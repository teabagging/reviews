I keep waiting for Burt Lancaster to show up somewhere; for Kirk Douglas to arrive on a chariot; for Charlton Heston with a Big Beard to trek down from the hills. I don't care if it's historically accurate - if only it would carry me away with the story it chooses to tell.

As far as the story line, where was the explanation for WHY Achilles is such a great warrior and can't be beat? A little detail about his HEEL (hello!) was left out of the story until the very end when he blatently sticks his heel out to take the arrow. It might as well have had a bullseye painted on it!

Achilles has new shades of humanity -- all of the Myrmidons (not to mention Briseis) benefit from this.

The fight scenes were played out horribly and the directing made the story move along at the pace of a snail, atleast until the end which they rushed entirely too fast. There were maybe two or three redeeming factors of this movie but I was so disappointed. Maybe its because I enjoyed Homer's Illiad, maybe its because I'm a history major. But I think it was because I perfer movies that have smooth dialogue, good acting, and over all a good production, which this one lacked.

If I had paid, I probably would've regretted it. The movie is completely average. Having seen the miniseries \\"Helen of Troy\\" (HOT) I was a bit disappointed in the movie. Both films take certain liberties with the story. HOT gave viewers more of a backstory and seemed to focus on the character development a lot more. The actors in HOT were all credible (Rufus Sewell made an excellent Agamemnon)-you knew in HOT what each of the characters' motivations and objectives are.In Troy, the characters seemed like cookie-cutter representations of accepted Hollywood movie epic stereotypes. In the beginning I was slightly confused about what was going on.The movie tends to get into the story much too early without explaining enough. You don't get that Helen and Paris (Orlando Bloom is almost laughable as Paris) love each other-their scenes together seemed painfully forced.It's not a throwaway movie, but it's not that special either."},{"rating":"1","title":"TROJAN MAN!!!","review":"When my Mom and I went to see this we kept cracking up, the movie was so boring we thought we could make it amusing. Alas, my Mom fell asleep and after about 10 minutes more I couldn't take it, we left the theatre. The only reason this movie gets another star is for Brad Pitt's tasty bod, other than that they shouldn't have used him because his acting was gay. In fact, all the acting was gay, and the cr_p they were trying pull off has been done and done better (Gladiator or Brave Heart anyone?). They tried to make an epic but in my opinion, it didn't work out. Maybe I'd feel differently if I'd seen the whole movie, but I doubt it.

The movie itself was awful and it did not resemble the book. It was a Gladiator wannabe with the Achilles character and music score. The movie just had the characters from the Illiad and that was it. The story changed so much it annoyed many people. It is best to read the book.Warner Bros. I heard was suppose to do Lord of the Rings but they wanted it to be one movie instead of the three that was put out. Troy in my opinion is an indication of what the studio did to ruin a story of a classic book. Lord of the Rings was saved from being butchered since Warner Bros. did not do the films.

There is no sense of this in the movie. We seem to get around the war in at best a few weeks.Second, where are the gods? The gods were a vital part of Homer's story, but for some reason the gods simply took a hiatus in this movie! First, I wonder whether a modern audience can understand and assimilate the intimate relationship between gods and men in Homer's classic. Perhaps it would have been impossible. Second, I wonder whether modern audiences could take the utter brutality of the Homerian account. I take it not from this movie, since it is certainly a sanatized version of Homer's epic poem.All in all, perhaps no sane person would actually screen the Iliad in a manner that is faithful to the original. But I wish someone had the guts to do so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why?","review":"Why would I want to see the director's cut to a movie that was, well, cliched and sweaty? I suppose so I could hear the director's commentary on how long Brad Pitt spent oiling up his arms so they could shine in every scene? Maybe so I can see the one character I thought three-dimensional die again. Or maybe it's so I can see the gag reel which probably features the actors laughing at their own dialogue. Either way, I'm not interested in the pre-production process that decided to dismiss the importance of the gods in this story, throw in contemporary dialogue, and (I thought this was impossible) parody ancient Greek art.

The director and the scriptwriter must be to blame for this. Even Peter O'Toole isn't as good as usual except when he's saying words from 'The Iliad'. Brad Pitt isn't a believable Achilles, and his having to act the hard man in a denim mini skirt and pink lipstick made me laugh out loud in places. The fight scenes, with the jumping or dancing about, soon lose their interest.They've done a character assassination of the demi God Achilles of the Iliad here.

But all of these are the exact opposite of what happens in the movie. The battle scenes are amazing I think but it just wasn't all true.

I only went because my two friends are obsessed with Orlando Bloom. One of the worst actors today. This movie just turned into another hollywood action cliche. The battle scenes, while at some points thrilling, mainly just fall flat. This movie is just a waste of time. I recommend maybe one viewing of it. Then go out and rent \\"Gladiator\\" and you'll see which one is better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I knew that this movie had removed itself from The Iliad, but that didn't bother me.What did bother me was how unappealing almost everything about this movie was.Achilles was a spoilt, egotistical, self-obsessed brat, Agamemnon a boorish braggart, as was his brother, Helen was just plain boring, Andromache looked like she'd just collapsed on the catwalk and was waiting to be force-fed, and Paris was a non-entity (I really don't think Orlando Bloom can act). The only appealing character was Hector.The large-scale battle scenes were okay, but I got sick of the pretty boy posturing and ludicrous balletic moves (of Achilles) in the showdown between Achilles and Hector.About half way throught he movie I started fast-forwarding, which I NEVER do. I just found it boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"wait for it in the clearance bin","review":"This was a horrible movie. Believe the reviewers on this site that have given it 1 or 2 stars. They are correct in their assessments. What a waste that tons of money was spent on terrible acting, directing, production, etc. etc. I laughed through most of it because of the riduculous characters and the stupid sound track. The female \\"wailing\\" voice was incredibly annoying...as was everything else in this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"A 3-Hour Bore","review":"OK - it was good to see cast members from Braveheart and Lord of the Rings again, Peter O'Toole and Nigel Terry were nice touches, and Brad Pitt had a few good athletic moves as Achilles - but this was NOT the epic movie that the studio and Wolfgang Peterson were hoping for. Had it not been for my husband being deaf in one ear and mistaking my request to leave for an inquiry if he was bored too, we would have walked out of the theatre. Even the young girls who (I'm quite certain) came to see Orlando Bloom were silent.I would recommend seeing Universal's Helen of Troy that was aired on cable over this version. It's available on DVD and tells a much richer, more satisfying version of the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Brad","review":"Brad will have to continue looking for a role that suits his talents to get him back on top again. He was not believable as Achilles. The screenwriter(s) took too much poetic license with the story, as was pointed out by my 16 year old son who actually read the Illiad and the Odyssey.Action scenes were hardly worthy of a Saturday afternoon made-for-TV movie.Even my wife, who loves Brad pitt (ala: Legends of the Fall), disliked him in this role."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Epic Cartoon","review":"This movie has nearly every gladiator-movie cliche incorporated into its lavish fabric, including the \\"beautiful woman gets her relatives slaughtered but then in 2 days becomes the lover of their murderer.\\" Apparently the money spent on the big name stars, special effects, and set left little or nothing for a script and story-line."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucks","review":"I dont know why but what i got its nothing like it was described by other customers i just got the regular one disc no special features no stended scenes...nothing, just the movie... im very dissapointed since the only reason why i bought this movie for my boyfriend in the first place was because the reviews said the movie had special features and unseen scenes.................makes me wonder who wrote the reviews if they were real customers or what."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly enjoyable but ...","review":"This movie was really enjoyable, with great performances by Brad Pitt and Eric Bana. Orlando Bloom, an actor i can't stand, really fits perfectly as the legend's wimp.Just one thing didn't click ... the love relationship between Helen and Paris was supposed to be something worth fighting for. However, in the movie it really doesn't look like it. The romance is as flat as can be. There was greater depth in Achilles' romance with Hector's cousin than with the romance which was supposed to be the fulcrum of the whole story.The end result is a very enjoyable epic with a sour taste that all the spectacular battle scenes didn't quite have a raison d'etre."},{"rating":"2","title":"HECTOR!","review":"this movie is awsome. one of brad pits best movies. its almost 3 hours long and there is no dull part.

Very Satisfied. Would definitely keep buying from Amazon. Great Service!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Brad Spitt is no Achilles","review":"Troy was a big disappointment; imagine what a real director like Peter Jackson would have made of it! Instead, we get a film that shows no respect for the story of the Trojan War; indeed, the script made so many unnecessary and unaccountable changes to the canonical story that I found myself seriously wondering if maybe the Trojans were going to win!!! The stark tragedy of the Iliad wasn't captured, and the climactic confrontation between Achilles and Priam was poorly done. They did have some really nice-looking reproductions of ancient jewelry, and the movie also puts the lie to any rumor that Brad is a real actor, but other than that..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Penny Arcade's Review was Right!","review":"All I have to say about this is penny-arcade.com's review of this movie was exactly right on. How much cooler would this film have been if the Hulk and Legolas had taken out all those Trojan and Greek dudes? A LOT COOLER!!!!!Not that it wasn't fine as is, it was enjoyable, but the Hulk (Eric Bana) and Legolas (Orlando Bloom) fighting off all those dudes as brothers would have rocked!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A \\"Gladiator\\" Rip-Off","review":"First of all, American actors suck! They are self-absorbed, immature and the current crop of male actors seem like eternal old teen-agers. The British are by far the best actors in all the world, with their intensity, maturity and strong personalities, but they couldn't save this movie.Brad Pitt was not believable to me. In each scene, he seemed to be preening and posing himself in the best light. With the long blond hair, he looked for all the world like a California surfer dude. With his current success, he seems not to be trying anymore to find the soul of the character as he did in \\"Legends of the Fall.\\"The battle scenes I liked except the director got in too close and it got claustrophobic. The battle scenes in \\"Gladiator\\" (which this movie emulates) were much better. I was not familiar with this story, but the script made it easy to follow, except there was just no soul in this movie and there was in \\"Gladiator.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah.....just...blah","review":"Well, I won't sit here and explain the story to you. By now you know of the \\"Face that launched a thousand ships.\\" But really, WHERE was the actual STORY of the Illiad or even TROY?All I remember about the movie is Achilles (spelling?) prancing around in his almost naked garb. He was so against fighting this war, but then his cousin gets killed, and it's now an all-out battlefield, but remains finding a glorious death? Hmmmm...A little strange. I don't think that Homer would be too happy with this depiction of his incredible masterpiece.This movie was WAY too long for it juvenile plot. I was expecting to see a beautifully crafted materpiece, epic, and adventure. But all I got was horrible dialogue and pretty faces. Now, I don't mind the pretty faces, but I'd rather not have high expectations and with $7.50 out of my pocket."},{"rating":"1","title":"The only good scene in this movie","review":"I think we'd all be lying, even the staunchest critics, if we said we weren't giddy during the Trojan horse sequence. The takeover of Troy was exciting, and Odysseus came off like a cool guy, and then it toppled downhill when Achilles jumped out of the horse. Ummm...Achilles was dead by then, well, at least according to this book called \\"The Illiad.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie making by numbers","review":"OK. What do we have here? Big budget, A-list actors, cast of thousands, epic story. So far so good. But hold on what else do we have? A German director who peaked with Das Boot and then went on to make stilted, dull Hollywood movies. And that's the problem with the film. The actors needed better direction, someone who could breathe life into the epic themes, someone who could create tension within the dramatic action without relying on special effects or the spilling of blood. Unfortunately, this didn't happen here, and I became progressively more and more bored as time passed because the acting was so wooden, the lines so hackneyed, and the movie so predictable in its manipulation of the narrative and audience: cue cute baby with over sized head; cue frantic woman screaming; cue bloody fight sequence; cue sacking of ancient city. Not a movie I'd watch again; rather, a movie I rue seeing even once. Let's just hope there's no Troy 2!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Get it in Widescreen","review":"I love these big Hollywood movies with larger than life heroes. Of course, Homer's heroes are the basis for the archetypes we enjoy in modern day cinema whether it be a Sergio leone movie, a Civil War epic or Die Hard III.Brad Pitt and Eric Bana assume their respective roles of Achilles and Hector admirably and it doesn't hurt that they are grand physical specimens.There is much more to enjoy in this exciting movie. See it."},{"rating":"2","title":"It definitely brings the movie up","review":"While this movie was not on par with the likes of Braveheart and Gladiator, this was still a decent film and the transfer to Blu-ray only helps it out.

I am indeed impressed with the quality of this transfer"},{"rating":"1","title":"Huh???","review":"First of all i'm not a kid i'm actually 17 but i didn't want to register. Now to the point, this movie sucked. They totally killed the illiad, first of all they should have called this movie achilles thats the only what they focus on. Ohh yeah and the damn greeks look like friggin asians with oddly shaped shields. What happened to the famous greek phalanx? The greeks in this movie were just an unorganized mob. Another thing, AGAMEMNON IS NOT SUPOSED TO DIE!!!!!!!!! What the hell!! Also the siege of troy lasted 10 years this lasted like 3 days. And another thing they left out the gods, the gods played a huge role in the iliad. Lets see what did i forget oh yeh western Turkey isn't a friggin desert.Troy was by a river not in the middle of a desert. Im sure if i sat here i could destroy this movie more but, i think you get the point. Don't buy this movie. If you must see it rent it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can see why certain things were cut.","review":"I wish they would've had this to rent. The comments on here convinced me to buy it, that it was worth it. You guys praised the way the extra scenes \\"fleshed out the characters and story.\\" However, what you guys failed to mention was that the additional flesh wasn't all new scenes. There was more nudity in this extended version than I was comfortable with. Now I'm torn between recouping some of my losses by selling my copy of this product to a pawn shop, or throwing it in the trash. The latter would be the more ethical choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"worse than pittiful king arthour","review":"Brad Pitt and Olando Bloom are acting way too modern in this film, especailly Brad Pitt, I would admire the way he fight in the film but things he said and that manner is simply too unrealistic in an ancient sense, i found myself hardly believe they r from \\"the past\\" and that destroy everything to be expecting later. My only applause is on Eric Banna he delivered a believable character. Olando's role would somewhat reminds u his role in LOTR, a kid that good with bow, but the way the story let him kill Brad at the end is so cheesy, which doesnt draw out any emotional moment whatsoever, it makes a weak ending but nothing more. Poor effort for peter wolfstang, as his neverending story is still on today one of my best movie of all time, and the war scene... weak if you r comparing it to Ridley Scott's stuffs like \\"black hawk down\\" or mel gibson's \\"brave heart\\" or ridley's new \\"kingdom of the heaven\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still no Blu-ray!","review":"I placed the order for the Blu-ray on Friday. Today is Tuesday and the movie still has not shipped. Talk about indifference..."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie sucks!!!","review":"This is the most disappointing film I've ever seen this year! Brad Pitt was completely wrong for the role of Achilles. I laughed whenever Orlando Bloom is on a scene (and this is not a comedy); he has exactly ONE facial expression throughout the film, that of perpetual surprise. It's a good thing that Peter O'Toole and Sean Bean were in the movie, they redeemed it somehow in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"TROY","review":"Originally we were sent the wrong movie but told we could keep \\"300\\" and they would reorder and send us the right one. This took several days to clear up the situation and my husband was not very pleased in the length of time it took to get his birthday present. Though I appreciated their gesture of keeping the first dvd, we did not enujoy it and ultimately gave it away while waiting for Troy. I would question doing business with them honestly."},{"rating":"1","title":"good example of Sturgeon's Law","review":"Somebody once leveled the following criticism of science fiction against sci-fi author Theodore Sturgeon: \\"ninety percent of everything written in sci-fi is crud.\\" To which Sturgeon supposedly replied, \\"But ninety percent of EVERYTHING is crud!\\"The remark took on a life of its own, and now even has it's own Wikipedia page as \\"Sturgeon's Law.\\"Anyhow, Brad Pitt's \\"Troy\\" is an good example of it.About 10% is fantastic and really worth seeing, especially if you're reading the Iliad and would just like to get some good visuals:1. Achilles killing the Thessalian hero at the beginning.2. All the ships sailing upon Troy.3. The actual sack of Troy.But the other 90%? Crud."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eye candy for the ladies","review":"The plot is weak - but it looks good. Gone is the high drama of the Iliad with it's contest of wills between the Greeks and the Gods, all of whom indulge their petty human (and intriguing) emotions. This movie seems designed for one thing - to show off Brad Pitt as a sex symbol. Brad Pitt's Achilles is dark, and even bloodthirsty at times, but not as manly as Russell Crowe's Maximus. Manliness is sorely needed in this film (Bana, Pitt, and Bloom together don't pump as much testosterone as Mel Gibson in Braveheart). Brian Cox as Agememnon and Peter O'Toole as Priam are the only acting performances of note. Diane Kruger's Helen is mute and passionless - and she's the reason for all the to-do? But the musical score is very good - especially for the climactic fight between Pitt and Bana- and the scenery is magnificent. Rent it - one watching will be enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait for the DVD...","review":"so you may fast forward through the slow parts. The battle scenes are good, not great after LOTR set the standard. Many slow scenes with repetitive dialogue about the meaning of war, what is killing good for, etc. There are gratuitous scenes of Brad Pitt's physique for those who would get a thrill out of it.There is very little historical accuracy, realizing it would take a 22 hour movie to try and get it right. You would hope they would at least try some of the easy historical depictions...like it took 9 years to get to the Trojan Horse, Ajax commits suicide after Achilles death, Achilles sends Patroclus to fight for him, not the way depicted, but directorial laziness prevented any of historically similar scenes from being attempted."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Epic Adventure","review":"An epic masterpiece, Troy illustrates Homer's Illiad with huge battles, romantic side stories, and a pinch of humor in this dark tale. Special effects and chorography give the battles on the beaches of Troy a realistic feeling. The actors really show the pain they endure during the Trojan War, and the reviewer connects with each. Although the Trojans have taken Helen of Sparta, there really is no evil side in this war, just evil people. Eric Bana and Brad Pitt really portray their characters well, and Diane Kruger and Orlando Bloom show their excellent acting skills, although they are not the center of the movie. Troy can be compared to something as great as Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings, however Troy is much more condensed. This incredible film is worthy of any viewer's five star award."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great improvement","review":"I'll make this quick...Picture is awesome in HDAudio is awesome.so the a/v experience is everything you should expect from a good Blu-Ray title. Not the best disc ever, but never a let down for HD.The movie is really fantastic. The extra 30 minutes turned this movie from a fun wanna-be epic into a a movie I REALLY like. I liken the transition from Two Towers to Two Towers extended edition. Now, this isn't as good as Two Towers, but the level of improvement is about the same. If you even mildly liked the original TROY, buy this much improved version. You will not regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engaging, entertaining, worth seeing","review":"If you're looking for a movie true to Homer's work, this isn't quite it. All they say is it was \\"inspired by\\" anyway, never claimed to be a screen version of the Illiad.If however, you're just looking to be entertained by a well acted, beautifully shot epic movie, I thought this was very good. I watch movies while I work out and judge them on how well they hold my interest and make the workout go quickly. This was a 5-star on that.Acting was great. Several memorable lines in a generally good script. Acting was convincing.I highly recommend it if you like the genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reading Made Easy","review":"This book is obviously for children just learning how to read. This would be a good book for beginners because they use simple words all through out the book and they use them over and over again. This is not a book made to have a plot.

This was my favorite book as a kid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pop got Hopped","review":"As one of the first books I ever read, it is great to see that this book is as timeless as when I was young. My three kids (who all call me Pop)-as well as two others who are staying with us-have all enjoyed this wonderful book. They all have been read this book many times. Each has struggled through reading it to me when they learned to read.Dr. Seuss' creativity shines in the playful book. It is very help in teaching rhyming and is a great candidate for a first reader-as there are very few words while the story still engages the child. This book created a family tradition as the kids have hopped on \\"Pop\\" on many times!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My toddler loved this book, and learned the bold words","review":"This is an extremely simple book, but it still exhibits the full genius of Dr. Suess with how well it connects with preschoolers.I used this book as part of a stack of books that I started reading to my kid when he was an infant. (Reading is good for kids, so why not start early) Somehow, as an early two-year-old, he had managed to memorize some of the words. He would say the largest, bold word as I turned the page. This was the first book that he could do that memory trick. So, there is something very special about this particular book.So, if you want to get your kid interested in reading, this provided very good early start, at least for my kid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rhyming Time with a Storyline","review":"Rhyming words galore, funny story bits and illustrations abound in \\"Hop on Pop\\".

They love the pictures and the sound of the words. They look and listen with rapturous interest, and often scream like banshees at the end until I read the book a second time.The book is fun for parents, too. It's a disconnected, almost surreal series of vignettes. The ever-popular segment featuring the flying Mr. Brown is longer than most, and the recurring character of Pup provides a hint of continuity. Not that kids will care about any of this; it's just a fun ride with the inimitable Dr. Seuss.Suggested follow-up: \\"Ten Apples Up On Top\\" (again by Dr. S), which is our girls' second-favorite book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A real disappointment for any Suess fan","review":"This is a terrible rewrite of Hop On Pop, one of Dr. Suess' great books.

As Jones stated in his book, Swing The Clubhead, \\"Your hands are everything in this business of playing good golf easily.\\" Mr. De La Torre cannot be teaching students to swing the clubhead with \\"the arms on the downswing,\\" and, at the same time, claiming to be a disciple of Jones, who I am sure is turning over in his grave! This thought only adds complexity to learning the correct swing. Any golfer, who really wants to learn the simplified method of Ernest Jones, should track down PGA teaching professional, Arnie Frankel, in Hobe Sound, Fl. He is a \\"true\\" disciple of Ernest Jones!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I thought","review":"I was expecting a fundamental approach to golf, not here. I did not find any practical knowledge to apply to my own game. If you looking for a story buy this book, if your looking for help with your game......buy hogan......"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sound instructiion","review":"This book is geared to the basics - a real find in these days of gimmics and fads in golf instruction. Sound simple swing techniques. This book works if you practice properly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass on this, there are many better books out there","review":"Having read two dozen or more instructional golf swing books, I would have to say this was the least helpful.Not mechanically specific, and not applicable to day to day practice. I would encourage potential buyers to pass and try others.For conventional swing technique try Swing Like a Pro by Ralph Mann & Fred Griffin (excellent illustrations) .For an easier but unconventional teaching, The Secret of the Golf Swing by John Dunigan. IMHO this is the best book on the golf swing out there. (plus the Pelz book for short game)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Follow this advice and increase your handicap!","review":"This is the first negative review I have written on Amazon, but I couldn't help it. This book is full of worthless drivel. There is nothing in this book that has any sound basis in science or physics. Just a bunch of one-liners such as swing the entire club or picture the shot. How many times can that stuff be written? Follow this book and waste alot of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bad back golf","review":"Manuel presents a simpler swing which I was looking for to help my bad back. Gives practical advice and help for the entire game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Really Ernest","review":"Mr. De La Torre claims to teach the Ernest Jones method (which produced numerous national champions on both sides of the Atlantic) but then pollutes the Jones method by taking the hands out of the downswing. After unsuccesfully trying Manuel's method for a while, I happened upon Arnie Frankel's Golf's One Motion video. It is a much more straight forward presentation of the Jones method. Understanding the Golf Swing misses the mark."},{"rating":"2","title":"former student krieg youngs","review":"Manuel has done an excellent job of analyzing the golf swing in the most clear and concise terms. I took lessons from Manuel many years ago and everything that he taught me and many more items are in this remarkable book. From the opening remarks by Carol Mann to the final chapters on Manuel and his father leaving Spain make this the best book I have ever seen on golf. I too remember the tree lined path and the putting green that Carol Mann described. It brought back a lot of very fond memories. Good job Manuel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spend your money elsewhere","review":"After reading the rave on-line reviews about this book I finally bought it and read it cover to cover. I'm now convinced that all the other reviews were written by employees of the publisher or members of the author's family. There is nothing new here, but unlike the thousands of other similarly mediocre golf books this one includes few diagrams or photos to illustrate the swing mechanics or other difficult concepts. Most of the book is a set of bullet lists containing all the trite dogmatic views you might hear from the high-handicappers on your local municipal course. Save your money and buy Hogan's \\"Five Lessons\\" or Peltz's \\"Short-game Bible\\", they will help you infinitely more than this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"There is only one Ernest Jones Method","review":"Mr. De La Torre claims to be a proponent of the Ernest Jones method. Any resemblance between what Mr. De La Torre has written and the \\"true\\" Ernest Jones method are accidental at best. In fact he contradicts Mr. Jones teachings on several occassions.If you are expecting to find the wisdom of Ernest Jones here you will be rather dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"missed some greens because I hit the ball too far","review":"great book. boils the swing into an easy-to-understand approach that's also easy to perform. after reading book a few days ago, I hit the ball more solidly (farther) than I ever have. will have to reasses how far I hit each club, but that's a good problem to have. highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"UNDERSTANDING THE GOLF SWING","review":"THIS IS THE FINEST GOLF INSTRUCTION BOOK EVER.

Why buy this when you can buy the entire first season for about the same price? Don't get me wrong, as a \\"movie\\" it does work and is actually one of the best and most sympathetic versions of the Superman story covering Superman's arrival, a glimpse into his teenage years, and ending with his introduction to Metropolis. Of course, I bought it to \\"complete\\" my Superman collection which includes all Superman movies and TV series. But, if you have the Animated Series, you already have this."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Have a Dream","review":"I introduced this book to my fourth graders before Martin Luther King, Jr. Day. The pictures served as a dramatic representation of what Dr. King wanted. My students were inspired by the art work displayed in the book.

I appreciated having his speech in its entirety and not just the snippets we usually hear."},{"rating":"1","title":"I have a dream too","review":"That one day 4 year olds will be able to actually read this book.This book is not meant for kids aged 4-8. It is well beyond what they understand. Frankly , i don't even think a 4 year old can even read this. Nice pictures. But unfortunately , i don't enjoy buying a book for pictures. I can get pictures anywhere. I didn't need to purchase this book to get them. Anyway , don't buy this book unless you enjoy paying a high price for pictures. With regards to the age group. Unless you have a gifted 4 year old this book is a waste of time for him/her."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent book that illustrates MLK's best known speech","review":"This book is a beautiful piece of literature. It is pictorial representation of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s famous \\"I Have a Dream\\" speech. All of the illustrators are winners of the Coretta Scott King Award for illustration. It is a great teaching tool for elementary children to be introduced to MLK and civil rights.

Lots of distortion during loud sections of Symphony 4. If you are looking for this music in MP3 format, look elsewhere. Buyer beware!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"After weeks of rocking out to 100 Broken Windows, I found myself at Best Buy and came across The Remote Part. I figured it was a gimme purchase, since the previous album was so phenomenal and such a clear demonstration of tremendous talent. Well, I got hosed. The Remote Part is so depressingly average, so obvious, so, ultimately, boring. Where 100 Broken Windows had incredible life and energy, Remote Part has tired ideas and uninspired execution. None of the passion of 100 Broken Windows is to be found anywhere on this album. As other reviewers have mentioned, it appears that Idlewild have indeed attempted to go mainstream, and have thus dumbed down both their music and lyrics in an attempt to be the next, I don't know, Coldplay or something. And judging by the 4.5 star rating this album is currently receiving, maybe they've succeeded. But for anyone who's heard 100 Broken Windows, The Remote Part can only be considered a failure. And a shame."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fine Piece Of Work","review":"I really enjoyed listening to this album, it's got everything. light tracks and heavier tracks. This is my first Idlewild album and probably don't know as much about them as you other people, but having this Idlewild album in my CD rack feels good!This is how i rated each song:1. You held the world in ur arms - first single - 5/52. A modern way of letting go - 4/53. American English - second single - 4/54. I never wanted - 5/55. I am what I am not - 4/56. Live in a hiding place - 3/57. Out of Routine - 5/58. Century after century - 2/5 (i suppose i'm being generous, worst track)9. Tell me ten words - 4/510. Stay the same - 5/511. In remote part / scotish fiction - 2/5 (it is a nice last song but isn't really my thing, better than #8 though.To be honest, if there was just another 1 or 2 more tracks on the album I probably would of gave this album 5 stars.Nevermind, I love the album and will probably stay in my CD player for a while!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"This is a mixture of trying to incoporate the Smashing Pumpkins into one song, and a bunch of other bands in the others. Achieving a sound of being entirely uninspiring, predictable, boring to say the least, and lacking any kind of distinction. They have the talent to create something, but they're sort of just sitting around trying to sound like all their favourite influences. That's fine if you're sincere, but the question here is are they or as someone said, do they just want to be featured on the O.C's soundtrack."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've heard it all before.","review":"Ugh! I'm listening to this album again haveing forgot about it since Christmas (it was a present). Ugh. This is easy listening and ear friendly, but whiny and repetitive. They mix it up, but all the songs have two things in common: 1. sounds like its been done before (greenday,rem,smashing pumpkins, etc...)and 2. its booooooorrrriiinnnnnnnggggg.In a weird way, they sound way more American then would be expected. Upon listenining again, I find myself wondering why my friend's band dosn't have a deal yet, if this kind of drivvle is on Capitol.Actually, if any members of Idlewild are reading this, sorry about the harsh, nonconstructive criticism. As a consumer, I don't have the time to listen to all the lyrics and really give this album a good listen. Maybe if there was a little more soul in the music I'd make the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Buy For Any Alt. Rock Fan","review":"This CD is an incredible follow up 1000 Broken Windows. It is much more melodic, and the way they mix trumptes and violins with hard rock is awesome. This is a musical masterpiece, the sound is totally unconventional and it feels like all of the band members put their heart into it. I won't tell you about any of their songs because they're all good. This band really makes hard rock poetic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grown as band while retaining punk sound","review":"Idlewild's 2nd and 3rd albums show real growth from their first punk-laden debut album Hope Is Important. Starting with 100 Broken Windows and continuing on to Remote Part, Idlewild is one of the new and emerging bands from Scotland who have shown that they have grown as a band and as songwriters while still retaining their punk sound. The songs on both albums are more tightly polished and scaled back than the Hope Is Important album. The two albums contain a wide range of music from the traditional three-chord ripping punk anthems that first got them noticed to nice quiet acoustic ballads. Standout tracks on 100 Broken Windows are \\"Little Discourage,\\" \\"I Don't Have the Map\\" and \\"Roseability\\" and on the Remote Part, \\"American English,\\" \\"You Held the World in Your Arms,\\" and \\"Live in a Hiding Place.\\" I am really looking forward to hearing what these four young Scots will come up with next."},{"rating":"1","title":"good album, but.....","review":"Capital is a bunch of money grubbers who copy protect so that I can't play this on any of my computers or old CD player.

I'm frankly disgusted and will be avoiding purchases from the Capital label!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My first Paladins CD","review":"I first heard the single \\"Follow Your Heart\\" in the summer of 1990. The local alternative station started playing the single on heavy rotation. I constantly left the radio on in hopes the DJ would play the song. I couldn't get enough. I never did catch the name of the band though. Three years later, it came to me in an epiphany. I bought the disc have fallen in love with the Paladins ever since. Ironically, the song I liked so much in the Summer of '90 is so atypical of their rock-a-billy forte. Instead of never listening to the disc again, it was like I was famished for more.

The dusting attachment is worth the price of the entire unit. I could never clean my blinds well, with eithier a wet cloth or a swiffer duster. This attachment cleaned them beautifully in a manner of minutes, great on keyboards also. The mattress attachment is great as well. I can clean an entire bedroom quickly, and have it really clean, using only this dyson. The wand is a little awkward as first, but lopsens up.

This old, deep culture is rooted in high desert austerity. It is a rural life of sparseness. Beauty is found in family life and small traditions. All who read this charming story will be enriched. To see the simple \\"paper bags with candles\\" lining roads and driveways on Christmas Eve is to be transported. This story is perfect for the holidays."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Path of Lighted Candles","review":"This book is about a family who at Christmas time would light candles along the pathway for the singers to stop at their house and sing to them. But this year, Abuelo wasn't feeling good so the granddaughter invented a new version of the luminarias. She put little candles in paper bags and placed them along the walkway. They got a surprise that night as well, for their papa came home from the war. This is a very touching story about a family that wanted to keep a tradition and the love that keeps them going throughout the year. The pictures are very lifelike and show the emotions of each of the characters. This story helps the reader read about a tradition that some families follow each year for Christmas. One thing that I really liked is at the back of the book; there are translations from Spanish to English for words throughout the book for young readers to be able to know what the words mean."},{"rating":"2","title":":) :)","review":"I have had this CD since I was 15... 8 long years..

There's a lot of different definitions in the HF industry on what long/short equity really means. Nicholas won't tell you what other authorities think. So this is a book with a very narrow focus, but even in this area it fails to clearly identify the risks of these equity hedge funds. You have to keep in mind that this guy is a promoter of the HF industry, so he's not an unbiased analyst of what hedge funds can do and cannot do.

Along with \\"It's A Gift\\", \\"The Bank Dick\\" remains Fields's most sustained piece of hilarity. A brisk outing at just over 70 minutes, the film strikes an ideal balance between plot intrigue and broad action, as Egbert foils bank robbers, invests in a beefsteak mine, and save his prospective son-in-law's job. The immortal Franklin Pangborn is superb as a bank examiner victimized by Souse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is that thing loaded???","review":"Sure, its one of The Great Man's best movies, but wher are the Paramount classics, Man On The Flying Trapeze and The Old Fashioned Way??These two Fields movies sum up his character better than any of 'em!"},{"rating":"2","title":"fields at his best","review":"this is fields in top form! this is one of his best offerings of the movies he made. well written by fields,(under the name,mahatma kane jeeves)and performed as only he can do.this one is a must for any wc fields, or classic comedy fan"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely hilarious.","review":"Not only does this film feature a truly clever car chase, it is probably the first of its kind to deal with the subject of \\"boondoggling.\\" Secondary characters like Mackley Q.

A must have for all classic comedy fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Fields you can get","review":"I've always been a big fan of W.C. Fields and I've always been disappointed in the quality (and quantity) of his work that is available. With the 6 short films, Criterion is doing a great job of preserving W.C. Fields for future generations.I wouldn't argue that some of his other films (such as \\"Never give a sucker...\\") are better than \\"The Bank Dick\\", but they're not available on DVD (let alone after being restored as this film has been).I won't rehash the plot, except to say that the notion of a petty criminal always keeping one step ahead from being found out is continually repeated and nobody did it better than Fields. A big part of the enjoyment of watching Field's movies is to find out how he lands on his feet. Field's survives in his world like a cat; with grace and only barely acknowledging what has been going on around him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfunny and overrated","review":"The Bottom Line:I walked into The Bank Dick knowing little about W.C. Fields and walked out very unimpressed by his style of comedy: the film wanders freely from one boring setup to another, never finding much comic material or presenting any sort of clothesline to string gags on, leaving the audience with little to do but listen to lines that might be funny if written but sure aren't when Fields mutters them droningly.2/4"},{"rating":"1","title":"What Did I Miss","review":"I am wondering about myself.

The so-called plot is feeble, dated and disjointed.After what seemed an endless period of time, I found that only 45 minutes had gone by.I love old movies, but I cannot understand why anyone would call this one of the funniest ever.

The title track was a smash hit at the time and was even featured in a Chrysler TV commercial during the 1965 World Series. And it has sold well ever since.While the funky title track is highly enjoyable, the other 4 tunes and alternate take of \\"Totem Pole\\" are equally outstanding and full of the blues. In fact, \\"Totem Pole\\" is probably the most sophisticated and interesting tune and \\"Gary's Notebook\\" is also quite inventive. \\"Boy, What a Night\\" cranks up the heat for a waltz and \\"Hocus-Pocus\\" closes the album in a relaxed mood.Morgan is outstanding on trumpet throughout and Joe Henderson is just as good on tenor sax. The sound of the RVG remastering is very clear with plenty of bass and cymbals so that you can hear all the music behind the soloists."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Non Philly Joe Jones Album Ever!!!!","review":"I'm a fan of Philly Joe Jones and usually snarl at albums that don't have Philly. If I like an album that doesn't have him, you know it's really good. Sidwinder is the best, but I wish Higgins would stick to the first snare drum pattern that he introduces during the melody. Totem Pole is my favorite, and so is Hocas Pocas. I wish Billy got more spots to solo, other than on the last track on the origanal album. I think it's Boy What A Night, which is the only 4/4 piece on the whole album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grab It","review":"Lee Morgan is the most underestimated trumpet player in Jazz history.

It's nice to hear Lee Morgan sound so playful, kinda like Brownie. And especially interesting to hear a young Joe Henderson in this context. IMHO, if the rhythm section played just a little less generically, this would be a 5 star session. This RVG edition has excellent sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"its a mess and noise","review":"I'm a fun of jazz and I have decent equipment to play it on but I've never waded through this CD to the end. I just couldn't stand the quality of sound. Cymbals are terrible (bleeding ears)and instruments are imbalanced. Please compare some older Davis recordings from Columbia or Bill Evans from Riverside where percussion is much more subtle and refined. I asked my friend, audiophile for judgement. He said \\"its a mess and noise\\". Despite significant upgrades and refinements in my stereo the CD didn't survive in my collectom. I'd say the same about some other RvG Editins (e.g. Cool Struttin' or Blowin' Session). The music itself is not bad, quite energetic but it can't make you tired. Fatigue factor is very, very high in this case."},{"rating":"2","title":"One terrific track after another","review":"Lee Morgan and the rest of the players on this album put on a fabulous display, proving why they all should be more recognized in the mainstream jazz market.

I always loved Discworld- I read and re-read every book up to Fifth Elephant with gusto, and I loved them like no other books in the world. But when I read Fifth Elephant, I found something had changed. There is just no life to this book. It wasn't remotely funny, the plot was confusing and unexciting... I don't know why, but I just didn't enjoy reading this one. I got bored with it after the first few pages, and it was a chore to read the rest. It was awful for me; like having a good friend suddenly turn on me. Every book following Fifth Elephant has, in my opinion, only gone downhill. It's not that Pratchett has run out of ideas, but that he seems to have lost his enthusiasm. It's horribly depressing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Abridged audioCD was unacceptable","review":"In this abridged audio version, the story line became disjointed. The clues tocharacters and plot, and the setup for sudden puns and allusions that make Terry Pratchett booksastonishing were wiped out of context.

Trouble in the Uberwald sends Vimes, Cherry and Detritus to the coronation of the new Dwarf King. Meanwhile Carrot and Agnes are having some problems, which leaves Sergeant Colon next in line for promotion to head of the watch....This is a great story, full of humor, politics and plot twists. So easy to read I picked up the book and I read it without putting it down. It has more of a political tone compared with the watches last outing (Jingo), which was more of an adventure. The fifth elephant expands the disk word by padding out the dwarfs and giving incite to the Uberwald (expect more books from the Uberwald)It's a good book if your just coming into the disk world books and a Great book if your following the disk world seriescont...

It's so tongue-in-cheek that I spent the first 2/3 of the book trying to dig past that part to get to the actual story. Once you get the story figured out and get a sense of at least a couple of the main characters (there were tier-2 characters who I still had no clue who they were at the end of the book), it's ok. But it's just way too 'out there' for me. My first and probably last experience with this author. If you like stuff like the Hitchhiker's Guide then you'll probably like this, but it's just not my thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another wonderful book","review":"Every book Terry Pratchett writes is wonderful and engaging, and The Fifth Elephant is no exception. I enjoyed it thoroughly, and as soon as I turned the last page (figuratively), I wanted to buy another Discworld Novel and carry on reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Fifth Elephant- A Return to 'Normality'","review":"After a few books I simply found too philosophical and/or topical Terry Pratchett returns to a form we haven't seen since Maskerade et al. Weaving in many new characters and developing old ones we are brought into an enthralling tale, complete, but not swamped by, Pratchett's links with reality, similar to the way he did in Soul Music. Everyone's favpurote character, Sam Vimes, is the key to this story, and it isn't simply set in the brilliant but increasingly cramped (inspiringly) Ankh-Morpork. It is witty as well as having a good plot and the only disadvantage is that the American cover, although eye-catching is simply not half as good as the British edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fairly Fantastic Tongue-in-cheek Fantasy","review":"Quite enjoyable fantasy set in an imainary world resembling 17th - 18th century Europe. Peopled with humans, gnomes, dwarfs (dwarves?), trolls, werewolves, and vampires as distinct races of peoples. It really is a lampoon of many institutions including government, religion, business, and technology. Noticeable absent are vulgar or profane words.The one negative is the fairly frequent occurrence of typographical errors such as misplaced quotation marks, substitution of 'an for 'as', 'than' for 'that' or missing letters such as 'heat' being spelled 'eat', which require the reader to reread the sentence a time or two to comprehend the meaning.There are no elephants whatsoever int he story except the mythical elephants supporting the flat earth and a statue commemorating the missing fifth elephant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not my favourite but....","review":"I have to be honest and say that this is not my favourite of the night watch series of the Discworld books. Having said that it is still a good read I would however recommend that it is best to have read some of the earlier books to fully appreciate all the nuances of this one. Terry Pratchett manages to make his characters mature as he writes about them and although I am sad to see less of the early Carrot in this book I enjoyed seeing how Vimes developed (having said that I feel that Colon and Nobby are still very close in character to their first appearances. All in all an enjoyable book and I just hope the next one which Pratchett has now completed is up to this standard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny, as usual","review":"Terry Pratchett has done it again - as expected. His tour-de-force performances with practically every volume of his Discworld series has become the defacto standard that he has set for himself.Once again, Sam Vines, Commander of the City Watch of the magnificently squalid city of Ankh-Morpork, finds himself in an awkwardly uncomfortable situation. Once again, Sam Vines, Commander of the City Watch of Lord Vetinari's personal chessboard, manages to overcome all odds and finesse his way out of a mess. In the course of all this, there is the whole gamut of humor, ranging from amused smiles, past sudden, surprised guffaws, to helpless outbursts of uncontrolled laughter. Mr. Pratchett has managed to do it again.What can I say? Nobody does the satirical fantasy humor genre nearly as well as Terry Pratchett.

More than a portrait of LBJ, the book is an artful depiction of the lure of politics and its terrible cost on those who pursue it.

As a stand-alone episode, it's an inch short of absurd. I realize this is the type of book you're supposed to turn off your brain with and just enjoy the ride, but it was too poorly written and ridiculous for me to do so.It probably goes without saying that the \\"plot\\" is filler to pad between car chases, gun fights, and tawdry sex scenes.

Twitchell seems to think that his audience is (like a commerical audience?) satisfied by brief, unreferenced anecdotes as evidence of a dynamic, give and take between advertisers and their audience. While seeming lofty (and at times arrogant), Twitchell fails to back up his claims that media culture is, indeed, akin to art and religion, and responds to, rather than preempts and sets, cultural trends.

Not this book. This book is like an overly simple version of those. This book should be called \\"an addition\\" to Dr. Sarno's books. Personally, if this were the first TMS book I had read I would have not taken the TMS concept seriously at all.BUT, my biggest problem with this book is the random suicide story. How was that necessary? That was a giant pointless chunk of negativity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vile Smell - Very Little Pumic","review":"I just bought this today b/c I was out of a pumic foot scrub I love that I bought abroad and figured \\"how much can can this kind of thing differ?\\"A lot. OMG - the smell is vile - when was the last time anyone served you Plum/Peppermint tea? Never! For a reason!But more importantly, there was very little grit in this \\"pumic\\" scrub - nothing abrasive enough to scrape off anything. Total waste of money. Will return if I have the time, though unlikely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shakers Lost Me","review":"Friends who are teachers recommended Downing's book as an entertaining picture of campus politics. That part was entertaining, as was the punctuation and grammar lesson at the end of each chapter. The whole story of Celia and the Shakers was needlessly confusing and not very interesting. And what's with this affectation of not using paragraph breaks? The author didn't present that grammar lesson but needed to."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fine addition to literary fiction collections","review":"There is serenity in order, but when that order is violated, one's life can fall apart. \\"Perfect Agreement\\" tells the story of Mark Sternum, a man with an idealistic life. Accused of racism, he loses his job as a college professor and soon finds the course of life he was planning to be impossible. What follows is something that will change his life, but not everything is bad. \\"Perfect Agreement\\" is a top notch read that is a fine addition to literary fiction collections."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great PWC product","review":"Works great.

After reading it from cover to cover multiple times, I found myself loving pornography even more. My addiction became worse and now, I feel as if I am on the downward spiral to other, much worse things. Skip the book and instead, go to an adult book store and buy as much as you can. Trying to get bored of pornos is better than trying to wean yourself from it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true adventure","review":"How engaging a mystery. It has the details of a true story with the excitement, multiple plots and mystery of a great novel in a small and fast moving book. Loved it and recommend as great reading for teen girls interested in travel and adventures of an honest and noble young heroin.The Spy Wore Silk"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best option, really the only option needed","review":"With all the products to choose from, this one ends the search for a fix to all symptoms. Taking other products in the past, I was glad to stop headaches and cramps, etc., but this product also stops irritability. Take 2 tablets every 6 hours with water."},{"rating":"2","title":"ART BLAKEY BEST RECORD","review":"This is Blakey's best Record. Try it. Bobby Timmons, Lee Morgan, Benny Golson formed the Messengers's best line up. I do not have words. Go and get the record, then we will talk."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for any fan of 50's & 60's jazz","review":"Blakey is one of my favorite bandleaders and drummers. I am a huge fan of the Wayne Shorter era recordings, but this one is just awesome. Good variety on the record, some funky tunes, and some more traditional jazz tunes. I never heard the original, I have the remaster and it sounds wonderful. The RVG reissues do the music justice."},{"rating":"2","title":"a classic w/more cuts","review":"I've have this for 5 years. On this CD, additional tracks have been added. Recently this was noted as jazz cd of the year. For historians of the art, or newcomers to jazz , get this, educate yourself, and groove. There is a lot to dig in these jams."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't Get Me","review":"I had no nack for this album. Drum Thunder is not great. The only good tracks are Monin' and Blues March. I'll listen to it closly again though."},{"rating":"2","title":"the essence of hard bop jazz","review":"This is simply a fantastic CD. One of the hard bop classics. Pure soul. Sound is great too! All the tracks are just amazing - the playing is simply sublime. Can't lose with this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"No moanin' here, just pure ecstasy","review":"This is one of Art Blakey's best albums, recorded in 1958. Lee Morgan is on trumpet, Benny Golson on tenor, Bobby Timmons on piano, Jymie Merritt on bass, with Blakey on drums. Benny Golson also contributed some of the tunes: \\"Blues March\\" is a jazz masterpiece and the slow \\"Along Came Betty\\" is almost as good. Everything clicks on this session, and it should be on anyone's list of the top 20 albums of the hard bop era. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jazz at its best","review":"Art Blakey is one of the biggest names in 20th century jazz history and Moanin' is one of his highest regarded songs, making it into a jazz standard. This album has some great jazz songs and two very famous versions of Blakey's most popular standard. The mastering is alright, but sounds great and is a must own for any jazz enthusiast. Even casual fans of jazz will love this album since it contains some of the best songs of the entire genre. Moanin' defines jazz and shows this performer at his finest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Art Blakey - The King Of Hard-bop","review":"\\"Moanin\\" was released by Blue Note Records in 1958 and features one of the best Jazz Messengers line-up jazz has ever witnessed: Benny Golson on tenor saxophone, Lee Morgan on trumpet, and Jymie Merritt on bass. Benny Golson, who later would be replaced by a young Wayne Shorter, pinned two tunes on this recording: \\"Are You Real?\\" \\"The Drum Thunder Suite,\\" \\"Blues March,\\" and \\"Along Came Betty.\\" Bobby Timmons, who later wrote \\"Dat Dere\\" for the 1960 album \\"The Big Beat,\\" wrote the title track.This is an outstanding album full of virtuosity, swing, pure emotion, and some of the best jazz drumming you ever heard. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Art","review":"If you like your jazz beefy with clean sophisticated phrasing. Smoothe & sparkling. Refined,designed, classy. This disc is it! My only reason for 4 rather than 5 stars would be my preference for jazz that's a little more experimental. That said this disc is first rate!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a terrific shower head","review":"This is a quality product made from heavy material. It functions very smoothly unlike cheaper shower heads. I am very happy with it. One thing to beware of is that it comes with its own arm (which is a beautiful product). I did not note that it has a female end where my old arm has a male fitting. Accordingly I could not use the new arm and installed the the new head on my old shower arm instead. I would love to use the new arm because it is a thing of beauty."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Classic Work on Bark and Skin Craft","review":"All modern students of bark and skin boats begin with this book. The intial work on the native watercraft of North America.While the book does not cover the watercraft of all North American First Nations, it does provide a broad range of information on craft from many Nations across the continent.This book is highy recommended to anyone interested in the history of canoes or kayaks as developed on the North American continent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tappan Adney","review":"Tappan Adney is a relative thru my paternal genealogy side, and his canoes are in a New York museum.Thought it would be nice to have his books for my children and grandchildren to read. Wish I could have gotten them in hard copy and one of the orginial printings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"Great book the definitive work on Bark canoes. A history all but lost if not for Tappan. A miracle and a treasure for all interested in First nNations history and the skills needed to make a craft"},{"rating":"2","title":"Five Stars - Top Rate CD","review":"Reviews of this group are not sufficient without dropping a few names for comparison.If Bessie Smith, Ma Rainey or Janis Joplin were alive today, they would be singing with the Uppity Blues Women. Truth to tell, with modern recording techniques on her side, these other ladies are no real match for Ann Rabson's booming voice and sexy piano work. Do Your Duty, The Clock and Life Goes On are easily worth the price of the CD.There is really no choice but to rate this a full 5 stars. I would be disappointed if the average were anything less. This is the one - if you have made it this far and still don't own this CD, buy it today - here or someplace else, I don't care. Don't put this opportunity off till another time; do your duty!"},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST OF THE BEST","review":"I LOVE THIS CD, IT'S THE BEST THESE GIRLS HAVE DONE IN MY OPINION. ANDRA FAYE CAN BELT OUT THE BLUES LIKE NOBODIES BUSINESS."},{"rating":"2","title":"WILLIAM CLARKE...SERIOUS BLUESMAN!","review":"CLARKE IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE BLUESHARP MEN. ON THIS CD CLARKE DISPLAYS HIS VERSATILITY ON THE HARP BY PLAYING IN BOTH OLDER (SONNY BOY, ETC.) AND CONTEMPORARY (HEAVY AMPED) STYLES. HE HAS A GREAT VOICE TOO. HIS UNIQUE SOUND IS FAT AND MUFFLED. HIS STYLE IS SIMPLE AND DIRECT TO THE POINT. HE REALLY SHINES ON SLOW BLUES. THIS IS NOT MY FAVORITE CD BY CLARKE, BUT IT DOES SHOW HIS VERSATILITY AS A HARPIST. CHECK IT OUT. JERSEY SLIM"},{"rating":"2","title":"Harmonica Blues Highlight","review":"This is the late William Clarke's first and best album. Clarke's harp is certainly the strength of the songs with styles varying from blues, swing, rock and sometimes touching on jazz. His vocals are also a feature as is the guitar of Alex Schultz and the drums of Lee Campbell. My favourites are the slows mood blues of 'Going down this highway' and 'Its been a long time' which highlight how good a harp man he was. The track 'Pawnshop bound' also features superb up tempo harmonica."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get the RVG","review":"You really can't go wrong with any of the Art Blakey & The Jazz Messengers titles with Wayne Shorter (1959-1964), and The Big Beat is no exception, but there's a reason why there aren't any new versions available of this particular edition. Get the RVG version, which has far better sound, since it was digitally remastered by Rudy Van Gelder."},{"rating":"2","title":"This lineup is a layup","review":"This is my third Jazz Messenger CD with Lee Morgan and Wayne Shorter, and they are all very good. Art Blakley's formula is to have his players write the song, and the arrangements are simply melody, solos, melody, then end. The trick is to have top-notch players like Lee Morgan and Wayne Shorter. Bobby Timmons is no slouch on piano, and Jymie Merritt didn't create big waves in the jazz world but certainly sounds good too. The songs are a masculine bunch. \\"The Chess Players\\" is muscular-sounding. \\"Sakeena's Vision\\" is more of a lope. \\"Politely\\" and \\"Dat Dere\\" both strut. \\"Lester Left Town\\" also has a strutting feel, but the melody is more slippery. The standard \\"It's Only A Paper Moon\\" is more complicated-sounding than the others, and also the best song on the CD.Despite some of the formulaic nature of this CD, hard bop fans should pick this up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Abridged Version","review":"This is an abridged version. If you want an unabridged version, get the Life of Johnson (Oxford World's Classics) [UNABRIDGED."},{"rating":"2","title":"Field Herping","review":"This is an excellent book and you would be hard pressed to find a more in depth guide to help you identify the reptiles and amphibians of costa rica. I wish there were more books about the herpetofauna of specific countries that went into this level of depth."},{"rating":"2","title":"I highly recommend this book!","review":"This is a very well written and interesting book! I just couldn't put it down once I started reading it!Frederick Gilmer Bonfils is my 3rd great-uncle, and I originally started reading the book to learn more about him and my family. However, I was so enthralled by Bill Hosokawa's writing that, as I was reading the book, I kept repeating, \\"This is an excellent book! I would definitely buy this even if I was not a Bonfils family member!\\"My family and I are so thankful for this book and owe a great deal of gratitude to Bill Hosokawa. He did an excellent job in his research and his objectivity. Also, he is such a talented writer.I have bought this book for my family members and friends (whether they are related to Bonfils or not). It is a must-read for everyone. I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Alot of fun!","review":"This is a really fun dance video! Moves are easy and instruction segment is pretty straight forward. The only complaint I would have is that Lisa is a little \\"lazy\\" about keeping you on count and preparing you for the next move. It is alot of fun though and she is motivating and I have always loved her! You will sweat with this one, too!! Have fun w/ it!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ready for the trash can","review":"I loved Lisa on \\"Dancing with the Stars\\" and really thought this would be a great DVD. I was wrong. It is very hard to follow. Her cues were off and too often the camera is focused on her face instead of on her feet or full body. I'm not trying to learn how to smile. I'm trying to learn the workout. Great idea, bad video. I would love for you to try it again and focus on the student not the star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Coulda been great","review":"The other reviews convinced me to give this a try. Although I really enjoy Lisa's attitude and confidence, there are several drawbacks to the workout.1) The cueing is spotty. Because the routines are complex and fast, this is an important omission.2) When she says \\"turn left\\" - to the audience, she actually means, \\" turn right.\\" I was always in the reverse image. EVERY other exercise video I've tried accounts for this.3) There isn't enough awareness about safety when stretching or moving fast.With some coaching Lisa could be a terrific instructor. She has the body, motivation, and good energy to inspire. The routines were close, too, and fun, but I couldn't overcome the drawbacks. The ability to move well and have great rhythm is a huge plus, but she needs to study with instructors who've made successful videos. Till then, I humbly suggest that she not quit her day job;)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"I am SHOCKED that anybody enjoys or uses this video. It's insanely boring, Lisa is lost half of the time, and you can barely hear the music. Perhaps it serves a purpose of teaching very basic dance steps, but it's laughable as a workout video. The fast version of each dance lasts 90 seconds. That's a whopping six minutes of cardio. And if you want to skip the tutorials and just get to work, you'll have to use the menu again and again. Horrible. Really, I can't believe how bad it is.

Fiddling with it will eventually restore the connection but this is not the way a mouse is supposed to behave.If I knew that mine is a defective unit I would replace it with another Targus BT but I can't be sure of it; it may be a design problem.

Then, if I don't use the mouse for about 15 minutes or so, I have to re-add it again when I come back to use it. This is EXTREMELY annoying!! I have other BT devices that I have only paired to my laptop once...and have never had to do it again since beginning to use them. Those devices \\"stay\\" in the BT configurations of the laptop.

I think that weakest part is the slide on/off switch which is useful for saving battery power but whose malfunction has likely killed the mouse. Not a good value for the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad battery life, buggy, cheap","review":"I bought this mouse a year ago to use with my ibook. Initially, it worked well. The biggest problem that I had was the battery life. The batteries would only last for about a week. I thought at first the mouse was defective, so I had Targus replace it. I still had the same problem.After a while, I seemed to have more and more problems getting the mouse to connect properly with my laptop. Also, the switch under the mouse broke off.I highly recommend the Logitech V270 instead.

This was simply one of the worst PPVs from the WWE i have ever seen, I have not seen one as terrible as this since the mid 90's. This entire PPV was a joke with the main event as The Undertaker vs. the Dudley Boyz? dont forget JBL winning the the title from Eddie Guerrero.

Michael Hill always delivers upbeat, joyous live performances, and his lyrics and drenched with passion. We haven't even started to talk about his guitar playing yet! This is an amazing performer and a wonderful man, and you are missing out on one of the true coming stars of blues when you talk of Michael Hill. I can't recommend this album enough. I love all the young blues musicians from New York, such as Michael Hill, Shemekia Copeland, Robert Charels, Todd Wolfe and Bill Perry. They are all doing something DIFFERENT, and that's what the blues world needs more of!"},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing record","review":"Can't praise it enough.Took me a while to get used to this version of Recado Bossa Nova (more up beat than both Frazer McPerson's and Zoot Sims') but, man, it does have more verve and bounce, and the entire CD is a wonder. I can't get enough of Mobley's playing and will be purchasing other CDs by him.Wish this great sax artist was still around so we could see him blow that horn live."},{"rating":"2","title":"Value for the information, not the prejudice","review":"I entirely agree with the other reviewer that Denig was very prejudiced about Native Americans. For me, the value in the book - and it is great - is to have rare information about these tribes before their near-disappearance. Denig seems to save his harshest criticisms for the tribes that were most independent, and his stories about these groups give us a glimpse into their lives. I would very much recommend this book to people who are interested in the early 19th century world of the Upper Missouri."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Kung Fu Movie","review":"If you've seen either of the first two movies in the series you should know what to expect.

Either way it was very good."},{"rating":"1","title":"6000 LOUSY Reviews.","review":"Obviously the author is over his head here--probably too many tastings for one person. Also, he has a unfortunate tendency towards over-rating domestics, and apparently little understanding of the most interesting, rare styles of beer (he gives Cantillon lambic something like a 20 out of 100 (less than some American \\"premium\\" lagers) because it's \\"too sour.\\") You might as well criticize Scotch as being \\"too peaty.\\" Frankly, I haven't found any beer reviewer that I agree with more than half the time other than the great beer diety, Michael Jackson. The notes on the tasting process, however, are well laid out and the process explained in clear terms--I guess that's the best thing I can say...It's mostly the beer reviews themselves that are lame."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but getting old.. and a bit biased","review":"Great book.. but it's getting old. There are many new breweries & beers not in the book. The reviews are good and fairly consistent. The book has the beer indexed by brewer, name, and state (US beers only). It really needs an index by type/rating as well.. it's difficult to find a highly rated beer of a certain type. The book is also biased towards 'holiday' beers that are unavailable."},{"rating":"2","title":"A comprehesive index of many beers","review":"As a novice beer taster, I enjoy this book a lot. It has easy to understand language and beers are arranged according to country of origin and brewery and also through an alphabetic index. While no book could contain all beers, this volume does a nice job including both macro and microbrews. A friend once brought a case of various little known microbrews to a party, and \\"The Beer Tasters Log\\" had over half of them. For beers that are not listed, there is plenty of room to write your own \\"reviews\\" and keep them in order with the other entries. If you are an experienced beer taster or a novice like me, I'm sure you will enjoy this book. Incidentally, all of the beers I have tasted that are in the book, I have agreed with the authors review of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of the Best!!!","review":"Excellent game with awesome campaigns, and mission difficulty. This game is a challenging one that keeps you tight on your seat all the time that a campaign lasts, because when you think that everything is almost done the computer strikes you back and can even destroy you as fast as the counterattack came. You can only depend on your strategy to survive to any challenge!. Very well done! I think that it has only a flaw,and it resides in the fact that missions are almost of the same type: Holding strategic points, destroying enemy headquarters, and conquering the map, but putting aside this issue I can highly reconmend it! I think that this game will last in the history of history based strategic games ever done, like age of empires did."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best RTS ever","review":"Excellent game, hopefully new patches will be released soon to help improve this great game.

I suggest it to any major RTS gamers like my self. Its a good taste of what it might have been like back then and the fun is enhanced with the company selection. Its realistic and entreaging and just pulls you into it. Its not like CnC when you have it on easy it sometimes gets really hard if you set it to easy you will still get a challenge and a thrill not a steamroller comp,but you also wont be able to just steamroll over them. overall its a great game and is one of my favorites I like better then Dawn of War (<3)which is a big accomplish meant in my case.Pros.Great Comp.Great Balancing.Great interactionCons.Not many to date5 of 5"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"Non stop fun.

They must be constantly on their toes fighting and micromanaging on the fly. I find it difficult, most of the time, yet incredibly entertaining. HIGHLY recommended, especially if you're into explosions every 5 seconds (once you've made a bit of progress into the game)."},{"rating":"2","title":"This game is awesome.","review":"I was a little wary of purchasing this game because my computer is several years old. The game runs flawlessly. It's a little different than most RTS games because the amount of commodities used to generate new units is accrued through gaining territories on each map."},{"rating":"2","title":"Addicting","review":"This is one of the best RTS games available and a great buy too!!!

Which is correct?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply amazing!","review":"From start to finish, this is Bobby McFerrin's finest release of the eighties! From the first track, \\"Thinkin' About Your Body\\", with its simple lyrics and wooderful tune, to the catchy closing track \\"Mañana Iguana\\", this album shows off Bobby's unmatched vocal (and other) talents. Besides playing with guest musicians on a few tracks (\\"Turtle Shoes\\" with Herbie Hancock, \\"Another Night In Tunisia\\" with Manhattan Transfer, \\"Walkin\\" with Wayne Shorter, and in an amusing appearance, Robin Williams in \\"Beverly Hills Blues), there's a cover of The Beatles \\"From Me To You\\" that even Beatles fans will like. If you're not a Bobby McFerrin fan, after the purchase of this album you will be!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous!","review":"When you listen to this recording, you forget that all were not done with overdubs, like some of his other albums. McFerrin has an incredible gift for producing harmonies and rythms with every part of his body. As a vocalist myself, I appreciate the incredible level of control he has over his vocal chords (as well as various other parts of his body). On top of it all, as the album title 'Spontaneous Inventions' implies, most of the tracks were improvised, in many cases live on stage. The results are often funny, often strange, often poetic, but never, ever boring.Ironically, one of my favorite tracks is 'Night in Tunesia' performed with the Manhattan Transfer--probably the least improvised of all of the tracks. Excellent performances all around of this jazz classic. This album is well worth the grammy it won, I believe it was for best jazz recording."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS IS BAD!","review":"I was chokin' to death when I heard this which I checked off from a library near Fulton County 'cross Roswell GA. It has a full blast and has amazing songs in it that I loved from: Turtle Shoes, Talkin' Thru My Body, Walkin, Beverly Hills Blues, Another Night in Tunisha, etc.This is sumthin I gotta have if I luv the man and 'specially fans to George Benson, Miles Davis, The Temptations, Herbie Hancock, Kanye West, The Manhattan Transfer, Wynton Marsalis, among others especially my main man and inspiration Mr. Quincy Jones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Treats and Causes Depression?","review":"Probly bought this when I was depressed.

THIS IS A MUST TO HAVE FOR EVERY SCORPIONS FAN"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible effort, No sting whatsoever","review":"The Scorpions truly miss the mark on this one. For a Scorpions fan who must have everything, go ahead and buy it. For anyone else, this is their worst album, so stay away.It's as though the band wrote no new material and put out an album of B-sides from the almost-as-bad Face the Heat.If this is the best the Scorpions can do, they won't be around much longer. Truly sad, the downfall of a great band."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gold Ballads II","review":"Sadly so, in 11 songs there's like 8 or 9 ballads. Not that all songs are bad but this is definately one hell of a boring cd. Stone in my Shoe and Wild Child are the only really rockers, as for the ballads: \\"You & I\\" ,with a similar structure to Still Lovin' You, is actually the only one worthy of the tag Scorpions. Buy this if you are mostly interested in ballads, if you want stings better look at the pre Live Bites albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Ballad Instinct!!!!","review":"In the other reviews they said this was an album with too much ballads. I agree, and if Herman Rarebell didn't left the band, this was never happened. But that much ballads doesn't make it boring, does it? 'Wild Child' is a nice rocker, but 'Stone In My Shoe' is wonderful, I love 'Tim Will Call Your Name', and 'But The Best For You' is the best for you. :D. 'Does Anyone know' is just boring and makes me sleep. 'Soul behind The Face' is very nice to hear, and 'Oh Girl (i wanna be with you)' is really nice as well. 'When You Came into My Life' is average, and 'Where the river flows' is worth the title of boring ballad. 'You And I' is not ugly, but it ain't super, it's average. And last and the absolute least: 'Are You the One?'. Where are the electric guitars on the last song? Klaus Meine better wrote this one on Acoustica!! But this is a pretty good POP album.Keep On ROCKing, not Popping!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best Scorpions Album","review":"Although not as famous as Crazy World, Blackout and Love at First Sting, Pure Instinct is a great Scorpions Album. I actually did not know many songs from this album before buying it, however I chose it because it has the song You And I, which I did know, and is also one of the best from the Album. If you are a Scorpions fan, looking for an Album different than the ones I've mentioned above, this might be an excellent choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Scorpions' Album so far","review":"This is a true masterpiece. Welcome back to the 80's melodic heavy metal. A gulp of fresh air in the world filled with faceless alternative contamination. Too bad that during the tour which followed this release, they didn't play much of the new music, sticking to their hits, instead. I had to leave in the middle of the show... Bored."},{"rating":"1","title":"Their worst","review":"The Scorpions are my favorite band but I even thought this CD s*cked. It seems like the scorpions might have permanantly lost their sting since Crazy World, cuz Face the heat s*cked too.Its sad to see a great (and my favorite) band sink themselves to this level.If you have never heard the Scorpions, hearing this will make you never want to hear their best work"},{"rating":"1","title":"Some good songs but boring and lacks power","review":"Some of the songs on this album are ok, like \\"You and I\\" and \\"But the Best For You\\", but overall this lacks the power of the Scorpions. If you think regular Scorpions ballads are too hard for you then this might be for you, otherwise you should look at their older releases, like \\"Blackout\\" and \\"Love at First Sting\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get another translation.","review":"This is one of my favorite Platonic dialogues, an analysis of both rhetoric and love which leads to some compelling discussions. However, the translation offered by Pengin Classics is hideously lacking. I can't put my finger on exactly where it goes wrong, but the translator makes it a pain to get through just one page. Everything seems laborous and technical, including the normally exquisite speeches.Get another translation instead. Might I suggest the one published by Hackett? Or perhaps Cornell University Press? Both of those translations take care to make the dialogue as lively annd exciting as it rightfully should be."},{"rating":"2","title":"These boots run BIG.... they are soooo STYLISH and unique","review":"I received these boots today and they were a little more green/teal than the picture shows.

Go and buy this today!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible. Just terrible.","review":"What a nightmare. It's hard to believe that this band had anything to do with the original Veruca Salt. Same lame tempo shifts in every song it seems. They play soft, and then hit it hard trick has been tired for years before this album came out, and uses it it seems on *every* track. It was years since I had the misfortune of picking this one up, and obviously still leaves a very bad taste."},{"rating":"1","title":"The talent is gone","review":"After listening to this album, it's clear that Nina Gordon was the real talent behind this band. Sorry, Louise, but you're doomed to the same fate as the other guy in Wham. Go buy Tonight and the Rest of My Life, and see why Nina is drawing comparisons to Amy Mann and Shawn Colvin. And Louise...was Dave Grohl really worth losing your career over?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nina Gordon, Please Come Back!","review":"Life isn't going to good for Louise Post these days. With the departure of Nina Gordon and the rest of Veruca Salt, Louise hoped to bring the band back into the harsh music world with the new VS album, \\"Resolver\\". Sorry Louise, this CD doesn't quite cut it. I will admit that I am a fan of Veruca Salt's earlier stuff (\\"American Thighs\\", \\"Eight Arms To Hold You\\") but this...this is just not the Veruca Salt I grew to love. \\"Resolver\\" is basically the same song played over and over again 13 times. You know how it goes...soft singing, LOUD chorus. How boring! This CD isn't the worst record I've ever heard though, there is one fairly decent song on the record, and thats \\"Born Entertainer\\". I just hope Louise Post realizes that she does not fit that title in any way, shape, or form. Sorry Veruca Salt, this CD is a major disapointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate to say it, but ...","review":"... bought this not knowing Nina Gordon had left; popped it into the CD changer, and wondered -- where are the hooks? why is none of this catchy? what's wrong with the vocals? But now... I understand why. Sad. Eight Arms to Hold You was fun, had a sense of irony about the monster rock elements (complete with cowbells). This feels like Eight Arms without the irony. Wish I had bought Juliana Hatfield or Sleater-Kinney's latest instead of this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"If people would stop comparing EVERYONE to Nina...","review":"This album is incredible! I don't know what JEFF GLASS & DAVID LAW were thinking. I wouldn't be surprised if it turned out they didn't even listen to it. I've heard Veruca before. But, this is not only quintessential Veruca, this is the band's best album! Granted, Louise is the only member left. But, she proves (as usual) that she can make a masterpiece from a pile of scraps. Her new band is excellent! The songs are better than they've ever been! Every song is fantastic! This is the only long-awaited release that hasn't let me down in some way. I would recommend this album to anyone with ears and of course, anyone with a good sense of taste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ain't no fun without Nina.","review":"Veruca Salt's Resolver is bland, offensive, and boring album. The only orginal member that is still standing is frontwoman Louise Post, I love her songs on the bands previous albums but only two songs are worth a listen to on Resolver, and those songs include: Only You Know and Pretty Boys. It's a darn shame Nina Gordon and the rest of the band went their separate ways after Eight Arms to Hold You. Nina Gordon's solo album, Tonight and the rest of my Life is amazing so I highly recommend purchasing that instead. Veruca Salt is nothing without the extra salt."},{"rating":"1","title":"It sits on my shelf . . .","review":"Horrible attempt to resusitate a dead Veruca, which is missing the real talent of the group, Nina Gordon. Sorry Louise, you ain't getting it done. Don't waste your cash, not even on a used cheapie. You're warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST THING EVER!","review":"This album is terrible. I used to love Veruca Salt, every song on there last two albums rocked. When I bought Resolver, I was expecting it to be a really awesome album. It is not. Nina Gorden was obviously the talent of the group. The songs on this album resemble JEWEL's more than any rock group's. Veruca Salt has SOLD OUT. There was a few songs that I thought might have some potential but were ruined by Post's annoying whispers. She whispers constantly in every song, which resemble nails scratching a chalkboard. Not to mention that the lyrics also lack quite a bit, they are either really unflowing or sound like pop. I must say that I HATE this album. If you like Veruca Salt, this album will only make you wish Post had left instead of Nina Gorden. It is a complete waste of money and the name Veruca Salt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Growing on me day by day","review":"Well, as a self-professed Louise and Veruca fanatic, I was chomping at the bit to get a hold of \\"Resolver\\". The new album lacks the continuity of past Veruca Salt efforts, but does bring Louise's rock influences and edginess to the forefront. While VS records had a bit of give and take on the hard soft hard songs, Louise does kick it up a notch on this release. Former TFA bassist Kevin Tihista helped pen 3 excellent songs and the influence of ex-Filter Brian Liefsgang shines through as well. While it is hard to admit that Veruca Salt is gone, fans of one of Chicago's best should enjoy the new Post and Gordon efforts this summer. Concerning personal references about Nina and Louise's relationships and Dave Grohl and a certain local singer---all drivel that helps make song fodder and shouldn't make review fodder. Bottom line is the music, and this is good music. Nuff said, now add this to your shopping cart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unresolved issues","review":"I was really looking forward to this album. Really. When I finally got around to buying it, I was also looking forward to listening to it. My only pronouncement is that Louise Post needs some assistance. Without her original bandmates, she just can't hold her own, and the juvenile musings on this CD get on my nerves. It's as if she's trying too hard to sound profound and introspective, with the eventual outcome of just sounding superficial. Come on! Veruca Salt's other endeavors have really set the bar high, I know, but Resolver is an absolute disappointment. There just isn't enough rock to this album--it wavers between soft ballady-type things to the insistent wailing of electric guitar. Ah well. I guess I'll have to find another use for my copy of Resolver. Frisbee, anyone?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bring in the pall bearers!","review":"There were hints of this, wrapped in great music, on the last Veruca CD(and I mean \\"last\\"), but let's face it, Veruca Salt as we know and love it is D-E-A-D dead.

No offense to Kiwis, but what a waste!! These guys are great writers, and this book is more than a look at the Luftwaffe's role in the little-remarked upon Norwegian front. Just as in Hayward's book, there is much discussion on the Kriegsmarine's operations, all of it fascinating. For example, I have read a lot on WWII (believe me), but until this book I did not know the US Navy ran a carrier operation off the Norwegian coast using the USS Ranger! I can most confidently recommend this book to any WWII buff. It is very well-written, and extremely informative."},{"rating":"2","title":"Durango Street","review":"I believe the book Durango Street by Frank Bonham was interesting because it could be a real life situation or something that could happen in real life.I felt like everything was believable;the people and the setting.The main character(Rufus Henry)was in a situation where he tried to stay out of trouble.One night he had ran into a gang called the Grassers,and he had no choice but to join a gang.He joins a gang with an old friend from Pine Valley Camp,called The Moors,but his parole officer told him not tojoin a gang.I think teen readers can relate to Rufus alot because he was a boy that was in trouble then tried to do the right thing,then ended back in trouble.I think that both males and females could read this book between the ages of 13 to 17."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Sucks!","review":"Why?

I fell in love with it and after that I had to get the soundtrack as fast as I could. I also love the song \\"First Sign of Spring.\\" It's a nice, happy song that fills me with joy. Now I can't wait til spring. \\"Sing the Day\\" is a really nice song too, but a little bit of it is a little confusing, but it's still good. I'm also glad that there are songs from the first movie, showing that we haven't forgotten it even the sequel's come out. Keep up the good work!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Shorter album on Blue Note","review":"Wayne Shorter made many outstanding albums for Blue Note while with the Miles Davis Quintet: \\"Night Dreamer\\", \\"Juju\\", \\"Adam's Apple\\", \\"Etcetera\\", \\"Supernova\\" and this classic album which contains many tunes which have become standards like the title tune, \\"Infant Eyes\\", \\"Fee-fi-fo fum\\" and \\"Witch Hunt\\". Freddie Hubbard and Elvin Jones provided energy and fire to Shorter as well as Davis teammates, Herbie Hancock and Ron Carter. There's not a weak track in this album and I remember wearing the vinyl version out after many plays. The RVG is okay but I returned it and got the original issue on CD because there was little separation to the point where it was almost monaural. This has happened on several early RVG releases like \\"Midnight Blue\\", \\"Out to Lunch\\" and \\"Unity\\". Thus I would recommend to anyone if possible not to get the RVG edition and try for the original issue. Outside of that this is a great album!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It doesn't get any better","review":"Listen closely and repeatedly to this one. This music is extremely subtle; Wayne Shorter is one of the greatest composers we have today. Upon multiple listenings, it will grow on you and its complexity will unfold. And, if you're a musician, get out the Real Book. Most of the tunes (like 5 of them) are in there; you will just die when you look at the charts. To make music like this sound as effortless as it does is the work of true masters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Melodic, foreboding, soothing \\"Evil.\\"","review":"Wayne Shorter's all-star unit seems to meld hard-bop stylings with deliberate, slow melodies that are quietly entrancing. I would recommend this album to any music lover, particularly relative jazz novices like myself. All of the songs on this set, particularly the mellow, soulful title track, are highly enjoyable. I'd only betray my limited knowledge of the genre by writing more, but I'd recommend this record to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"Blue Note's new RVG edition releases justify buying an album again, even if you own the CD. This gem is among the greatest recordings ever. the first track has one of the most memorable licks in all of music. The only downside is that it will occupy a permanent space in your CD player. Clearly a good purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid RVG editions","review":"Like many \\"Rudy Van Gelder Edition\\" the sound of this record has been deeply degraded by the remastering. The sound level has been pumped up with very unpleasant compression effects in particular on the cymbals. The overall sound has now a vague resemblance to the sound of live Jazz.What a shame that Rudy Van Gelder (the engineer of many fantastic records in the 50's and 60's) gave its name to this vandalism."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haven't spent enough time with the album for final judgement but...","review":"the playing is really solid. Shorter has some really nice melodic runs and makes some cool choices as a composer. Obviously the backing band is the cats pajamas. I don't really know where it stands yet on my favorite albums list- but if you're a fan of Shorter I can't really imagine that you would be disapointed by this outing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Blue Note Jazz","review":"Wayne Shorter used these recordings as a showcase for his playing skills. It's not as much as a group effort as Kind of Blue, but it's a classic. This is a perfect introduction to Shorter's late 60's work, and if you buy it, you'll be hooked like I am."},{"rating":"2","title":"Speak No Evil","review":"This is Wayne's most acknowledged masterpiece and is probably his greatest album. The album features Wayne, the brilliant Freddie Hubbard on trumpet, Herbie Hancock on piano, Ron Carter on bass, and the amazing Elvin Jones on drums. The album really plays like a long suite, since all six numbers keep the same mystical aura for the duration of the album. Every song is about the supernatural (except the bueatiful ballad \\"Infant Eyes\\", but this particular track still keeps that mysterious, mystical feeling that is presest on the rest of the tracks.). This is one of those rare cds where no one track sticks in my mind, since every track is flawless, and no one track is better than any of the others. If you are a fan of jazz music at all, you have to add this gem to your collection!"},{"rating":"2","title":"very fine","review":"the irish two songs remind one of a aire of love for all persons, and simple pleasure in music. let the coors record an American Classic song \\"THE YELLOW ROSE OF TEXAS\\"CHRIST Blessings,peter fitzgerald"},{"rating":"1","title":"lost on the way home.","review":"The Corrs are insanely talented Irish musicians. Their background and talents have for years begged the question that they produce a roots album. Purportedly, this album, \\"Home\\", is the result.If you enjoy the superscrubbed, sterile, overproduced sound of their pop albums, then you will enjoy this album. As usual, there is not a single spontaneous note on the whole album, and no risks were taken. The Corrs have the potential to make an electrifying Irish roots album, but \\"Home\\" is not it. For starters they would need to ditch their usual producer, Mitchell Froom, who also produced \\"Home\\". Froom is a decidedly pop producer, and, unfortunately, a pop album is what he and the Corrs have produced. Given their enormous potential, this album is, thus, a huge disappointment for those awaiting a roots album from the Corrs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Ready For Irish Prime Time","review":"I bought this CD for my girlfriend who has gotten into Irish folk music just recently. She quite likes it but I was disappointed with it.The problem with The Corrs and some other Irish & English performers is that they feel a need to adopt a 'mid-atlantic' accent while singing, which means much of their native tongue goes missing. This works well for pop & rock etc but less so for folk singing.Irish artists like Maura O'Connell, Mary Black or even Enya in a pinch could have performed any of these songs better than The Corrs.I did note that acoustic guitars made in Northern Ireland were used on the CD - that was a nice touch. Otherwise The Corrs should stick to the bubble gum, eye candy pop singing they're used to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Traditional Irish songs ruined","review":"Am a Corrs fan, so was eager for this new album ... a trip back to their Irish roots. Unfortunately, all I can take from the album are the \\"breathy\\" vocals ... you hear EVERY SINGLE intake of breath between notes and its VERY DISTRACTING!

With songs like \\"Old Hag\\" to \\"Haste to the Wedding\\" to get you dancing and songs like \\"Heart Like A Wheel\\" and \\"Peggy Gordan\\" to help you over come a relationship, this album has something for everyone, of all ages. Sharon Corr, the bands violinist and back up vocalist also takes front stage for the song \\"Dimming of the Day\\" where she sings lead, her voice is truly impressive and her debut is a GREAT success! Andrea Corr's melodic voice goes right through you, and sent chills down my spine the entire album through. This is the MUST HAVE album of the century! 5 out of 5 stars for sure!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Corrs do it again","review":"I really like this album. My husbnd wasn't sure I would when he gave it to me for Valentine's Day. He stated that since there were two songs in Gaelic that it would be different from the other Corrs CD's I have.

The songs are so beautiful and bring out my hidden celtic nature. But the most appealing thing about this album are the uilleann pipes - for me the most beautiful instrument of all. They were played by John McSherry from Belfast,Ireland. I did a search on him and found some of the most beautiful, inspiring, awesome music I have ever heard. I strongly recommend getting anything by him. If you are, like me, only discovering Irish traditional music, then this album is a must.

The substitute plane was discovered thru fluke circumstances. But still succeeded. Incidently, once a full defensive alert was called all commercial flights in the U.S. were ordered to immediately land so as to prevent other simultaneous attacks.Note that this was a Chinese attack. Not Russian. Most of the story consisted of planning for the mission and political fighting for supremacy between ChiCom factions. This was an excellent read. Moved very quickly.

Lisa isn't in control of the class. She seems to be always looking off to get instruction from some one. Many times the dancers in the back have started a move long before Lisa calls it. The dances are broken into individual segment. It would have been nice if they had put them together to form a workout. You don't do one move long enought to break a sweat or get a good workout.

The camera angles showed her hips when what I needed to see were her feet. I would prefer a constant full frontal or back view so I can follow her. Also the camera showed side views that made no sense. I gave up after trying to follow for a full 40 minutes. Equally discouraging was how the hustle was impossible to learn as presented, as was the Paso. I wondered where the director and producer were when this was being filmed. It seemed the camera person had free reign and was bored, so threw in creative shots that made learning the routines impossible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Liked Alot","review":"I rented this video from the local library because I was tired of investing my money into workout videos that didn't deliver. The dance moves here are invigorating. Although Lisa is kind and (attempts to) take her time showing us the steps, the choreographer (in the background) is drowning her out and the dancers behind her seem to leave her in the dust. She looks off the camera many times to get a cue as to what to do next. The dances are hard to get at first because she is facing me i have to turn around and look at the tape through a mirror to try and simulate her moves, it's frustrating, but I guess once I get the moves down and continue to do the dances to my own music, it will be an amazing workout..they should release a revised version of this workout using many of the suggestions from the commentators here."},{"rating":"1","title":"delzen","review":"Boring...very slow moving..will not get the exercise you need as she stops many times and n you never really get started."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a dance instructor and not exercise!","review":"Rinna is likable, has a great body and dances well.

And the beginning segments are not well taught.

I had every reason to be enthusiastic after hearing Freddie Hubbard on Hubtones, Dexter Gordon on Go, and Lee Morgan on Sidewinder, all SACDs from Analog Productions. However, for some reason, Maiden Voyage just doesn't sound right. It is so very dark sounding. I compared it to my RVG edition CD. On the Analog Productions SACD, it sounds like the top end has been rolled off. I wish I could recommend Maiden Voyage but sadly, I cannot. Take my advice and stick with the RVG edition of this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Comfort","review":"I've tried multiple noise canceling headphones over the years and this is the first pair I can actually wear for flights of ten hours or longer that does not hurt my ears. The comfort is simply amazing. The ear cups are large enough that they don't press on the ear nearly as much as comparable devices. The volume control feature is also a boon. This is a GREAT feature because it enables people like myself to keep the In Flight Entertainment volume as low as possible while still enjoying a movie or music. The Bose headphones simply made the sound so audible that it hurt my ears to listen, and I don't have this problem at all with the Soundshield 501's. The noise cancellation could be better though. But overall a great set of headphones."},{"rating":"2","title":"A concise resource: What it is like and what to do about it.","review":"I think that I have read them all and this is one of the better ones.

I make use of it only as outside-class reinforcement for Spanish speakers in my classes who need to acquire ONLY basic speaking skills quickly. Keep in mind, however, that the Spanish/English version contributes to a dependence on the student's first language, and its format & layout can be confusing. There aren't enough practice exercises in general, and it doesn't address any academic skills such as punctuation, capitalization, writing longer sentences/paragraphs or reading comprehension. Its saving grace is the pre-laminated reference sheet for common vocabulary and phrases. It would benefit from an accompanying CD or tape for speaking practice and reinforcement at the very least.

(Did you know that cars are the number 1 cause of the Florida panther's decline?) While biodiesel should be promoted instead of gas, it really does not alleviate the majority of social ills caused by the vehicle itself, like the atomizing of people inside steel boxes or the clear-cutting of forests to make way for parking lots and strip malls.

All I can say is- wow!Just the treat of hearing Mingus and Roach- perhaps the finest rhythm section players of the post-war era- playing together is enough of a treat. Add the rare experience of hearing Duke Ellington (whom Mingus worshipped) playing in a trio, and you've got something really special. Put all three of them together and an incredible experience. Mingus and Roach's powerful playing seesm to be almost taunting the Duke, pushing him to play beter. And he responds with stunning, firey playing.If you're a jazz fan and you haven't heard this album, buy it now. Or buy two, in case you lose one.

Gurdjeff is a really good storyteller, the only boring chapter was the introduction, the rest of the book I found to be very fascinating and insightful as to the question who the person was.Still, I would have preferred if he would have relayed some more about the peoples from whom he learned his knowledge, and if he would have presented this knowledge as well as for example he does about the occasion when he met a Persian dervish who criticized his yogic practices. The book were much better if he would have included more such interludes, instead he focuses on talk about his friends and companions who actually are not very remarkable at all, they just happened to be his friends.One more minus: the book's cover is a really lame work of art."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gurdjieff's journey to knowledge","review":"\\"Always and in everything strive to attain at the same time what is useful for others and what is pleasant for oneself\\" said Mullah Nassr Eddin. And Gurdjieff worked all his life to do that. In this book, he offers us his journey to knowledge with its stepping stones and its struggles, and introduces us to the people that affected his life in one way or another. It should be titled, Meetings with Remarkable People,in my opinion, since a couple of women are also included, though men are more.With Gurdjieff and the protagonists of his life, you'll get a trip back in time, through a multi ethnic, unmapped region, whose roughness and beauty provide the perfect setting for an endeavour of the soul.This is one of the books that truly touched me deeply, and the first i read from Gurdjieff, other than In Search of the Miraculous. The eloquence and wit of Gurdjieff, make reading an enjoyable experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"FANTASTIC!!!!","review":"Gurdjieff at his most engaging. This is his autobiography, in particular the biography of his occult knowledge. He introduces you to the people who developed him into what he became and taught him what he came to teach himself later on. It is written in a special way, different from a typical 'Western' writer. This must be understood: this is the thinking of a Eastern and Ancient quality. Fantastic voyages, extraordinary people, Gurjieff does not disappoint. On the brink of exhaustion in an expedition deep in the Gobi desert Gurdjieff experiences a miracle, and then another, and another......."},{"rating":"2","title":"Remarkable book","review":"This book is very inspiring, even to those unfamiliar with Gurdjieff's other works. This man has had one remarkable life! In my view, his active pursuit of true spiritual knowledge puts to shame much of the commercial spirituality & beliefs people settle into nowadays. The various accounts mentioned in this book give a lot of food for thought and inspire reflection upon our upbringing, values, and the way to search for truth. Definitely worth reading (and re-reading)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adventure developed into philosophy","review":"If you like adventure reading but want to go further, try this.

Gurdjieff have anything to offer you? Consider the following quote (which is not atypical) from p. 210 of Meetings with Remarkable Men:\\"In my opinion in employing contemporary maps it would be ideally useful to put into practice the sense of a judicious saying which declares, 'If you wish to succeed in anything then ask a woman for advice and do the opposite'.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Caveat emptor - Unremarkable (all and everything.)","review":"Lots of \\"wiseacring\\" here.

For this reason I give it five stars.As mentioned by other reviewers, Gurdjieff is a master of \\"coyote wisdom.\\" In the American Indian tradition, the coyote, as totem guide of a Shaman, is a trickster and there was none better than Gurdjieff. My most vivid recollection is a story about his teaching center in France where he was adulated by an obsequious woman. He picked up an iron bowl from the fire and told the woman, \\"Here, hold this.\\" Her shock and pain may or may not have awakened her consciousness, but the technique is vintage Gurdjieff. I have met a number of serious students of Gurdjieff in my 60 short years and they stand out as having significantly more depth than most students of non-traditional paths. Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is a modern tragedy","review":"Meetings with Remarkable Men is an eclectic mixture of art, philosophy, and religion. Gurdjieff uses his early-life adventures to illustrate the difficulties inherent in living a life with a constant goal. The meaning of life isn't so much the goal, but more the experience of life. In this respect Gurdjieff can be compared to Jack Kerouac. Both were pioneers who wandered the country-side. Both had a goal in mind that intricately mutated as their life experience shaped their thoughts. Both are timeless writers. Gurdjieff is also a timeless philosopher."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thomas NW Guide","review":"An excellent road guide for the NW, if you still prefer paper like I do.Not much else can be said about it.

This ran quietly and heated well, but shut off permanently after twenty minutes. Again, customer service sent out a replacement with no hassle, but this one only worked for ten minutes!

The image depicted above is of the 154 model which is the one that has the chrome alloy coil (like what you find in cheaper floor fixtures.) The main difference between the two is that the 157 has to heat up longer than the 154. When you turn the 157 on it will have to warm up the coil for a few minutes before it puts out strong heat. When you turn on the 154 the heat will be produced much faster. The trade off to this is that the 157 has at least a 40 year life (we are just now replacing the one in our 42 year old home and it still works), whereas the 154 could burn up much sooner.I want the chrome alloy coil because of the faster heat output.

Once the unit turns itself off via the thermal switch, it won't come back on. I've went through three thermal units before I learned my lesson. With the 158 the thermal switch would reset itself and I would be able to use the unit again.

Peacock's unfaltering walking bass lines provide coherence and civility, but this would hardly seem to be the occasion for exercising politeness.

None of the songs really even have attempts at hooks. His voice is lacking in quality, which would be ok if he made up for it with emotion, but he does not. I'm just struggling to find a \\"feel\\" for this album, because it just sounds more like musical noise aspiring to be something beautiful, and...well, failing. Sorry...would have loved to be more positive!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality pastels, good price!","review":"I bought this box of oil pastels for my son, who loves art and coloring. Crayons and colored pencils are nice, but they don't have the same richness and blendability as pastels.He was delighted to receive them, and has used them a dozen time in a month. These are top quality pastels - not crumbly or dry. The colors range from soft to vivid, and the 36 colors in this box are plenty to choose from.I recommend these for anyone who wants to buy good quality art products. The price was reasonable for the quality we received."},{"rating":"1","title":"Left me wanting a lot more!","review":"I wanted a great set of oil pastels to work with and this was not it.

There are several artist grade pastels out there which are economical compared to the top end brands but provide their value in quality of your art.

The size of this beast is huge. Actually it is even bigger than my cordless house phone. It does not come with any type of holster or carrying device. I guess they felt the extra 50 pounds for a holster might be a turn off. The buttons are very hard to push and way to small considering the size of this grandfather clock of a phone and very hard on the fingers. The menus are sub tree devided. To get to a feature, you have to go through a maze and hope you find what you are looking for. It comes with 4 'getting started' manuals but each one tells you nothing other than to check back to page 28 for more details, only to go to page 28 and read that you will learn about this feature on page 70? I would not recommend this peice of crap to anyone. It has a true Fisher Price design but it weighs much more than a child could possibly carry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warranty? What warranty?","review":"I had been very happy with my Motorola phone until the battery started losing its charge within a day, even when the phone was turned off. The friendly but incompetent customer support kept me on the phone for an average of 40 minutes for the repeated calls trying to figure out the problem. After the phone had finally been sent to their technical service center, they returned it to me that the phone was irreperable \\"due to customer abuse.\\" I have done nothing to that phone that could have caused any damage (unless using it to make phone calls counts as \\"customer abuse\\"), but got the same comment, without explanation after I had sent the phone in for a second time for reevaluation. It seems that Motorola is just trying to get out of fixing or replacing the phone free of charge under warranty. You'll be fine with a Motorola phone as long as it works. After that, you're on your own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty, but not as high quality as expected","review":"This bracelet is very pretty, but the metal isn't as nice or as heavy as I expected.

All of Janette Oke's books have well-rounded, three-dimensional characters that show a lot of inner-self and emotion. I am always easily drawn into her books and into the plight of the heroine and hero. I do not give her books away; they are \\"keepers.\\" Sometimes, more complex plots are a little slower at showing the forging of a loving relationship, as real life is often like that, as people experience things, so they change.

But, I was wrong!.. I enjoyed every bit of this wonderful book. The only problem I can think of wasthat it was just too short a story!. I wanted MORE!...I've always found it a bit difficult to get into a book. So many books are just about MURDER!.. authors seem to think that folks love to read about murders, but notthis guy!..So, from the very first page, I was hooked. I was a bit sad because this good author did'nt continue her wonderful story for many more pages!."},{"rating":"2","title":"When Calls the Heart","review":"This book was good.

Its a christian novel so its not like its going to be a surprise every book with christian overtones is pretty much the same no matter who writes it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacks depth.","review":"\\"When Calls the Heart\\" had absolutely no depth whatsoever. The character's were one dimensional and predictable. But, thankfully, there was hardly any religious preaching, which I was thankful for. The chapters were very short, and were written as if they were from a child, with no meaning. And, as always, the ending came up so quickly, and ends so abruptly. If you're looking for a mindless read, then this is for you. If not, then I do not recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine materials for a movie","review":"The story is nicely woven, better than \\"Love Comes Softly,\\" and there is a great cast of characters including some loveable Swedish settlers.The interaction of the characters is well done, sometimes delightful.The language, on the other hand, is still a bit stiff -- schoolmarmish, you might say. That is mostly forgivable, given that the narrative is in the first person by a schoolmarm of 1910. Still, the dialogue does sometimes sound like a textbook (e.g. Jonathan's history lesson near the bottom of page 34).Another weakness is that the story often fails to provide a clear picture of the immediate setting of the action. That makes it hard for the reader to get her or his bearings and build a mental picture.Happily, the strengths of \\"When Calls the Heart\\" prevail. It's good reading.The story, the people, and the historical setting furnish the materials for a thoroughly enjoyable movie. There are reports of a movie in the making. Let's watch for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly enjoyable","review":"I say surprisingly because it was not what I expected. I had never read anything from Janette Oke, but this book made me a fan. It was romantic but not steamy. I really enjoy bits of Christianity thrown in there too.

That could have been eliminated and still been a great story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprise Surprise","review":"I had no idea when I purchased this book that it was a \\"Christian\\" love story. It was an OK book to read. The story line was fine. A single teacher leaving home to teach in the West of Canada. She cares about her students and overcomes many hardships (mice, homesickness, lack of simple necessities). It was very slow to develop and the love relationship did not come together until the end of the story. Maybe another chapter or two would have helped to allow the reader to see more into the relationship of Elizabeth and her Mountie. What I did enjoy were the few messages about God written via a father speaking to his son. Wonderful! These words were well worth reading several times."},{"rating":"2","title":"when the heart calls","review":"Read was fantastic,enjoyed the strength of the characters,both Male and Female leads did not give in to the pressures,they stood up and fought for what they believed in,so much for conventions."},{"rating":"2","title":"When calls the Heart is the start of another great series","review":"Really enjoyed this book.

In addition, I really didn't find it to be any more comfortable than any other pillows I've used. I tried varying the amount of water in it and it never did seem thick enough. One other thing, I guess my mattress tapers-off a bit around the edges, and due to that, it seemed like the water in the pillow wanted to flow to the outside, upper edge of the pillow, away from my neck and shoulder, which obviously defeats the purpose. Anyway, these were some things I didn't consider before buying the pillow. On a positive note, I had no trouble returning it and getting a refund.

My chiropractor recommended it. I sleep on my back and my side. It's okay for a side sleeper, but not for a back sleeper. The picture shown is a cut out view of the pillow. The top of the pillow is a thick and made of simple polyfill material. The water in the bottom of the pillow is nothing more then a gimick as far as I'm concerned. It does nothing to enhanse the pillow whatsoever. It's a waste of your money. The pillow is so thick with or without the water, it's just uncomfortable to sleep on. If you're on your side it's okay, but not worth throwing your money away for. Don't bother buying the pillowcase that doesn't come with it. That's a waste of $20. It's a mildly quilted and nothing more. Just use your own pillowcase from home. After a week of using it, I went back to my feather pillow.

For perspective purposes, I must mention that I enjoy my hot sauces over-the-top hot but I will not rule out a mild hot sauce if it has great flavor.I must say that this hot sauce has both excellent flavor and impressive, lasting heat. I think I could best describe it as something that is rather punishing but so tasty that you won't want to stop. Upon consuming you will experience a very natural (it doesn't taste chemical at all) zesty, tangy flavor that is eventually followed by a creeping, lasting heat that rivals that of many extract-based sauces.I really can't describe how great it is in words but I would call it the best hot sauce you can buy in terms of ratio of quality/dollar.

Sorry Lady M it didn't work for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"How could she?","review":"Of all the options Madonna had on this song I think she chose the worst one possible. I have nothing against Madonna and have enjoyed her past music but she has taken away anything good that was ever in the song. Madonna, for possibly the first time in her career has crashed and burned."},{"rating":"1","title":"0,0,0,0 stars","review":"I can not believe out of the 8 reviews, only 2 people hate it. Madonna is a killer. Just like in, \\"Don't Cry For Me Argentina,\\" she takes a classic and butchers it. Don McLean is the only one who can sing this song. Madonna takes the song, and you can barely even recognize it. \\"INCREDIBLE\\" the first review says. Well, whoever wrote that needs a lesson in good music. I am really mad that Madonna has once again shown such evilness as to destroy a great song."},{"rating":"1","title":"LISTEN TO ME RIGHT NOW!","review":"Don't you dare buy this butchered remake! Get the original by Don McLean. Believe me- it's worth it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is truly the day the music died.","review":"Hello all. I listened to the Madonna cover of American Pie but twice. Don Mclean, I'm sorry. Buddy Holly, I'm sorry. Madonna turned this beautiful song into a pop atrocity. Every time one of those notes is played, I scream in pain. Now, listen up for all of you who notice why this song has such high ratings here. Traditionally, the only people who rate songs are those who loved it so much, they want to share their love with the rest of the world. You can prove my example by searching for almost anything. Now, i also want to show you something else. Ignoring the two latest one star reviews, take a good look at which reviews were chosen most useful. With the two one-star reviews, one of them was found useful by one out of fifteen people and the other was found useful by only three out of eighteen people. Don't believe everything you read. LED ZEPPLIN RULES. By the way, Britney SPears is doing a cover of Satisfaction by the Rolling Stones. Beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"YOU FILTHY WOMAN!","review":"Why, why \\"rape\\" this once so beautiful song? Why does this untalented singer think that she can manage to make a better, modern version of this classic? Yes, I agree with the reviewer under: Music is dead, this CD is garbage. Satisfaction and Britney (Give me your money) Spears? Please!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Artistically bereft and morally reprehensible...","review":"To turn an all-time rock standard into a piece of disco-style fluff is just like Madonna. Even though I was never a big fan of the song (yes I know the significance of the song and its reference to Buddy Holly's plane crash) I still consider it a rock classic (along with Stairway to Heaven and Free Bird, neither of which are favorites of mine). At least Don McLean put some feeling and heart into the song - Madonna sings it in the mechanical style which has been her norm in recent years. I listened to it on the radio once - now, my finger moves to the preset buttons on my car radio at just short of the speed of sound the second it comes on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why?","review":"What was Madonna thinking when she attempted to remake american Pie? She did it no justice at all, and she lost all of the meaning. She left out so much that it's not completed. She totally killed it, and I don't understand how people can accually like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"American pie part 3.","review":"Loved this cd single.I bought another( part 2) and hated it, so gave it away.This one was the best of the lot.The Richard Humpy Vission Radio Mix is brilliant, and when I listen to this song, I only listen to this version.It is great, and Madonna fans will love it.Good buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Day The Music Died","review":"This is the single worst cover I've ever heard. There isn't an ounce of soul or inspiration or anything but money-grubbing off of the fame of McClain's classic. Not worth the cost of the CD it's printed on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring - A waste of money","review":"The first version was ok not her best work. The next two versions of the song there is no singing at all. If you want to actually hear the song wait until it is released on her next album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Note the Facts:","review":"The people that give this song one-star ratings haven't really listened to the song, (or they don't know true pop music). Madonna took this song and made it into the best it's ever been. Her voice fits the song better than the other guy's voice and the song is more apropriate for a woman to sing. In my state, this song has been at number one for about six weeks straight!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A stunning interpretation","review":"From day one, I was in love with the way Madonna turned American Pie into a joyous piece of earcandy! Too bad the American public didn't latch onto it fully...It could have been a damn good summer anthem!The mixes here are very good and sound great. Anyone who doesn't at least tap their foot upon hearing them must surely be deaf or, at least, be a big heavy metal fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a very good cover","review":"1. American Pie (Victor Calderone Vocal Club Mix) - this mix is horrible, it just goes on and on untill the real vocals finally come in, and it dosn't last long. Bleh.2. American Pie (Victor Calderone Extended Vocal Club) - when I thought it couldn't get even worse, this longer version proved me wrong! This mix is practically the same and it's tacky and endless.3. American Pie (Richard \\"Humpty\\" Vission Visits Madonna) - not a real mix, lots of repetition in this one. Its okay, not good, but half-decent4. American Pie (Richard \\"Humpty\\" Vission Radio Mix) - VERY GOOD! There is no endless waiting for the vocals, it starts quick and sounds great. I love this one!5. American Pie (Album Version) - The music dosn't go very well with the vocals, I'll have to pass on this one. Just not very good.If you were to get this single, the only reason is for track #4. All of the others are horrible. Possibly her worst single to date."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product, Great Price","review":"Living in rural Maine, about the only place around here to get a hand mixer is WalMart. I was very unimpressed with the quality of the mixers that our store carried. I bought my last mixer there, and it didn't last a year. I have other Sunbeam products--an iron, a breadmaker--and have been pleased with their performance. I read a lot of the reviews here on Amazon before ordering my mixer. I agree with what most people say about it. It was well worth the price. It is a nice handling mixer, has good balance, and doesn't feel cheap. It has plenty of power to do anything that I need it for. I don't think I've even used the highest setting yet. The biggest test for any mixer I use is a big batch of chocolate chip cookies. This will work one up with ease. The only reason I hesitate to give it a five star rating is the fact that I haven't had it for a long time yet. If it lasts, it will be worth a 5."},{"rating":"1","title":"Out of Control Mixer","review":"I got this as a Christmas present and it was terrible! I tried to use it once and the slowest speed was WAY too fast, which made it very difficult to control. Food was flying everywhere. I think more of it ended up on the counters and wall than in the bowl to use! There was a turbo boost button on it and it wasn't turned on. I tried to adjust the speed and there didn't seem to be much difference between the speeds. It was just REALLY fast! I considered this product defective and returned it."},{"rating":"1","title":"too fast","review":"This mixer is very frustrating to use. As other reviews noted the lowest speed is just too fast. Go with a kitchenaid!"},{"rating":"1","title":"There is no low speed!","review":"I give this 2 stars, but that is for looks and durability ONLY. It sure is pretty and it sure is strong. But...The lowest setting is far too fast! We got this for a wedding shower gift and I absolutely hate it. There is no way to slow it down. Not only is it too fast, but there is barely any change between the lowest speed and the highest speed. Honestly, don't waste your money on this. Go with something else entirely. I'm buying a new one this weekend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good choice","review":"Where do I begin. I've lived with it for a year, and I'm moving on. There is no slow speed - so get ready to clean. No matter how deep the bowl you use, the batter will fly. The stand is a good idea, but in reality, rolling the cord under the stand is a hassle each and every time. And finally, the blades. They are nearly impossible to release. It takes monumental effort and actually hurts my fingers. My friend was my helper in the kitchen at Thanksgiving, and she too couldn't believe how difficult the release was. It mixes great! But there will be a mess, a hassle, and sore fingers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"I wish I could give this product a lower than one star review. The speed on this mixer is fast regardless of the setting. Food flies all over the kitchen even on the low setting. Do not buy this product, it is not an easy use and to much power for everyday mixing of food."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like to go \\"fast\\"","review":"There is no slow speed on this mixer. It is helpful that the mixer stands on its end so the mix can drip back into the bowl. It is lightweight and not much louder than any other hand mixer. This is a mixer I use quite frequently over the past few years and it works well and is easy to clean.I am still giving it four stars because most of the things I use it for I need the higher speeds. I have a stand mixer that I use for things that need to be beaten slowly. I would not recommend this mixer for anyone who only has one mixer since it combines everything at warp speed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too fast! Not usable.","review":"Even the slowest speed is way too fast. I tried it on mashed potatoes and later on a soup. In both cases, it sprayed all over. Totally unusable. It's hard to understand how Sunbeam could release this product in good conscience and why retailers carry it. Doesn't anybody test these things???"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Deal!","review":"I bought this for my mother-in-law for Christmas.

The incredible string band, pentangle, Bread, love and dreams comparisons are, in my opion, wishful thinking. This isn't due to Espers ability as song writers, but to their incessant use of annoying overdriven heavy metal type guitar everywhere. This ruins what is otherwise a nice album."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good","review":"Very Informative Book. The information is not in detailed I would liked, or the information is to brief.

This movie was a huge disappointment. It was so amateurish that the darker aspects seemed silly, and the ending that could have been poignantly tragic, seemed sordid and pointless. As a practing Catholic myself, I was curious to see what the Mexican Church found so scandalous about this movie. At the end of the movie, I was left thinking that philosophical differences with the Church should be explored, but sophmoric mudslinging might just deserve repression."},{"rating":"2","title":"temptation","review":"this is an important movie about the nature of temptation and the complications of living a double life..

But what a let-down! This movie is confused, disorganized, and sometimes just silly. It's a bad movie, plain and simple. Especially the way way it starts out with political intrigue and corruption within the catholic church, then suddenly becomes a dramitic love story! I found the villainous religious old bag character particularly cartoonish and out of place. But the most surprising is all the beaming reviews! But then, when people write \\"it will make you think\\", or finish their loving review by recommending \\"swimfan\\" and \\"lawn-mower man\\" you know there's something up...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excelente!","review":"The movie was a great a new gooooooool for Mexican cinema which continues to pump out thought provoking, well filmed movies while the \\"Behemoth of the North\\" continues to pump out its brain dulling fluff-o-dramas. You can read more from other commentaries, I would just add that I found the most intersting portrayel to be the \\"crazy\\" woman who practices her own brand of religion - she is the first to stone the young whistleblower, yet the first to know about the local parish corruption, she is the first to lead in prayer yet the first to steal money from the offering bowl....interesting symbolism of rural Mexican catholics."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you want to hear good blues...save your money.","review":"If you want to hear a good Blues CD, save your money. Go get some Charlie Musselwhite or James Cotton, those guys play the Blues. I don't know what this album is. It definitely doesn't know whether it wants to be pop, rock, R&B or Blues and succeeeds in being none of the above. Just a bunch of contrivances trying to be pop hits. Nothing real about any of them. I'd give it no stars if that were a choice. Ugh!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Get advice on how to surrender!","review":"I found this book to be nothing but an affirmation of the low status of men in divorce court/family court. We are second class citizens with no rights. In this book, there are no guidelines to navigate and shore-up your position. It basically tells you to bend over and take it. Your choices are how low you drop your pants and how far down you grab your ankles. It reminds me of the \\"Twilight-Zone\\" episode, \\"How to Serve Man\\". I already knew how skewed, against men, family courts are. I was hoping to find some good advice to level the playing field. Needless to say, I was extremely disappointed. Now I can add the author of this book to the same \\"take-my-money-list\\" that the current family court system and my ex-spouse grace."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"Large print, about 100 pages of written material. There are terms, appendix and other written matter to stretch the book out. The book has very small chapters and seems very cut and paste. It appears alot of repetition in the book. Sounds like Young had to enter into a poor first marriage and didn't get all the assets he hoped for so he is trying to profit off the book. Anyway, I wouldn't waste your money. I actually requested a refund and got my money back for the book and shipping and handling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Serious, realistic advice","review":"This book won't tell you what you want to hear but it tells you what you need to hear.

I recently discovered I had PCOS. I was prescribed metformin and told to follow a low GI diet. The book does a great job of explaining how and why a low GI diet should work for women with PCOS, but it does a poor job of explaining the actual diet. It makes it very confusing to follow, and although it gives a table of foods along with their GI, it is very vague about telling you what you should be eating. I followed the diet in the book the best that I could, and gained 5 pounds before the first week was over. Also, the recipes in the book were no help to me... each one of them had an ingredient that was either very exotic (lamb meat was one of them) or something that I had never heard of. They cannot realistically expect people to make these recipes on a regular basis. I recommend PCOS and your Fertility by Collette Harris. This was a much better and more helpful book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Need Answers?

This book may be a great starting point for people who have yet to do any research, but for those have, you will not receive any new information. The recipes are nice, but if I wanted recipes I would have bought a cook book! Not worth the money in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enlightening","review":"This is a wonderfully informational and helpful book that gives hope to PCOS sufferers. Before reading this book, I had no idea that so many of my symptoms were PCOS related. All I've ever been told by my doctors was to \\"lose weight\\" and then my PCOS would be cured and I would be able to conceive. The problems with this were two-fold: one, I was never able to lose a significant amount of weight with a lower caloric diet thanks to the PCOS itself, and two, the information was wrong -- PCOS can't be cured, only alleviated...information I was unaware of before. Now, after reading this book, I have all of the information I've been longing for, along with a plan to alleviate my symptoms and hope that I will be able to conceive. I have eaten according to the low g.i. plan for 2 weeks and have already lost 10 pounds! I highly recommend this book to all women who suffer from PCOS!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bundy Saxophone","review":"I bought a saxophone on Ebay right before buying this one and the experience was horrible (bad quality, over-priced shipping, etc).

By the way, Adderly played on the legendary \\"Kind Of Blue\\" album, the best selling jazz album ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never get tired of this one","review":"Whenever I need a lift, this is a good choice to provide one. This is also one of those CD's that, when I'm facing my music collection and not sure what I'm in the mood for, this is one of my \\"default\\" CD's. (The others areJazz in SilhouetteandBilly Taylor Trio.) You just can't go wrong when Miles Davis is involved, and Adderley brings a whole new dimension to the definition of a small horn section. Blakey's unmistakeable ferocity in driving the tunes provides a great backbone for the other musicians to build on, and each listening brings its own indescribable pleasure. I would say this is a CD that should be added to the collection of any serious jazz fan, and it would probably be a good choice for someone looking to broaden a non-jazz oriented music collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Album is Somethin' Else, period","review":"If anyone ever wanted to know what Julian Cannonball Adderly is all about, go no further than track one of this album. He leaves it all on the table on Autumn Leaves. His solo there is so intense and emotion filled that it leaves you breathless.Miles takes a back seat to Cannonball, but not because its Cannonball's gig, but because Cannonball's playing has no end to its emotional depth. It is a cliché to say it, but it is simply something else, period. And Hank Jones piano playing cannot be improved upon. It is exquisitely precise and the chords he drops makes the spine tingle. This is a good album, period.Fifty stars"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic performance and audiophile grade remaster","review":"This remaster is a first rate edition of a classic album. Although Cannonball Adderly is the leader in this performance, the star is clearly Miles Davis.

Essential, accessible desert-island jazz."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic","review":"This album is a jazz classic and deservedly so. Only the title track lags a bit, but the others all soar. \\"Autumn Leaves\\" is a gem, and Cannonball's feature on \\"Dancing in the Dark\\" is magnificent: I've listened to that track at least a thousand times over the years, and everytime it moves me.

I have some very well mastered \\"MONO\\" recordings but this is not one of them.Clearly feel cheated on this one, as I have to buy the original Blue Note release.Please do not buy into the hype about 24 bit analog to digital transfer because the results are borderline amateurish, like someone was messing around with their laptop software.This is not the only landmark recording RVG has ruined.

Cannonball often takes a side role-even as a leader-to the playing of others, specifically Miles Davis, yet the album has a warmth and atmosphere that are fully his. 'Autumn Leaves' is a stunner-beautiful and long with great solo work by all. 'Love for sale' is also very catchy-you will probably recognize the melody when you hear it. I think the last track is supposed to be called 'Rangoon' but I'm not positive-it is 'Bangoon' on the back of the jewel case. A great introduction to Adderley's work. Highly Recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"good music, bad transfer","review":"4 stars for the music: it sounds like Davis' first quintet on the Prestige label - very good but not great. The reason for the single star is the 1998 transfer is awful: the treble is boosted far too high, with the result that Davis (and sometimes Adderley, too) sounds shrill above the stave, and the piano accompaniment is lost in the background. I suspect RVG was trying to give Miles the \\"Blue Note sound\\", but Miles isn't Lee Morgan (and I love Lee) and doesn't fit the mold. He's too introspective, his sound more diffuse than bright.Blue Note needs to remaster this title to restore Miles to his rightful self."},{"rating":"1","title":"BenQ support","review":"We purchased a BenQ PB 6100.

No mention is made of Jimmy Stewarts home at 918 Roxbury Drive where he and his wife Gloria lived for 45 years until his death in 1989. Elizabeth Taylor is cited as living at Nancy Sinatra (the mother's) former home at 700 Nimes Road in Bel Air. The Sinatra pad was only a small modern house. The bulk of Elizabeth Taylor's estate is on the several acre 688 Nimes Road property originally belonging to Warner Baxter and later to Jack Ryan, designer of the Barbie doll.

There are small pictures of the star and the home.The book focuses a lot on really old movie stars, including many from the silent era. The few contemporary stars in the book rarely have their current homes listed--it may be an apartment they stayed in 20 years ago or a first home they purchased before they made it big.A map would also help. For those not familiar with L.A., we have no idea where these houses are in relation to anything else.Compared to other guides that are out, this is a pretty good book but dated.

Before plugging the antenna in my 7200 was tracking five or six satellites and the bars were 1/3 to 1/2 height. Accuracy was reported as 23 feet. As soon as I hooked the antenna up the bars went to nearly full height and I was tracking more satellites. And...accuracy went to 7 feet...!!! I have read some reviews that claim Gilsson antennas are cheaply made, but that is not the case with the one I received. It is a very sturdy-feeling device and boy does it work! Highly recommended..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fixed my Garmin Nuvi !!!","review":"Before I ordered this low profile GPS antenna, my Garmin Nuvi 680 was having serious problems acquiring a signal; my signal strength alternated between nothing and one bar. The problem started a little over 2 years after I purchased the GPS device and had gone on for a couple weeks. I was worried I'd have to shell out a bunch of money for a new GPS. First, I decided to look at an external antenna and this one received some great reviews.When I received the external GPS antenna, I noticed it had a nice, long cord. This didn't matter much to me, as I keep my GPS on the dashboard with a friction mount, but it's a nice feature. Attaching the antenna was as simple as screwing in the gold plated connector. Ever since, my signal has been at the strongest levels and accuracy seems to have improved too. If you aren't receiving a strong signal on your Garmin, I can't recommend this antenna high enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent, Low-Priced Alternative to Garmin's Auxiliary Antenna","review":"The title really says it all. I have my Nuvi 750 positioned low on my center console, where its satellite reception was \\"just okay.\\" I simply ran the antenna's cord under my dash and positioned the antenna on the dashboard near the front edge of the windshield. I now receive a high strength signal from all available satellites, resulting in greater accuracy and much faster startup (the Nuvi \\"acquires\\" the satellites easily within a few seconds, usually before I've pulled out of my garage).An excellent product, well worth the cost."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Device.","review":"This GPS receiver worked great. It very quickly gets a GPS lock.

They cover similar territory, but Nettle packs more information into fewer pages and conveys it with far greater precision."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lessons from History","review":"This book is fatally flawed. Layard's notion that you can create happiness by removing risk from society is absurd. Risk and challenge are what keep us alive. Without it, we become nothing more than drones. Instead of spending the time on this book, readers would do well to read Ayn Rand's account in her first novel, \\"We the Living,\\" of what happens when people try to do just what Layard proposes in his book. \\"We the Living\\" is Rand's profound personal account of the swift and complete demise of her country and its people through the acceptance of the collectivist philosophies that Layard pushes in his book. Living in Soviet Russia just after the 1917 Revolution, Rand lived with all the socialism that \\"Happiness: Lessons from a new Science\\" claims is the only way, and grew to hate it all with such distate that she spent the rest of her life trying to abolish it. Her book alone is reason enough not to read this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent book integrating a wide range of data","review":"As a non-American it is astonishing to read the distortions of Layard's argument presented in several of the reviews of this book, distortions suggesting that many Americans view any innovative thoughts on government policy and taxation as \\"communism\\". Layard shows that unfettered economic growth and scientific change has led to not just rising incomes but to social breakdown in the form of increased divorce rates, crime and alcoholism. These things make people unhappy!! Poor mental health makes people more unhappy than just about anything.Critics of this book should themselves attempt to answer the question, why, above a certain level, do rising incomes not increase happiness rather than rant on about its \\"communistic\\" ideas."},{"rating":"1","title":"A nice airport book","review":"While the ideas in the book are interesting and I happen to agree with many of them, the presentation clearly lacks rigor. The evidence behind the rationales is presented in a poor way, which makes conclusions appear weaker. Read this book if you have a few hours to spend on a plane, you will enjoy it. But if you are looking for a book that makes a convincing case for new measures of progress, this one is not for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book everyone should read","review":"I purchased this book for a friend but ended up keeping it for myself and getting her another copy.

He uses this research to advocate governmental management of happiness, which is the primary theme of the book. Whether or not you agree with that idea, this book's flawed logic and rambiling prose is unilkley to convince anyone either way.Layard proposes several policies intended to increase happiness including prohibition of vice, increased taxation, redistribution of wealth, and general intervention in the economy. Naturally, his authoritarian proposals for collective happiness largley ignore individual rights and freedom. They also ignore the fact that similar policies have failed when attempted by governments throughout history.What is clear is that if the department of happiness comes to be, the central planner's idea of happiness won't be mine, and it won't be yours either."},{"rating":"1","title":"A clouded affair.","review":"I would like to say that I tore through this book at a rate of knots and left fully satisfied. I hate to discover that halfway through a book it is becoming a chore to read but that is exactly how I found this book. Although it does have moments that will no doubt allow you leave to pause for thought, generally it is a tough read that the author has obviously tried hard to complicate regarding issues where motives were actually very simple. Maybe he was looking to read between the lines for deeper issues but I don't believe that they existed. If this were a school report card it would have \\"could do better\\" written all over it.

The book gives a fair attempt at tellingthe band's story, but Wise's interjections are too often,and leave the reader wondering if it's a biography or asynopsis of alternative rock. As one of the biggest rockbands in the world today, the Pumpkins deserve a more in-depth study of their music, and the chemistry between theband. This book offers a good beginning, but leaves fansclamoring for more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well...","review":"Actually I reviewed this book after I bought it, but the review never appeared. Maybe it was too cutting, or maybe it sounded like I was against the author too much. Anyway, only because there aren\`t many books available on the Smashing Pumpkins, is this book worth buying. If you have a few spare bucks and you want to know the basics about the band, sure buy the book. I didn\`t know some basics, so that\`s why I bought it, but you could probably get the basics from good radio programmes like those on CFNY in Toronto. It also has some pictures that you may have not seen before. It\`s too bad that someone hasn\`t written a proper book about the band. Well, I\`m busy, so I guess I can\`t.

This was my first experience at reading a Mary Daheim book but, certainly not my last. It was a riotious read that kept me guessing to the very end (and then I was wrong about who did what to whom). Judith and Renie may not have the most conventional methods of getting to the bottom of the case, however, they have the brains plus pure dumb luck on their side.

I think the material tends to cause good friction with the material of my sofa which also helps. I do not know how this would work on a smaller sofa arm or on slicker material such as leather.I wished that there were other colour choices available.

He does not tell her he is one, which I thought went on way to long for interest, but after admitting their feeling for each other, she is told of his rank by his friends, Blake and Caroline (from How to Marry a Heiress). Elizabeth than refuses to talk to James - for a 100 pages!!!!! James's friends were not friends at all and were busy buddies, really, and not very endearing. In the end, she should have realized her stubborness was rather drastic and apoligized, not the other way around. Why was no one trying to talk sense into Elizabeth? I was so disappointed to see the return of Caroline and Blake in such a shabby format."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful...","review":"Other reviewers said the book was delightful, funny, laugh out loud. They must have been reading a different book. Enough reviewers have already given the plot. I will only say that the romance needed real help. The books opening had lots of promise but the juvenile behavior of Elizabeth for the last 100 or so pages was absurd. James should have gone off to London to meet someone else. I agree that it was crazy and cruel of Elizabeth to treat James the way she did, and his friends too. What was the point? Are we, the reader, supposed to think better of Elizabeth - that she was smart or something? That fateful word of regency authors is \\"pluky\\". Her little sister was \\"pluky\\", Elizabeth, however, was a horror. I have found with other Julia Quinn books she tries to be too cute, and always draws the endings out too long. She is off my reading list now..."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's all the fuss?","review":"I usually like Julia Quinn's work, but How to Marry a Marquis was a huge disappointment. To tell the truth, I couldn't even finish it. The basic problem was that the conflict between the romantic leads was unbelievable. One reviewer called her reaction to the revelation of his true identity \\"psychotic\\", and I think that's pretty close to the mark. Why she makes the assumptions she does and takes offense to the degree she does is beyond me. I just couldn't care about her hurt feelings; it seemed like junior high hysteria.

Stand up straight\\" - His boxing instructions were entertaining as well. Her siblings were also very fun. I hope to read about them in the future.

Deserving his own book, Julia Quinn places James in a country setting, coming to the aid of an elderly relative who is in a bit of a quandary. Elizabeth is her paid companion, and the sparks fly.

The blackmail in the story never amounted to much and the only really interesting character was Lady Danbury. How to Marry A Marquis is a disappointment.

The dialog between all the characters was snappy and really kept me interested. The book worked so well for me because of the balance of humor and drama. When she discovered his secret and the two had a huge fight I cried for pages!! I sure hope Ms. Quinn plans to write more about the Hotchkiss family, especially Susan. Also, I liked having Blake and Caroline from TCAH appear in this book and hope to hear from them and James and Elizabeth again. Thanks for a great read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Irritating","review":"While I enjoyed Ms. Quinn's light-hearted approach to her theme, and I found much of her humor witty and engaging, I did not like the book. I thought her fiesty heroine a complete cliche. I made my way through most of the book with no extreme quibbles, but I fairly itched with irritation when Elizabeth discovered James's true identity. Her indignation was irrational and went on and on ad insufferabiliam. Also, I wish someone would explain to Ms. Quinn and her copy editor the difference in usage between \\"lie\\" and \\"lay.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Absurd beyond words...","review":"I enjoyed the book until Elizabeth discovers the real identity of James then the book become absolutely absurd. Her reaction to his real identiy borders on psychotic. While I was pleased to see Blake and Caroline enter into the story, their treatment of their friend, James, was horrible. Why? Blake becomes a parady of a man who lives in Carolin'e pocket. The story totally lost me here and I struggled to finish the book. Of course James and Elizabeth get together in the end but it took about 100 pages of stupidity from Elizabeth to get real. If I was James, I would have gone back to London and forget about her and his so-called friends. Boy, was this book ridiculous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Merely Okay","review":"It's a common story line, done better before.

Lots of witty humor balanced with poignant tenderness between James and Elizabeth. Quinn is one of the best in the genre!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Typically, I enjoy a nice, simple Julia Quinn novel. How to Marry a Marquis, however, was a disappointment. The plot was nearly nonexistent and I found my attention wandering through much of the book, skipping ahead in a fruitless endeavor to find a part that was more interesting than the last. The ending, particularly Elizabeth's overdone fury over the Marquis's deception bordered on absurd. I find little to recommend this book save the fact that it is a regency romance with the typical happy ending. Save your money and choose another of Quinn's books."},{"rating":"2","title":"funny, quirky & entertaining","review":"I loved the plot. the characters were endearing and dialogue between Elizabeth and James is interesting and unique. You never quite know where a scene will end up. blake and Caroline from To Catch an Heiress make an appearance towards the end of the novel, which adds another hilarious dimension to the dialogue. I wish there were more books in this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Light and funny. A perfect weekend read!","review":"This book is delightful. Expectation is important, however, and many readers of historicals want a drama rather than a comedy. (Mary Jo Putney's One Perfect Rose is an example of drama HR). This book is a comedy and like most comedies, does deal with emotional issues, but comes at them from the side. Readers of drama (I am one) will enjoy this book if they know what to expect. The hero James is lovable, more interested in a real woman than the image falsely put forth to lure men. The heroine, Elizabeth, is spunky and although she's in a tight spot, works hard to get herself out. (I hate wimpy heroines; if you do too, you will like Elizabeth). This book made me laugh out loud to the point where I started getting funny looks from people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing downer from a usually capable Quinn","review":"For years, Julia Quinn was the pinnacle of Regency romance writing for me, but now that I've discovered Eloisa James, I guess I'm holding Julia to a higher standard, and How To Marry A Marquis just doesn't cut it. Aside from Lady Danbury, and our old friends Blake and Caroline, none of the characters held my attention or were very absorbing; I just didn't want to keep reading (although I did), which is a first for any of Ms. Quinn's previous works, which I've devoured (I think I read all 8 books of the Bridgerton series in about 10 days!). I'd save your money and check this one out of the library, or borrow it from a friend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Apparently Shakespeare enjoyed quoting Tennyson...who knew?","review":"A lot of the logic of this book doesn't make much sense to me...but I was willing to let that go, because romance novels are rarely logical, which is part of the fun. Even the lack of character development and the shabby use of some ridiculous book to tie everything together was acceptable.However, she lost me with the factual errors, the most glaring of which was when she attributed Tennyson's famous \\"Tis better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all\\" quote to the Bard. Call me a stickler, but if you don't have enough knowledge to give credit to the right people (especially when \\"the right people\\" did not coin this statment until about 35 years AFTER this story takes place), then make sure your editor does. Otherwise, the entire book comes across as ignorant and poorly written."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Sleeper not a Keeper","review":"I was really bored with this book.

I read The Duke and I and it was much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow - Awful!","review":"I am really at an impass as to why so many seemed to enjoy reading this story. Ms. Quinn seemed to enjoy making the man a picture of stupidity. I won't go into the plot - it has been done to death already. But if you are a romance reader who enjoys smart women and men, this is not for you. Again, as another reader pointed out, the last 100 pages were sooooooooooo bad I was floored anyone could like this book. Elizabeth treats James with such disdain that I too hoped he would move on. Also, his so called friends, Caroline and James, were hardly that. They too seemed to take great pleasure out of the absurd situation with James and Elizabeth. Take a pass on this story for romance it is not. No woman I know would behave the way Elizabeth did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clint Eastwood influence","review":"The Quick and the Undead obviously has an influence from the classic Clint Eastwood western movies of the 1960's.

But the overall execution of the story simply fell flat on its decaying face.It felt as if the acting was being done by high school students. High school students with no talent that is. The actors were wooden and lacked any interest in their characters.I didn't care much for the special effects, but I did like the concept of the dead moving at varying rates of speed depending on their stage of decay.If they had taken this good concept and, instead of placing it in a retro-future western shoot'em up, placed it in the actual wild west of the 1800's than maybe they could have pulled it off...

Dwells on alcohol-related accidents, even though 1995 and 1996 accident statistics show only one (1) fatality and two accidents related to alcohol during the two years. The book places blame on the FAA, FBOs, ATC for not running a police state and blames everyone by the pilot. (Of course the pilots involved in accidents all liberally assigned blame elsewhere too.)

Also, he seems to forget that all pilots are required to know information in the Federal Aviation Regulations and the Airman's Information Manual.

Almost every cliche that has become fodder for Davis impersonators (from Carol Burnett to Charles Pierce) are in this one...the swagger, the clipped speech, the cigarette holder and chronic/constant puffing, the one-line jabs and popping eyes. This one is elevated from mere melodrama by an admirable supporting cast and top notch production values. But if the genre isn't your cuppa, it will be a long 104 minutes.This DVD print is wonderful. Crystal clear...looks and sounds terrific and the real reason to include this one in your library of classics.

For a time Judy believes that she's been cured, a myth supported by her doctor (George Brent)who is starting to fall in love with her. Cameos by Ronald Reagan and Humphrey Bogart are welcomed inclusions that enhance the film's dramatic appeal.Unfortunately, Warner acquired this title from a tired, worn print in the MGM library. The print is full of grain, chips, scratches, inconsistant shadow and contrast delineation and digital grit. There are several occasions where the entire image within the frame wobbles up and down, due to worn out sprocket holes. The visual experience during such instances is akin to riding a canoe through choppy seas. The audio is strident and scratchy. Overall this is a disappointing visual experience and one that Warner needs to rectify soon, before we lose this great classic forever to the ravages of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is Bette Davis's Best","review":"Bette Davis is at her tear jerking best in this one.If your a George Brent fan, you will be a happy movie going person too.

She has great friends like Ann King (Geraldine Fitzgerald), a smitten gentleman friend (Ronald Reagan), and a bevy of horses and her own stablehand (Humphrey Bogart). That all changed when her eyesight begins to fail. Reluctantly, she goes to a doctor (George Brent) and is told that she must undergo and opperation. She believes it has been a success, but Dr. Steele knows that she has a short time to live. The problem is, he has fallen in love with her, so in order to protect her, he decides to let her believe everything is okay.The acting in this film is superb. Davis constantly performs and always knows how to draw emotion from the audience. Fitzerald is also remarkable, a little known talent. There are several times when Max Steiner's music and the dramatic events turn the film into a high class melodrama, but the emotional intensity makes it seem more realistic than campy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bette Davis wonderful is classic weepie","review":"With the release of such classics as \\"The Wizard of Oz,\\" \\"Gone with the Wind,\\" and \\"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,\\" \\"Dark Victory\\" certainly backs up the argument that 1939 was the greatest year in motion pictures. 1939 also proved to be the greatest year in the career of America's greatest screen actress, Miss Bette Davis. \\"Dark Victory\\" is certainly the highlight of the four films released starring Davis. If you think about it, the story is very simple. It is no more than a tale of a well-to-do socialite who contracts a disease and dies. Nothing special, and you would think it sounds rather uninteresting. However with both great direction and a superb cast, \\"Dark Victory\\" ranks as one of the greatest tear-jerkers ever put on screen.

While this isn't near anything the Roses did, it is still a solid, enjoyable album. The rest of the band is very good, too, in my opinion. The singer has a good voice that fits the music, the bass player and drummer are both very good (I am surprised to read the reviews slagging off the rhythm section!) and Squire is Squire. While there aren't as many guitar solos from him as I'd like, his guitar work is still awesome. The best songs are I Want You To Know, 1999, Standing On Your Head, and the jaw-dropping Love is the Law. A really good album...if you're a fan of the Stone Roses or just good British guitar rock in general, check this out."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very poor album.","review":"This band was formed by John Squire, ex-guitarist with Manchester band Stone Roses. Anyone familiar with Squire's superb work on the Roses' albums will be thoroughly disappointed with this weak effort. The songs have little or no individuality or quality, descending into bland, soulless sub-rock territory. Squire should know better. His guitar-playing is the one decent thing about this record but that is no reason to buy it. If you don't have the Stone Roses debut album, get that instead.

As a Stone Roses fan I naturally had to buy this album, but as a music fan I wish I hadn't. With the exception of \\"Love is the Law\\" none of the songs Squire wrote appealed to me- too neat and tidy, verse-chorus-bridge; almost like made to order parcels! The singer in the band, a guy Squire hired after hearing sing on a street in Oxford, wrote three of the better songs on the album and this kinda saves it. John Squire is an amazing guitarist but this album sounded like he was going through the motions and the rather flat bass/drum backing did'nt help either.If you want to buy something like the Stone Roses buy Ian Brown's \\"Unfinished Monkey Business\\". It appears that without this guy Squire is set for obscurity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Johnny Squire shows us he can be mortal...","review":"Imagine Jimmy Hendrix stopping in to play with the local bar band, and not wanting to outshine them. That is Do It Yourself. Johnny Squire perhaps our generation's version of Clapton-Hendrix-Page playing to the level of mere mortals. Not willing to distance himself like the Demi-God he is, satisfied with playing to their level. The album overall is a nice effort, good rock-n-roll songs and Johnny shows us he can still write some very good tunes. But none of them feature the near climatical efforts of your typical Roses tunes. Hence a good album but not a great one. I for one just kept wanting Chris Helme to shut up for a minute so I could hear John's lovely licks, alas not on this album but maybe on the next."},{"rating":"1","title":"a let-down of an album","review":"If you are a fan of the Stone Roses or John Squire's guitar playing, do not buy this album. It will only disappoint you. Squire's great guitar skills do not show themselves, the lyrics are weak, the bass playing and drumming aren't very good. I think that \\"Do It Yourself\\" buried John's career. This album is not to be compared with other, superior brit-rock albums by artists like Radiohead, Candyskins, Oasis, etc. If you're a Stone Roses fan that just can't get enough, and are following their solo careers, buy either one or both of Ian Brown's albums. They are much better and of course the vocals will remind you of the Roses. I think I was being quite generous by giving \\"Do It Yourself\\" 2 stars. It's a shame, because John was so great with the Stone Roses, its hard to believe he has sunk to this level."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pauling's Life?","review":"The Hager book is not bad at all, though I would not rank it above the Serafini book. Probably the motivation for saying this is that there is less of Pauling's science in the Serafini book and more in Hager's book. However, many reviewers miss the point that the purpose of a biography is to delve into a subject's life and personality -- not the details of his work. And, in any case, Pauling stopped doing any serious science before the 60's began and in fact left Caltech near the beginning of that decade, thereafter devoting his life mainly to silly peace crusades, vitamin C hokum and such things. So in this respect the Serafini book is actually more in proportion to Pauling's serious work in science and does a fairly good job. In this respect also, the Goertzel book in my view also does well, although the latter is a bit too \\"psychoanalytical\\" for my taste ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Attractive and does the job","review":"This heat lamp is perfect for my small bathroom.

Nicholas Cage is brilliant as the phobia-ridden Roy but after a while his facial tics and mannerisms become distracting. The camera angles with constant \\"thru the window\\" shots are annoying and unecessary. There are some rather confusing scenes towards the end especially between Roy and his ex-wife.

His quirkiness and his portrayal of offbeat characters are intriguing. He takes offbeat to a mesmerizing level in Matchstick Men. He plays an obsessive compulsive conman so well, you're not sure whether to slap him or cradle him and say \\"everything's gonna be all right.\\" Regardless, he keeps you glued to the set, waiting to see if he'll snap out of his chain-smoking, eye-twitching, panic-attacking ways or hopelessly land himself in a padded white room.The mood of the movie restlessly parallels Cage's character. It's edgy and stays on a bite-your-nails course until the end. A twist at the end left me shaking my head as if I hadn't seen it coming. The unfolding plot, however, foreshadows some unknown turn, but I wasn't expecting that twist.This is an entertaining movie and well done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than I thought it would be","review":"I was lucky, and got into a screening of Matchstick Men, and I was surprised. After being let down by the past few Ridley Scott, and Nic Cage films, I wasn't really expecting anything that great.The movie is clever though. It's not laugh out loud funny or anything; the humor is subtle. Never dull, and always keeps you watching closely.So it's not the best film of the year, but it's definitely up towards the top, especially this year, where the comedic films just haven't been up to par."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pros and Cons","review":"Plus side:1. Another highly entertaining, quirky performance from Nicholas Cage.2. Funny, at times hilarious dialog.3. Great chemistry between Cage and Alison Lohman, who also delivers a nuts-on performance.4. Short, snappy scenes that are well directed and edited.Negative side:1. Plot twists at the end abruptly change a story about relationships into a story about plot twists.2. Shiela Kelley's character, the grocery check-out clerk, had such a limited role she might as well not have been there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great movie until that horrible twist","review":"This is one of those movies that needed to just play it straight. The acting was great and the concept, sans twist, was great. But this movie, like many others, tried to be too clever for its own good. Granted this movie came out before M Night Shamalambadingdong was appointed his Hack status, but in general movie creators need to take him as an example when making movies. You dont have to put twist in everything. Sometimes just let the drama play. Let the movie be about characters and interactions, don't be too plotty. Because after a while you get potty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another weekend, another Nicholas Cage movie","review":"Ridley scott is a brilliant director and Nicholas Cage has a firm grasp on the art of acting. Unfortunately even all that skill and heart can't save Matchstick Men. First of all it about conmen, so right from the get go its oh ready riddled with cliches. Cage plays a conman who finds his heart after he realizes he has a daughter, so he has an epiphany. Despite the contrived plot Cage brings real charisma to the role, picking up where he left off with Adaptation. The movie sucks but Cage makes it worth seeing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Diassapointed film","review":"Ridley Scott is one of the top directors in the world. That's undeniable , but what happened with this one?The plot is boring , even ridiculous . Nicolas Cage is perfect in his role but the script goes to nowhere . This film seems inspirated for House of games and a moral lesson for fathers. And the film remains in the middle of the road.I couldn't believe this film carried the signature of Ridley Scott.A minor movie for a status director . As you see the marriage can not result in a happy ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"really incredible","review":"nicholas cage is at his best. and wow, the girl, is pretty good too. at first i thought that it would be similar to AS GOOD AS IT GETS (obsessive compulive man finds himself through personal relationships), but it turned out to be truly original and hysterically funny. and the twist at the end is priceless."},{"rating":"2","title":"ALEXS CAPSULE MOVIE REVIEWS","review":"Highlights: Nic Cage's performance; witty script; poignant themes; assured direction.Lowpoints: Slight slips into sentimentality; forgettable.Conclusion: 'Matchstick Men' is a well made con film/family drama/comedy, supplemented by an intelligent script, R. Scott's elegant direction, and a quirky protagonist. There is almost no 'ham' (apart from where the filmmakers just couldn't help pull the 'tear-strings' a little bit), which is a common expectation in a Hollywood parent/offspring relationship exploitation. The film excites, amuses, and is even touching due to the subdued ending. Despite its' effective qualities though, it still belonges to a genre of forgettable features."},{"rating":"1","title":"Matchstick Men","review":"Wow it was not at all what I expected. I was thinking it was full of action and it was not. If you are a Nickolas Cage fan you might like this film but other an that it was not interesting for me any way. Came fast and great conditions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story, great cast, great everything!","review":"I absolutley love this movie with all of my heart. Nic Cage, for me, is hit or miss, but in this quirky tale he is all hit! The acting by all is superb; Sam Rockwell is amazing and I am suprized that he is not one of our current leading men. I highly suggest picking up this flick and I assure you, you will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Transparent Plot","review":"Matchstick Men falls well short of being a good movie. The plot is utterly transparent and there are no surprises. Maybe fifteen mintutes into the movie you will figure out the entire plot, and then you will cease to care about the characters. With the illusion shattered, you will quickly loose interest. The whole movie you hope that it isn't so, but it is. There is a little redemtive arc at the end for Cage's character, but this still leaves the audience feeling empty and unfulfilled. I would only suggest watching this movie if you see it on cable and there is nothing else on, otherwise do not bother buying or renting it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring. Dull.","review":"Nicolas Cage plays an obsessive-compulsive con-man in this extremely tedious film. His life is turned upside down when he learns he has a daughter. That makes him reassess his life and values.That's all you need to know because this movie is as slow as it is uninteresting. The daughter brings almost no energy to this plot and about 90 minutes passes before anything even remotely interesting happens. I'm getting bored just trying to write about this dog of a film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!!!","review":"It started off a little slowly, but when it picked up speed, it was fabulous!!!!!I loved the near-ending....the big twist, when the plot unfolds!!!

I'm writing this review just moments after having experienced what is one of the greatest films I've seen in years. You know that feeling of absolute amazement, that energetic surge you get when you're so jazzed up you can't believe what you just saw?! This movie is that impressive. In every way Matchstick Men is an out-and-out masterpiece that will leave you stunned and incredulous. It truly is the sum of some very talented parts.When I think of my favorite films of all time -Fight Club, Vanilla Sky, Unbreakable, The Butterfly Effect, etc.- the one quality that always stands out is the element of surprise. So if you dare to face the unpredictable, Matchstick Men delivers!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumb","review":"Are you kidding me - 4 stars????? This tells me that the rest of America - all youz guys - are getting real dumb. You should be ashamed to rate this bomb a 4 star movie. How annoying was the lead actress?

I will have a great moment...THE END !What the hell ! Much talent for so little flick ! It's so predictable.I knew what it will happen as soon as he met his daughter.It's disappointing and Cage is wasting his time and talent.I easily understand why he chose to be involved in ADAPTATION but this time,there is absolutely no reason.There is nothing to keep in mind.It's EMPTY.The twist has been seen in better movies and the end is simply kind of \\"I KNEW IT\\" It's not because they waste their time that you also have to.Give up !

Plus people were commenting on how much they liked the wig."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!","review":"I can't believe they pass this off as a \\"product\\". This video looks and sounds like it was made in a garage. There is absolutely no \\"depth\\" to this video. Honestly, I can't believe they sell this - for 25 bucks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly disappointing - I'd skip it.","review":"Having read rave reviews of Rachel Ray's cook books, I had high expectations. When I got the book and scanned the table of contents, I was already a little leery - many of the recipes seemed like things for which you'd barely need a recipe and the range of foods was really limiting. Plus it's organized by odd types like \\"make your own take out\\" - so I needed to scan individual recipes to find what to do with the chicken in my refridgerator.The first meal was mostly thrown out. My husband and I ate small amounts, but supplemented with other things. The leftovers went in the garbage. My kids had peanut butter sandwiches - so much for kid-friendly.There are much better cook it in a hour or less cookbooks and I strongly recommend AGAINST this one. I actually bought two online and I'm planning on returning the one I haven't used."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting reading and do-able, but on-hand items aren't common","review":"This cookbook definitely makes for good reading; it's done in a conversational style like her show is. Kind of humorous when they have to include a section about what EVOO is and what it means to let food \\"hang out\\".My main criticism is that you have to look at the recipes first, decide what you want to make & purchase the items for it. Apparently, she and I do not keep the same items on hand in the pantry. And, the number of ingredients she uses can be daunting; when I think of quick meals, I don't think of using a dozen items to make them with!Still, I've found the book inspirational; even though I haven't got the required items, it's made me experiment with what I do have on hand."},{"rating":"2","title":"buy it","review":"My husband bought me this book for mothers day after we had been watching Rachel for about a month or so. At first I thought she was a dork, but after watching the first episode and then making the meal the following day, I was (and still am)hooked. I have just placed an order for three more so that I can give then to several friends, as well as ordering her other books.If you've happened along this book by chance, and have no previous knowlegde of Rachel Ray or her show, I cannot express this enough. Buy it!. But I have to go now, 30 Minute Meals is on in 5 minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"If its too good to be true.....","review":"Well you know the rest. Aside from her brash repetative demeanor her cooking has a lot to be desired. These meals CANNOT be done in 30 minutes, unless that is if you want everything half cooked. The book makes false promises and does not deliver. There are also NO PICTURES and NO INDEX and the recipes are very confusing..most of them deriving from an original Master recipe and then just changing one or two things. If you want good food and a good cook book don't buy into the hype and don't buy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"bottom line: yuch-o","review":"The concept was good, and the show was catchy, but the hype was waaaay better than the product. Tried several recipes from this collection, and none were a hit with my family. Our verdict - YUCH-O!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rachel has no formal chef training and it shows;","review":"Rachel Rays personality is her greatest asset. She has no formal chef training and most of her recipes are very basic and somewhat bland. She seems like a fun person, and in todays television rich society, at times if your liked, it masks a lot of imperfections.Her cookbooks are always somewhat unorganized due to the lack of quality indexes and pictures. Her recipes are also hit and miss; I think her sauces are bad at times, but sometimes she has a great idea for a simple appetizer or pasta. Again, very basic cooking but with her personality, she could pretty much sell anything. I think she'll continue to grow though and hopefully the food network won't ruin her.She will never be an all-star chef but she's a good spokesperson for simple dishes, and hopefully her books will improve as she does; I think both will get better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another flavor-of-the-month chef","review":"A very average collection of recipes from the Food Network star-of-the-month Rachael Ray. You've seen these recipes before in different forms in hundreds of other cookbooks. Skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Book is a real miss","review":"Rachael Ray has no talent as an author or a cook. This book is full of recipes that you would find in any home ec course in high school. I returned it as quickly as I could."},{"rating":"1","title":"no thank you","review":"I can't stand everything about Rachael Ray. She's obnoxious, loud and fake. She pretends to eat food on television and acts like it's the most delicious thing she's ever tasted. I think you need to eat more than a bean to determine the level of deliciousness, Rachael. And I don't think you can determine deliciousness when someone else has removed the food for you. On one episode my mom was watching, she went to take a bite of her muffin, but the camera angle showed that the bite had been taken out for her! She's not a real chef, and she's a mediocre cook.If I have to hear the word 'yummo' or 'delish' one more time... I might scream myself to death."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not-Delish","review":"Not only can the meals in this book not, in fact, be prepared in 30 minutes, they are also not yum-yum. Once, while watching her show, I noticed that she placed some potatoes in the microwave at 18:01. Then, at 18:08, she took the potatoes out of the microwave and claimed they were in there for 12 minutues. This sounds more like 34 minute meals to me! Also, 40 dollars a day is bogus...you cannot sleep through breakfast and trade your hat in for a meal and then claim it is 40.D.A.D.- 40 Dollars a Day. I do not like the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"E.V.O.O Oh No.No.No.","review":"Rachel Ray has to be the most annoying person on cable television, if not, at least in the top 10 - right behind Bill O'Reilly, Suze Oreman, and that Oxy/Orange Clean fool.Yes, some of her recipes may be enticing but who can stand to watch her for 30 minutes with her \\"delish\\" and her \\"evoo\\" and her \\"MMMHHHMMMmmmmHHHMMMHHHHhhmmmm\\" as she stuffs her mouth with her own creations. I surely can't. And WAY too much hand movement - I don't care if she is Italian. No excuse. Kill the stereotypes.So, in summary - mediocre recipes and annoyance at a blistering level - forces me to give Ms. ...D.A.D a single star (actually, a single star is the lowest rating amazon.com allows). But at least with this cookbook you don't have to hear her mouth. Praise the Gods."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Hastily thrown together book","review":"I've heard a lot about MS. Ray's show on the Food Network, so I thought this book might be an interesting addition to my library. I was wrong. Unfortunately I didn't scan the book before buying it, or else it would still be on the shelf. Most of my gripes have been covered now that I have read them. Un organized, no index, and to be honest, uninspiring recepies. 30 minute meals? I don't think so given the time it takes to find what's needed to create a meal, most of them seem to be the kind that were passed down by word of mouth, and not researched. Is MS. Ray a chef? I don't think so, and am not sure what her credentials actually are.So I can't recommend it, unless your a die hard fan of her and want all her merchandise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother. Very Disappointing Xmas gift. No pictures and boring recipes.","review":"My wife asked for a Rachel Ray cookbook for Xmas. I asked her if she wanted any other types of cookbooks.

I love My Monte Cristos,It's different and very good.I can't wait to make it for my friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick and Easy","review":"Like another reviewer, I had to respond to some of the negative reviews posted here. This cookbook is pretty darn good. Racheal Ray's recipes are resource for my kitchen.I dislike Rachael Ray's show very intensely. Her cutesy little catch phrases, like calling Extra Virgin Olive Oil \\"EVOO\\", and exuberant manner are not even Emeril-esque kitsch - they are simply cloying. Ms. Ray, its not a children's show, its a food show. We aren't four years old.Which is why I find this cookbook so amazing - its actually very good. I think too many Americans think only take-out, fast food or overprocessed \\"convenience foods\\" can fit into the fast paced modern lifestyle. Ms. Ray proves you don't need to spend 2 hours in the kitchen to come up with a healthy meal.If you are seeking an innovative cookbook with \\"wow-your-friends\\" type recipes - look elsewhere. If you need a challenge when you cook, look elsewhere. But if you want to Coq au Vin instead of Hamburger Helper, this is a good book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hey, What A Concept!","review":"Rachael Ray delivers yet again! Before she was a Food Network favorite, this hard working former server and PR genius wrote up a number of recipes for genuinely appealing meals that could be prepared in a half-hour or less. She used to go to supermarkets and do demonstrations and sell her books that way. She's earned her current status as one of America's favorite cooking personalities and this book shows why. Unlike so many cookbooks, everything in here is kitchen-tested, it works, and it's absolutely worth the time it takes to make. Rachael Ray has kept food preparation simple and she really goes the extra mile in passing on her time saving tips on how to prepare fine meals in today's hurried world. This is a fabulous book and I recommend it without qualification!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No pictures","review":"I think, having a cookbook with no pictures is rediculous. I work during the week so I dont often get to watch the show but I always liked it..Til Now..After buying 6 cook books, 5 with little or no pictures, I was furious..it's pure laziness..just a way to make money without quality. I will never watch the show or buy a book from her again..I'm so mad!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Read This Before you Think about Buying This Book!","review":"First of all, I love the show \\"30 Minute Meals and think Rachael Ray is GREAT! BUT..... this book came out before her 30 Minute Meals show, and the recipes were created several years ago before she \\"Fine-tuned\\" them for the show. If you compare her recipes in the book to those you get from her show you will see a big difference, and the new fine-tuned recipes she has on the show are MUCH better. I was very disappointed with the book. My advice to anyone wishing to purchase this book....... You know she's going to come out with an updated version eventually, so save your money for the real deal, the newer recipes!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Cookbook Ever!","review":"I have 3 of her cook books and I like this one the best. The recipies are the easiest and IMO the best! Try No-Pain Lo Mein, Curry in a Hurry, Gran'pa Emmanuel's Pasta Concoctions, Cashew! God Bless You Chicken or Moo Shu Pork Pockets. All are fantastic and full of flavor. She uses a lot of fresh veggies and herbs. Two problems I have found. One, there is no index so it makes the recipies hard to find. Two, these meals might take HER 30 minutes to make, but for most of us who don't cook for a living, they take longer. Still, the meals are fun to prepare and wonderful to eat. My family loves these dishes. Well worth the price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Great Rachael Ray Cookbook","review":"I have all the cookbooks written by Ms. Ray and they are all great. I did not have much of a interest in cooking before I started watching her 30 minute meals program and learned anyone could cook including me.

Some meals aren't done in 30 minutes, but they are all generally easy to make and pretty tasty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rachel's 30 Minute Meals","review":"Just thought we would share our experience with Rachel Ray's first book, 30 Minute Meals. Organization is key! You must prepare the ingredients ahead of time before you begin cooking to really make the 30 minute recipes in 30 minutes - but the recipes are fantastic and by no means, bland. We've only had the book a few weeks, and I can tell you that my 11 year old son was very enthusiastic about planning and making the menu suggestions from the book. So far we've made over 5 of them and all have been great. The book is wonderful for new cooks - young and old alike.Rachel Ray makes cooking look easy and her enthusiasm encourages you to want to try to cook a meal in 30 minutes instead of running out for fast food - and these recipes are much better tasting!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for people who don't cook often","review":"This is one of the best cookbooks for people who don't cook often and who have little experience cooking! I always watch the show 30-Minute Meals, and I liked the recipes that were on the show, I just wondered if they were actually as easy to prepare as they are on the show.

A couple of the discs were also loose in the packaging when it arrived, but there is no evidence of damage, so I am very pleased with my purchase.The pricing was extremely attractive and I feel that I got a great bargain with this Blu-ray collection.

I couldnt get the thing to focus and the only thing it was good for was taking a picture of myself from 8 inches away and even that pic looked [bad]. Id give it no stars the scale dosnt go that low. This camera should be a toy in a happy meal. Dont waste the money just wait a few more weeks till you have enough saved to go buy regular digital camera for 300 bucks or so my brother has a nice one that has a multi media card slot and was just as easy to take pics with that and then just put the card in my treo as using the veo sd and the pics with my brothers camera acaully looked like normal pics instead of a cover on some old 60's acid music cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible product","review":"Veo takes blurred pictures, is very slow, holds only 10 at a time. Flimsy, like a CrackerJack prize. Veo software is a space hog. And it automatically loads two more pieces of software -- one to transmit the pics to another device, which requires a compatible ISP (more software), and one with no apparent purpose except to occupy PDA space until you pay more to get an \\"unlock\\" key and open it.Plus, the Veo software screws up Launch'Em and/or OS-5.It took a hard reset to get rid of the problems Veo caused. ... Veo is a real disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work","review":"The product never worked for me...but by the time I realized I had already left the country so I didn't bother returning it.

In the meantime, I'll give it just one star for my money loosing."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is it!!!","review":"This CD, with its partner Volume 2, is one of the greatest live recordings of a club date in jazz history. The hard-driving Blakey with his best group ever; Brownie is incredible. And unlike a studio date, there are no retakes, no editing, just raw improvisation at the highest level."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huh?","review":"I remember when being a \\"favorite of the critics\\" meant something. That was back when the critics actually annointed fresh and interesting music as thier favorites. I utterly fail to understand the buzz about \\"Kid A.\\" I even more can't get the kudos being given it as being \\"daring\\" and \\"profound.\\" Hello? Have the critics stopped listening to music? Radiohead is a passable band but lets's face it, they aren't doing anything that dozens of other bands haven't been doing for years. \\"Kid A\\" is pleasant sounding to a point but without innovation, message or charm. If you like downbeat electronica you would do better with Thievery Corporation or Low, to name but two. To name \\"Kid A\\" as one of the best of 2000 very poorly reflects on Amazon's critics. They need to get out more and listen to more music."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Great Experiment","review":"They didn't try to follow up OK Computer - they did something different. This is not always an easy album to listen to, but it gets easier as time goes by. The songs are catchy and the repeated phrases are funny and profound. It certainly cements Radiohead's place in the Greats. But for all its wonderful experimentation and trailblazing, it's not quite in the epic class of OK Computer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stepping forward","review":"Initially I was disappointed by the lack of aggressive rockers on this new album, but after three listens, found it to be a pleasant surprise. Like Blur's 13, the ambient approach of Radiohead on Kid A created an album that can only satisfy the audience when heard straight through, from beginning to end. No singles, no breakout hits, just a good solid album for audiophiles. One of the best things about Radiohead has been following their progression from album to album as they avoid the pitfalls of commericalizing their artistic integrity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Am I missing something?","review":"Why the big fuss over this band?

Gayer???)","review":"Listening to this album is like receiving a LONG SLOW ENEMA. I still have no idea what people see in this much OVERATED band.

Creep is their only good song.....There I said it."},{"rating":"2","title":"with amnesiac, an important work which grew on my","review":"This album, along with Amnesiac (which was produced around the same time) is not easy to like. At first you probably won't get it. Listen to the album a few times. Let it sink in.This is not the Radiohead of The Bends. What started as an experimental direction in OK Computer gets more convoluted and further away from rock in this album.It took some time to grow on me--but now I think this album is amazing."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Emperor's new clothes","review":"It was with great anticipation that I bought this CD. I'd heard The Bends and enjoyed it. I'd read the reviews, which seemed to be universally enthusiastic in their praise. I was massively disappointed. This is musical navel contemplation. It seems that you open yourself up to sounding obtuse by savaging this effort, but it was a huge waste of time. The silver lining is that it's only 40 minutes long or so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Am I missing something?","review":"Why such a fuss over this band?

No love songs & three guitarists....complicated layers of melody/harmony etc. I waited for 2 YEARS for a new issue from musicians that always put me in a state of AWE. I bought KID A. Listened to it 20 times(on headphones, in the car, alone, with others, etc. I hated it more and more. I love it more now that I have 1) converted the disc into a very stylish clock & 2) purchased all the expensive import stuff by radiohead that I didn't have before. I wish they hadn't become so ordinary in their attempts to be different."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this album under any circumstances","review":"If you put a couple of randomly-chosen fourteen year old boys in a modern studio with professional engineers and told them that they had to write and record an album in one day, odds are you'd get something much more entertaining than this (...). It's hard to imagine something so repetitive could be so completely devoid of melodies, yet here it is. I wondered why something so critically acclaimed would not receive more radio play until I listened to it -- believe me, this is not something you are going to enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"For the Masses","review":"Really, I don't get Radiohead's appeal. At all.I don't get why this *WAY* over-hyped mediocre alt-rock rock band from the 90s can incite such absurd, obnoxious fanboy behavior from the 15-35 (mostly male) demographic (just look at the 2000+ reviews here). I'm tempted to ask folks who say this is 'brilliant' or 'genius' (the two most common adjectives signifying fanboydom): HAVE YOU EVER HEARD MUSIC BEFORE???It's OK; it's AVERAGE. It's better than Britney Spears' early work. It's *hardly* groundbreaking. It's *just* 'weird' enough, and *just* commercial enough - like an Alexander Payne movie. It's 'experimental' pop for the masses.The fact that they take themselves SOOO seriously - and that their fans take them SOOO seriously - only highlights their parodic value.People: Get over it, and Get over yourselves. There's MUCH better and MUCH more interesting music out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Bad","review":"Yeah, this is pretty bad. I could use an electronic keyboard and sound more innovative than these people. Radiohead relies on really boring electronica to make their bad music more interesting. It works for a couple of minutes, but then you realize how stupid it is and you just shut it off. Kid A is simply the epitome of Radiohead's very bad music. Happy listening! P.S.-Did you see their ridiculous performance on \\"Saturday Night Live\\"?----Ha! Ha! Forever."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT HEAVY!","review":"No, sir, Radiohead are one of the worst bands I have ever heard in my life. Their music is softer than a pillow and they don't swear at all! The worst part, however, is that their lead vocalist, Steven Jenkins, doesn't scream AT ALL! So disappointing. If you want true screaming brilliance, go buy Idaho by Slipknot, who's lead singer, Fred Durst screams bloody murder.

I thought I was buying a Radiohead CD.","review":"Wow. Never before has a band dropped so low so fast. OK Computer was one of the best albums ever produced, up there with Dark Side of the Moon.

At the end of every God awful \\"song\\", I hoped that the next song would be a fantastic peice of musical artwork, since I know the band is capable of it. Instead the CD just got more and more lost in art-school tripe. This is quite simply the worst collection of \\"music\\" ever assembled. Unless you are a blind, obsessed Radiohead fan, DO NOT buy this CD, DO NOT download it for free, DO NOT waste 45 minutes of your life listening to it, you cannot get that time back.

Don't waste your money on this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kid zzzzzzzzzzz","review":"Kid a is pretentious, self indulgent, downbeat and boring.

Was this supposed to be good?","review":"For all their hype ... I don't get it.I bought it, gave it one listen and thought \\"how boring was that!?!\\"Took it back the next day and traded it in for another CD.Mind you, I own almost 500 CD's and just as many vinyl albums and I don't get the Radiohead craze. I been told you \\"have to\\" see them live. I don't doubt it cause I've seen many a band that are absolutely fantastic live but don't come across well in studio. Must be the case for these guys cause they do nothing for me. Oh ... and then there is the song National Anthem on this CD. Finally a song that sounded worthwhile .... until they totally screwed it up with noise and horns and chaos. I felt like punching out the bandmates for ruining a great song. I wanted to like this band but, no can do."},{"rating":"1","title":"droning and boring doesn't equal good","review":"people, it's okay to admit when a band you like puts out a ... record.

That is a better investment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-rated (Kid F is more like it!)","review":"This album is a shining example of how file sharing can save a music lover fromwasting money on over-rated trash.

This group needs to listen to their first album again andremember what it's like to write a \\"song.\\" This group istrying too hard to be hip and strange, and it leaves the listenerwondering what in the world are these guys smoking or injecting.

Raidohead has done it again! give these boys the album of the year award!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Different, but still excellent.","review":"My first reaction to this album was something along the lines of, \\"What the heck am i listening to?\\" I want to say, first of all, that optimistic is nothing like the rest of the album. However, once you get over the shock, this album is simply incredible. It begins with synths and voice warps making up the first 2 tracks. The title track has almost a jazz beat to it. There are also the self-driven rock sounds of the national anthem and optimistic. how to dissapear completely is a nice acoustic/strings song. i never listen to morning bell because i can't follow the rythym. basically, this is the most experimental album i've ever heard.-( e [) /-\\\\ zby the way, the first song from vanilla sky is on this album, so you have an idea what the album sounds like."},{"rating":"2","title":"Always moving forward..","review":"Once again, Thom Yorke and the men of Radiohead have created yet another epic that will stand true in the world of music. The surreal opening track begins with an almost gothic organ track and Thom proclaiming, \\"Everything In It's Right Place\\". The album on a whole consists of a superlative flow of live instruments, effects, and unwavering vocal mixing.Despite the claims by many music critics, Kid A is by far a timeless masterpiece. My personal favorite, the title track, \\"Kid A\\", is reminiscient of childhood with it's almost whimsical xylophone tune in the background. However, as the song builds, the vocal track, \\"standing in the shadows at the end of my bed\\" destroys any preconceptions you had about Thom or the band itself.Radiohead has come a very long way since the single \\"Creep\\", experimenting with new sounds and ultimately arriving at the prominence they have achieved with their music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kid A","review":"Let's put it this way.Giving it the \\"edit playlist\\" test. If I delete 3-4 songs from the continuous program loop, the album is listenable and somewhat interesting. But that is where the problem is. As I have not felt the need to edit the playlist on any of the bands previous efforts. So yes I am disappointed and believe it is a step backwards for RadioHead.To be honest I kind of like guitars and vocals. And this album has hardly any. Straight synthesizer and tape loops for the most part. The pendulum simply swang to far off into left field on this CD. With only brief flashes of the bands previous brilliance on display. A very average CD from a very talented band. But in all fairness perhaps I just expected to much after OK Computer.So in conclusion, I suggest you walk, not run, to buy this CD. Cause your not really missing anything extraordinary by not having it. And it probably won't be sold out anyways."},{"rating":"1","title":"They call this music?","review":"This is definitely the worst thing I've ever heard. The only song that is remotely decent in my opinion is Idioteque, but that gets dull after about one listen.

(I didn't know anything about it until I got it, so I thought it might be good.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"KID F is more like it!","review":"I was so horribly disappointed with this album, considering that I thought THE BENDS and OK COMPUTER were both brilliant albums. I thought OK COMPUTER was one of the best albums of the century! KID A is a departure, but much too much of a departure. It's just background noise, not unlike U2's side project Passengers (which I also disliked). Unfortunately, I was looking for guitar hooks, over-the-top vocals, brilliant song structure. I didn't get it! There are only one or two songs worth listening to. It is supposedly a \\"concept\\" album, but what (or where) is the concept? To me, KID A is just a bunch of guys in a studio acting new age, trying to invent something that's not there. It doesn't work. Radiohead, where is thy brilliance?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Emperor's Clothes ..","review":"Sorry to say .. but this album is terrible. I bought it as it was released, since I awaited it as eagerly as any other fan did. And I am hugely disappointed. Radiohead is capable of greatness, and this is not it. Over-whelmed by expectations after OK Computer, I suspect that Radiohead became scared and copped out, pointedly trying to evade failure by doing something so very different .. and worthless. So now everyone can boldly claim: \\"Hey, it's not Ok Computer, what did you expect?\\"The reviewers here claiming it is one of the best albums ever, and that 5 stars aren't enough .. are deceiving themselves. I can not find any redeeming thing in this album to like and will get rid of it as soon as a shop opens on Monday morning that buys used CDs. I did allow myself a few days to try and see if it will settle in, but I don't want this crud in my collection. I feel embarrassed at having been conned out of my money for this trash. It even pains me to give it a single star."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst Radiohead CD","review":"This was the worst CD I've heard from Radiohead, I went to buy it as soon as it got out because i just love Radiohead, but once I listened to it I realized it was a piece of junk.

Sonidos experimentales y canciones sin melodia llenan esta produccion, para nada comparado con su trabajo anterior, OK Computer. Realmente no vale la pena adquirir este CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"and a half stars........What wrong with you people?","review":"How can this be a bad album? Am I the only one who thinks this is a brilliant piece? Where is everyone?I thought this is right up there with their two previous albums (OKC, bends). Many reviwers here point out that there is hardly any melody, just noise. I think its the other way around. I found a lot of euphoric melody (in reminicense of OK Computer), and the noise actually made sense!To the upset reviewers: did you actually think they should have made a second OK Computer? If you believe Radiohead is one of the greatest bands of this (and the past) decade so far, leave them to experiment, and not produce the same album over and over again. Doing that may prove that they are not so productive, and may cause them to lose credibility.To the hopefuls: Listen again. and again. and again. You will eventually like it. Im surprised some people did not get it on first listen. I did!To the ones who loved it: Rock on!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Give it time","review":"The thing about radiohead is that most people won't enjoy it the first time they hear it. It's music that requires a deeper connection to yourself, rather than just a tune that you listen to two or three times and it makes you sick(like most music these days). Listen to it and if you don't like it, listen to it again. I think it will eventually come to you. Good music often takes time to appreciate."},{"rating":"2","title":"BRILLIANT","review":"This album is plane and simply BRILLIANT the members of Radiohead are true musicians they do not follow the crowd they just write what they think is relevant to them, too many one hit wonders are out there Radiohead is definetely NOT one of those types.

I think that's a great thing because the actual music is not very innovative in general. But, I admit the deep and misterious sides of this album , but listen and let the music grow up in your soul. Look at song like How to dissaper completely, this is a perfect musical achievement for me. A little upset could be for guitarist like me the small place to guitar on the album. Overall, you need to open your mind and this album will be your favorite."},{"rating":"2","title":"sand in the ointment","review":"a telltale sign that Radiohead are still on good terms with their muse: they've managed to lure about half of their fans into otherworldly bliss, and completely alienate the other half. folks, a muse is not a statue, and an artist is not a vending machine. art is not static, art is more like a story: it's always going somewhere, heading somewhere. thom yorke, in the albums heart-wrenching opener, sounds like he's not only heading there, he's even passing himself on the way back (note the forward/backward theme in the vocal samples). bend your ear a little & you'll be amazed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rewarding rock Record","review":"As a 16 year old rock fan it depresses me sometimes to realize that I have missed the golden age of rock. But an album like this restores my fading faith in music. It is intimate/distant piece of art that I hope many radiohead fans will like, sure it's different from their other work, but isn't that why we like them = they evolve, much like The Deftones who have cited radiohead as influences. all The tracks are great and it's best heard as a whole, with all of your brain soaking it up."},{"rating":"2","title":"The newest Masterpiece!!!!!","review":"This Cd is a real Masterpiece. I still like the Cd OK Computer, but I prefer Radiohead's newest Album. Ok computer was an excellent album, but Radiohead managed to overtrump the predecessor. The lyrics convince like the dramatic sound itself. Best track on the Album is How to disappear completly. Treefingers is a n instrumental work, while optimistic is an accoustic track. The whole Cd is very varied. All 10 tracks are pushing on the lachrymal gland. Only deficit of the album is that its 45 minutes are much too short."},{"rating":"2","title":"ENO meets FLAMING LIPS","review":"A daring and bold new album from RADIOHEAD.

It's one of the best albums I've ever purchased. If you fall into any of the above four categories, give Kid A a try.

Song after song of brilliantly written, perfectly unified music, \\"kid a\\" raises the bar on rock music. Every song on the album is some how correllated with the next, and still each song has its own feel. This is radiohead's \\"Darkside of the Moon.\\" Some radiohead fans steer clear of this album because it's \\"wierd\\" or whatever. Radiohead was trying something new, that deserves the fan's respect, and it deserves a listen from there mainstream rock fans. But simply because they were trying something new is not what makes this cd great, it is the songwriting, the creativity, and the originality that makes \\"kid A\\" radiohead's best."},{"rating":"2","title":"TOTALLY AMAZING!!!!","review":"I have found out something after listening to KID A: Now radiohead can do just anything they want. They have made a mind blowing album following another mind blowing album. This is a very hard thing to do and something very few groups can do, so now they have nothing left to prove. This puts them in the position of the greatest band in the world right now. One thing amazing about KID A is the way radiohead managed to do something very different without losing the essence of themselves. This album pushes farther the electronic elements, wich radiohead used in other records, to create hounting atmospheres wich resemble sureal landscapes in your mind. The artwork recreates this images perfectly. Well I won't make a description of each song, because I thing it is impossible to put that in words. The only thing i can tell you is that if you really appreciate music, and if you really have sensibility to listen, you are going to love this album. GO AND BUY IT NOW!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mesmerizing, compelling, and way different","review":"This album is the most adventurous popular music CD I've ever heard. It takes a little getting used to, particularly the long instrumental cuts, but worth the effort in my opinion. The sound is eerie, atonal and sonically bleak, but it's also engaging. I particularly like that the use of computerized vocals does not sound overproduced like so much commercial music today. Also the organ that underpins almost every cut gives the music great depth. Lead singer Yorke's vocals are actually a bit thin at times (for instance \\"Idioteque\\"), and the lyrics are even more obscure, at least to me. If all you've heard is \\"Creep\\" you may not go for this, but if you're on board for the Radiohead ride then just get prepared for a little stranger trip."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant Kid","review":"I found this album beatifully haunting, but as we all expected it turned out to be the biggest hype of the year. To me it's all about the music, not just because it's radiohead i'm going to listen to it. I understand a lot of people are disappointed with the new direction of the band, but let me tell you Kid A is one of the most crafted albums i've ever heard, it hooked me on the first listen. It's not like OK computer at all but that's fine, we all knew that anyway. Most of the songs in here will play constantly in your head and you'll live through them, really. The only one i'm having trouble understanding is the title cut, but the rest.. brilliant. I'd like to know what's gonna happen with the other songs recorded like: knives out, lift, true love waits, pyramid song. They deserve being on an album cause they are amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Most Amazing album since \\"Darkside of the Moon\\"","review":"You will be totally amazed with what Radiohead does with this album. I think this is the best alternative album ever! It has the most incredible soundscape, with instrument layered over instrument. They also use trumpets (and other horns) in a way you'll never imagine (in 2 songs). If you buy one more album this year, this should be the one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"I don't know how to begin describing this work. As a friend said, \\"There are no songs.\\" It is a moving, lovely, sweet, strong 45 minutes of atmospheric beauty. Jump in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pink Floyd of the Millennium","review":"It's in it right place, and will be a classic! you'll see... I love the odd all over the place music Radiohead brings to the table. It left off where ok Computer ended (another classic) in 2 words MUST HAVE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"In the right place","review":"I'm a big Radiohead fan and Kid A is a perfect reason. They're focused, unique and refreshingly free of recycled ideas that most rock bands do these days. They're not afraid to confront your notions of music, and best of all they seem able to stand up to their fame and not let it affect their music.The first half of the disk, especially track 1, are wonderful reflections and refractions of a structure, with layered notes and electronic riffs and vocals that I rediscover with every listening. Very moody and strangely human.However, these vocals do finaly get a bit too much. Despite their genius, Thom's sampled vocals start to overpower much of the subtlety and texture of the music in later tracks. In some parts this becomes borderline abnoxious, maybe even egotistical. Which is a shame as it would be a first for the band.Still, this is a gem of an album. And it will probably grow on me in time, over-sampled vocals and all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Listenable Portmanteau","review":"The first listen may put some off. After the first listen for a while, I skipped to National Anthem, Optmistic and Motion Picture Soundtrack. Then I listened to it again Then, it became clear. A lot of the songs may sound very similiar to the less pop orientated techno-dance-trance type going around ( Some smacks of Pop Will Eat Itself aswell ) , but it still sounds like Radiohead, and its still good. Many bands find it very difficult to follow a good album, so following OK Computer Kid A will always seem \\"not-as-good\\". This is a shame, since there is a lot of atmosphere to it, more of general suffocation than of the mortal fear of OK Computer.I wouldn't say it was a classic, because it isn't. Die hard fans will love it, and since no single was released in the UK, it still managed to get to no1 through word of mouth and the net. I didn't even know it existed until I saw it at no 11 in the charts as I was going home from work! :-) However, I love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"to touch and feel another world","review":"Radiohead's album \\"Kid A\\" is a work in progress... it will take several listenings to even begin to gain a sense of the effort... radio tracks don't jump out of the speakers... this collection is introverted to the extent that you feel that you are not along for the ride but privy to something that no one looks to share... like all of the great artists and music of any decade, this work is far beyond now- it will grow as the days go long.The music is short on melody and touches on 70's lost moments from Floyd to Jarre to Tony Carey.Buy this work and let it grow..."},{"rating":"2","title":"This band is taking rock music to the next level.","review":"Radiohead's music keeps growing. A bold, rare statement to follow up thier operatic O.K. with an album full of ambient and non commercial music. Not that the kids of today could swallow up karma police too easily. Kid A has plenty of beautiful & mind etching melodies played by an immensely talented band. 100 years from now mostly all rock and electronic musicians will regard this band as one of their major influences. New album in early 2001."},{"rating":"2","title":"New direction, Great result","review":"Continuing to stretch, this album finds Radiohead stepping back from the arty brink and less accessible last album, into a more electronic style giving a more atmospheric/scary sound to their excellent/painful lyrics. Great album, check out \\"The Bends\\" if you haven't already."},{"rating":"2","title":"Radiohead takes music to another level","review":"This album is groundbreaking. This album is a rebellion to the anticreativity movement in the musicworld today. This album expresses feelings in a way unlike any other. With amazingly jagged lyrics and revolutionary sound Kid A shows why radiohead is renowned as one of the most talented bands in the world. Yorke's voice resonates throughout your car/room/head with tones so deep and obviously heartfelt that it is not even necessary for the listener to understand the words in order to comprehend the message he's conveying. A message of the state of the world we live in. The irony of Everything in its Right Place and Optimistic, the feeling that everybody's had at least once in their life that comes through in How to Disappear Completely. The sonic beauty of the album holds the interest of whoever's listening, an interest that can span many times through because of the completely new sound radiohead took on with this album. thank you for reading this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kid A - Ground breaking","review":"Radiohead have created a great album here. They've taken the experimentation of Ok Computer to another level. Optimistic, Everything in its right place, and How to Disappear completely are my favorites. I would say song for song Ok Computer is a better record but I like KID A more than the Bends. It took me about 5 listens to really start to enjoy it because it is so different, even by previous Radiohead standards so be patient."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Artistic CD","review":"This CD has proven to be one of my favorites, because of the fact that it is so different than any other album. You might listen to Limp Bizkit, or Barry Manilow, or Faith Hill, but no matter who you listen to, youll still like the CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Radiohead as a Band and Kid A as an Album","review":"Well, first of all, i would like to say that Radiohead is hands down the best band of the late nineties. I have been a fan since hearing \\"Creep\\" while on Holiday in Germany. I really think that everyone in here who is critiquing Radiohead and saying that they aren't groundbreaking are right. They are BRILLIANT and INSPIRED musicians, they aren't breaking new ground, they are leaping over it, showing us where music will be in 10 years. Atomosphere is everything in this record, and i for one would recommend it to anybody that wants a GREAT mood album. This album resembles closely Pink Floyd's \\"Meddle\\" in sheer audacity, however it has fast become one of my favorites. Not as good as \\"OK Computer\\" but thats like saying that the Beatles \\"Abbey Road\\" isn't as good as \\"Sgt. Pepper.\\" A great album by a great band. Loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"My God...","review":"I've never heard anything like this album. It's been on continuous play in my CD player for about six hours now and I won't be turning it off any time soon. Sure, Kid A sounds nothing like OK Computer or the Bends, but it is still undeniably Radiohead, and by definition they can do no wrong. Still, I don't think anyone expected anything half as mind-blowing as this. Kid A simply defies descrption. Get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best new release this year!","review":"This could Aphex Twin if he just calmed down. This album is dark, moody,tense,and most of all beautiful! Do not think this is like any of there other records. It is by far the best. After buying a ton of new stuff this year, thank God Radiohead has the talent to back up the hype!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This Generation's THE WALL","review":"Radiohead , the band that started as a one hit wonder with Creep has returned. As with each CD previously made by Yorke and Friends , it is totally different to everything you or I have ever heard. Wearing a quiet atmosphere and sometimes killing sounds , Kid A gives the best out of the band , reaching higher grounds than OK computer , and giving us the first convincing album of the new millennium , Radiohead proves one more time that they are the Best UK band of the 90's , and the best band for early 00's. BUY THIS RECORD"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yeah, I know you're going to buy it anyways.","review":"I want to set things straight in this review. So many people seem to think people don't like Kid A because it is electronica/ambient with very little rock. Either that, or they just have bad music tastes and don't like Radiohead. I, on the other hand, like Radiohead, and I have much respect for the band. Yet that still can't dissuade me from writing this review. People should be warned before they pretend to like this album for a couple of weeks, and forget about it. To be honest, it lacks any kind of energy. Listen for 30 seconds and you'll get the feel for the whole song. There is plenty of creativity and experimentation, but that fails to breath life into empty songs. Oh, and for those people who call this the Album of the year: just wait a month or so, then you'll be able to admit that its not very good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a single hook. (Their first bad album)","review":"I'm an avid Radiohead fan. Until now its been hard to find fault with the band that singlehandedly reinvented the guitar, has a one-in-a-million lead singer, and sings some of the most poignantly beautiful songs I've ever heard.So what's wrong with this album? For one, the band clearly believed too much of its own press. In an effort to break new ground and bring us the latest greatest concept, they apparently forgot what they really are: Pop musicians. Great pop musicians.There are plenty of great vintage synth sounds on this album -- but there's a little too much exploring, and not enough basic songwriting. What has always drawn me to Radiohead is that in their explorations of new musical territory they still manage to pull out some incredible pop. But not this time...Radiohead needs to head back to the studio and work hard to remind us that they can still write songs. And that they can rock."},{"rating":"2","title":"Radiohead's most emotional and best album","review":"I prefer this album over every other Radiohead album... yes even the sacred Ok Computer. Why? Well for one, it was entirely unlike anything the band had done before. It used computer effects and strange spacey effects in a much different fashion than the albums before it. Most of the songs here arent even driven by guitar anymore.As for the songs themselves, I enjoy every song (though \\"Treefingers\\" and \\"In Limbo\\" are my least favorites, the rest are equally great). I found some of the songs (\\"Morning Bell\\" & \\"How to Disappear Completely\\" in particular) to be emotionally moving... which is something I hardly ever experience when listening to music. Whether or not this is because of where I was in my life at this point is up for debate, but one cannot deny the overall ominous or depressing mood in these songs in particular. Honestly, when was the last time you were affected on an emotional level by a song? That is the telltale sign of a great album."},{"rating":"1","title":"13 BUCKS FOR ONE SONG","review":"I love Radiohead but this album is good only as background music while working or driving. The music is not worthy of paying full attention to. This kind of work has been done before by Brian Eno and Robert Fripp/King Crimson. It may be good music to cut your wrists to, but it is worthless for anything else. I think the band tried really hard but it is really important that they go back to their real strength and genius which is the intertwined and beautiful guitar work that they are capable of. The only reason i gave them 2 stars is because there is one truly great and beautiful song and that is \\"How to dissapear completely\\" which is a lovely work of genius."},{"rating":"1","title":"Half-decent album","review":"I think reviews from non-RH freaks are much needed here!....sure radiohead is a good band with balls and artistic integrity...but this time one must admit they almost blew it. Roughly half of the track are decent....the other half is junk or fillers....could someone honestly think that treefinger is not crap? What about those 3-4 minutes of silence in the last song....sorry guys but this artistic statement has been made countless time before.....enjoy the silence?....please! Morning bell is a decent song but for those of you who think the drum is genius....well listen to closer from Joy Division and you will hear that exact same beat. I think this album is kind of an adverse reaction to the stardom they were forced into following OK computer. In summary this album has been completely overrated...it's sad when hardcore fans can't admit their group had somewhat of a failure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is the Emperor wearing any clothes???","review":"Talk about a disappointment. After having \\"The Bends\\" and \\"Ok Computer\\" permanently installed in my CD player for the past few years, I was eagerly awaiting the next release. What I found--wandering, aimless techno-noise, minutes of near-silence, backwards-sounding vocals derivative of the Stone Roses first album from 10 years ago--made me want to run to the nearest used CD store to turn it in. I am completely astounded by the critical ravings. Maybe I'm just not cool enough for this stuff anymore. I don't care. It bored me senseless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak Effort","review":"I just don't get it. I just listened to The Bends and then went back to Kid A. It just doesn't match up. The melodies are just not there, the ringing acoustic guitar lost to sound loops. The emotion of their previous albums is just not carried into this album. Kid A is a good album, however, not the classic that I expect from an act like Radio Head."},{"rating":"2","title":"whos got [guts]?","review":"Radiohead is beginning to reek of the sweet smell of art-rock pretension. What kind of band would follow up a smash hit poprock album like ok computer with an album that is essentially 48 minutes of anti-songs? Radiohead, the band with the biggest [guts] in the world. Im amazed Thom Yorke can even stand with the weight of those massive [guts] holding him down. So how do you review an cd that really sounds like nothing else out there? First it must be said that this is an album in the fullest sense of the word. All the songs are good, but don't really hold up on their own. Every song needs every other song. So do yourself a favor and listen to the whole thing. Do not just listen to optimistic, say \\"that was pretty. i like radiohead. cake is good.\\" and leave the rest of the album alone. Be complicated. Be Arty and pretensious. please like this album. It deserves it so much. If not for the quality of the music, at least buy it so Thom and company can buy carts for their huge [guts]."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please remove heads from Radiohead's arse","review":"I know everyone likes a little experimental rock now and then, but this album was experimental for eperimental's sake. Radiohead has forgotten that it's all about good music, not just being rock pioneers. I was disappointed with the album as a whole, although there are some good tracks (motion picture soundtrack,everything in its right place). I like radiohead just as much as anyone, but the credit they are given as \\"rock saviors\\" and best band ever is just hopping on the radiohead bandwagon. I will hop on as soon as they remember how to make good music like i know they can."},{"rating":"1","title":"Retro Prog-Rock Bombast","review":"I find it fascinating that the critics who found the masturbatory musings of Pink Floyd, King Crimson, Yes and other seventies progressive rock outfits so offensive seem so smitten by Kid A. This album is twaddling self-indulgence on a galactic scale. Radiohead, perhaps influenced by all the \\"best band in the world\\" nonsense, is clearly beginning to take themselves too seriously. OK Computer ranks as one of the great rock albums of this past decade. Kid A is interesting background music for those on high-grade hallucinogenics, but very little else."},{"rating":"2","title":"typically radiohead","review":"i can't understand all these discussions of persons who are familiar with radiohead about the differences to the ok computer release, ok this is an comercial platform and so i shouldn't expect much more, but what did you expect this kid a is a typicall radiohead it's an (if this exists) avantgard pop release they told that they didn't want to sound like a copy of radiohead and that e.g. aphex twin had much more influence to music evolution than themselves, ok they forgot sonic youth but they are song writers and their music wouldn't be imaginable without feelings and that are still the same even if their lyrics seems to be more cynical than ever at all a great album"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quite OK. OK, Radiohead ? DONT BUY DONT BUY DONT BUY","review":"Working hard for my money, I don't enjoy being let down by a group trying to experiment all the time (I should have know better) OK, Computer opened new grounds on the rock arena, but KID A sucks. There is no Karma Police, no Exit Music to a Film, no No Surprises. NOTHING. Electronic sounds, silly landscapes and programming ... you call this rock? Give me IRON MAIDEN!The booklet (\\"limited edition\\" and all) is total junk (no lyrics, no photo's, no innovative drawings as on OK,Computer) and just goes to show that there is such a thing as \\"overexperimentating\\".I must also say that after a while one starts to get used to it (my first instinct was to take it back), even gets interesting, in fact I can understand why some call it revolutionary. (Don't compare with Pink Floyd, PLEASE!). But WHY all the effort, when something like Mark Knopfler immediately goes well on the ear!?!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely Overrated","review":"I wanted to like this album. I really did. Many people are saying how they have \\"reinvented music\\". That's a load of rubbish. There are a few interesting odds and ends, but overall the album is just not very listenable. Radiohead has made great music on their past albums and I think most people are grading this album on past accomplishments. It's mostly pompous, overblown noise. Sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Good Night Irene....\\"","review":"The only reason to buy this CD is so people think you're cool when they see it in your CD holder.

A guy I work with says it lifted him to a new level of conciousness. Take a tip from me --- listen to the samples before you buy it --- to me it sounds like an hour long musical interpretation of a fatal car-wreck. Apparently taste is really subjective on this one --- To me it barely even qualifies as music --- its just a mish-mash of inharmonic noise. In my opinion, don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trust me...

Maybe if you are on an acid trip it could be remotely interesting. But for any sne and sober person, this is not the stuff you can sit back and listen to.I tried listening to it repeatedly, but it still sounded like a radio trying to tune in, or a space ship. And if you want that, get Bold As Love (the first track). Don't get this, PLEASE. It's all hype and is not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most disappointing album ever made","review":"Sure, it must have been hard to follow up two of the greatest albums of all time, The Bends and OK Computer, with anything like those in quality, but they could at least have tried. Kid A is absolute rubbish, full of synthetic sounds and incoherent, and when they are discernable, pointless, lyrics.If Radiohead wanted to experiment with new directions before settling back to what they do best - good, tight, guitar-filled emotionally charged rock - they should have just kept it to themselves, instead of releasing it and conning us loyal fans into paying good money for c**p like Kid A.In the history of music there have been worse albums made, though not many, but there has never been a worse album made by so talented a band."},{"rating":"1","title":"what is this?","review":"Pretty disappointing. Some might say this music is ahead of its time and we're not going to understand what its about. Actually, I wouldn't even call this music. I could let my cat walk on top of my MIDI keyboard and make something, perhaps, quite similar to the songs on this album. It's like Vangelis on dope. Don't buy this, cause I know you'll be disappointed too like everyone else."},{"rating":"1","title":"The first Radiohead work I've raised an eyebrow at","review":"As someone who considers himself a die-hard Radiohead fan, I immediately ordered this album the instant I heard about its upcoming release. Upon its arrival, I rushed out to the car to give a listen.Sadly, after forcing myself to leave this disk in the changer for the past four days, little of it has grown on me. Things start off nicely, with the eerie soup of \\"Everything in its Right Place\\" recalling much of the feel of earlier works, with some new textures. A perfect song for brooding while driving really fast. But from there, things mellow into an eerily calm, unemotional stupor. C'mon Thom! Is someone slipping you guys valium/prozac? Where is the energy, the \\"bite\\" of the music we've come to expect from Radiohead?

I do not suggest it for a new Radiohead listener though, but maybe use it as a second Radiohead album purhcase. \\"National Anthem\\" starts off the amazing record with its electronic rock feel, which flows throughout the rest of the tracklist. \\"In Limbo\\" is probably my favorite song, and then \\"Motion Picture...\\" is one of the many mellow-ish, new age tracks, that really chills the listeners out. Great album, a must have."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing album","review":"I acquired this album about two months ago and have listened to it about once a day since. It's a fantastic album and if you are a true Radiohead fan you will not be disappointed. If you're expecting 3 1/2 minute songs that are radio playable then this album probably won't make much sense to you.

Ambition and pretentiousness. Good music and bad music. On \\"OK Computer\\" Radiohead somewhat admirably walked that line, but on \\"Kid A\\", they've fallen flat on their faces on the wrong side. The worst part is that they've blinded the music press and their own fans with their contrived expectaion-dodging antics.Okay, maybe that's not really fair. I'm sure there are people who do REALLY like this record. Indeed, a couple songs work, \\"Idiotheque\\" and \\"Motion Picture Soundtrack\\" being two standouts. But look; all of this has been done before, BETTER. LFO, Aphex Twin, Autechre... hell, buy a Warp sampler and you'll get a much better version of \\"Kid A\\" with a copyright date of ten years ago. To say this is innovative or even foward-looking is pretty naive. If anything, it's retro.Thom Yorke really needs some ice for that swelling head of his."},{"rating":"2","title":"such kids in it","review":"brilliant. disturbing. terrifying. I imagine if we could scrape at the darker insides of a mind like will self's, or william gibson's, or george saunders', or mark leyner's, KID A would perhaps be a good aural indication of what we might dig up there beneath our grubby, ragged, monkey fingernails. there is little consolation in the suspicion that the future's hypercapitalistic ultrahuman designer babies will look back with perfectly-calibrated eyes on the first crude injections of human embryos with foreign genes and on the arrival of Kid A as perhaps the first and last gropings of a species doomed to extinction by its own intelligence. in Kid A is the awareness of all this, and yet--somewhere underneath it all, the human heart still beating, despite. for whatever that's worth, for the time being. the sound of a dying old world slipping (almost) unawares into one frightfully new, frightfully unknown, frightfully uncertain in its inclusion of humanity as we now know it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This sounds more like RADIODEAD.","review":"Radiohead released one of the most interesting albums of the last decade but, unfortunately, in trying to throw the critics (whom they pretend to ignore) for a loop, they've created an album that is utter BLAH! PLEASE....someone grab Thom by his scrawny little shoulders, shake him and yell \\"WAKE UP.\\" His constant mumbling throughout the album sounds like he has an English sausage stuck in his mouth. And the band...well the band really doesn't play(like we know they can). There is a lot to be said about minimalism, but if we wanted ethereal, we could have listened to Brian Eno."},{"rating":"2","title":"I had a hard time with this","review":"I think Radiohead is a ingenius band. Pablo Honey and OK Computer are both masterpieces for UK Rock, and music in general, but this album is dificult for me. OK Computer is certainly a hard album to follow, so in trying to be objective... This is a creative masterpiece; unlike anything before it. I believe this will spawn entire new types of Rock music; however, I'm not used to it quite yet. I have given it a number of listens and I find it deep and interesting, but somewhat depressing (not that Radiohead has ever been very uplifting). As though I really have no idea what the music meant (I suppose I didn't really know on their past albums either, but at least I thought I did).So after my list of random thoughts I will simply say this is a creative masterpiece, and must own for music lovers and Radiohead fans, but it will probably not sell like OK Computer, and if you just want more Karma Police, or Creep, you should look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great follow-up to Ok Computer","review":"OK Computer, Radiohead's last CD, was in my mind one of the best CD's of the 90's. Radiohead has set another precedent with Kid A, a well rounded and thoroughly inspiring CD. the tracks on this release are distinctive, yet the album still maintains a cohesiveness that is subtle but evident. the minimal use of guitars and incorporation of Moog like synths, horns and other instruments shows the originality of this group as well as their multi-instrumental talents. some tracks remind me of Darkk Bros. in their experimentation of grooves balanced with chaos...my compliments to the band. if you are a musician you'll have a particular interest in this CD. thumbs up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My first full listen to Radiohead","review":"I only heard the songs Creep and Karma Police before this. I heard Optimistic, but I didn't like it too much. But then I chose to listen to this at the Hastings close to me. I've been wanting to buy it since then. Cuz before I used to always hear about them but not know them that much. The lyrics are mainly sarcastic, even though it doesn't bother me. It feels like Pink Flloyd but a present day version. Also a British NIN. This is in my opinion, a masterpiece since I didn't know what to expect. They've also got their own individual genius sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Modern Masterpiece","review":"This album takes the listener on a lovely head trip without ever letting go. After their three equally awesome albums, one had to wonder if Radiohead could match previous perfections with their new disc, Kid A. They have suceeded tremendously. Best songs are Optimistic, Idioteque, and Morning Bell (eventhough each song is amazing). Kid A is a worthy addition to the Radiohead legacy."},{"rating":"2","title":"KID A is nothing short of REVOLUTIONARY","review":"Buy it. Right now.

Radiohead puts so much thought into every song it is amazing, but that requires you think as well. Of course this album is \\"weird\\" and \\"other worldly\\" but it is the most creative combination of noise and words Ive ever heard. Definitely a \\"smart person\\" album.

Its romantic, emotional, unsettling sounds gave me shivers down my spine the first listen. I am inspired and in awe of Radiohead's creativity and originality with this experimental album. They can bring any sound to life, create a story behind it, and make you FEEL something incredible within yourself. Radiohead really sets themselves apart from the rest; their willingness to experiment with new sounds and making it WORK deserves them much admiration and respect. I would recommend this album to anyone who's interested in amazing quality music, because God knows that's hard to find nowadays. Kid A leaves you speechless, breathless, emotional and begging for more... Hurray for RADIOHEAD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"the world is changing-this is proof","review":"if you are someone out there wondering if there is anyone else that thinks like you, if you feel all alone in your viewpoint of the world, of yourself, of spirit than this will comfort you. it will give you the pure truth that, yes, the world is changing BIG TIME and so are we, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"The future of music","review":"Folks, this is what music should be. It is hands down the best album in recent memory. Radiohead is the Beatles of the 20th century. They are creating new and profoundly beautiful music. This is an album that will stand the test of time, and this is a band that should be highly revered for it's bravery in releasing such a ground breaking album. In a time when people think that Limp Bizkit is the future of rock and roll, this is a welcome change. THIS is the future of rock and roll. Doing what you want to do, not what the public wants you to do."},{"rating":"2","title":"It grows on you","review":"The first time I heard Kid A, I was a little put off by it. I was expecting weird, but not this weird. Then I heard it again, and again, and again, and that's when I realized I liked it. \\"Everything In Its Right Place\\" and \\"Morning Bell\\" are good examples of songs you think are crap when you first hear them, but then they start to get better as you listen to it more. \\"Kid A\\" and \\"Motion Picture Soundtrack\\" I still dont really like, but they're the only bad songs on the album. So what I'm saying here is just give it a chance and you'll probably end up liking it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated Album of The Year","review":"Although most discs reviewed on this site seem to get a 4 or 5 star \\"THIS IS A MASTERPIECE!\\" review, I'm going to break stride and Kid A is a good album with which to do just this - and for good reason. I liked OK Computer quite a bit and was prepared to like Kid A as well, but even after repeated listenings I don't hear anything here that really makes me want to come back for more. I mean, I'm trying very hard to like this album! But essentially, Kid A is an album with maybe 2 songs containing something approaching a memorable melody. The rest is electronic filler. I would recommend not buying into some of the pretentious reviews posted here claiming Kid A is \\"terrifying\\" or \\"groundbreaking\\" etc etc...it's filler."},{"rating":"2","title":"a new world","review":"This album breaks all the music listening habits and opens a door for a new world. simply revolutionary.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never listened to OK Computer... love Kid A.","review":"Truth be told, before listening to this CD the only songs by Radiohead I was really familiar with were 'Creep' and 'High and Dry', so maybe the fact that I didn't have any preconceptions about how this album should have sounded left me open to enjoy Kid A. I bought this album because everywhere I turned, people were raving over OK Computer and Radiohead. I find Kid A fascinating and not at all pretentious as other reviewers have described it. It did take a few repeated listens, but once the backdrop became a bit more familiar I was able to appreciate the subtleness of the melodies and the music. A fine piece of work.So my advice? Listen to Kid A as Kid A! And not OK Computer Part 2!By the way - after acquiring this CD I've since purchased OK Computer and The Bends, and thoroughly enjoy them. I'm now a huge fan of Radiohead. I plan to purchase Pablo Honey next. =)"},{"rating":"2","title":"What Radiohead is meant to be.","review":"This album is Radiohead. The other albums, great as they may be, were a prelude to this masterpiece. This is one example of a band who took a break from trying to sell records to do what they wanted to do, and made one of the best CD's of the decade.How to disappear completely is a beautiful song whose slow and mornful melody will entrance you every time you listen to it. It is my favorite on the CD, as is \\"Everything in it's right place\\", with it's electronicly emotional flow.This album rarely comes out of my CD player, and I don't believe I will ever get tired of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"KID A = 5 stars","review":"This CD is only a 4-star album but it deserves a bonus star since it was such a balls-out move by radiohead to even release it. They could have made another The Bends or another OK Computer and became heros but instead they made an album to try and become legends. And for the record, it is a damn good album. Very dark, very gloomy, very radiohead."},{"rating":"2","title":"it must have been the modified bears.","review":"This is an awesome album, further establishing radiohead as one of my favourite bands. one thing that caught my attention is what a dark album this sounds. the album art is cold and dark, yet it is an absolute beautiful album. it's very different from their earlier, more rock-based albums, but it's a great change. i personally enjoy ok computer better, but in a way i think kid a symbolizes something better in music. the fact that radiohead can keep changing their music from pablohoney to the bends to ok computer to kid a is just amazing. word of warning though: this music has very many electronic elements in it. i am actually a big fan of electronic music so that may have biased my tastes in the album, but if you're expecting lots of guitars you may be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well, maybe 2.5 stars","review":"Certainly a band deserves credit for exploring new styles, and deviating from what they may be \\"expected\\" to play. Bearing that in mind, Radiohead's Kid A is a noteworthy, if unsuccessful foray into \\"electro-minimalism\\", or whatever you want to call it. It sounds to me like Radiohead changed direction simply because they were afraid of trying to top the incredible and more unique OK Computer. While the \\"new\\" sound is successful on certain tunes, others suggest that Radiohead possibly hurried the ideas onto tape under the guise of minimalism.If you liked Kid A, or even feel that it fell a little short, try some of these artists (and realize that Kid A isn't the unique masterpiece some will make it out to be): Aphex Twin, Brian Eno and Bjork's \\"Vespertine\\" are generally conceptually stronger than Kid A. Or go further back into electronic's roots and listen to Kraftwerk, Neu! or Suicide. Those not averse to classical music might find Philip Glass rewarding."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Hate To Say It But \\"Amnesiac\\" Is Much Better.","review":"I say a video show a while back that devoted their half hour to all videos of \\"Radiohead\\". Most of them were from \\"Kid A\\" and \\"Amnesiac\\". I watched it because I was curious about the group and their music. I bought \\"Amnesiac\\" first because there were more songs I liked from that album then \\"Kid A\\". I thought that this would be just as good, but I was really disapointed. There's only four really good songs on this album in my opinion.\\"Everything In Its Right Place\\", \\"How To Disappear Completely\\",\\"Optimistic\\", and \\"In Limbo\\". Eveything else didn't seem like a song to me, just attempts at ones. \\"Morning Bell\\" isn't bad, but I liked the version on \\"Amnesiac\\" better. If your new to \\"Radiohead\\", I'd suggest getting \\"Amnesiac\\" before this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why?","review":"Honestly, I was never much of a Radiohead fan, be it back in 1993 when a couple of my friends started playing \\"Creep\\" off of MTV's compilation, or when those same friends tried to introduce me to Amnesiac. However, I thought I'd investigate their middle efforts and see what's been the big deal.Listening to Kid A, I don't find anything particularly engaging. If you listen to \\"Right Place\\", you expect some goal for trudging through it. But through the rest of the album Radiohead doesn't convey a clear purpose to their music.I don't expect the band to \\"be\\" anything, and I'm neither a fan that fell off nor a blind defender. But after this listen I wonder if the praise HEAPED on Radiohead isn't as formulaic as the rock against which Radiohead purports to rebel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great to Listen to","review":"I bought this CD because it was first played at a record store that I frequented. I happened to be impressed with the group's technical and sound effects. The listener is not suppose to take it too seriously as to what they are trying to imply in their music. It's great to listen to when you don't want to hear elevator or hype-up music. Radiohead is talented in their own way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drive down Woodland Avenue in NY....","review":"If you drive down Woodland Avenue in Long Island, you might find a cracked Radiohead Kid A album somewhere along the side of the road.I absolutely love Radiohead. Their work on \\"The Bends\\" and \\"OK Computer\\" was amazing. I was expecting a change from Radiohead, as was pretty much apparent because they like to change their sound, but this album is utterly pathetic. The album cannot boast one very good song, not even one.This album is a collection of melodramatic, cosmic sounding rubbish, which sounds more like a B-Sides album than a major studio release. I gave this album time to grow on me... I had it in my possession a few months actually. After finally coming to the realization that this was one of the worst highly anticipated albums of All-Time, I broke the CD in half, and threw it out my car window. That may have been a little extreme, but it goes to show what a big Radiohead fan thinks of their new material. That is how disappointed I am with \\"Kid A\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"whiney drivel","review":"I loved both OK Computer and The Bends but did not get around to listening to Kid A until this month.

I traded the cd in on the weekend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hate It","review":"I love Radiohead. But this CD is just dumb. I bought it and tried and tried and tried to like it but I just can't. And I've a fairly open mind too. Whether it's Zappa or Beefheart or someone like Spookey Ruben or Self, I have a pretty good ear for experimental music when is the work of genius.

For what? The majority of this record is muddled noise that Thom and the band should have left in the studio rehersals and not on a LP!I find it funny that improv noises that Kid A is full of - people are so gung-ho for. Why I ask... why? The answer is simply because we're supposed to think that. This album has been treated like the best thing ever- it is soooooo far from that! I'm am a retired music critic from the Bay area and believe me when I say this, what Kid A offers is an experiment - nothing more! I've heard a ton of experimental records in my career, but this one has no valid statements, no ideas, no potential at all. A complete waste and a very disappointing LP. This however is a CD im sure they needed to get out of their system, hopefully it'll be back to more fertile ground next season."},{"rating":"2","title":"Artwork in Music","review":"This album is truly a work of art. From the first time I listened to it, it stayed in my CD player, and if it was changed, it was usually to a different player. This CD is, I'll say it again, truly fantastic from beginning to end, the only track I found skippable being \\"Treefingers\\". I've also found this CD extremely easy to take a walk in the snow listening to it, or just driving around. I don't know why, but there's a certain quality that makes it perfect for said ways of movement. Another thing, this album seems indescribable to me, so I'll shut up and let you listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Machines of the Electronic Heart","review":"Kid A... it is more than you could ever expect from a firmly entrenched rock band, to say the least. Experimentation runs rampant all throughout the albulm here Kids. Thom and crew may have made their seminal work with OK Computer, but how do you follow up a seminal work? The answer is of course with something different, something ahead of seminal. Just as much as OK Computer was OK for radio, I really doubt Kid A will make it to any radio stations outside of college campuses. The stuff they are doing now is different, and is better for you and your sense of music appreciation than vitamins B-Z, because this is your vitamin A."},{"rating":"1","title":"only Radiohead can get away with this [stuff]","review":"After trying to get used to the new project I can't find much to enjoy aside from maybe three tracks. People are calling it artwork but if that's what I wanted I would buy some Picasso. I was looking for music and Radiohead failed to deliver for the first time ever. No one would have produced this garbage had it been another band but Radiohead does it ... call it the album of the year. I think I'll just keep listening to OK Computer."},{"rating":"1","title":"pretentious, pretentious, pretentious","review":"Amazing these days what passes for \\"important\\" records and music.

I happen to really like this album, and I have to admit that I don't understand what all the furor is about. To my ears, this is neither a horribly cacophonous middle finger to Radiohead fans everywhere, nor is it a staggering breakthrough of artistic genius. It's just a cool, somewhat experimental album with its own vision, some great sounds, somber and sometimes beautiful emotional landscapes, and great MELODIES, believe it or not! But if you've heard anything as adenturous as, oh, Pink Floyd or early Peter Gabriel, this shouldn't strike you as that outlandish. Another suggestion to the potential buyer: Kid A keeps getting described as electronica, but this is not a particularly synth-y, drum machine driven record; it has a much more lush and organic feel than what is usually described as electronica. If that sounds good to you, give it a try!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Kid ARGH","review":"This was one of the truly worst CDs I have ever heard - I once bought a tex-mex macarena party cd that I could bear more than this horrible tripe.

I liked what I heard and my interest had been sparked, so I further investigated this band. I bought \\"The Bends,\\" the album they had released prior to OK Computer, and found that it was mostly pop-junk music. So I figured perhaps they had became disillusioned with mass-marketed pop-crap and decided to make something that sounded a bit more creative, yet was still uniquely pleasant with OK Computer. But I believe they've gone a bit too far with the creativity in this latest album, Kid A.The album is an inconsistent cornucopia of harsh, distorted sound waves. Now matter how many times I listen to it, I can't seem to like it. It really is quite bad. Any thoughts?

Muchas gracias."},{"rating":"1","title":"brainscramble nonsense","review":"The best part of this album was the last 3+ minutes of DEAD SILENCE! \\"Kid A\\" makes no sense, has no structure. Songs should be like books: have a beginning, middle and end. Every song on \\"Kid A\\" starts as seemingly random playing of instruments with no dynamics at all and continues that way until the 2-second pause before the next group of random notes and erratic mumblings of \\"vocals\\". I give \\"Kid A\\" a zero; it's not \\"catchy\\" (which I guess would make Radiohead GENIUS by way of non-conformity) and you can't dance to it even if you were able to escape from it's brain-sucking, deadening trance."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!","review":"I was ready to truly love this CD. I love so much Bends and OK . This is so pretentious is disgusting. They forgot the golden rules of great rock music! Experiment with sounds, Instrument, arrangement not with melodies! There is nothing on here that has been done before and much better by artist like Bowie, Eno or any German avant-garde bands from the seventies."},{"rating":"1","title":"artsy-fartsy crap","review":"alright folks, we need to quit listening to the artsy-fartsy critics trying to tell us how \\"revolutionary\\" this album is. These critics had led us to believe that it is so amazing that if we do not appreciate it, it's due to our own ignorance for art-rock. After making myself listen to this album just to find some redeeming quality, all I could dig up was the studio musicians they hired to play real instruments, only so they could play with it enough to make it slightly less distinguishable. The lyrics are repetitive, and his voice, quite annoying. Now if the words contained in the booklet underneath the disc-tray were the lyrics in the songs, This would be a wonderful CD, instead it's his whiny voice droning over some electronic noise they must have concocted in just a few hours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad experiment that never should have left the studio!","review":"I like Radiohead and their first three albums. So I gave this album half a year because I really wanted to like it. But not even a mother could love this one! This album never should have left the studio. Too bad, because I really like the alternative movement or what's left of it, except this record is worse than rap or disco. All the songs, but one, are too much electronica junk for me, sorely lacking in melody and songwriting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be too optimistic if you buy this cd.","review":"I love Radiohead. I mean, they're just awesome. But then came the sad day when I purchased \\"Kid A.\\" I was listening to it on my discman on the way to school. Man, was it horrible! To me, it sounds kind of like techno, except for \\"optimisic\\" and you know, that song really isn't that great. Well I guess if you like techno music this cd isn't too bad. But if you really appreciate Radiohead and their deep, meaningful lyrics, you'll probably dislike \\"Kid A\\" as I did.

Well Radiohead fans of course, no matter what awful music this group produces people will still go out and buy it. If you think the sound is new and innovative, it's not. Aphex Twin has been making the similar kind of music for years. I think with a good record deals music like this sells, gets into major magazines and TV slots.

Pepper\\", your \\"Pet Sounds\\", your \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\", your \\"Achtung Baby\\"... )I can't decide if Radiohead should take MORE drugs or less drugs, but I do know that they ought to stay away from music until they start falling in love with songs again. Because this is the sound of a band that at the moment hates music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Post-Modern Apocalypse Bomb!","review":"This album sounds more like a soundtrack to a futuristic movie of a high-tech apocalypse than something I would want to listen to for pleasure.

Perhaps this is what happens a band as mediocre as Radiohead gets too much media attention by music critics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely Horrible","review":"This music is meaningless and has no personality. Its funny how people call it \\"innovative\\" when it is anything but that. The vocals are horrible, and the lyrics are so pretentious drivel that they almost sound painfully like someone trying hard to be intellectual. There's no enjoyment to be had from this music. It does nothing to stir the soul. Its void and vapid. It has not real emotional connection to human hearts. Its made just for the sake of impressing people with something proposed as new and hip. Hipsters may like this piece of garbage, but I find it better to put it in the trash where it belongs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Follow-Up to OK Computer....","review":"Three years is a long time to wait for a follow-up to one of the best albums of all time. Radiohead has succeeded again with the mellow, dramatic \\"Kid A.\\" Less rock oriented than \\"Pablo Honey\\" or even \\"OK Computer,\\" this album is reminiscent of a very early, very experimental, Pink Floyd. The songs are melodic and mysterious, and gently lead the listener on a journey into a lesser explored genre of avant garde music. In a world of predictability and the boredom that arises as a result, this album is a refreshing reminder that great music still exists, and that true artists are never afraid of taking risks..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow down, dig in","review":"Like the idiots at the top of today's review list who jumped to dismiss it, I was unable to relate to this album at first. But slow down, give it a chance, learn to judge it on its own terms. It's one of the most astonishingly original albums out there. It's also catchy. The songs get stuck in your head, and they stay there, and they change your head a little once they're in.It's pop, in a time signature you never thought pop could exist in. It's dance music, but you don't quite have enough limbs to dance to it. Like reading Middle English, you have to learn a little bit about it before you feel it. But this is much better than Gawain and the Green Knight.Listening to this album, I actually felt joy in the subway during rush hour, because I was in the presence of something all those other people weren't. And because it was really hard to stop myself from shouting along to a song whose rhythm I couldn't even understand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glimpse of the Future","review":"This may be the greatest album I've ever heard.While it certainly isn't for everyone, it's hard to argue that this isnt a work of art. This album blends obscure, winding rythms with Thom Yorke's haunting voice to create an album so revolutionary it's no exaggeration to call this the equivelent of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, in progressiveness at least.However, if you felt the least bit alienated by Radiohead's 1997 CD, OK Computer, then you'll be completely lost in this one. The tracks in Kid A seem to blend together eventually to form one underlying ryhtm, best shown in the song \\"Morning Bell\\".I give no guarantee that you'll love it, but it worth a listen nonetheless."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like it, but....","review":"I LOVED The Bends and OK Computer (despite some people being put off by the experimentalism of the latter, I actually preferred it).Kid A took time to grow on me, and I still think the other two are better.

This is one of the most original cds i have ever heard and obviously they make what they want because it sounds good.

With or without guitars, Thom Yorkes voice and ear for a pop tune make Kid A instantly memorable and hummable (you will find yourself singing phrases of some of the songs the next day). However, one wonders where now for Radiohead-their efforts to produce and avant garde/experimental/less obvious piece of work have backfired as their pop talent overrides any desire to be \\"uncommercial\\". TO those who need three to four listens to get this record, you are not listening hard enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"not for everyone","review":"maybe i'm the odd-man out, but this album actually clicked with me quicker and more efficiantly than \\"ok computer\\", possibly because i've spent more time listening to autechre and can than any prog-rock. after listening to \\"kid a\\" probably hundreds of times, i'm still not bored with it in the least, because it's not an album that relies on immediate hooks or cheap thrills. it's mellow as hell for one thing; it's charisma is based quite a bit on atmosphere for another, and to be frank, it's not catchy at all. if you get it, it's beautiful, but it's apparent that not everyone does, and i understand that not everyone will. this is not an album for everyone. if anything, i feel that this album was made for me because it feels so personal. the best i can recommend is to keep an open mind. don't fight to understand it, because you won't. don't try. it's not a difficult album until you make it one. years later, this album still blows my mind. i don't know how else to describe it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool but different","review":"First of all this CD is great! While it isn't all that much like earlier Radiohead works, it is just as good. I personally like the songs The National Anthem, How To Disappear Completely, Optimistic, In Limbo, and Morning Bell. It has a different sound kinda like techno, but it's still rock, and it's still Radiohead. I think everybody should buy this CD no matter what they listen to! It is that good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ethereal soundtrack for the new millennium","review":"While it's not immediately accessible like \\"The Bends\\" (1995) and lacks the melodic hooks of \\"OK Computer\\" (1997), \\"Kid A\\" challenges the listener to grow with the band's sound. Defying conventional song structures on most of its tracks, \\"Kid A\\" grows more and more enjoyable with each repeated listening. \\"The National Anthem,\\" with its show-stopping horn finale, is enough to make you stand up and salute. A word to the uninitiated: To fully appreciate the band's aural accomplishment, listen to \\"The Bends\\" and \\"OK Computer\\" first."},{"rating":"2","title":"BYE BYE BRITNEY!","review":"If not for the exceptionally beautiful and human indulged musical triumph that you can hear in each note in each song on this entire album, then buy Kid A simply because this world is too full of Britney and N'Sync bullcrap. Kid A comes at a time when the musical landscape is desolate and bleak, deluged with unimpressive lyrics and juvenile melodies. Remember when Nirvana came out and kicked that freak Michael Jackson and his equally freaky sister Janet off the charts? Wasn't that a glorious time? We all felt sooo good. It feels even better now. Thank God for Radiohead and thank the Heaven's for Kid A. Stylistically, the songs on here range from Aphex Twin and Mu-ziq inspired drill and bass to Sinatra-esque crooning. All the songs on Kid A have a delightful moral: humans rule. Regardless of the technology you hear on this album, you can't help but be reminded, somewhere in the song, that there are a pair of human hands twisting the knobs or pushing the keys."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breathtaking","review":"This CD is amazing. I think Radiohead is possibley becoming the greatest band of the decade if not the millenium. With every CD comes a new and fantastic sound. If you like music you will love this album. Once you listen to it for the first time you get trapped in there music and you never want to leave."},{"rating":"2","title":"Radiohead's Best","review":"Why can't it be possible to rate some things with about seventeen stars? Amazon.com should look into it. Anyway... Right from the beginning, this is greatness. Everything In It's Right Place is fascinating. Thom's vocals are just kinda of catterwalling, but their brilliant. Kid A is entoxicating. The National Anthem is a meserizing and hypnotic pulse of bass and brass and just sounds never before heard in music. It's revolutionary and it's a spectacle. The National Anthem is probably the best song on here, but my favortie is Idioteque. It's sheer brilliance. It's some kind of techno-futureisitic iamgery of the end of the world. \\"Who's in a bunker? Who's in a bunker? Women and children first.\\" It's just sheer musical mastery. The music is perfect and I swear, for the life of me, Thom Yokr has the best voice of any singer, make or female, singing today."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent album, and an entirely new direction...","review":"I have to start by saying that anyone who is interested in buying this album based on the fact that they enjoyed \\"OK Computer\\" may want to borrow it from a friend first. It is a 180 degree turn in terms of the type of music. The album has an electronica/trance feel to it, and lack the guitar band sound that was so perfect on Radiohead's previous albums. Having said that the album is really amazing. It's the kind of music you'd play when you just want to sit down and space out. Diehard fans should run out and buy it right away, preferably in the special edition - which has a different cover. Overall, I simply don't have enough time to say all the wonderful things I want to say about this record. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Radiohead Gets 'Different'","review":"I've always loved Radiohead and the music they create. I've always overlooked their kind of arty pretense about music, but no longer. Kid A is by a long shot their most far reaching album, and one that tries too hard to be different. I realize they were trying to do something completely different and I wouldn't have minded had they done something of quality. But some of the songs could of have been written by my five year old cousin with a keyboard. Anyone can make ambiant sounds, but only a few people can write 'Paranoid Android' or 'Fake Plastic Trees'. There are a few saving graces, notably 'Optimistic', 'Idiotheque', and 'How to Disappear Completely', but not enough to save the album. I realize these are the only 'songs' to speak of, but they've given me nothing else. I'm sure some will hail this as the greatest album ever, but let's be honest, Ok Computer is a hell of a lot better than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"IT'S NOT THAT ....' EXPERIMENTAL!!!","review":"Right now i'm going to school to become an audio engineer so naturally I've critically listened to a lot of music and granted, there is such a thing as music that's too experimental... music that's inaccesible and rediculious. But people COME ON!!! ART IS SUPPOSED TO BE CHALLENGING!! Kid A IS NOT, i repeat IS NOT too experimental, you're just too closed minded! Believe it or not, I absolutely loved Kid A ever since i first heard it and no i don't say i love something just because it's Radiohead. It might have something to do with being a patinet listener, not demanding a sugar coated hook every ten seconds and appreciating the music for what it is. MTV and radio have ruined people's perception of good music. But don't worry, Amnesiac is much more songy and traditional except for \\"Pulk Pull Revolving Doors.\\" One last thing: ART MUST PROGRESS WITH MANKIND!! HELP IT OR GET OUT OF THE WAY!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Real Album","review":"Great Album. Totally different from the Pop trash that MTV and the mainstream pushes. It will be on the same level as Dark Side, and Sgt. Pepper. The vocals, bass lines, drums, electronics, all good. Although not as pleasant sounding as OK, it's just as good. The music is stunning and beautiful at the same time. Listen to it a few times, you'll like it. It's about time we hear some music with meaning and truth."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you want people to think you're cool, this CD is for you!","review":"Just when you thought that the music press had gotten over the \\"if it's British and trendy, it must be fab\\" disease, along comes the heralding of Radiohead's \\"Kid A\\" as a masterpiece. When Radiohead put their minds to it, they can product amazing, beautiful, sharp-edged Pop. This isn't it. THIS is a bad art-pop experiment, with only two actual songs, that is just overtly \\"arty\\" enough to dupe people into thinking it has a point. Surprise. It doesn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magical","review":"Anyone who dismisses this album is missing the point. This band is continuing to redefine rock music as we know it. If OK Computer was Radiohead's answer to the pre-millenial angst we all felt, then Kid A is it's offspring, asking which direction we are supposed to go in now. This resonates throughout the album. It is dense and dark, but completely accessible if you give it the chance. I hope Radiohead take their no-videos, no-singles approach to this record and sell the hell out of it. They are the best band around, and with this album have let traditional structure and melody take a backseat to the otherwordly soundscapes that are all over this album.Kid A is a brilliant calling from a far-away planet that other bands wish they could visit just once.Radiohead lives there."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST ALBUM I HAVE EVER HEARD","review":"This could very well be the greatest album created in the last 100 years and it only has 4 stars!!!!!!! Even 5 stars isn't enough. whats wrong with you poeple. do you know what art is? the poeple who rated this album low either didn't listen to this album enough to really understand it, or they don't have any kind of emotions which are responsible for making music sound good.KID A is even better than OK Computer. Their are more amazon reviews for kid A than dark side of the moon, OK computer, and any album I've ever heard of."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stop complaining and Trade Up!","review":"Lots and lots of complaining about the new Radiohead. People either love it or hate it, understandably. I have a solution: For all you people out there that loved Pablo Honey and the more mainstream material of the 'Heads should trade up and support Supergrass. I'm loath to use a tactic such as this to promote someone other than the review subject, but if there was ever a group of music lovers who should appreciate the lads it's Radiohead fans. I cannot support Supergrass enough. I have been listening to their CD's NONSTOP since I bought them and they are simply brilliant. No art prog posing or meloncholy musings here, just simply the catchiest, groovinist tunes I've ever heard. These guys could pick up the standard 'dropped' by Radiohead and CLUB YOU with it! Check the guys out, I love Radiohead, but Chaz and the lads are the future-count on it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"¿little Goldie influence?","review":"What happened with this album? What i want to know is how a talented group of musicians such as Radiohead can come out with masterpieces like \\"The Bends\\" and \\"OK Computer\\" and then come out with this. When i bought this CD i thought I'd hear at least something similar to the sound of Radiohead, but this is trach..techno trash..They have always been alittle techno..but they have just gone over the edge. The are hardly any lyrics and the ones that they do have are hardly Thom Yorke-esque. There is hardly any guitar..maybe one song..and way too much electronics..this has really made me think twice about the talent and individuality of this band. A very sad day for music."},{"rating":"2","title":"A CLASSIC, BEST RADIOHEAD","review":"KID A is by the best Radiohead album. In fact, the bands 3 best songs may be on that album (EVERYTHING IN ITS RIGHT PLACE, HOW TO DISAPPEAR COMPLETELY, and MORNING BELL). Conversely, OK COMPUTER is vastly overated.MY RANKINGS:1.

I like ever album that these guys have except this one, and I haven't had the time to go out and buy Amnesiac, but i'm not optimistic. This album is a synthesised piece of weird music. Don't get me wrong i'm all for weird music, but I need lyrics. What happened to the strange appocalyptic ramblings from Ok Computer, or the angst ridden vocals of The Bends. I mean come on, expermentation is fine, but something good should come out of it. All I hear when I put this on is some really synthesised singing along with some excedingly not Radiohead type of music. I got one over used phrase for these guys, \\"back to basics\\". Thats what they need to do. The survives the one star infamy because Optomistic is an excellent song. It's one of their best. Now heres hoping these guys can get back to what they are best at, making great alternative music."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm not fooled","review":"'Kid A' is a mess. To me this isn't really music; it's silly bleeps and squawks and unintelligible nonsense. I can hear that on any Stereolab record, thank you. This radical shift in their sound has alienated many fans, and rightly so. I know people will just gobble this up thinking it's life-altering music but if you want an album with proper songs look elsewhere. 'Kid A' limps out of the gate and hobbles home in a cloud of dust. The real big let down of 2000."},{"rating":"2","title":"why cant i rate this 4 ? i would have","review":"This album is great! I dont listen to it because i think i'm cool, or special or anything, if i do it. I think its the idiots who says that you are pretending to be special if you listen to this, that are stupid. Why are they saying that? Because they think theyre cool and original enough to say: \\"I have enough self confidence to say that i dont like it. I have figured all of you out\\". There! Youve got the whole situation turned upside-down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh - \\"Sentimental Drivel\\" - High Concept [stuff]","review":"This is the album that has come very close to ruining Radiohead for me. \\"Amnesiac\\" will have to be damn good to rescue my interest in the band. \\"Pablo Honey\\" was great, \\"The Bends\\" was exceptional, and \\"OK Computer\\" amazing, but \\"Kid A,\\" seems to be nothing to me except perhaps a subtle way to make fun of the record buying public... Is that why the album was originally going to be entitled \\"The Emperor's New Clothes\\"? Because it's not actually there at all? If not that then Radiohead really [messed]up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like nothing they've ever done.","review":"This new Radiohead album is nothing like their earlier work. It has the slight electronica feel of their previous 2 albums, but the music on this album is not nearly as varied as any of their other albums. Kid A is extremely laid back, which is nice at times, but at 50 minutes, this is a boring listen. I recommend their first 3 albums, and both EPs (My Iron Lung and Airbag) before this album. Then, if you want more Radiohead, give this a spin. Just keep your expectations at the level of background music, (e.g. Enya, Eno) which is unfortunate since these guys have the ability to write songs that command your attention."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less artsy...more fartsy","review":"This album is way off the deep end.

Regardless, I do believe that as a band you have the obligation to give fans what they want. The reason Radiohead has been so successful is their guitar-driven, opera-like, brilliantly unbelievable music. Guitar is almost completely eradicated on this record, and Thom's vocals, which in the past have been incredibly powerful and moving, are either used as backround or just not very passionate. I still have faith in Radiohead, they still have it in them. They are the best at what they do, I just hope they don't lose sense of what that is."},{"rating":"1","title":"What kind of air are they breathing???? if any","review":"Dear Radiohead and RadioheadersWhatever you were trying to express with this new CD if you expressed it as you wished, three cheers to you, but I must say that Kid A was a big disapointment to me. I think you would find it wise to your music your fans that love your music and yourselves to put away your computers your turntables and your London Symphony Orchestra and go back to your roots of being a Guitar Bass Drum Band, that was much more moving music, you don't need all the digital FX to get it all out...Creep Acoustic and Creep reg. was beautiful it makes me so emotional when i hear it but i'm not sure what Kid A makes me do except ask for my money back, sorry to sound dickish, but thats me.If I wanted Techno I would have bought Techno, i want Street Spirit Radiohead. Bring it back.Mikes"},{"rating":"1","title":"unoriginal","review":"I'm giving Kid A just two stars because most of the praise regarding this album refers to its so-called originality. Maybe for most people who listen to nothing but mainstream music (i'm not making a judgment, just stating an observation) this is original, however, if you have ever listened to Aphex Twin, Haujobb, Delerium, Autechre, Orbital, DJ? Acucrack, THD, etc., it's obvious that none of Kid A is original and quite frankly, it's been done better. That's not to say that this is a completely terrible album, however, i feel that this is probably one of the most overrated albums ever and bands that have already made (better) music similar to this are getting seriously screwed over (but that's usually how the music industry works)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thom Yorke, the Britney Spears of the art school","review":"This time Radiohead has finally done it: created music that only spoiled white kids can understand. It is music that, had it come out ten years ago, might have been considered experimental. But they are not an experimental band. The only experiment they are doing is trying to make an album that sounds equally as good in their fans' Volkswagens as it does on their Imacs."},{"rating":"1","title":"limited edition","review":"I am submitting this review for the limited edition packaging. I am giving it 1 star not for the content of the album but for the fact that there really isn't anything in the limited edition packaging that couldn't have been included in the CD booklet that comes with the regular release. It is unjustifiable to charge more for this version as opposed to the regular version. This packaging is reminicent of a hard cardboard childrens book. It is only four pages of paintings of iceburgs plus a sleeve for the cd. There is no CD extra track. Get the regular release and save some money. It's what on the disk that counts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Radiohead's BEST","review":"The first time I heard it i was like \\"what the hell....where's all the guitars???\\" I really hated it when it came out. Divine Intervention caused me to listen to it again, and now i LOVE it. See, what's so great about this album is that the experimentation just blends beautifully with their music. Sure, a lot of bands have done it... but just take one listen to U2's Discotheque and realise that Radiohead is the one of the few band that truelly mastered this. And I LOVE IT, How can you say that OK Computer is their best album??? It's not, Kid A and Amnesiac are!!!Oh and THOSE ORGAN OPENING NOTES on \\"Everything is in its right place\\", ISNT IT THE MOST HAUNTING YOU'VE EVER HEARD????"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Buy this CD already!!!","review":"This is such an amazing CD.

Once the addiction starts it is tough to quit."},{"rating":"1","title":"save your money","review":"This is trash ~ they ought to give it away for free~ why anyone would pay anything for this is beyond me.

Its so BORING! I dont even want to compare it with ok computer, or even the bends. Whats with the synthesizer? I can understand it being on a couple of tracks, but damn not the whole album. Where are the guitars? Wheres the edge? This is not the same band that gave us \\"creep\\" \\"paranoid android\\" and \\"lucky the tourist\\" Im not asking for much, just a little to keep me awake. Believe me, I tried my hardest to like this album. I really did. But it never happened. This is the type of album that would make perfect elevator music.

I wish I would have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Little too Late","review":"If you are under the impression that \\"kid a\\" is in any way a new sound or something groundbreaking, you have been fooled. Although it is really admirable that Radiohead have the ability to reinvent themselves in most of their records that does not make them new or good. All of the music played sampled and done in this record, has been done a long time ago by such visionaries as Aphex Twin, Red Snapper, GYBE, Looper and others. If you are a music fan, interested in good quality non-classical music buy those artists. If you are in the mood for reworked pop go ahead purhcase Kid A."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ohhhh, farmed out man, like right outta state!!","review":"Give me a break.

Everything is in it's Right Place is almost unlistenable, with its splinters of Thom Yorke's vocals flickering in sporadically. The soft, keyboard atmospherics wear thin extremely quickly and are repetitive. After 10 listens, this album still doesn't hit, and there is not one song that I am going to put on my Best of Radiohead Mini-Disc. People who have been enjoying the album, answer this question: Do you truly like the album for its music and that alone, or is it only because it is a Radiohead release that you are prepared to accept it? In taking away the hype, forgetting which band released Kid A and concentrating upon the music alone, you are left with a very poor album indeed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuccck.....","review":"I've suspected it since that cringe-inducing song \\"Creep\\" off Pablo Honey.

Kid A might be one of the biggest let-downs (no pun intended) of all time! That said I do love \\"How To Disappear Completely\\" and \\"Optomistic\\" is OK. But the rest is like they found out what keyboard effects could do and couldn't stop playing with them. A liken this to something in a design program you can't stop doing no matter how cheesy it is. Radiohead have simply chosen to under-achieve. That will be more than enough for the brainless masses known as their \\"true fans\\".

This is honestly one of the worst album I have ever listened to, and what makes it worse is we all know that Radiohead is capable of such greatness. OK Computer was certainly not what any of us expected but it was able to combine experimentation with the rock vibe we except from Radiohead. However, Kid A seems to take experimentation far beyond anything that could be considered rock or alternative or whatever you want to call it. Radiohead has said that commercial success has never been their goal and that is made abundantly clear on this album. They seem to have thrown the guitars out the window and traded them in for keyboards. Even the traditionally outstanding vocals of Thom Yorke are lost in the over experimentation. So unless you are a huge Radiohead fan I suggest that you pass on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the Truth About this CD","review":"Personally, I enjoyed htis band's previous albums. They had good singing, music, and lyrics.I can't say the same for the new album. The band appears to have forgotten how to sing during their years of fame.

Ok Computer grabbed you by the neck, and immersed you in cerebral atmosphere. Here, the musical aura comes to you spontaneously. You're literally radiating in it. This album has some serious textural beauty to it. Sounds ranging from a child's music box in \\"Kid A\\" to the wind-instruments in \\"Nation Anthem,\\" no other album is so submerging. Instruments varied throughout; every song has a different vibe to it.Art-rock does not get any more experimental then this. The exotic time signature of \\"Everything In It's Right Place\\" will make you giddy, and \\"Idioteque's\\" furious beat will make you jump out the second floor in adrenaline. With that said, I would like to mention \\"Motion Picture Soundtrack\\" is my favorite track of all- time. Now this song, this song will make you sad. Thom Yorke's voice is a powerful instrument."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"Most of the qualities that made The Bends and OK Computer great, such as great songwriting and musicianship are absent on this CD. Its almost like they tried so hard to be different from every other band that they forgot to write good songs along the way. Don't get me wrong. Its still better than most of the other CDs that are coming out lately. However, its really frustrating to listen to this boring, lifeless music, when you know they are capable of so much more. I hope they saved the best songs for their new one coming out in the spring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't get it","review":"Huge Radiohead fun. But this album is hard to get into.

Garbage is garbage, no matter how the mind attempts to convince you that you're not the idiot you are for time and money wasted on this junk. Radiohead has played a joke on its fans and is laughing at all the acclaim heaped on it by fans. This ain't the cosmic leap from Help to Rubber Soul or Revolver to Sgt Pepper. This is the same noise that George Harrison released 34 years ago on Wonderwall music. There were a few deluded Beatles fans who were convinced that it was quite genius back then, too. Heck, let's face it, as wild futuristic avant garde musicians, Kid A doesn't even compare to Yoko Ono's stuff. Sad thing is if Yoko put out an album of mechanical warblings and slapped the Radiohead name on it, the same people here who love this album would love that one even more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor songwriting and Weak Style","review":"Rock music can be judged on two bases--style and songwriting(i.e substance). \\"Kid A\\" features some of the worst songwriting in recent rock. One star for \\"Idioteque,\\" the one good song in the entire album. (Fortunately, the band crafted better tunes for \\"Hail to the Thief.\\")Record label markets the band as leading the revolution in wedding electronica to rock music. I beg different. Stylistically, Radiohead is neither leading, nor the best in the sub-genre of techno rock. To put is bluntly, they are not the first band mixing rock with techno...and they do not even do it well. One more star for trying too hard, yet failing to impress.For techno rock done right, check out U2's 90s Euro-trilogy, or anything by NIN, or Massive Attack's \\"Mezzanine.\\"One more thing: please do not compare Radiohead to Pink Floyd.

Radiohead try to be abstract, but they don't get it, they just became un-understandble, this is not vanguardist, this is not 'new era', this is just namby-pamby. if you 'like' Radiohead, why don't you try TheVerve? you will find out what should be called abstract."},{"rating":"1","title":"ive just heard it, oh my god!","review":"its awful. i know they were going for indevidualism and uniqueness but this is way o.t.t its just noise. id tape it for the sake of the two ok songs. if your expecting a ok computer, give it a miss!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Is \\"Kid A\\" short for \\"Kid Awful\\"?","review":"Pretentious, droning music that wouldn't have even made Pink Floyd's b-sides.

Ok Computer was just that, OK, but this album shows just how easy it is for mediocre musicians to pick up the label \\"experimental\\" to justify selling their meaningless meanderings to the public. I've tried to be open minded towards this group, asking my friend to play it for me on various occasions. Each time I can't help but want to throttle that whinny vocalist (He's NO singer) and ask the band just what the point is. They just go nowhere. Do yourself a favor, don't believe the people who Desperately want them to be the next Can, (This tripe will never be timeless, unless everyone loses their soul), listen to the Bends and appreciate it for what Radiohead really is-A bunch of whinny rich people who accidentaly wrote half an album of alright tunes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad music, but genius just the same","review":"I think Thom made Kid A and Amnesiac to make fools of the reviewers, critics, and bandwagon jumping fans.

Just in a different way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shock treatment","review":"I have no idea how this makes it into the charts as a good album or a good band. Senseless is the key word.

Save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"This album is simply amazing! Lush with layers of organs, synths, and tons of unusual sounds, this album far surpases OK Computer in experamentation. Definitely not their best melody wise, but the cd makes up for that with its bare emotion from singer Thom Yorke.The only thing keeping it from five stars was the lack of melody. However some may not see this as a weakness at all. It can be used as a strength"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant, Complex","review":"I've already heard this CD 4 times straight through and it is really addictive. Funky, dense, lush, slightly left of center; this is not a rehash of Radiohead's earlier work but more an evolution of the themes expressed brilliantly on OK Computer.Kid A (the title refers to the first human clone) is not a record that immediately gives up it's charms, but one that must be listened to and cherished like the classic album it is destined to be. Just listen to the wild, horn filled \\"NationalAnthem\\", the opener \\"Everything In It's Right Place\\" and \\"Optimistic\\" and be swept up in it's glorious musical visions. I already have and can't wait to hear it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing like you ever heard...","review":"well they did it again (but not the same) Radiohead doesn't repeat their music, they come a little bit different and they come out big and sound great Definetely the best CD that came out in the last few years and the few to come..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kid A is quite possibly the best Radiohead ever","review":"I'm sure Kid A will lose a lot of Radiohead fans who loved the guitar rock of the Bends and the smooth melodic OK Computer. I'm also sure that Kid A will gain some new Radiohead fans. Kid A is one amazing album that you have to sit down and listen to in one listen. You can't skip tracks. It's all one piece of art and it leaves you speechless and wanting for more.This is the best Radiohead has put out to date."},{"rating":"1","title":"bah!","review":"band starts off modestly; band gains attention; band gets really good; band attains well-deserved popularity; band gets great; band receives well-deserved respect......band spits on it.this album is a sham. a perfect example of a group of supremely talented musicians reaching the highest level of worldly fame, where they can do no wrong, and thereafter spending a few addled nights in a studio, eventually releasing to the world (as a sort of grand esoteric, private joke) and album most of our little brothers and sisters could have created. i speak in hyperbole, of course...but just barely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just plain boring","review":"More than 7 years have gone since this record was released and I still don't get it. I don't get the average Radiohead fan hype about something so daring and original, which it is, but in all honesty Kid A doesn't give me the one bit of thrill, emotion and the desire to keep listening to an album over and over again like it did with OK Computer. I've spent years and years expecting this album to \\"grow on me\\" because that's what everybody's been telling, and still Kid A is remains collecting dust in my shelf, and I've given it more than enough chances to prove me wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kid A has changed music for me, in a good way","review":"I recently purchased Kid A, being a casual Radiohead fan. I owned Pablo Honey and OK Computer, and was interested to see what they were able to come up with next. From the moment I slipped my headphones on I was stunned. Radiohead is experimenting with sound textures in such a way as to create a CD unlike anything you've ever heard before---a total departure from their previous efforts. Now everything I hear on the radio sounds horribly dated and shallow. What did Thom Yorke say in \\"Meeting People Is Easy\\"? \\"Alternative rock music is a stale format, like a fridge buzzing.\\"? That's what the current crop of music sounds like to me now - a fridge buzz.

A friend slipped it into my cd player and I was instantly sucked into the gorgeous tapestry that is Kid A. I get the feeling that it either hits you somewhere deep inside and reverberates through you in brilliant ripples, or else goes right over your head. I'm intoxicated like I haven't been by an album since I was a teenager. Thank you radiohead!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Altered States in Sonicland","review":"To be fair, I cannot compare this album to 'OK Computer'. As much as I would like to, considering the excellence of Radiohead's 1997 Grammy-winning effort, it would not do justice to the group's spirited -and spiritual- latest offering.The album kicks off with Yorke jumping straight into the melancholy moat. Is it a Moog? Sounds like one. Either way, the droning warmth of the ancient keyboard's vacuum tube sound casts an eerie fluorescence on what sounds like what should have been the soundtrack to '1984'. However, don't dismiss Radiohead as just another Smiths' revival, caught revelling in the swanky side of death or subjugating all the happy people on this Earth to hell.While 'OK Computer' stayed within the lines of technology and despair, -even throwing in some HAL 9000-like heuristics for those not schooled in how to live- 'Kid A' crosses the line into subliminal ecstacy and still manages to get its message across."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bringing it to the next level","review":"Let me just put it out there.... this album is amazing, that's really all that needs to be said."},{"rating":"2","title":"GENIUS! A MUST FOR THE ANTI POP LISTENER","review":"Radiohead is not for the everyday rock/pop listener. If you are drawn to music that conjures trippy images, much like a good film score, Pink Floyd or Zeppelin 'B' side track can, this album is for you, as well as past work by Radiohead. I consider their work to be one of the premiere creative influxes of pseudo pop music in the past decade. Innovative, with a true creative focus (rather than what makes albums sell to the many), Radiohead will be regarded as one of the true alternatives to mass mainstream music. And \\"Kid A\\" is only another example of their creative prowess. I hope they never achieve total popularity. To do so would only put Radiohead in the all too simple trend for boring, standardized, and fabricated pop music. Listeners need to listen before they finally get what's going on.Thanks from Seattle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant?","review":"Okay, I read about the anticipation and anticipated myself. Read lots of reviews then came here to hear from real fans. Some positive and a lot of them negative at first. Well, I decided I would not buy the album, not having heard much Radiohead other than Creep and buying OK Computer and a friend borrowing it for the past two years (he moved away).Well, impulse gave in and with low expectations this album blew me away on the first listen. Kid A is one of the most brilliant albums I have ever heard. The opening track, Everything In Its Place sets the tone of the album with its delicate synth chords. Moving through this sonic journey I felt a full range of emotions.How To Disappear Completely has to be the most haunting yet beautiful pieces of music ever put on tape, where Optimistic sounds just plain angry.Skeptic of the critics at first then it blew my expectations out of the water. Kid A is true brilliancy and raises the bar for the rest of pop."},{"rating":"1","title":"ok - you can come out now","review":"Experimentation is great. But this sounds too much like we've dropped in on a selection of ideas that remain half formed.It's as if Radiohead have put out a work in progress.

If you took ANY of these \\"songs\\" and put it on OK Computer, what would be the worst song on that album? I thought so. It's just not creative. As a musician, I know in my mind and heart if I'm making something creative, or just something different for different's sake. This is the latter. Call it avante-garde or whatever, I'll call it an ego-driven \\"we-can-put-anything-out-and-they'll-buy-it\\" piece of pap. Sounds like they took the easy way out.

When I played this CD I couldn't believe I was listening to the same band. All the virtues for which I've loved them before -- fantastic melodies, Thom Yorke's aching and beautiful voice, the band's raw ensemble power -- are either gone or so muted as to be feather-light, as substantive as fog. \\"How to Disappear Completely\\" offers some slight glimmers of beauty, but most of the other tracks are just derivative, meandering, unpleasant suicide-soundtrack music.

Whoa... has pop music really sunk so far? The lead singer's voice sounds like a 15-year-old boy in the throes of puberty gone bad. The \\"songs\\" are boring and pointless.

Why anyone would willingly spend money on this overblown bit of tripe is beyond me."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Album is simply horrible","review":"I love OK Computer as much as the next Radiohead fan, but that doesn't mean I automatically have to love everything else they put out as it appears many here do. Garbage is garbage no matter who puts it out, and Kid A is nothing but that. The truth is, if an unknown band put out this cd of noise no one here that gave it 5 stars would do the same. Sorry Radiohead, but save the experiments for b-sides...unless your goal was to alienate your biggest fans. Avoid this piece of over-hyped trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inane warbling","review":"Unmelodic, discordant, mindless twaddle.I think the joke is on the listener here. Radiohead are trying to alienate their audience or are excercising some internal demons or something and unlike ourselves they have taken the liberty of sharing their misgivings with the general populace - very extravagant of them I must say.Saying this is a concept CD or whatever is just misguided code for I want to like this album cause I worship Radiohead but what I really mean is its crap and I barely ever listen to it! :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Ultimate Disappointment","review":"After one good and two great albums Radiohead wanted to explore new grounds, which is actually quite understandable. Unfortunately they failed to come up with something of any real interest or substance.There is not one real good song on this album. There are occasionally interesting sounds and passages, but most of it sounds like the soundeffects of a weird computer-game.For me this album was the ultimate disappointment of year 2000.

It simply lacks the melodies present in ok computer that are also absent in pablo honey and the bends. Whining unintelligeble vocals are alright if they flow with the music, but in Kid A, the music is just as whining and unintelligeble. Not worth the plastic it's printed on."},{"rating":"1","title":"radiohead gets a casio","review":"This album reminds me of college; being snowed in at someones dormroom and their annoying roommate breaks out there casio keyboard because ther is nowhere to go and nothing to do and you are all out of cheap beer and wine and nothing to eat but microwavible popcorn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull as dirt","review":"I can't get over how boring I find this album.

I came home disappointed and empty handed. I'm giving this album 2 stars not because the quality of the music warrants it and not because it \\"sounds like Super Mario\\", but it is more to spite all the music reviewers who are gushing over it saying how ground breaking it is. It's great to see that a mainstream band is using its plateform to release material that is challenging the status quo of popular music and judging by the responses of some reviewers, it is a little too challenging for some; but, the electronic side of this music is far, far too similar to that of the music put out by Warp Records 2,3,4 years ago, especially that of Aphex Twin and Boards of Canada. I wouldn't be surprised if Radiohead bought Richard D. James (aka. Aphex Twin) a box of twinkies and a new tank for producing Kid A."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing and boring","review":"I'm sorry but if I bottled my dog's excrement it would be better than this garbage-- Kid A.

I would not recommend this horse bowel movement to my worst enemy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Everything...in its Wrong Place","review":"Radiohead have gone too far here. They have released an album that is 10 songs and 49 minutes of complete noise. I agree with the 109 1-star reviews that this album has so far, and I'm about to make it 110. This album was a complete waste.I can't bear to talk long about such a bad album. \\"OK Computer\\" was one of the best albums ever. If they had just stopped there at that cross between genuine rock music and computer experimentation...but no, they had to take it one step farther. On this CD, they almost completely ditched guitars. \\"Kid A\\" seems an appropriate title, as any Kid A could have ran around the studio for 49 minutes pushing notes on various synthesizers.Overall, this album is a sincere disappointment. I recommend you buy it only as use for a drink coaster or if you are seriously considering committing suicide. Other than that, you will regret this purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Trash","review":"This album is to music what Andy Warhol was to art -- a retelling of \\"The Emporer's New Clothes.\\" For all its hype and great reviews, I found this album to be comletely unlistenable.

Unfortunately, that's not the case here, since the record is worse than mediocre, and the great band was nowhere to be heard--all I heard was a bunch of synthesizers. Also take into consideration that you don't need crunchy hooks to make a record, but after this one, I'm beginning to think that in order to be listenable, they may be a necessary evil. Let people tell you you're not a real music fan, and that you don't appreciate the subtle genius that is displayed here, and then take your money and buy something with a melody. All I have to say about this album is caveat emptor. I'll keep listening to it for the time being only because, now that I bought it, I'm going to milk it for every penny it's worth.

I understand the band's desire to always break new ground but Kid A is a side of Radiohead I just can't get into. Strange, rambling, electronic experimentation just isn't my bag baby. A lot of the music on Kid A seems like endless, self-indulgent, electronic gibberish that just goes nowhere. Those of you who can appreciate Kid A, have a good time. I have to sit this one out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blows","review":"Radiohead put out one of the greatest albums of all time (OK), and now we get this shallow, pretentious tripe? I'm a huge fan of experimental music, but only when it has some truth beneath it. And for those of you who have been comparing this release to J.S. Bach, you should be ashamed of yourselves. That man was a genius. This CD isn't clever, it just blows. Ebay bound."},{"rating":"1","title":"No new ground broken here. Been there, done that...","review":"It is appaling to hear those who say this is new and original groundbreaking stuff. I don't think so. Just listen to Bartz, Laraaji, Vangelis, Larry Fast's Synergy, and Eno. These soundscapes have been explored and created before. Just because Thom Yorke mixes in some disjointed vocals and a bit of simplistic bass in there does not a groundbreaking release make! This has got to be the most pretentious, boring carbon copy music i've ever heard. A great cure for insomnia. The masses have been fooled once again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Letdown from OK Computer...What happened??","review":"I was just exposed to Radiohead for the first time a few weeks ago with \\"OK Computer\\" after Amazon's glowing reviews... and was blown away by its complexity and variety of texture... certainly challenging by popular music standards... or the standards of any musical genre, for that matter.And on that wave of enthusiasm, I acquired \\"Kid A\\"... so what is this... musically shallow Dance/Techno?? Were it not for the familiar lead voice, you wonder if it is the same band at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"An album that will take at least 10 full listens to understand.

It flows more than Ok computer, and is a breath of fresh air to the music market."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Instant Classic","review":"I thought I had heard the absolute best in music 3 years ago, when I listened to OK Computer. Let me assure you all that this record represents not only an incredible follow-up to an already classic album, but also a revolution in popular music. With Kid A, Radiohead have chosen to abandon the path followed by \\"mainstream\\" groups and create a road all their own. Without a doubt, this is the most spine-chilling collection of sound I have ever heard, and it is also the most breathtakingly brilliant recording I have ever listened to. If you want to hear music at its most dynamic and original, then look no further than Kid A. It may confuse and even shock some people, but it will never disappoint."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could there be a better album?","review":"After the lengthy wait for Kid A to arrive in stores, I've finally gotten a copy. This album is more amazing than any of they're previous three (full album) releases. Radiohead has outdone themselves this time. The music brings you back to the days of the Bends album, but also sets you forth into the realm of the unknown future of the record industry. It makes me wonder how an artist could write such wonderfully complex music and make it as beautiful as Radiohead has done here. They truly are the best, and most unique band in the world. They're hard work has truly paid off with this album. It is a must have for music fans of any genre all around the world. Thom Yorke has the amazing ability to melodically set a person at ease on tracks such as \\"How to Disappear Completely\\" and \\"Optimistic\\". Trust me, just BUY it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW","review":"I loved OK Computer - and I went and bought this right away on the day of its release. I didn't know what to expect - but was hoping for something like the OK Computer album.

Open your mind, close your eyes and listen - its simply unbelievable that ART like this can be created for your ears."},{"rating":"2","title":"First Listen is Not Enough...","review":"This album is a true mind-trip that gets better every time you listen to it.

With hauntingly emotional vocals and trance like synth, this album not only sucks you in, but transports you to another place. I can't stop listening to it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ahh... The sweet, sweet sounds of Radiohead","review":"This album is brilliant. If you like the crap that is played on the majority of radio stations here in the US, don't buy this album. You'll hate it. I love this album. I also liked Pablo Honey,The Bends and Ok Computer, all for different reasons. This is a band that is evolving. That's what you're supposed to do. Other bands might want to try it. It's nice to listen to."},{"rating":"2","title":"A worthy successor to OK Computer","review":"If The Bends was Radiohead's best collection of individual songs and OK Computer was their best concept album in terms of listening to it all in one sitting, then Kid A is one of the most \\"non-mainstream\\" commercial releases I've heard in a very long time. My personal favorites are Everything In Its Right Place, The National Anthem, How To Disappear Completely (and never be found), Optimistic and the brilliant Idioteque. I'm looking forward to their next album which should be out in early 2001 and will supposedly contain some \\"singles\\" and more \\"accessible\\" material. Whatever? ;) Kid A is best listened to as a thematic journey into isolationism, detachment and the melancholy side of life. Enjoy... you won't be disappointed.- \\"And if there's one thing I can't stand, it's up.\\" -"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mixed Feelings.","review":"I have mixed feelings about Kid A. Some of the songs, such as Optomistic, How to Disappear completely, and Idioteque deserve five-star ratings without question. Radiohead went in a radically different direction from OK Computer and I felt that some experiments succeeded where others didn't. This being said, Kid A's good songs make it one of my favorite albums. There aren't any bad tracks... but I just felt that not all of them deserved five or even four-star ratings."},{"rating":"2","title":"strange. .. but not in a bad way","review":"In this generation where being so HARD and so HEAVY was this big push it's unreal that this cd was ever made. Don't kid yourself, your a long way from the radiohead of yesteryear. This cd is extremely subdued and mellow. I listened to this cd with an open mind.. i'd never heard too much of the previous works of radiohead.. and came out with an eerie sensation. This cd is truly great. Radiohead has made an unquestionable leap in a new direction.. hell, good luck even trying to describe or name where they stand now! Kid A is a strange trip though some unknown world as bleak as the mountainous scene on the front cover. But it's a great journey. It's obvious to me that many people won't like this cd, because it just is THAT radically different. If your ready to explore your musical tastes and yourself, then plug in the odd aura of Kid A and drift away.. or be dragged away violently."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Lowest of the Best","review":"Lets face facts,if this album was not by Radiohead the majority of you people wouldn't go near it. It is a lazy attempt to try something new but the ideas are stale and the overall effect is boring album. I think Radiohead have the potential to be one of the greatest bands of all time but this is a backward step in their evolution. If you want to hear this type of experemental concept executed properly pick up Low or Heros by Bowie. I also think that the fact that radiohead are planning to release another album so hastily can be seen as a sonic apoligy, and I for one are looking forward to forgiving them."},{"rating":"2","title":"something different, even for radiohead","review":"Many have said this continues radiohead's evolution. But you can't really know. The next album may have more of those wild but rare guitar riffs on the previous two albums. Anyways, for me, this album is like all of their other ones. The first time through i was thinking, \\"pretty good, but a little odd.\\" The second time, \\"now it the odd makes sense, and fits.\\" The third time, \\"this is totally badass.\\" I ordered it before release, and ever since i got it delivered its been in my cd player. If i hasd to pick a favorite song, it would probably be the national anthem. Maybe because it has a that OK computer dark sound that i love. maybe because i play trombone. But don't get me wrong, i like all the tunes on Kid A just as much.All in all, its as good as the bends and ok computer, but even less rock n' roll. For huge rock fans like me, that takes a little getting used to. Only thing bad is that i may have to wait another 3 or so years for another album this good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Let's Carry On Marching Into The Light","review":"Oh, please.I keep reading all these reviews condemning Kid A as not being half as good as the \\"incomparable\\" OK Computer. If I remember right when OK Computer came out it received the same response: \\"How can Radiohead do an album like this after the incomparable Bends?\\"And for those of you whining about the lack of words in the liner notes, try looking INSIDE your case. I'm sure you'll find something interesting there.Also, will people please stop alternately hoping that Radiohead will either:A: Save Rock.B: Single-handedly kill Rock/Pop.They're very, very good. But give Thom and friends a break. If we leave them alone and they continue to put out albums as beautiful as they have been the world will be a better place. Just don't expect them to save anything.Oh, and Kid A ate my soul. In my humble opinion its fabulous and baffling. Just the way I like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely Overrated","review":"I wanted to like this album. I really did. Many people are saying how they have \\"reinvented music\\". That's a load of rubbish. There are a few interesting odds and ends, but overall the album is just not very listenable. Radiohead has made great music on their past albums and I think most people are grading this album on past accomplishments. It's mostly pompous, overblown noise. Don't believe the hype."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant.....of course","review":"This one may take you a while to get into...unless you're a member of the Obessesed Radiohead Fans Association, like me. This album is simply put, beautiful. Kid A is the most original and intelligent thing to come out this year, so chock full of raw emotion , you might just cry like Thom did the first time he heard it all the way through. My personal favorites on the CD are \\"Idioteque\\"-the darkly twisted technoish dancey song (once you hear it you'll understand why it's so hard to explain...the songs almost disintegrate into sound...) and \\"Motion Picture Soundtrack\\", which is gorgeously sad. Kid A is more of an emotional experience than an album. Buy it now, you need it."},{"rating":"2","title":"radiohead's best album to date","review":"This highly anticipated release is completely different from all of RH's previous albums. Alot of people expected them to create another 'OK Computer' but they did quite the opposite. 'Kid A' is brilliant, however, those expecting a rock or pop album are in for a rude awakening. The band has taken on new horizons, mostly offering composotions rather than conventional songs. 'The National Anthem' is my favourite track on the album, which concludes with a John Zorn-eque frenzy of saxophone and guitars. All of the tracks on this CD are classics, a fine example of a band that isn't afraid to push limits and create their own boundaries."},{"rating":"2","title":"This record is worth the cash for \\"Idioteque\\" alone.","review":"Enough said. if you dont like this record it's because you dont understand it.

Quite a brilliant CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"no words","review":"no words can describe this album. its weird and its mellow and its brilliant. i just love it. its as far as you can get from the commercialism in music these days. even rock and metal groups are selling out and rock is following the same path as pop. but radiohead seem to stay firm. listen for great tracks like 'how to disappear completely', 'optimistic', 'the national anthem' among others. the most sensational track, however, is 'idioteque'. i keep rewinding it every time i hear it. its just pure, deep, haunting, beautiful music. this is one of the greatest albums ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth The Wait","review":"Radiohead have always been a band that i have admired, as they are always setting examples for other bands to follow. The new album is full of top quality songs ranging from Treefingers and Kid A to Idiotegue and Morning bell. Any Radiohead fan will like the album and i think this new one will also them a legion of new fans"},{"rating":"1","title":"Get the 5-starred jewel-cased version.","review":"The artwork and cover for that matter are much better on the original version.

Whatever the meaning or interpretation you will be changed."},{"rating":"2","title":"great album","review":"kid a is like listening to something completely different. i don't think any particular review would do it justice, but i'll try anyway.it starts off with a great beat, goes to strange electronics, melodic flow, back to good giutars and ends with a song that lulls you into a dream. this album is great in its diversity and comprehensiveness.i don't think it's for everyone though. sometimes listening to it once isn't enough either. the more you listen, the more the album grows on you. it's rooted deep into me now, anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"Radiohead's second good album","review":"Radiohead couldn't ever seem to quite get it right. They tried Brit-rock (Pablo Honey, The Bends) and that was terrible. They tried straight electronic (Amnesiac) and that was downright revolting. Only when they've mixed the two, on 1997's OK Computer and on this, Kid A, the more electronic of the two, does everything work out. The album starts with the average Everything in it's Right Place, but then moves on the impressive, suprisingly upbeat (trippy?) Kid A. Following is possibly Radiohead's greatest song of all time, the bass and horn heavy The National Anthem. Trumpets that go in seemingly no direction at all and a simplistic, yet incredible bass line provide for a great expierence. The almost equally impressive How to Dissapear Completely follows. Other standouts include Optimistic, In Limbo and Idioteque (which is amazing live, by the way). ... An impressive outing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get enriched","review":"Sophisticated beauty. That's what it is. Simple, minimalistic melodies, let alone the lyrics, and yet, beautiful. Very high concentration of pure beauty in your room. And you know what's great about it? Beauty is cathartic. Lisen to it, and see how your soul will be recovering from all the pain of the outer world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Be Scared... It's All Good","review":"There isn't much to say about this album because it's not easy to put into words. I would just recommend an open mind. If you're worried about charts, videos, or what other people think -- this isn't for you. Definitely for the mature listener. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Radiohead does it again.......","review":"As a fan of Radiohead for years, even before MTV had discovered them, I was initially a bit shocked by this album. I have every Radiohead album and a few imports, and this one definately breaks into new territory. But at the same time it embodies the qualities that makes Radiohead an excellent band. My advice is to give the album a few listens. If initially you don't like it, it will grow on you, until you are in love with it. Trust me on this. I've been listening to Kid A just about everyday now for months, and it's excellent. Contrary to what has been said, Radiohead didn't create this album to alienate fans or revolutionize a genre. It's refreshing to see a band consistantly put out great albums without becoming repetitive or boring. Fans may also want to order Amnesiac, which is hitting stores in June and can be pre-ordered on amazon. I've listened to the upcoming album a few times and its outstanding as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Expansive","review":"Radiohead never bores you. This album is an expansion of the ever-evolving sound of the most innovative band out there. I wouldn't reccommend it to Backstreet Boys and Britney fans. Must listen with an open ear."},{"rating":"2","title":"Evolution, not repetition","review":"I'm not a radiohead groupie I came to radiohead through this album, and I loved it from the first listening for its uncluttered and content-rich experimentation, its poignant and smart lyrics, but mostly for the depth of feeling the band's infused into their use of new music media and their brilliant use of (often imitated but rarely, as here, used well) non-hierarchical composition. If you're trying to compare one of their releases to another one, you're wasting your time. The attitude, quality of songwriting, and that emotion have remained consistent, while their songwriting construction and use of their media has evolved from Pablo Honey by leaps and bounds - what impresses me most about this band is they never repeat their success - they reinvent it entirely each time. The sample tracks from Amnesiac offer a glimpse of the next step. The consciousness that wants to unify their records is something Radiohead itself would rail against. Celebrate the differences."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Cracking Album!","review":"Kid A is simply a great album. I was never a huge diehard Radiohead fan, I liked a lot (if not most) of their songs but never bought any of their previous albums but when I heard this album I just had to buy it. Listen to it youself and see what you think, but it has my vote."},{"rating":"2","title":"Radiohead's Metamorphosis Continues","review":"With this album Radiohead continue to reinvent themselves yet again, proving that they are the most innovative, intelligent and talented band on the planet. While at times wishing for more of the aching beauty of \\"OK, Computer\\", overall this record does not disappoint. \\"Kid A\\" may be accessible only for the open minded, but if you had a closed mind you wouldn't be on this page would you?"},{"rating":"2","title":"You really need to be in the mood for this!","review":"As someone who declared in 1994 that Radiohead would be the U2 of the 1990s, I've always been amazed by the talent of this British group. They're very literate, write songs that are full of intricacies, and are well-written. Each album seems to be better than the last. But then comes this album. Everything you've read about it's experimental sound is certainly true. The problem is, it is not often a very melodic album. So if you're in the mood to hear what Thom Yorke and Co. are doing to explore the possibilities of music, you will enjoy this album. If you're looking for anything you'll start humming along to, you're not going to find it here. This album will probably become a classic, though, like many of Sinatra's \\"dark\\" albums of the 1950s, you've really got to be in the mood to enjoy it to its fullest potential."},{"rating":"2","title":"Of Course...!","review":"Radiohead is on a path, and there's nothing more exciting in music than to be able to experience that path. Kid A is the logical next step from OK Computer. How could anyone have expected anything else? The album is excellent, and a perfect sonic fulfillment of OK Computer's promise. Radiohead is only one of two bands I can think of that has evolved so completely from pop to envelope-pushing art in a few short years. The other is Talk Talk. Although the sound is different, if you enjoy the unstructured musical approach and diverse soundscape, check out their \\"Laughing Stock,\\" which EMI (who, coincidentally, publishes Radiohead) refused to publish nearly a decade ago."},{"rating":"2","title":"Typical Radiohead","review":"Ok, first off this is nothing you'd expect from Radiohead. It's a lot like an experimental electronica album with just a track or two that remind you that this is Radiohead. But then again, they are the same guys who after a great debut album (Pablo Honey), released the radically different \\"The Bends\\" (arguably their best album) only to release the Grammy award winning \\"OK Computer\\" (yes, really!). Well, \\"Kid A\\" is as radical a departure as you're gonna get and it is enjoyable. Like anything else they've done, it'll grow on you. Trust me !"},{"rating":"1","title":"They fell in love with sound effects","review":"OK Computer and The Bends were great, Pablo Honey was annoying, and this album falls somewhere in between. I realize that bands need to progress artistically but I just can't see Kid A as progress. (People in other reviews will probably point out that I \\"just don't get it\\") Well, they're right, I don't get this album. I don't understand why they chose to replace instruments with sound effects. There are almost no guitar or drum parts. Instead the songs consist of beeping and organ-type sounds. The whole album has a very bare and minimalistic feel to it.I do like the hip-hop beat on Track 8, Idiotheque, but that's really the only song I enjoy listening to. I apologize to those high-browed, pretentious reviewers that scorn people for daring to criticize this album, but I just don't get Kid A. Maybe they can explain it to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"All I can say is......","review":"What happened?!?!?

We like Radiohead, cos, well, they are Radiohead, where are they in this??"},{"rating":"1","title":"And this is a rock band?","review":"First of all, let me start off by saying that O.K. Computer is one of the greatest recordings on the 90's. Since I fell in love with that cd, my expectations were very high for this album. I was very let down! This is supposed to be a rock band. For a rock band they do not like to use too many \\"live\\" instruments. These songs seem to lack focus, and only two seem to even resemble songs at all! I am not saying that this album is not inventive, it is boring! One of the only things I find unhypnotic about this cd is the cover art."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kid A","review":"Taking OK Computer to the next extreme Kid A is music for the mind. It's more like an album with pauses than a collection of songs. Don't expect any of the rock aspects of the bends just let yourself sit in a room and take it in from beginning to end."},{"rating":"1","title":"What A letdown","review":"I was waiting for this album as soon as I heard they went back into the studio, only to find a piece of crappy \\"art\\". I loved all the albums previously and can say this doesn't even come close to a good radiohead album. There are a few decent tracks such as Everything in its right place, how to disappear completely, optimistic, and idioteqe. The rest just sounds like noise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kid A Not Ok","review":"If you're in love with Radioheads previous works of sure genius you might be dissapointed here with Kid A. This is a new adventure for the group putting away their driving drums for looped drum beats, melodic guitars for casio keyboards, and passionate vocals for whimpers and moans. Don't excpect to hear anything like Ok Computer here or other great recordings from the past like \\"Fake Plastic Trees\\" and \\"Creep\\". I think they spent more money on the pull out sleeve than the making of the recording itself. If you have the cd you'll know what I mean. Yes, add it to your Radiohead collecttion like I did but also watch it collect dust on the cd rack. Kid A is a Kid D-"},{"rating":"1","title":"An Insomniac's Dream","review":"What is this album? Dissonant noise? A joke? A failed attempt by a recording group? It's all three of these statements wrapped into one overproduced album. A casual listening to this album brings frustration and the air of background music. A second listen with headphones will put you to sleep. Thus has to be Radiohead's weakest effort, a pointless prog rock epic about sucking lemons and failed efforts. Personally, I liked the ambient genre before Radiohead tried their hand at it. Buy it for the album art and the cellophane that accompanies it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Corporate rock, not avant garde","review":"More boring empty pomp rock from the Genesis of the 90's (Pink Floyd?- In your dreams!). Supposedly a move away from the stadium bombast of their previous corporate rock efforts, the posh, priggish Oxford schoolboys do little to disguise their wanky prog rock self indulgence, despite a vain attempt to court analog keyboard sounds and delay effects just like Stereolab and all their clones have been doing for the past 8 years. Have these guys any shame!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Liam was right...","review":"Man, I don't know what all the hype is about this band. I listened to this lamentable dreck and it bored me to tears.

If Liam and Noel ever get their acts together, they will easily surpass this mess. Liam was right, Radiohead sucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete Rubbish!","review":"Perhaps I am not in tune with the new artistic movement that everyone is praising this album for, but I think the album is rubbish. Pablo Honey and The Bends were great albums. Songs like: \\"Fake Plastic Trees, Think About You, True Love Awaits, and Paranoid Android\\" are what I like to hear from this group.

It is the interaction and relationship of her characters that make the story come alive.We start off with two mysteries at once. A naked man, wearing sunglasses, is found in someone else's bathtub. Across town an important person goes missing. The local policeman had figured out the relationship already (or has he). He has even nabbed the suspects. Lord Peter (armature sleuth) and friend of Inspector Parker must figure out if one plus one is one or two.Whose body?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent mystery","review":"\\"Whose Body?\\" is the first in the series of Lord Peter Wimsey mysteries. It's a great read and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to a mystery lover.As a longtime fan of Sayers's novels, though, I enjoyed \\"Whose Body?\\" on a completely different, almost anthropological level. Lord Peter hasn't quite coalesced here into the character he'd become in the later novels: he's more a collection of all the habits and mannerisms Sayers hoped would give him the personality she intended. Likewise, Bunter and Parker aren't quite there yet either. Sayers also experiments by creating a foil for Wimsey, an antagonistic police inspector named Sugg. It's an intriguing look into what might have been, and I'd recommend that any Sayers fan give \\"Whose Body?\\" another look."},{"rating":"2","title":"The first Lord Peter story, well read.","review":"The reader of this book does beautifully at distinguising the various voices of the characters, making it a joy to listen to.

The book presents curiosities that are only mildly curious and quirky characters that are not very quirky and wouldn't get a second glance in California or Florida. Its main subject matter seems to be large road-side advertising constructions.

Title track \\"Song for my father\\" performed by Horace & his quintet is easily his most recognised work and the truly awe-inspiring bossa nova track that it is, but it's important not to forget what else is included here, bearing in mind it's troubled creation process (Horace is was in the middle of disbanding one Quintet & assembling another), yet the brilliance of \\"The Kicker\\" & \\"Que Pasa\\" shine with a positively sparkling sophistication that it seems unbelievable that such joyously organic music can spring from a unstructured creation process.

The songs actually do sound good in remix form, but I feel this is the weakest Ultimate Dance Party as it does not have a lot of true dance music.

You'll be very dissapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Move on, there's so much better to spend your money on...","review":"Let's face it, Ultimate Dance Party was never really that great... but at least before, its' content was decent. I've got to say that this CD lacks in any originality. Most of the songs on this album are remixes of random radio hits... and while some remixes are good... the ones on this CD aren't. If you're into pop and r&b hits that are cheesily remixed, then this is your CD. If you're into true club music with energy and originality, it's in your best interest to shy away from the Ultimate Dance Party series, and 2000 is no exception."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT THE SONGS YOU HEAR ON THE RADIO!","review":"The ULTIMATE DANCE PARTY should be called the WORST DANCE PARTY.

But even most of these songs are remixes and the remixes on this CD are really bad, for the most part.

Somerset Maugham, William Wyler's noirish THE LETTER (1940) begins with a literal bang as Bette Davis guns down a man on the steps of her Singapore veranda. She tearfully claims self-defense but a letter surfaces from Davis to the victim that complicates matters. When the letter is purchased from the victim's wife and kept out of the trial, things do not improve for Davis and her husband Herbert Marshall.This entangling drama was nominated for seven Academy Awards including best Picture and Best Actress. Extras: an alternate ending sequence and two versions (1941 and 1944) of the Lux Radio Theater's broadcast with Davis and Marshall. The '44 version also features Vincent Price in his Lux Radio Theater debut.It's said that director Wyler and star Davis were having a torrid (is there any other kind) affair during production. Notice how sensuously this basically unattractive woman is lighted and photographed."},{"rating":"2","title":"moonlight,lace...and murder","review":"The last five minutes of this film alone is worth the price of a DVD.Unlike other reviewers, I don't like to give away endings but it all involves moonlight, lace and murder. Our brilliant Bette gives a fascinating performance as a woman whose murderous actions are seemingly dictated by her own frustrated passions and a forbidding full moon.The actors, direction, and creepy atmosphere really sets this movie apart. The DVD contains an alternate ending that wisely was changed.The quality of the DVD transfer is good but I wish they would remaster all films transferred to DVD because the result is basically a VHS on DVD otherwise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bette Davis movie","review":"This film has many lessons. A woman obsessed with a man is capable of any injustice or crime. We see such incidents today with mothers murdering their babies for men they have an obsession with. Bette Davis murdered the man with whom she had an obsession because he came to his senses and wanted to recommit his life to his wife. It is an intense film and demonstrates the power of reality, and facing the reality of obsession. Davis' character is at last murdered by the grieving widow.The product was packaged well, arrived on time, and in good condition.I am always happy with Amazon fulfillment."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Davis' best","review":"Herbert Marshall is his usual stiff and stoic self, but it is Bette Davis's uncharacteristically unmannered and understated performance that makes this melo-mystery completely compelling for its entire 95 minutes. From the dynamic opening scene, we are drawn into this cunning story with above average direction from William Wyler and a superior supporting cast. There is also an excellent and unsual economy of plot and dialogue absent from many films of its day/genre. There is an Alternate Ending, theatrical and two great radio broadcasts among the Special Features. As a Somerset Maugham fan, I especially appreciate this great movie adaptation of his work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful","review":"I read this book about 30 years ago.

This color looks really good in sunlight and similar indoor lighting. In dimmer lights, of course, it appears darker. I was half afraid that buying this would not turn out well because it is obviously no longer sold in stores. But, there is no expiration date on these so it is still good.

I purchased these graduated cutters sometime ago and I must say they get quite a work out. They are absolutely ideal for my needs. I bake a lot for friends, groups and clubs and have constant orders for various sizes. These work perfectly. They have a very nice keen edge to them and store well. As has been pointed out, they do rust so I always make sure they are well washed and well dried. A very, very thin coat of olive oil helps which is washed off each time I use them helps a lot.

The smaller cutters can be used to cut holes in the sugar cookie dough of larger cookies.

This is a \\"cannot put down book\\". You get interested in the characters right away, and it takes you into a time of war, conflict, politics, and all the relationships that develop,keeping the interest up all along the way. I don't regret one page and this is a big novel. Don't shy away from it due to that fact.I am so happy to have found this author and will read all her books.Happy reading, from a book lover!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Shining, Glorious Book","review":"Penman writes beautifully of other times, bringing them to life, and making the reader care desperately for her characters. All her books are wonderful.This, however, is the best of the lot. It was a labour of love, written when she did not know that she would be a successful author. This story is the story she had to tell, and tell it she does. Even knowing how it will all turn out does not distract from the suspense she weaves. Whatever your opinion about the facts of Richard III's life, you will be drawn into this telling. Yes, the plot is determined by Penman's opinion about whether Richard killed the little princes or not. But that's not where the power of the book lies.The prose shines with clarity and grace. The characters seem real enough to touch. The pacing is splendid. The storytelling is compelling. This is a book to read and savour."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Sunne in Splendour, absolutely splendid!","review":"Excellent book--I couldn't put it down. What I found so refreshing was Penman's take on the House of York. She didn't speculate about Richard's (one of the Princes in the Tower) escape from the Tower, like many other contemporary writers. As a matter of fact, she made a strong case that the Duke of Buckingham murdered both.Her characters are well-written and realistic. One can really appreciate why the characters acted the way they did. Particularly the portrayal of Anne and Isabel Neville--their relationship to each other seemed--very realistic, and she didn't portray Anne as being of a fragile character.All around, an excellent read, and the best one about the War of the Roses that I've read! Kudos to Penman!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous, thorough, historically accurate novel","review":"Though a novel, THE SUNNE IN SPLENDOUR accurately reflects the times (approx. 1459-1485). The story is sympathetic toward Richard III, but it is less romanticized than some other fiction in this category.If memory serves (I read the book awhile ago.), it treats the disappearance of the princes as a murder - one committed by the Duke of Buckingham without Richard's knowledge or consent. I think this scenario is unlikely, but the work is fiction, and no one knows what happened for certain.While the novel centers around Richard, readers also will learn about Edward IV, who reigned during most of the time period covered by the book. You will also learn about the disputes between the Houses of York and Lancaster, as well as the role of the French, and to a lesser extent, the role of Burgundy during the Wars of the Roses.Penman is an awesome storyteller - strong character development, credible blend of fact and fiction, engrossing writing style."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Sunne in Splendour","review":"Excellent historical novel drawing a new and more believable picture of Richard III. Especially enjoyble due to geographical and details. I would reccomend this novel to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bravo!","review":"I bought this book for my Kindle and am besotted with it.I read it then read it for the second time without pausing and am now more than half way through a third reading. It is intoxicating and addictive. The language is glorious, the ambience exact and the characters full bloodied and three dimensional. Ms Penman seems to have used Kendall as her primary source and what excellent use she has made of his biography of Richard! I am left wordless with admiration at the skill with which she weaves the complex strands of the dynastic civil wars into a coherent tapestry of such great beauty.I would recommend this book to any reader hunting for a richly detailed and thoroughly engrossing tale. It is quite truly one of those \\"couldn't put it down\\" books which come along only too rarely in today's world. My only complaint is that more of Ms Penman's works are not available for the Kindle. I would like to have her complete collection available to carry around with me to read whenever I chose."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic historical novel","review":"I love Penman's novels. This one in particular is moving and entertaining. I have read all her novels so far and am impatiently awaiting another. She pulls you in and leaves you wondering how so many pages could possibly go so quickly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still amazing, years later","review":"This is my all-time favorite book; I re-read it every year. Besides being responsible for me changing my major at university and falling absolutely in love with medieval history, this book is thoroughly entertaining to those who may not have a history passion or even passing knowledge of the time period. Penman is detailed enough to help along readers with little to no knowledge of medieval British history, but enthusiasts will delight in her detail and character development. If you have even a remote interest in history, Richard III, or murder, intrigue and deceit, read this book!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WONDERFUL BOOK!","review":"I very rarely write book reviews, but I absolutely loved this book.

There is a woman standing outside. Blackadder asks her, \\"Is this the home of the old crone?\\" The woman cackles, \\"That it be, sir, that it be!\\" Blackadder, disgusted, replies, \\"Just say 'Yes it is!' 'Yes it is!'\\" He is clearly fed up with this old-tyme grammatical construction, and frankly, so am I. Penman's characters talk like this...\\"This be the most dangerous undertaking yet, Ned!\\" It's awkward to read and unnecessary.Otherwise I quite enjoyed the story, as well as most of her other works. But this is grating enough that I had to remove a star.(By the way, the old crone in Blackadder immediately drops the stilted talk and begins to speak to him normally.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Who knew about Richard?","review":"Following the reign of Edward IV and Richard the III, Penman does a wonderful job of weaving history and narrative. Penman portrays Edward as a once grand and thoughtful king whose downfall is hurried by his greedy, power hungry, vindictive wife and her family (Elizabeth). Richard, in contrast, is all that is possibly good in a potential King and a foil to Edward.This is a controversial history because Richard (of Shakespeare fame) has historically had a bad reputation. Penman sees little historical proof for this perspective and Richard becomes a man who is ultimately felled by his own goodness. While the history is interesting, what Penman is good at is weaving a compelling story around characters who are complex and interesting"},{"rating":"2","title":"A New Look for Richard III","review":"A most interesting view of Richard III. A counter balance to the Shakespearean depiction, and the model for most Hollywood productions. I was totally surprised by the author's description of his military leadership and tactical abilities. The author does a superb job in detailing medieval combat. Her description of the physical effort of combat and the realism of a battle's outcome on both the winners and losers is excellent. I thoroughly enjoyed the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A top notch novelist","review":"A great read for those who enjoy historical fiction. Ms. Penman's writing style will put you right in the midst of historical England. My first time reading Ms. Penman's works...however...not my last!

At times a bit graphic and not for the feint of heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Sunne in Splendour:A Novel of Richard III","review":"Sharon Penman writes in such a way as to take the reader into the action without being trite.

For historical fiction buffs, this is a must."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long, but gripping tragedy","review":"This is a wonderful book. It is historically accurate, following Kendall's \\"Richard III\\", but also flows. Characters are well developed, and one finds oneself caring what happens to them. One especially cares about Anne and Richard, and Richard's final end is truly a tragedy.This is a very, very long novel. But, that is not a disadvantage. One hates to have it end.The biggest plus in this book for me was that it made the War of the Roses much more understandable. I already believed that Richard III did not murder the princes in the tower. Actually, I think Penman's solution makes more sense than Josephine Tey's solution.I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Historical Read!","review":"Sharon Kay Penman writes a wonderful historical fiction book.

I'm totally hooked...."},{"rating":"2","title":"this is what reading should be.","review":"Never has a book drawn me in as much as this one.Intellegent and informing, you can trust that Sharon Penman has made it her mission to relay the facts. She provides a story that is as liable, if not more, as any other Richard III story.I have read similar historical novels that have drifted off along the way, losing the reality of how these people actually did live. Creating the characters to be so obsolete that it is impossible to identify or relate with them.Sharons Richard, Anne, Llywelyn and Joanna have instilled an exciting, lasting interest within me.A most recommended read."},{"rating":"2","title":"a great redemption of a tragic king","review":"I just finished this book today, and I must say that it is a great great novel. As a fan of Penman's other fantastic works, I cant help but think that this book should be in film. Her books make me wish I was a movie producer or director just so i could see the actors portray my heroes on the screen. Well, anyways, this book portrays Richard as a very nice, humble, pious man who is betrayed by people he trusted. I pick this book as a great read if you're going on a long, boring trip. Or just something to read on the side. It's great either way."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the greatest books I've ever read!","review":"I read this book several years ago in the hardback form. It's huge size and heavy weight belied what an easy read it was. Ms. Penman's greatest gift is her ability to breathe life into her characters to the point where you feel you know them personally and become emotionally involved with them. It was hard to reach the end of this book for two reasons: (1) I didn't want it to end the way I knew it had to, and (2) it was such wonderful reading I just wanted it to go on and on. Ms. Penman is truly gifted. I always recommend her books to anyone who loves reading history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read!","review":"Great read!

But her main point is that the history of Richard III was written after his death, by his enemies.This \\"history\\" is as believable as any, and is entertaining to boot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ms Penman not to everyone's taste","review":"I recently ordered Sunne in Splendour based on the strength of the many positive reviewer recommendations. Apparently, the appeal of Ms. Penman's writing escapes me - I found the writing dry, the characters flat, and the sense of time and place poorly drawn.

A family sit down to a meal. An old woman tends her garden. A pig's enormous testicles. Hukkle contains a series of images (both beautiful and disturbing) with no dialogue, and no apparent connection. The film challenges you to construct your own narrative.The film portrays a day in the life of a rural village in Hungary. The images could be simple snapshots of the everyday lives of typical villagers -- or they could be clues to a sinister and disturbing mystery. Throughout the film, the viewer will be challenged to assemble the pieces, but nothing is revealed until the very end.Be prepared to watch the film at least twice, since you will be completely lost during the first viewing.In my opinion, Hukkle is one of the most original films I have every seen, and among the very best films of the last several years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Detailed Documentary","review":"This is a set of 2 DVD's on the history of the Arab/Israeli conflict.

After all, all history writing is a retelling of a tale, and the story here is one that carries a lot of interest in today's politicized and terrorized world. Rome is on the brink of civil war, every man with a sword has an agenda, and \\"You are There.\\" Great stuff, Tom."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Readable Survey","review":"Having read Colleen MaCullouch's fascinating series, I have tried to find what was truth and fiction. With Rubicon, I found what I was looking for. Other accounts I found tended to be very dry and brief. Rubicon, on the other hand, is a well-written popular history (in the best sense). The author converys the competitive nature of Roman society which worked well for a city state, but not an expanding empire, thus bringing about the end of the Roman republic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Narrative Excellence","review":"Tom Holland brings the ancients to life, exposing the ambition and vanity of Pompey, the defiant attitude of Caesar, the greed of Crassus and the egotism of Cicero. Holland knows his material, writes like a novelist and compels his reader to learn more. As an avid reader of ancient history, I spend much of my time reading scholarly discourses which can often seem to focus on trivialities; Holland spends his time expressing the characters' thoughts and desires through an incisive reading of his ancient sources. If you want to introduce someone to the period, this book is perfect. For someone trained in the subject, this proves an enjoyable romp through Rome, written by a contemporary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why Knock America?","review":"The remark inside the jacket cover about America embarking on imperial ventures is uncalled for and an affront to EVERYONE who is an American citizen.

What a disappointment for a book about the fall of Rome! The author writes with an abundance of flair and dramatic sentences, but a shortage of meaningful ideas. If you read to relax, fine; but if you read to think critically and learn, this book will leave you crying \\"foul!\\" at every page.A few examples:\\"Rome, having neutered political life in other societies, was now supreme as the world's theater of ambition and dreams.\\"\\"No Roman could tolerate the prospect of his city losing face. Rather than endure it, he would put up with any amount of suffering, go to any lengths.\\"\\"Never did the hardy peasant values that had won the Romans their empire seem more admirable than when they were being most flagrantly ignored.\\"Gimme a break!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Literate history of the decline and fall of the Roman Republic","review":"A literate work on the decline and fall of the Roman Republic. Why did the Republic fail? How did a new system, of emperors, replace it? This volume makes the effort to tell that story. It begins with Caesar deciding to take his troops across the Rubicon, a small river of little consequence. With that step, he ushered in the end of the Republic. But the seeds for its demise had been planted long before. The story considers key personalities--Marius, Sulla, Pompey, Crassus, Cicero, Cato, Caesar, and--ultimately--Octavian/Augustus.The book covers a fairly substantial time period, but provides enogh information to get a sense of the political dynamics of the time. There are enough maps to give a sense of the geography of the time, although a few more could have been useful.A quick read and a useful entree to the events of the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best history of the Late Republic I've read","review":"I've read a lot about the Late Republic era, and I am convinced that this is still the best book on the period. Holland's writing is smooth, exciting, and almost like a story rather than history. Holland really makes Caesar, Pompey, and the other characters come to life. He also takes care to provide the reader with a short but insightful background. I think he is right to stress the importance of the precedent of Marius and Sulla. Overall, I can't recommend this book enough. I wish it were assigned reading in high schools rather than the dry textbooks on ancient history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly, tabloid version of the Republic","review":"Although I'm a big fan of Roman history and the Latin language in particular, I was disappointed by this book. Tom Holland, a British novelist and radio personality, apparently thinks its important to put together a \\"narrative history\\" (his words - p. xxi in the Preface) and emphasize character development and personalities. So, eg, he speaks of Cicero not being \\"one of life's natural party animals\\" (p. 188), tells us Pompey had a \\"swagger\\" (p. 88) and reveals that Clodia had a \\"taste for gangster chic\\" (p. 226). Who cares and what's the relevance to the history?If you're looking for the last decades of the Roman republic as it would have been covered by Star Magazine, this book is for you. If you're looking for a thoughtful, detailed account of the rise and fall of the republic, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, if brief, history of Rome's Republic period","review":"Tom Holland has the wonderful knack of bringing history to life in an entertaining and informative manner that almost reads like a novel. His prose flows seamlessly and his passion for his subject matter is infectious. The only quibble I would have is that the book is too short to adequately cover the period from the fall of the kings to to the establishment of the Empire (in the truest sense, the coming of the emperors). That is a minor observation though, because if nothing else, this book will excite a desire to delve more deeply into this Roman period and that can only be a good thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"An explanation of the times.","review":"As a history buff, I found the history period very interesting.

He is helped tremondously by the likes of Cato, Caesar, Pompey, Sulla, Cicero, and Cleopatra, among many, many other fascinating secondary characters, but it is his highly readable style that moves the story forward in ways that will be understandable for anyone encountering ancient Roman history for the first time and refreshing for those who are returing to this period of history. This is true pop history in the best sense of that meaning. The history comes alive in ways that will ring true and unmistakable to any reader now (without ever belabouring the obvious comparisons between the fall of the Roman Republic and our current events. History is never dead.) A recommended glimpse into the chaos that became Rome as its ideals for its society were subjugated by a quest for personal glory as its empire and its consequent chances for wealth grew."},{"rating":"1","title":"What my history professors said never do...","review":"The book is overloaded with generalizing, personifying, and hyperbole, which simplifies and obscures the history. Some random examples: the Republic was exhausted and preoccupied; everyone knew; a ragbag of cities presumed; resentments seethed; the Romans judged; the plebians refused; community was cherished; peers wondered; Cato's ghost haunted the conscience of Rome. I felt frustrated that explanations and reasoning were being hidden from me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Advised to Purchase","review":"Orange roughy can probably be called the world's most unsustainably harvested fish. This deepsea inhabitant, referred to by the name of 'slimehead' prior to marketing experts changing the name to 'orange roughy, is a slow-growing, long-lived fish. These fish do not reproduce until they are in their 20's and they live to 130+ years. When eating this fish, you may very well be eating a creature well over 100 years in age, from a population that has little chance of rebounding after initial harvests. On top of all this, the fishing practice used to capture these fish, namely deep sea bottom trawling, is one of the most destructive fishing practices known to humankind. Comparable to bulldozing down forests, huge nets equipped with heavy gear scrape along the sides of seamounts, removing ancient cold water corals and other benthic habitat. There is no excuse for ever eating this fish when there are so many alternatives."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"This product arrived right before Christmas and I was very disappointed as it was a gift and one of the punches was missing. The biggest disappointment was that there was NO WAY TO CONTACT ANYBODY..i left an email for amazon and got a response to \\"ship it back\\"...I just wanted the missing punch! A contact number somewhere on the web or on the packing slip would have been an awesome way to resolve this. Instead, we had to run around hardware stores trying to find a missing piece.

As the vinyl became worn, I was always looking out for the CD replacement and \\"The Best of Lindisfarne\\" seems to be the closest I will ever get. However I must say that the quality of the CD recording leaves much to be desired.

Of course, that's icing on the cake, given that he does very good economics.I look forward to reading some of his other work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well-written, thought-provoking essays for general readers.","review":"I enjoyed Paul Krugman's \\"The Accidental Theorist\\" a great deal. Each of the 27 essays is short, well-written, and thought-provoking. I especially liked \\"What Is Wrong With Japan?\\" and \\"Looking Backward\\", an astonishing piece written from the point of view of an economist looking back over the last 100 years from his vantage point in 2096.The author explains complex economic ideas in terms that laymen can easily understand. In \\"Delusions of Growth\\", he summarizes monetary policy by using a baby-sitting co-op as a model!Paul's viewpoint is from the left. I viewed this as a welcome change, a counterbalance to years of reading the conservative slant of the Wall Street Journal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good short pieces on economic topics","review":"The pieces were written in the 1990s, and some are a bit dated, but Krugman is always a sharp writer and it's fun to watch his mind at work. In one piece, he explains that, like most Americans, he can't stop working and enjoy life, because if he did, \\"somebody else might get that Nobel\\"--which he would get in 2008."},{"rating":"2","title":"what offten passes as common sense is offten nonsence","review":"There is a lot of dismal sentiment and dismal pronouncements on tv and the internet--theUSA and the world in general Is going to the dogs the Usa should prepare for an economic calapse and we should expect to return to the Gold standard. Krugman shows this is nonsence, trade with china is actually in our favour we will never return to the gold standard--if we did it would be a desasterRead the book cheer up things will turn out all right"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book, although all recycled articles","review":"As all of the other reviewers have noted, Paul Krugman does a good job of writing popular economics -- i.e. making it readable for everyone. I don't wish to take away anything from the book itself, which is marvelous.However, what I did want to add as a review is that most of these articles included in the book are available in his Dismal Science column at Slate or on his web site. So if you're a student like myself, you can save 10 bucks or so reading them off the net."},{"rating":"2","title":"Krugman is always fun to read","review":"Paul Krugman knows how to make economics interesting and he does it without dumbing down the material. He is deservedly well known for his ability to illustrate economic phenomena using creative and easily understood models. Of course you won't be worthy of a BA in economics after reading this, but you will be able to experience some of the complexities with which the field concerns itself. Some of his essays in this book tackle more complicated issues than others, but all of them are insightful and are a great opportunity for laypeople to find out how economists think about economic scenarios. And, as a bonus, Krugman's writing is rarely boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, remarkably well-written","review":"I can't recommend this book enough; the manner and the clarity with which the ideas are presented are far better than any other economics commentary I've ever read. The presentation is excellent, and the ideas are logically explained, but not without some degree of lightly-masked bitterness toward those whom he sees as clearly and undeniably wrong. I strongly recommend that everyone read the book to obtain some sort of background in economic policy that is necessary in present American society to make educated political decisions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Economics for everyone","review":"As an economics lecturer, I cannot but recommend this book. If you're ever going to read one economics book in your entire life, please read this one. By avoiding the usual jargon typical of present-day economics debate, it makes economics accessible to the layman. Easy to understand examples are used to explain core concepts and mechanisms underlying current economic theories. The logic so developed is then used to critically assess different argumentations in recent debates (the budget deficit, the Euro,...). This is one book I will certainly use in the classroom!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm pleased","review":"My son had this as one of the items on his Christmas wish list ~ it arrived quickly, looks nice, but I did not read it myself.

It just makes them look incredibly cheap and amateurish. All six films are shot on video and look more like a group of buddies made them on a drunken weekend binge. Lots of shaky camera work, poor sound quality, bottom rank special effects, and terrible acting. OK...there is a lot of gore but so what...these really are not the least bit scary. You laugh a lot at the beginning because they look just so very bad but after the first 20 minutes you end up just being bored to death.Each movie runs around 75 minutes or so and you see a lot of the same actors turn up on these films and the other films from Pendulum pictures.

The movies were shot in a 7 foot tall basement with a video camera they must have bought at Walmart and makeup from a halloween store.Sometimes these \\"home horror\\" movies can be cool- but these were not.

The only person whom I talked with previously on vid conference had an old vid cam so I didn't see a big difference. Then a family member called and said he just bought a new vid cam (a Logitech Quickcam 4000) and I couldn't believe the difference. I can see now why the Veo Velocity is getting such a bad rap. It's well deserved. It's very grainy and jittery, and doesn't work consistent in any light, not to mention very poor in low light, even with the 2.0 USB card. I'm not much into the vid conference thing, but since it looks like I'm going to be in touch with my family member now on a steady basis, I went out and snagged a Logitech 4000 and am very pleased with it.Don't settle for the Veo Velocity cam.

And as for \\"Classic\\" Rock, I humbly submit that songs like \\"Substitute,\\" \\"That Smell,\\" \\"Treat Me Right\\" by Pat Benetar have not exactly been labeled \\"classic\\" by anyone but Morse.I think what happened here is that Morse spend an afternoon on Nexus running searches for a bunch of songs and came up with a miscellaneous series of quotes from backdated issues of Rolling Stone.

The authors knowledge of weapons, and his historical research, or lack thereof, crosses the borders of absurdity. He goes so far as to mention the weight of many bladed weapons as surpassing 75 to 95 pounds, and that is just the tip of the iceburg.

It clearly demonstrates the phenomenal love a man, Darius, has for a woman, Alexa, despite the choices she makes. The tables have turned. It is refreshing to read about a man desiring to have the complete love of his woman as opposed to a woman striving to receive total and complete love from her man. Alexa and Darius are very believable characters that easily slip into your heart as you experience the ups and downs in their relationship from the beginning and on to the suspenseful conclusion.

It may sound silly, but it works. I will never forget what to call the door, the mirror, the cat (okay, he's not really wearing a sticker), or dozens of other common items around the house. Writing a word or phrase over and over again and repeating it out loud may seem like tedious exercises, but there is a reason why these kinds of drills are used in schools throughout the world. Writing and saying words is an effective way to reinforce them. The pronunciation guide is helpful, although its weakness is that it does not tell you which syllable gets the emphasis.

So why is it that many English Bible translations have replaced it with the title \\"LORD\\" in all capital letters? Why is it that the King James Version has the name standing by itself only 4 times? On the other hand, why do some versions like the American Standard Version include it over 6,000 times in the OT? And why do even fewer contain it in the NT? And is the correct pronounciation of the divine name Jehovah or Yahweh? Dr. Firpo W. Carr, a recent Bible scholar who has earned his PHd in biblical languages, discusses and answers those and other questions.He is well qualified to do so; he has examined several Hebrew manuscripts of the Bible, including the Lenigrad Codex.

It is really a testament to the man's abilities - he had psychic powers that have yet to be matched. One of the things to be learned is that Cayce refused to charge for his services - he really did see his gift as something to help mankind. A fascinating note re: the author - Sugrue suffered badly from a chronic condition. Cayce actually did a reading, telling him what to do to cure it. Sugrue followed what Cayce said for a while, but then stopped, resorting to the common medical treatment for the time. Unfortunately, he died. A true irony for the author who honored Cayce in this wonderful biography."},{"rating":"1","title":"B o r i n g","review":"The minutia of his life and family was tedious to read, and on the whole, it was a really boring book.

This book became the reason for me to read Cayce's books.I have found it to be an easy-to-read and a style that can bring the reader along the journey as if experiencing Cayce's life first-hand, or at least that's my impression. It's certainly a book that I couldn't put down and a book I have read more than once because it's such an unusual story about a man whose consciousness split into two: waking and sleeping. When he goes into a sleeping state, he'd become a source of knowledge and wisdom being offered for those who asked.I'd surely recommend this book for those who are interested in Cayce's life and his works as it's a good introduction to the modern prophet, or so I think."},{"rating":"2","title":"A life-changing book","review":"How many times have you heard the overused term \\"life-changing,\\" usually used to describe decidedly non-life-changing things?Well, this book is an exception.

The lessons here will always remain valid, for they come from God.After reading this book, read Edgar Cayce's Story of Jesus, Edgar Cayce on Reincarnation, Edgar Cayce on Atlantis, and the others.

It's extremely interesting material, but Johnson's flits over it all in barely readable, fragmented prose. Furthermore, as one unfamiliar with the city (especially as it was in the 1800s), his descriptions of the landscape (and the design of the buildings) leaves me still with a black box imagination of what the city looks like. Pictures or illustrations would well suit the understanding of this book, which would lead to the (hopeful point of the story) understanding of the city."},{"rating":"2","title":"Come on now THUNDERCATS love it all day","review":"Grew up loving this show I watched it all the time.

The sound quality is low as well. It would seem to be mono, not stereo, sound. Also, as one other person pointed out, the music is missing from one of the episodes.

Although the picture isn't remastered, you can still let it go. But I have to raise my TV volume high just so I can listen to what the characters are saying.

I have the Transformers DVD Box Set and they explain about the inferiority of 1980's materials, but that they did the best to restore the cartoons to better than original release, they even have a split screen! They also took the MONO track and made it 5.1 So stop trying to think you'll EVER get a super clear THX digitally enhanced version of ANY 1980's cartoon, this is as good as it gets folks!

I didn't sweat, my heart rate didn't rise, and my arms didn't get sore. You don't use any weights.-The moves were hard to learn and there weren't verbal cues to tell you when to move to your left, right, etc.-The instructors are amateurish and their \\"we're so cool\\" banter is extremely annoying.

There is no cueing and the little bit of cueing that they give is not enough information to let understand the next move. The video is broken up into 4-20 minutes segments but like another review mentioned the arms and abs are only 15 minutes long.

Some may pick up on it easier than others."},{"rating":"1","title":"borrrrrrring","review":"first of all the quing was non-existant. 2nd that blond made it sound like it was a tough workout and she kept complaining how bad it hurt. puleeeeese leslie sansone is tougher than these girls.and you can tell they are not experts in there field of employment. if you like complaints and lack of knowledge then please buy this dvd. if you want a real workout pick something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rubbish","review":"There are a ton of real workout out there. This is not one of them. A lot of talking. It was not challenging at all.I wish I was advised not to waste my 15 bucks at Borders. Pure rubbish, don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and result orientated","review":"This is by far my favorite workout video and I think the best of the Skinny Bitch series. The girls are funny and I like that they mess up every once in awhile. I'm not an athletic person but I'm in pretty decent shape and in my late twenties. Everyone of the sections is challenging enough to feel and notice your body working but not so hard that I find myself skipping or having to modify the moves. Each 20 min workout focuses on a part of the body so you can do one a day or all of them or like me switch off two a day depending on how much time you have. The arm workout is the absolute best I've done that didn't require weights. Actually none of the workouts require special equipment tho you could easily add weights if you wanted (I dont think you need to though)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why have music if you don't follow the rythm?","review":"Although the workout was OK, there were two things that bugged me like crazy. First, there is some annoying music in the background and the instructors don't follow the beat in the music. It was tough following their instructions when the music was in a different tempo. Second, the instructors kept on saying \\"namaste\\", although they were not even close to doing yoga."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy this video if you don't take working out seriously.","review":"My review is very harsh, but it is my opinion so here goes:I bought this video because I was looking for a different workout than all the others. What I found was offensive and didn't actually end up being a work out. The reason this video offended me is simple. The 'instructors' declared at the beginning of the video that it doesn't matter if you are ugly as long as you love your body. If I were leading a work out the last thing I would do is call the people paying me ugly or fat. They also appeared to be under the influence and had no idea what they were talking about. I would be terrified to let these ladies near anyone who is trying to learn about real physical fitness.So yeah. If you like watching two drunk chicks casually messing around with stretching or hand weights, then this is for you. If you are looking for something that will teach you something as well as make you sweat, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst workout dvd ever","review":"This really is the worst workout dvd ever. The arms section does not work you out at all and there is virtually no cuing. During some of the segments, the instructor gets bored and instead of counting starts saying dum dum duh duh duh ... badum badum badum... or something like that. The half squats they do in the butt section are just the right distance down to really injure knees and the way the two instructors, who obviously work out harder than this, talk about how \\"this is killing me, yada yada\\" is just patronizing. Also, if you read the book or watch the interviews on the tape, you find out this is just a marketing arm of their vegan propaganda. Which just makes it weird."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Joke!","review":"Let me start by saying.... I'm very active, exercising 4-6 times weekly. I thought this would be a challenging glute & arm workout but this is not the case at all.This DVD is a total joke. The sessions are not 20 mins as advertised (the glute segment is about 14 mins and the leg is maybe shorter than that, I started the arm session but didn't finish because I wouldn't tolerate the lack of form!!!!!).The in the \\"A**\\" workout, Rory looks like a \\"deer caught in headlights\\" as she intensely focus in on whoever is in front of her giving them instructions... That was a total turnoff for me. I tolerated the chatter and language but the lack of form I just couldn't handle.... THESE ARE GETTING RETURNED !!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wickedly Awesome!!","review":"I love this DVD! The workouts are fun and Bitches keep it interesting and entertaining, the time flies by and it keeps you wanting to come back for more. I used this DVD almost everyday and followed the guidelines set out in their Skinny Bitch book and my fiance and I both saw results in me after only 1 week!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Good Workout Video","review":"The workout sets on this DVD go too fast for most people that aren't already experienced in exercise routines. Even if you were, the steps are not explained slowly enough so you end up having to watch the DVD a decent amount of times to try to 'pick up' on what the instructors are doing. It doesn't seem like they know what they're doing, honestly, because both myself and my mother were injured after failed attempts of trying to keep up with them. This will probably work out for someone who picks things up quickly and already knows proper exercise protocol so they don't hurt themselves. But it seems like they are missing their mark with their target audience- which is amateurs- when they are not treating the audience as if they are new to fitness training."},{"rating":"1","title":"You've got to be kiddin' me!","review":"It is amazing to me that these two clowns even have an exercise DVD; they have to be the laughing stock of the exercise world. I only picked up this DVD b/c my neighborhood bookstore went bust and it was 1/2 price (I'm even mad I paid that much). I thought I'd be able to do the arm segment daily ..... it's a mess! Why would you want to work your arms without weights? It's plain to see they made their own arm exercises with no choreography and they're not even on tempo with the music. They don't even explain the segment; all of a sudden, there's arms flying in every direction. Their banter is even nauseating. If these two can put together an exercise video, so can I. This one ended up in the trash!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Workout","review":"The workout is good, I can't really say it's the best, but it works for me. For all those who say thay did not break a sweat, maybe you did not try hard enough. You definetely have to use your own strength based on your fitness level, the more you push the more you sweat. I have tried tons of exercise DVD's and I have to say I like this one, it does make me sweat. Yes, the instructors are not always coordinated, and sometimes they make mistakes...but that's exaclty what they promote, imperfection is part of everyone's life. So stop bitching and get moving!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An outstanding collection of '70's jazz sax.","review":"This was Ronnie Laws' debut album and, unfortunately for the rest of us, is far better than the commercial drivel he made after this. PRESSURE SENSITIVE is pure music and includes one of my all-time favorite cuts, Tidal Wave.

And this one did not disappoint me at all. \\"The Cold One\\" is a wonderfully-written book that captivates the reader by the middle of page 1. The way that Mr. Pike weaves a story around his many characters and storylines is nothing short of superb. \\"The Cold One\\" ventures into the land of horror, mixed with science-fiction and suspense. I am extremely pleased that Mr. Pike decided to commence writing for adults as well as for young adults, for his young adult books are treasured in my bookcase as \\"favourites\\". If you have not yet purchased \\"The Cold One\\", then please do so immediately, for this is a life-changing novel, a novel of intense emotion and suspense. This is right up there among the best of Stephen King and Dean Koontz."},{"rating":"2","title":"So super... in search of sequel","review":"This book is amazing. I have read it and reread it many times. All the twists and turns, the plot line is spectacular. I have never read such a great book before. Absolutely my favorite, even compared to all the Harry Potter books. I have been searching and searching for the longest time for the sequel, The Cold One II: The Seedling.

If anyone can help... please email me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AWWWWWWWWW YEAH","review":"This book was simply awesome. I couldn't put it down, it went every where with me, the bathtub, the loo, the dinner table, my job and I even attempted to read it while I was driving. Christopher Pike is a master at developing genuine characters. If you can make your reader relate to and or \\"breathe\\" with the character, you can sell millions. Certainly, it's not an ability easily obtained. Some of the metaphysical hooie made me yawn [the part of the book that took place in India] which is the only reason I dont give this book a five star rating. But hell, at least I learned a thing or two. I thoroughly enjoyed Sati and I am on my way to reading Seasons of passage. By the way, I highly recommend The Midnight Club and the Chain letter series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only for someone desperate for a horror fix.","review":"Starts out okay, nothing literary, but falls prey to the horrible ending...at points the action and descriptions are so comical, a person might conjure Beavis and Butthead-style zombies in her mind...still entertaining, as many horror fans will read or watch almost anything to witness the newest, most original fictional method of killing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reader be warned","review":"This book was good, although confusing at time because there were SO many characters involved. It has a really interesting set of twists that make it a great read.A note to potential readers. Be forewarned. There was supposed to be a sequel to this book. Since 13 years have now passed, I am starting to doubt it."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Dramatic,unearthly romantic,Purely horror\\"","review":"The Cold One was utterly terrifing and dark. Purely horrifing, very good, definantly a five star book. Very unexpected violent and wrenching not to mention horrifing actions. Many peoples lifes were linked to the cold one, their fate in the cold ones hand, Peter James was definatly the most inportant to it, he was either going to complete it or destroy it. Something Edger Allen Poe would decribe as \\"terror of the soul.\\" It's been one of the best horror books I have read so far from Christopher Pike. It catches you up in the prologue and never lets you down, never a boring moment at all. Pike goes into great details at times, but still keeps his mysterious touch through the whole book.

The familial revelations read more like a bad daytime soap. And about RAK, the 5,000 year old (blind!) god? He reminded me of the 1st Survivors to be booted off the island: he rounded out the cast but the show could've and would've gone on without him.

Ay caramba!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book, Bitter Reader","review":"As most of the other reviews already state, this is a great story. A great story that was never finished. Therefore, sure, read it for what it's worth but there are plenty of other books and series out there that are just as good (and better!) that were written by authors who actually finished what they started. Mr. Pike obviously continues to write (albeit, not nearly as well) so just tell us what happened here. Did you get stuck? Did the politics of the publishing business kill any further progress? And if you think that you're generating interest by stringing readers along, I think it's been long enough. Well, just had to get that off my chest. Once again, I truly enjoyed the book at the time but there are too many other books out there to bother with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"This book was mesmerizing! I couldn't put it down! I loved every second of it! I am a huge fan of Christopher Pikes! This is one of my favorites. He has a unique way of creating a story where every chapter is completely different than the one before it! What I mean by that is that he creates several stories in one and then ties them all together slowly! There were so many twists! It was FUN to read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Me","review":"I have been doing an Ab Blast DVD from Jeanette Jenkins for about a year now and decided I needed to change it up a little. I bought this DVD as a recommendation from a relative who said the Abs of Steel series was fantastic. I have attempted this on several occasions knowing that it takes time to warm up to something different. I cannot warm up to this. The first few segments in (not the pilates and yoga portions) the line up were moving fast and almost putting a dance routine together without giving you time to learn the form. Just when you start catching on it's time to go on to the next move where you start over trying to learn a form. I am happy to work my body hard, but I need solid clear instructions. I also want to clarify that I have been working out 5 to 7 days a week for 4 years. I'm familiar with a lot of moves and usually catch on quite fast.

Well, I'm not really a beginner, I've used In Home Walking, Tae Bo, and lots of Richard Simmons videos, but this one is just too involved. You start off with what seem to be very easy movements and then all of a sudden the instructor is doing five-six part movements, talking a mile a minute, and moving even faster. I skipped to the next section of the dvd and it was no better.I may try it again in the future when I'm more in agile, but for now I feel that I wasted my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"dvd","review":"I didn't like the dvd.

Newton has 50+ years of coaching experience and over 25 Illinois state Cross country championships to his credit.Newton is old school, doling out tough love with daily motivational quotes to his charges. More than great runners, he aims to develop young men of strong character. Challenges abound in this quest as teens are tempted by booze and the lure of petty crime.

It wound up being a fun movie, if a little unbelievable. Tracy stars as a scientist and Hepburn is the owner of the home where he sets up shop. Both have had difficult experiences with love in the past and have decided they are against it. For convenience sake and since they are compatible, they decide to marry, believing that a marriage without love could work. Since it's Tracy and Hepburn, the viewer obviously suspects something different. The movie is amusing, and apart from the real chemistry of the two leads, it also benefits from a wry performance by Lucille Ball as Hepburn's real estate agent. It may not be the greatest film of Tracy and Hepburn, but it is worth watching nonetheless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie, but there was a remake","review":"As always, the Tracy/Hepburn movies are always wonderful to watch, no matter the plot.

Frankly I love them!This is a wonderful two hours of song, and a trip down memory lane. It was great to see many of the original broadway cast members back on stage recreating their roles just one more time and for a few minutes again, showing the world what they did best.None more so than the incomparable Mandy Patinkin returning to Sunday in the Park or George Hearn return to Sweeney Todd. In fact the Sweeney Todd sequence was a joy with both the old and the new Demon barbers coming together with the legendary Patti Lupone.The best of the best is the sequence with all the leading ladies on stage together each performing a classic and each performing them to the letter. The ladies in red are fabulous and the support and encouragement they give each other is just a thrill to watch.I audibly applauded some of these numbers at home and you will too!The best Birthday ever!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jazzanova Top Themselves With a Stellar DJ Mix CD.","review":"A mix of chilled jazz, nu soul, a dash of hip hop, live instruments, and some electro and retro grooves make up the salad bowl that is \\"Mixing\\" by Berlin's Jazzanova, a great selection of tunes for that last-minute get together.

I recomend this book to 5th grade and up, dew to the books hard vocabulary.I like this book because of the exitement, adventures, and drama of karanas life on the island alone.Island of the blue dolphin is for peoplewho like to read about survivle and adventure.I dont think people who only like to read about comedys mysteries shouldent read the book.Island of the blue dolphinis about a girl who gets stuck on an island by herselfand learns how to survie and has a big adventure on the way. The main charcter of this story is karana.

Her brother got killed by wild dogs a day after the ship left. She faced the danger of nature, surviving all of the challenges she encountered.I think this is a very good book because it shows how people can really do things if they put thir mind on it. Karana had to live all by herself and she made friends with dogs, birds and the Aleut girl named Tutok. She belived that the white men's ship would return someday to rescue her and they did come back eventually.

She is an excellent reader but was very upset with the beginning of the book. Since this is so well written a young girl easily projects herself into Karana and so reading about the girl watching her father die (her mother is dead already) and then finding her dead brother can understandably be upsetting. After that point she began to 'get into' the book. As her mother I read the book to know what she was reading and as an adult found the book very moving.

It is at some parts that are good but the rest is just not. Like in the beginning the main character's dad dies in a really dramatic way. But you can tell that there trying to make it so dramatic but it was like in the third or fourth chapter. But they barely had any character development with him so you don't really care. But then after the main girl gets stranded on an island it starts to get good. But then at a point it just droped. Then really all that happens was she was just getting food so she can survive and befriending animals. Some of it is interesting but some of it is not. There is this really generic time line.

Her trip away from the island in the canoe went on for about 10 pages, and all it was about was the canoe leaking.

The father is killed along with most of her tribe. To top it all off the little brother is also killed. The girl also kills several animals, all without much feeling if any. They give a reading age of (9-12). It is considered a young adult read. My daughter is not an adult of any kind. She is a child. The content of the book is a bit much for a child who loves family and animals. My daughter is an advanced reader but I would not want her reading this book until she was much older.

It was for school and I had to answer 35 questions about it. I think it would be a better movie than a book. Here's why. The whole story was about Karana surviving on her own, on the Island of the Blue Dolphins. It was a great choice for the teachers to pick, while I found it sort of boring and/or repetitive. Every couple pages or so, it told about a different day on the same island with the same person, not including the animals. I also found that a lot of people were killed or died in the story, which I found being inappropriate for children in my age group. I am 11 and I do not think this would be a good choice for kids under 12.

It's basically about a girl building shelter, making clothes, and befriending all the island's creatures while waiting YEARS for a ship to show up. There really is no plot or rising/falling action. I was even hoping for a little romance to pop up when the Aleuts come back , but she befriends a girl instead. I really haven't gained anything from reading this (except maybe how to spear live animals). It could be because I am 17 years old but never-the-less, if your a young reader go ahead and read it, you have nothing to lose."},{"rating":"1","title":"AUUUGH!","review":"Okay I seriously can NOT beleive how AWFUL this movie was.

Scott O'Dell has his own style and he painted a great picture of what the story was about in my head. That is why I would rate it a 4. I wouldn't rate it a 5 because of the ending it seems to me the author had a variety of run-ons about her fight that was not needed and he kind of rushed the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"6th Grade","review":"Hi I'm Agnes and I read the book Island of the Blue Dolphins in 6 th grade!

Well I think that Island of the Blue Dolphins is the right book for you! In this novel written by Scott O'Dell, a girl name Karana was in a tribe called Ghalas-at. There was a war, and most warriors died. Everyone else left the island, but Karana and her brother, Ramo, were left behind, and Ramo soon died. Karana had to learn how to survive on her own, without the help of the village. She was left on the island for years! She has many tasks to do and goes through many mistakes, learning from them. She made friends with animals, in a bond together. Will Karana ever be rescued? This novel is packed with action, is exciting and is hard to put-down once you start reading it.

It has been a fantastic jumping-off point for explorations into Chumash culture and history, visits to the graveyard where the woman is buried and Santa Barbara history. O'Dell has incorporated the known facts into a well-written and engaging book, with a very touching ending, as most readers would know that the woman died some weeks after being brought to the mainland, probably because of eating food to which she was unaccustomed. Although all members of her tribe had died by the time she arrived and no one was able to speak her language, she was so happy to be among people that she welcomed many visitors before her death, communicating her stories the best she could. By all accounts she was a very sociable and pleasant woman.

I remember reading this when I was in 4th grade and really loving it. Reading it again, I can see why I liked it so much. This is a timeless book that is fun to read for adults and children. The story of Karana is lonely, sad, and yet it is so inspiring at the same time. I would also definitely recommend researching the true story that Scott O'Dell loosely wrote this book from. The Lone Woman of San Nicolas is an interesting person to learn about.

I'll be honest that I blocked most of the extraneous details of the non-existent plot out of my memory. But I do remember feeling depressed for days after finishing it.

I thought that the quest for Karana's survival was at the best mediocre. There were long, tedious details about everyday life that didn't grab attention, and the storyline about foreign people bumping off the indigneous natives is getting old.

The story is great mix of action, adventure, and drama throughout the book. While reading the book, I felt as if I were Karana's only companion, or that she was dictating her life story to me via a diary. Children reading the text will likely wonder if they too could bear living eighteen years alone of an island and may decide to do some investigating about the cultures of southeastern Native Americans on their own. I am skeptical about how much research O'Dell actually did himself since the characters seem overdramatized."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice and well written I would recomend this book to you","review":"As a 12 year old I thought this book was great I read this book atleast a year ago and I still remember the whole story!!!!!This novel deosn't really have dolphins it's just that the island has alot of dolphins around it so that's how it got it's name. But there are some part's with dolphins and there are these wild dogs in the story as well. They help her in parts and it's just a lovely book. you must read it. I'm sure you'll enjoy it.

Part of this story is true, and yearly my class sails to Santa Cruz Island, a nearby island to what we think is the real \\"Island of the Blue Dolphins\\".

I hope YOU don't turn out that way!The book talks in a way I can barely understand, but somehow I know what it means. It is about a girl who was abandoned on an island that is shaped like a dolphin. She was abandoned because her tribe was captured and the hunters left her behind because she hid (I think). It's mainly about her, trying to survive on an empty island with no companions (maybe a rock or something). It is a good book and I strongly advise you to read it if you like books.

So the people had to leave and when the boat was going, her brother didn't get on the boat so she jumped of to stay with him! The problem in the whole book that she seemed to survive with is to keep wondering \\"When will the ship come back, and how long will I survive?\\" Well atleast she makes an awesome friend named rontu who is a friendly dog that helps her suvive.

I'm referring to the 2005 remake, with new artwork by Maurice Sendak (who I find very hit-or-miss...) Krauss and Sendak collaborated several times in the 1950s and '60s, but this tepid outing doesn't recapture the buoyancy of those old days, as hard as Sendak may have tried. Feels like he was just coasting here, and though many parents and longtime devotees got into this one, I thought it was just plain boring. Haven't read the 1948 original.

Even for a few minutes when I am upstairs she goes in and she has not damaged anything at all. Plus I know she is safe! I recommend this to anyone bringing home a new puppy.

Mr. Saadiq is on point and Muhammad is dropping beats all over the place. I hope \\"Without You\\" is released as the next single, it's got radio play written all over it.

I found that the offering from Lucy Pearl broke no new ground. The album really flowed from song to song; because the beats were basically the same.

I guess it's been done before with Gerald Levert, Keith Sweat, and Johnny Gill's bland LSG project.

The cd is average mostly, with a few shiners (Hollywood, Dance Tonite, and Remember the time being the only notable tracks) thrown in to keep you listening. I saw a webcast from the group saying they made enough songs for two albums, I cant help but wonder if this is the best, how horrid are the rest? If there wasnt such a hype around this group, from themselves included, maybe I would have rated it higher.

It's great to hear Dawn Robinson on record again and her sweet voice blends well with Raphael's storytelling style. While many will question the CD's lack of surefire radio hits, the CD plays much like D' Angelo's, more of an album than a collection of producer-driven songs. \\"Dance Tonight\\" takes a back seat to songs like \\"Everyday\\", \\"Good Love\\" and \\"You\\"(feat. Snoop & Q-Tip). Here's hoping Lucy Pearl won't end up a bad menage-a-trois and serve up a second helping."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album by a R&B Supergroup","review":"This album is a classic. It is real, soulful r&b music by some of the greatest artists in the r&b world. This album has a lot of variety with elements of gospel, soul, and a little rock and roll. The artists that make up Lucy Pearl really put their heart and soul in this album to create real music that actually means something."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soul Power","review":"This album has a cool vibe to it. I can feel the heavy musical influence of Tribe though the drums and bass parts on most tunes like Everyday and Good Love.

And finally it has happened! I saw it when it first was shown in the theaters and later in VHS form but have been frustrated that it took so long to be available on DVD. Tracy and Hepburn at their best caught in a strong and frightening plot. It tells of the innocence and gullibility of the general public and our willingness to believe what people of note told us in the years preceding WW II. The story reminds us that what is on the surface often masks a dark and evil truth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not my favorite, but I liked it","review":"Just the fact that there're Spence and Kate, the film has appreciation. It's my favorite on screen couple, with Mickey and Judy. They're even. Great performances from the both of them. In particular from Spencer. He couldn't possibly disappoint me. The guy that plays the kid is incredible! Spencer Tracy helped him in every of his shot, and I think he succeeded. It's not a comedy like Woman of the Year, naturally. It's neither a noir nor a propaganda or a crime movie. Sort of mixture. A real dramatic role for Katharine Hepburn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fizzles out halfway through.","review":"This film started well - I'm a big Spencer Tracy fan, and he's as good as ever in this noirish mystery. But it quickly gets convoluted and dull. The whole thing is like a Victorian gaslight melodrama, and about that interesting, with everything revealed in the last reel. Hepburn is stagey and doesn't get to use her fine comedy talents in a one dimensional role. The ending, the big secret, is signposted throughout the movie, but it will still come as a surprise, since you will have convinced yourself that it is too preposterous to be what you thought it was. Like I say, Tracey is good, but not even he can save this turkey."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flameout","review":"Hard to imagine Spencer Tracy and Katherine Hepburn being lousy together: until you see them in this Popular Front catastrophe fron 1942. The conspiracy theory of those days among Hollywood leftists was that there were Fascist fifth columnists under every bed and they had to be rooted out. Reporter Tracy is rooting under widow Hepburn's bed to get the goods on her late husband. Tracy was not politcally sympathetic to the project and he looks thoroughly discouraged and annoyed from scene one. The crummy script and abominable sets didn't help any. Politics is always a touchy subject in the movies; it usually doesn't date well. Some films, like \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls,\\" can shrug off the rhetoric and still be great years later. Others, like \\"Keeper of the Flame,\\" sink like a stone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Star Maps is filled with the promise of dreams","review":"I saw Star Maps twice in the theaters, and still can't get it out of my mind. I keep checking to see when the sell-through VHS will be available (at an affordable price). The film's music is top-notch. This may be a so-called Indie film, but it's performances, especially from Douglas Spain as Carlos, the young man with a dream, are believable. This a gritty, realistic picture about people struggling to stay focused and to survive. Carlos wants to be an actor; he sells maps to the stars homes in Beverly Hills. He believes that all he needs is one chance at the acting brass ring. To earn more money he is forced to hustle, but he knows that what he deeply wants is to be an actor. A touching, poignant movie. There is nudity and adult situations, and even some comedy, but this is a strong film and well worth viewing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amatureish but gritty","review":"A \\"summer stock\\" vision of mexican boys brought to the USA to hustle under the guise of selling maps to the stars homes in Hollywood. Some good performances but mostly the dialog is stilted and it sounds like the screenwriters first attempt. Too many sub-plots and intrigues muddy up what could be an interesting film a la JOHNS and My Own Private Idaho from an ethnic perspective. Worth watching when the price drops."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Glad I Found It","review":"I looked several years for this album. Skipper Wise is such a good singer.

It was recorded in such places as Cork, Dublin, and Belfast, the latter a place where few artists dared perform at that time due to the Irish Republican Army fighting with British troops there. However, Gallagher did the tour, and the result is one of the most criminally-overlooked live albums of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure energy","review":"An excellent album that demonstrates Rory's passion and ability. He plays with reckless abandon - he'll miss a note once in awhile - but more than makes up for it with the pure energy that set him apart. The only weakness is the quality of the recording, but it was 1974. Enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible","review":"This is one of the best CD that I ever listen, especially \\"A milion miles away\\" it's very good.

From the energetic opener \\"Cradle Rock\\" to the haunting \\"A Million Miles Away\\" to the one-two punch of \\"Walk on Hot Coals\\" and \\"Who's That Coming\\" as the finale, this is pure passion from an outstanding 25 year old (at the time) guitar slinger. It's unfortunate in our \\"hit\\" oriented world that more people didn't discover Rorys talent, but this is the perfect place to start. A fabulous album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rory's early years","review":"This is a classic record from Rory's early years. In it you will find all of the man's trademarks: guitar virtuosity, some great song writing, true live performing, etc. This record ranges from classic blues with some clearly BB King influences in his playing (I wonder WHo), hard rock (Tattoo'd lady, the best number here and best version ever), acoustic numbers (As the crows flies), and some of the man's most introspective songs a million miles away). The only reason I don't rate this album 5 stars is that Rory's best numbers were still to come, but otherwise is an excellent record.The package is really nice in a letter envelope- style. Essential for Rory fans and a nice way to start getting into this artist as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rory's Glory","review":"This album shows the LATE GREAT Rory Gallagher doing what he does best:Play the blues.

Perhaps the other reviewers here prefer guitar and stand-up bass as the basis or \\"pure\\" folk oriented music, but it is the song that shines through. Kenny White plays piano beautifully and In my opinion, the arrangements are superb. I dont understand the mediocre reviews of this CD. If you have seen Cheryl in person, her voice is beautiful, but she talks too much and is too politically bitchy. She would be better off singing and more of this type material would be welcome. Cheryl must not think much of this CD either, since she does not perform songs from it in the 6 concerts I have seen her in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tales of the Foreign Service","review":"Nobody would read this book to learn about Belize or the casualties left by Hurricane Hattie.

It is interesting that many compositions here are minor key and \\"blue\\"---the magnificent \\"Duid Deed\\", \\"Danceland\\" and \\"Cleopatra's Dream\\", an underrated composition. Clearly, it was Powell who influenced an entire generation of pianists such as Horace Silver, Sonny Clark, Bobby Timmons and others from the 1950s-1960s who were famous for that sound. Although other cuts don't quite match up (\\"Comin Up\\" is a strange attempt at mambo funk, \\"Borderick\\", a childlike tribute to his son, is neither here nor there), this is a solid date."},{"rating":"2","title":"a funny, intelligent book about the early days of rock","review":"Julia Watts has written a funny and intelligent book about the early days of rock music, life in Appalachia, and coming to terms with being \\"a member of the family.\\" A fantastic read for anyone concerned with any of those three topics.

And the two intermingle and inspire each other wonderfully here. Mulligan's music, as usual, is characterised by great clarity and \\"logic\\", forceful and emotionally satisfying, impeccably performed and always highly musical. Much the same can be said for Konitz, who however is \\"harder on the ear\\" in bringing to bear a greater complexity, but of a rewarding kind, as it results from a richly inventive musical mind. Hs music, though demanding, is never difficult just for the sake of it, and certainly not just \\"cerebral\\". These tracks, together with his work with Wayne Marsh, feature some of his best and most sensational work. A great CD to own, which will bring permanent pleasure! - Joost Daalder"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sound quality","review":"Very fast delivery, \\"it's awsome\\" says my child who I bought it for.

Sound quality is an improvement from our starter 1/2 size violin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad quality and unfit for use","review":"The specifications sounded perfect and the pictures looked great. The price point was right. And for a beginner student, it was cheaper than renting a violin from the stores recommended by the school. I fell for the trap. A big mistake. The violin arrived all wrapped up. My daughter was excited to open the package. I tried to set it up after looking at some videos on the Internet but it would not. The bridge would fall, the strings would not get the right tension. I sent it over to the teacher and I was told how useless this instrument was - the bridge, the strings, the bow, the tuning knobs, the overall shape of the body and alignment of the f's were all wrong and that it was simply unusable. I returned it the next day. Amazon was prompt with the pickup and credit back to my account. I eventually ended up renting from a local area store. Definitely a NO buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Think before you buy","review":"The Cecilio 3/4 size violin is very poor quality and in not good for playing.

Overall, a fine beginner instrument."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for a Beginner","review":"This was a good choice for our son as a beginner.

These girls might be fun to have a drink with, but they aren't fitness trainers. The blonde woman acts like she's in an Anna Faris role - not really awake, laughs at anything. The brown-haired woman just likes to yell bitch as much as she can. Both flail their arms without any instruction and stare robotically at ... the actual trainer? The teleprompter? Watch this is you're in the mood for a laugh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, different - a great end-of-the-day stress reliever","review":"Here's the thing - you should probably read through the books before working out with them. They have a distinct style of talking to their audiences and, from the look of some of the reviews here, some women weren't ready for it.I actually had a lot of fun with this work out. It's not as strenuous as my normal morning routine, but if you ever come home from work stressed out or annoyed or just plain angry, this is a fantastic stress relieving alternative to grabbing that bag of chips. There's a casual feel to it (the girls mess up the moves regularly) but I still broke a sweat. Anyone who puts their heart into it for 50 minutes is gonna get a workout. Don't let anyone tell you differently.It's a style that's probably not for everyone, but I'm a fan. Their books and philosophy has had me dropping weight for months and feeling like a brand new person.

Although I DO agree with the cueing being terrible, once you watch it once or twice, you should be able to move along with them with no problem. It definitely gets the blood pumping! While I also agree that sometimes the whining gets a little old, I feel that way with ANY exercise DVD's commentary. It's repetitive; but you're watching the same video over and over, OF COURSE IT'S REPETITIVE! I recommend watching it with the commentary the first few times you do it (so you can make sure you know what you're supposed to be doing), then muting and listening to your own music thereafter.The language is \\"bad\\" in a few places, but the video and the book are called Skinny Bitch, what do you expect?In summary: Highly recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL - condesendinig blather","review":"This workout is highly disappointing. These girls are obviously not fitness instructors, the worst part about this workout is the complete lack of cueing. They go from move to move with a countdown, but only once or twice do they tell you what move you'll be doing next. The way they act, you can tell they're taking cues from someone off-screen, I have to assume it's an instructor, to which I say put THAT person on screen and have these girls do the workout and add commentary. Not that the commentary is good, mind you, it's not. Don't waste your time on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"I just had to rate this because it's so bad! I've never done an exercise video that was so lacking in so many ways. I'm usually fairly positive, and I don't think I've ever given anything one star before. Thankfully I was just borrowing this and did not actually spend money on it! They should have practiced! They didn't explain what they were going to do, they just started doing it, and left their audience trying to catch up. And, the workout wasn't hard! I'm not super-hardcore, but I like a good workout. I didn't really feel like I had worked out after this was over. Also, they chattered endlessly through the whole thing. And, their chatter was not helpful, and sometimes rather nonsensical. Truly, if you're considering buying this video, borrow it from someone (or your library) first so you can see what it's like. \\"Strong Body, Ageless Body\\" by Erin O'Brien is great, as is the Cardio Burn Series by Tonja Djelavic (sp?). Happy exercising!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak Video","review":"I was really disappointed with this video. It was difficult to follow because they would change moves while the camera was focused on one person's face/torso and they did not give many verbal cues - they were too busy making snarky comments. My biggest pet peeve with fitness videos is when they work one side of your body and not the other - and this one did that! I feel like that is a big oversight in developing a workout. I did this video once and won't be doing it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrific!","review":"I sincerely wish I had checked this out prior to throwing my money away.

It was almost as if the girls sat down and said \\"OK girlfriend, how else can we make money off this franchise of skinny bitchdom??\\"Neither are particularly instructive nor appear to have any qualifications to teach an exercise class.

The difference is that Lileks' accompanying commentary is absolutely hilarious. Danny Gregory writes well enough, and draws a few laughs, but mostly he just describes the filmstrips without adding any insight.The filmstrips themselves that are featured also aren't that interesting. I'm not old enough to remember any of them, but that shouldn't matter. Several years ago I read a book on the graphic auto-safety films that used to be shown to high schoolers. I didn't remember those films, either, but I still enjoyed it.The book itself is beautiful, and if you grew up in the 1950s and remember these filmstrips, this would make an excellent coffee-table book.

Just plan on buying rechargable batteries (energizer 30min. w/4AA batt. about tweentyfive dollars). that goes for most anything that takes batteries these days. Rebate makes is an extra good deal.

The quality will surprise you. These are artfully designed and perform excellently (within their portable speaker class).Hint: The fabric carrying case does not have a 'hard side' to protect the exposed (no grill) speakers when you are transporting them.

If you want giant Klipsch speakers, then buy those, but I dare you to try and fit them in your briefcase and backpack and cart them along with you. These speakers allow you to listen to your tunes with good sound in a small environment, such as a small office, an office cubicle, a small dorm room, etc. The sound is very pleasant for their size and the current price is just right.

The actual text is taken from interviews of Catholic Workers all over N America. Because of this, it's an all-encompassing book...with voices who are Catholic, Jewish, Athiest, Buddhist, and in-between...people who practice hospitality in different ways, running Shelters, Soup Kitchens, Farms, and also homes for kids...people with all sorts of different opinions and ages...and stories of all different sorts. No one person could possibly have written such an excellent book. Also, if you're hesitating about reading this book because you think it may be too Catholic, or too political, or too do-gooder, too conservative or too radical or what have you...then I suggest that there are so many voices in this book that this need not be a concern. Somewhere in this book there is a story of profound value for everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great show that sadly ended","review":"The last season with a finale that would leave you wanting more.

Which I highly suggest buying for the Full Tower effect."},{"rating":"1","title":"When did Rick Springfield join TOP?","review":"Even bad TOP is still better than most of the stuff on the radio...but make no mistake, this is as bad as TOP gets. \\"Count On Me\\" ventures into \\"Flashdance\\" territory, but is at least listenable...and \\"Personal Possession\\" is a nice tune. As with \\"Monster on a Leash\\", however, the real problem is that it doesn't sound like TOP...it sounds like Rick Springfield or Cory Hart with the TOP Horns (and not the finest incarnation of the horns, without a strong tenor sax soloist)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this Chance","review":"Peter Sellers was a precursor to Jim Carrey in many ways. He was uproariously funny in The Pink Panther series, he was understated in \\"Lolita\\", and masterful in \\"Doctor Strangelove\\". He was a crossover comic talent who could make the viewer laugh or cry, and whole range of emotions in between.Apparently, his personal life was a sad one. Although commercially successful, and very wealthy, he was often lonely, and suffered through many failed relationships.In short, his is the type of biography that should make fascinating reading.The author, however, fails badly in his treatment of Sellers. From overwhelming the reader by the sheer volume of facts and theories about his subject, to boring the reader by his suffocating style, to making incredulous assertions, such as when he speaks about interviewing Sellers from beyond the grave via a seance.Sadly, just keeping concentration intact is a chore.This is possibly the worst book I have ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lewis Goes too Far or Not Far Enough","review":"Mr. Lewis does fine research, but what he does with it is disturbing. He indeed interviewed scads of folks who knew the brilliant British comic actor. However, his book amounts to a scathing diatribe against the character of Peter Sellers. Buldging with subjective bias about the character and morality of Peter Sellers, the book ultimately condemns him as an evil man. From almost the first page, Lewis baldly states that Sellers was an evil person, incapable because of heredity and psychological reasons, of being good. In short, the book is the product of Mr. Lewis's private witch hunt. A more balanced and fair bio of the man is \\"The Man Behind the Mask,\\" by Peter Evans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad waste of time","review":"Its such a shame that, given the subject of this book,any space at all has been given to the wildly inaccurate and very hurtful (to friends and family)opinions of this \\"writer\\". There are always going to be those who claw at fame for themselves by vilifying others,and the sleaziest of all are those who pick on much-loved dead superstars who can't refute the libel in person. The non-research carried out by this \\"author\\" included not even contacting Peter Sellers' first wife prior to publication. If anyone wants to spend money and read drivel, this is the one for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the most biased biographies I have ever read","review":"From the computer enhanced photo of a sickly, green-faced PeterSellers on the cover to the ridiculously slanted last page, this bookwas filled with nothing but heresay and boldfaced lies. From the way this \\"biographer\\" talks of Sellers, you would think that Sellers slept with his wife or firebombed his house or something. I feel bad for the trees that were killed to create this scandelous trash heap. I suggest \\"Remembering Peter Sellers\\" by longtime friend Graham Stark, or \\"Peter Sellers; A Celebration\\". True, you won't find dirt, but you will find substantive information and anecdotes about England's greatest comic talent since Charles S. Chaplin; Peter Sellers. END"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Flawed Man, But Not As Flawed As This Book","review":"Peter Sellers was an amazing comic force, but also a flawed human being; often quite difficult to work with and given to bouts of childishness. Thus, one would not expect a biography of his life to paint a glowing portrait. However, nor should one have to wade through this rubbish, from an author who writes like he works for \\"Hard Copy\\" and who liberally fills in the blanks with his own imagination, drumming up entire conversations and thought processes. A lot of research went into this book, no doubt, but a lot of research was left out, as well.

The little intertwined stories and metaphors and moments of beauty make the book a read that tastes tremendous on your tongue.THE WARNING: yes, here is is. This is a prose poem.

Instead of focusing on mechanics and positions in the swing, the author keys on six angles vital to effective ball striking. Five are established in addressing the ball. All are clearly defined and illustrated. The book also contains some excellent drills to help the reader get into better positions at address. There are chapters on the short game and even a few pages on the swing itself. This is an excellent book for anyone above a 10- or 12-handicap or for any golfer who has come to the conclusion that setting up to the ball correctly makes up at least 75 percent of effective ball striking. It is also easy to read. Most importantly, the key points made can be put to the test right away at the driving range."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Beautiful Holiday Album","review":"I don't write reviews, especially of symphonic works, as I am not an educated music critic. But I had to give my impression of this album. Most would agree that holiday albums are a dime a dozen. Now that can be a good thing, concidering that such a massive selection to choose from allows one to find what strikes their fancy best. That said, however, finding original music and performances of true quality takes some looking.This album is one of the most beatiful I have heard in a long time. It is performed by the matchless London Symphony and I have found it to be a perfect soundtrack for the holiday season. If you are looking for an alternative to albums that only offer more of the same songs, and want some truely original content that you will love to hear over and over...Buy this!

Wilder's simple style and sincerity come through on every page. These books, this one included, are classified as children's literature, but I find that they appeal to the youth in all of us. I can hardly think of a better book, or set of books to get a child started reading. Not only are they exposed to some very good writing and story telling, but they also get a first hand account of one aspect of our countries history seen through the eyes of a little girl.

I particularly enjoyed reading a theologian's nightmare. However hardly any of this book is philosophy on par with Russell's work in other subjects.

Very interesting but hardly any truth and substance against Christian thought."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"As a Christian who has studied math and philosophy, I am quite familiar with Bertrand Russell's contributions to logic and philosophy, I am quite impressed with his brilliance. When I first got this book, I was afraid of what kind of powerful arguments he might present against my beliefs, instead I was shocked to find his arguments poorly constructed, his premises, shoddy, his logic full of holes. I expect much better from a man of his genius. It is quite obvious that his atheism wasn't based on a reasoned analysis of philosophy, a rigorous deduction from the evidence, rather, it was the result of a strong emotional bias against Christian ethics, particularly sexual ethics, period. A disappointment through and through. Whether you are atheist or theist, if you are looking for a good, through, reasoned arguments against God, you should look elsewhere than the writing of Bertrand Russell."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty dated","review":"Elizabeth Taylor won an Oscar for this overheated drama about a call girl wanting to go straight and find love. To me, the movie was terribly dated. The awful incidental music, complete at one point with a fully-orchestrated fugue in four parts, was intrusive and the dialogue was stilted. Taylor's acting was OK -- she was sexy in a kind of lush, overheated way. But the rest of the acting was so-so at best. Eddie Fisher demonstrated why this was one of only a couple of movies he appeared in and Laurence Harvey's hair was his most expressive feature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong number for Liz","review":"While Elizabeth Taylor is visually beautiful in this film the script is extremely dated and hackneyed. Women are all sluts or as blindly devoted as dogs. Being a \\"fallen\\" woman means you have to die dramatically. The searing scene where Taylor reveals the trauma that made her what she is is the only dramatically realistic minutes in the movie. Everything else is cliched dialogue and overheated acting. Better to remember Liz for A Place in the Sun or some of her other better films.The believability of scriptwriting and acting has improved light years since this quaint early 60's period piece."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Liz IS big. It's the picture that got small\\"","review":"Elizabeth Taylor was one of the most beautiful women in the world back in 1960 and she's always been a very talented actress. As the promiscuous model that finally fell in love, Taylor was the best thing in the dated, overly melodramatic, often ridiculous movie that was adapted from the John O'Hara's novel (written in 1935). I did not read \\"Butterfield 8\\" but I can't believe that the author of \\"Appointment in Samarra, and \\"The Lockwood Concern\\" wrote the stuff the cheap soap-operas are made of. Liz was big and she deserved her first Oscar but there are so many bad things about the movie - uninteresting characters, uninspired acting by the male protagonists, horrible irritating musical score - just a few of them. I read that Taylor hated the move when she was making it and she hates it now - I don't blame her.

That is one amazing scene.As a total guilty pleasure, I enjoy watching \\"BUtterfield 8\\" and \\"Suddenly Last Summer\\" one after another, a movie none of the other reviewers mentioned.

I was a bit disappointed, not because the album isn't good but because I felt it wasn't the John Stewart I know. The lyrics didn't have the same punch for me. I love his more folksy songs such as the ones that appear on Chilly Winds (my fave) or Wires From the Bunker. These songs definitely had a more 80s feel rather than that folksy reflective feel I like. If you are a fan of John's older stuff, I would recommend getting those albums first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smart Lyrics + Catchy Melodies = Great Music","review":"I listened to this CD when it was leaked prior to the release, and then quickly preordered it.

I advise you to use your free time for more worthwhile sustenance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Day of Reckoning review","review":"First of all I think that the \\"Day of Reckoning\\" should have been read over a few times before it was published. The author does hit on some good points, allowing the reader to know more about the Columbine High shootings. The author jumps around alot inserting comments and paragraphs that should not even be in the paragraph. It was a very poor book. The author tries to insert to much into one paragraph as well as the chapter. We need to read the book so we can empathize with the family of the victims. But the author put me in a place of confusion and he is a very poor writer, however I would recommend this book to someone else to read not because it is a good book but because it has some good points on Columbine that can be enlightful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the 0 star option?","review":"This book doesn't even deserve one star; since there was no option for one star, I figured it at least deserves one star for the author being brave enough to publish it. This book is the biggest joke to literature. The author didn't even bother to look up his information under an acurate source, considering one of his most abundent sources is altavista.com (not realizing that it is a search engine). This book just rambles on and on about pointless theories and so called 'conspiricies.'

This book has no real focus, no real meaning, and to be honest, no real point. Murphy's style is an atrocity. It is a completely wretched read, and I don't think that I would pay someone to read this book. Murphy jumps all over the place, and never really stays on one track, he seems to have a wandering mind...especially when he wrote this. I don't think that I will ever read another book by Murphy.-scott skillings"},{"rating":"1","title":"History Class Lecture","review":"Reading this book, I expected to learn more about the family lives of Harris and Klebold. I was hoping to better understand their personal lives and personal fears. Instead, I got a confusing mass of content with no transitions. I felt that it was overkill of everything that has happened in the past. I undersatnd that some of the references connect with the Columbine Massacre, but could not find the smooth transitions needed to connect the topics. I felt the book emphasized that teens are plyable and stupid. I felt it bashed the internet and the media. I did however, appreciate the thouroughness of how it is easy for anyone to have a gun. Also, it was nice to read how Murphy doesn't think it's too late for America. It just seems that he doesn't think of the past how it really was. There were also many typos. I guess I just wasn't expecting what I got."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of trees","review":"This book was a pile of biast, unresearched dribble. Murphy rambles on for pages about unrelated topics and does not even attempt to connect them to the massacre at Columbine.

Oh, and he should have bought a dictionary!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the Point?","review":"I feel that this book is very poorly written. This book totally lost my interest. I just couldn't get into it because every bit of it was facts, restated over and over again. I don't at all mind that his book was based on facts, I just didn't think his presentation was very effective. Overall I feel this book was written very poorly because the subject matter wasn't given very much thought. One may even assume that it was written ona rush, in order to capitalize."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing Literary","review":"The publication, Day of Reckoning is one of the kind of books that you literally have to understand the text in between the text.Murphy disturbingly goes from one complete thought to the next. There are no bridges drawn or connections. This book should have been insightful on the Massacre at Columbine High but, the only thing Murphy primarily writes about is his personal views and opinions about how technology today is corrupting our society.If your looking for empathy and compassion in this book for the victims you will not find it. Interestingly enough the references to Klebold and Harris,the actual murderers at Columbine High seem to be filled with the authors assumption of thier characteristics and not researched facts.This book is an assigned reading for a English course, and I think based upon the authors writing style,this book is an effective tutorial on how not to compose your thoughts on paper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Day of Reckoning","review":"Titanic, Star Trek, Dungeons and Dragons, She's All That, Varsity Blues, The Matrix...no, I'm not listing off my movie collection, these all seem to have led to the shootings at Columbine!

If you do, you will enjoy this marvelous piece of literature, full of random pieces of information disguised as facts, as well as a plethora of grammatical errors. If you are insanely compelled to buy this book, I will sell you mine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Murphy is publicity-seeking himself!","review":"First of all, Murphy wrote this book without thinking about his audience. He has numerous spelling and grammatical errors. His book outweighs the actual article (over-determination) and the titles have no connection to subjects. He is not coherent and he needs to start using transissions. Furthermore, he has a bias point of view. This book is ok for people who believe in such way as Murphy but for most young people it is insulting. Just because we use the Internet, see/hear MTV, or entertain ourselves by playing violent games doesn't mean that we're going to mimic what Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold did! Murphy has to focus and be more objective in his writings. The only good thing about this book is that we learn what NOT to do in our writings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Day of [terrible]","review":"I believe that my title speaks for itself. Murphy outlines the history of neo-nazism and very rarely does he make references to the events of Columbine. Murphy seems to blame everyone except maybe the one true reason, that these kids were just crazy. Murphy seems to have a biased towards everyone but in no way does he support how it relates to Columbine. Murphy's presence in the writing world seems to support the Confederate way of life. I love the way Murphy spends 5 pages descibing how the internet works, and how he sites web addresses in the text... Murphy's opinions are in this book, in fact i think he's ever been to Columbine. But i can say that alot of people have bought his book, infact my entire class bought it (required reading). I guess if I contribute anymore negative feedback Murphy will compare me the negative subculture of generation x. And my class knows that printing a sequel to this book would be torture..."},{"rating":"1","title":"A mistake that written","review":"This book was an a mistake that was written. Murphy never really focus on the murders he just stated that the kids might have gotten their ideas from music and the world wide web. He never thought once to research the story before he wrote this book. Murphy is a one sided person that was just telling people what he thought of the situation and not the actual facts. He eventually made some assumptions that were right but most of them were wrong. He had some truth to some of the things he wrote about but most of them never made sense until many many pages later. I think that if your going to write a book on such a serious issue then maybe there should only be facts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing","review":"I did not like this book at all. I thought that it was very poorly written. There were numerous grammatical errors, and it did not flow together. He kept jumping around from one point and then to another completly different point. A majority of the things that he wrote about didn't even pertain to the rest of the book. Eric and Dylan were not even mentioned all that much. Another thing that I did not like about the book was that it made it seem like society, the media and things such as violent movies and video games caused Eric and Dylan to kill their classmates. There was also a lot of times where the points made were unclear or just ridiculous. I felt like the book was never really focused on Columbine, it seemed to be centered on the trouble with society and kids today."},{"rating":"1","title":"EXAMPLE OF TIME WASTED","review":"The Day of Reckoning is a book that reflects the work of a mere opportunist the author John Murphy saw the opportunity to intrigue people with mis-information as well as poor details and he ran with it. The book is poorly written and doesnt flow for the reader Murphy is all over the place with his writings he jumps from subject to subject in the beginning I thought the book was about Nazi history but it ended up in another direction with alot of useless details. This piece definitely doesn't make for an easy read. On a scale of 1 to 5 i'd give it a zero."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO FOCUS","review":"I THOUGHT THAT MURPHY'S BOOK WAS TERRIBLY PUT TOGETHER.

HIS INFORMATION WAS UNFACTUAL AND THE TONE OF THE BOOK WAS THAT MURPHY THOUGHT HE JUST KNEW EVERYTHING ABOUT THE INTERNET AS IF HE HAD DISCOVERED IT. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO ANYONE WHO WANTS TO KNOW THE REAL TRUTH ABOUT THE COLUMBINE MASSACRE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review","review":"I thought that John Murphy is terrably confused in this book that he has written. Very often he goes off into space with these random ideas that do not even correlate with the main subject at hand. It is as if he brought ten books into one. He makes many statments in the book, but does not back them up at all with any statistics. Also, his sources that he does use are very questionable. Overall, I didn't like the book at all, and thought it needed a lot more editing then was done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better Luck Next Time","review":"I personally would not recommend this book to anyone. I find it to be very appalling that someone would actually consent to the printing of this piece of... literature? Mr. Murphy obviously wrote this book just to say he is a published author. One would think from the title that you would actually learn something about that fateful day at Columbine. However, one soon comes to find that this is definitely not the case. All you will read about is Mr. Murphy's take on the Internet, neo-nazism, the media, and his vast knowledge of military history. I wish you all the luck on your next book, Mr. Murphy."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Day of Reckoning: The Massacre at Columbine High School","review":"Murphy's lack of knowledge and ability to write makes the book very difficult to read. He doesn't cover anything that relates to the Columbine Massacre, but instead places useless information about the \\"World Wide Web\\" and \\"KMFDM\\". Yes, the two teens were users of the internet, and may have listened to bands like KMFDM; however, Murphy's writing is completely incoherent. By the second page, he begins to discuss topics that are not relevent to the incident. He also writes as though his readers have never seen or even heard of such things like the internet. Maybe he should stick to being a history major, and not try to become a famous novelist. If I could give this book negative stars, I would. I highly recommend saving the [amt]and spending it on something more useful. The novel should have been called, A Day of Reckoning: The Massacre of a Novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely not a page-turner!","review":"Why would someone or anyone want to pay [money] for a book that makes absolutely no sense and is filled with both spelling and grammatical errors? In his book, Day of Reckoning: The Massacre at Columbine High School author, John Murphy wastes page after page with his senseless drivel about what he thought had really gone through the minds of Dylan and Kliebold.The only page turning was done was to see what else he could make up. Blaming anything and anyone he can think of blaming for what occurred. In addition, often researching whom he is blaming very poorly. In most cases, it appears that the web was searched and the first hit that came up was solid enough to be put it the book.For a book that is very biased and very unorganized it is a shock to see that such a book was published; considering it should never have been published.I recommend that one does not buy this book but rather find something better to do with their money."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is a waste of time","review":"This book was not very well thought out.

He talks the Nazis,SWAT team tactics, and the movie \\"Matrix\\" really well, but as far as Colombine, we know the same information we knew about the situation before we read Murphy...."},{"rating":"1","title":"wreck of the day.","review":"If one were to harvest every bad seed that fell from every evil that has befallen our race in it's twentieth century,one would apparently arrive at the root cause of the Columbine high massacre.Simplistic and jejune as this may seem, Mr. Murphy has succeeded in packing this volume with dazzlingly shocking tidbits that create a strand of events that only conclude in the very real possibility that a conspiracy cooked up by Hitler, M-TV and the creators of our modern technology is why these confused and amoral boys were led to do the things they did. If this sort of sweeping delirium appeals to your senses then rush right out to get your very own copy.You won't be disappointed.It,s just such a sad comment however, that an event of such obvious social proportions has not yet been written.It may never be.It's patently old news by now to most,and that's the real point isn't it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Samuel L Jackson was excellent in the Matrix!!","review":"If I were to say that this book was worthy of purchasing or even taking the time to read, I would be a liar. Along with the internet, Mr. Murphy must have never heard of \\"spell checks\\" or \\"proofreading before publishing to avoid horrible mistakes.\\" Mistakes that were the most obvious were the spelling errors, the grammar confusions, and the inconsequential rambling about slightly related but primarily mind numbing details. Yet this book still managed to have one redeeming lesson to be learned. You don't have to be a good writer to have a book published."},{"rating":"1","title":"awful","review":"The author needed to invest in an editor. He makes some good points but due to the poor grammar and writing style it's hard to keep your attention. Had he stuck to one thing it like a wand developed riter is supposed to then the book might have been good. Due to his single causality however we don't see what really ent on in columbine. He should have used more personal interviews i think what would've kept the interest of the reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Day of Reckoning","review":"The author needed to invest in an editor. Throughout the book he begins making a point, but then goese of onto something different. This left me wanting more. I think he should have used more personal interviews maybe even traveled to the school, but he didn't. He uses single casuality throughout much of the book. Had he stuck to one point and went along with it the book might have been good, but there're to many random points within it to keep my attention. I thought this book was awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better Off Reading His New Book","review":"John, Murphy beats around the bush abous his subject, and does not get straight to the point. He doesn't even give good supporting evidance or facts to support what he is saying. Eventhough editors reread his book for errors, there are still MANY grammer errors! Spell check on a computer could do a better job. A big factor that bothered me was how Murphy hardly mentioned Eric and Dylan until the the last two chapters of the book. Murphy would talk about subjects that did not even pertain to the Columbine incident."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bewildered","review":"Reading this book left me with many questions. First, what was the author trying to convey to the reader? Second, was the authors intent to confuse the reader by jumping from one point to another with no link to the previous point?In the end, I certainly would not recommend this book and my expections were clearly not met. Also, some good editing would have been helpful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the editor?","review":"I can give Murphy credit for some of the points he makes in his book. But, this book has a lot of great ideas with no form and no conclusion to any of the ideas that are started. Besides Murphy's jumping around from idea to idea, he has so many gramatical and structural mistakes that it was a distraction from the reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Day of Reckoning - Crazy book","review":"I think Murphy did not write this book very well. He tried to use the massacre at Columbine high school and compare it to Nazi organizations, video games, guns, and the Internet. He did not construct a premise for his opinions. He did not present facts in a way to justify his point-of-view. Nevertheless, I felt he did a great job in detailing reactions of law enforcement during the massacre."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was poorly written","review":"I thought 'The Day of Reckoning' by John Murphy was terribly written. The subject matter throughout the book changed very erratically, and the book ends up not really going in any direction. The irregularities made it hard not only to follow along with the text, but also to hold any interest whatsoever. For example, John Murphy expresses his views on the how shoddily the tragedy was handled by the SWAT team in one sentence, and in the next sentence he brings up Monica Lewinsky. In addition to the poor writing style, I also felt that this book holds no real merit. To say the least, this book did not do any justice to the Columbine tragedy."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Book About Nothing","review":"The title of this book does not fit the content. Murphy discusses many issues and people in this book that does not have any connection to what you would think the book is about. Also, Murphy should have had an editor look over this book before it was published because he makes a lot of grammatical errors that a fifth grader can spot. He basically tried to take advantage of a national tradegy to make his pockets a little fatter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Come on already!","review":"It is great that someone wishes to write about the Columbine Massacre, but is this really what Murphy is writing about? Internet great he seems excited for the new technolgy and also claims that is full of violence and not good. Beyond being all over the board on the topic and jumping from excuse to excuse at times you can see what Murphy is saying. Overall I was not very impressed with the writing style or how Murphy discussed such a touchy subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"What about Columbine?","review":"I think Murphy had way too much time on his hands. His book is full of military history, mis-spelled words and bad quotes. Though it did have its perks while our class ripped apart his poor writing, Murphy's book was pointless. I would be surprised to hear that people have actually bought this book to learn about the Columbine shootings. This book honestly has no relation to the tragedy except for the fact that Murphy can spell the word \\"Columbine\\" correctly. Way to go!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Day of Reckoning: A Massacre of Literature","review":"I was incredibly disappointed in this book. I am reading it only because it is a required text in my college english class. The context is unstructured, confusing, and poorly written. I ask myself every time I attempt to read it if the publisher or editor actually looked at the book. I always seem to come to the conclusion that they did not. A Day of Reckoning is plagued with typographical, grammatical, and spelling errors. Murphy's condescending tone and prejudices regarding teens are incredibly unfair and ignorant. He creates assumptions that encompass an entire generation, my \\"MTV\\" generation, and paints a picture of us all as impressionable blank slates who cannot and do not think for ourselves. Mr. Murphy also deviates from the point of his book, Columbine and the forces that contributed to it, so often that I constantly have to ask myself what he is talking about. The book is poor example of literature and I would not recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Erica Reckoning Review","review":"The book, The Day of Reckoning, was one of the worst books that I have ever read. The author, John Murphy does'nt seem to know very much about the subjects that he is talking about. One of the first problems that I had with this book was that the author went from subject to subject without any sort of connection. It made the book really choppy, and it did'nt flow well. Another problem that I had was that Murphy did'nt seem to have researched anything really well. The book was full of information that was'nt true, which he could have found out if he had done more in depth research. There was also a lot of unuseful information, which led me to think the author was just filling space. Overall this was a terrible book not because of the subject matter, but because of the way it was written. I would not recommend this book to anyone unless they were trying to find out how a book should not be written."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Waste of Time!","review":"Wow, all I can say about this book is that it was very amusing. I have never in my life read a book that contained so many grammatical errors. I felt that this book was a waste of paper. Everything that Murphy said was completely irrelevant to the topic of Columbine. The book could have easily been condensed into a much shorter piece. The majority of the statements made by Murphy did not make sense at all. Overall, I felt that the book was a waste of my time and a waste of Murphy's as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware...","review":"If you are looking for a non-biased view of the Columbine Shootings, this is not the book for you. The Author's constant dark references to the killers gets very old, and just got in the way of what I was looking for.I wanted a straight-forward, factual listing of events, not someone's opinion of what they thought of Dylan and Kliebold.As far as the rest of the book is concerned...mindless drivel. Save your [$$$], find another book on the matter to buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Terrible!!!","review":"This book was just terrible.

Entertaining fun, and a cheap book. Good read, even if you have zero interest in wrestling (the book doesn't go into \\"match details\\" or \\"in character\\" at all).

I learned a lot of things that I wasn't aware of at the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the most entertaining wrestling books ever written","review":"What really makes this book stand out from other wrestling books is it's crispness. Since this isn't a memoir, there's a diect thread throughout the entire book that wrestling fans will enjoy and find refreshing. Its other main strength is how it works for non-wrestling fans as a study in incompetence. Even amongst the slew of corporations that went bankrupt in the 2000s, few did so faster and more dramatically than WCW, yet some decisions that were made mke it hard to believe it lasted even as long as it did (these are where the hilarious footnotes reveal their usefullness.)

If you started watching once WCW died, this is a great book on the little federation that could- but didn't. And if you hate wrestling, but for some reason still want this book, it's a great example of how NOT to run a company. Great frickin book by a great frickin author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read","review":"A well written and detailed look into how a once unstoppable company fell to such low levels. Reynolds and Alvarez present it all in an entertaining way, not only poking fun of the ridiculous events that took place during WCW's downfall, but showing exactly how they hurt the company.My only complaint would be that at times it felt like there was more to the story than what was presented, and some more details could have been helpful to explain things."},{"rating":"1","title":"How long do we have to wait to get this?????","review":"I ordered this on December 27, 2005 and I still have not received it, it keeps going on back order and getting delayed.

Bottom line Time Warner who owned WCW mearged with AOL. Since the pro wrestling industry was on a downward slide the new owners, who did not rely solely on wrestling to make money, and did not care about wrestling anyway decided to cut WCW programing from their T.V. stations and sell the rights. Dont buy any books from these two leeches of pro wrestling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap just Crap","review":"Save your money and buy the DVD The Monday Night War. This book just copys that DVD.

It's sad that the band was somewhat short lived and most people have no idea who they are, and they are severely missing out. Each track of beautiful insanity with catchy instrumentals and Katie Jane Garside's vocals, at times screaming, gasping for breath or even vomiting (I love the Future Free.) is just...great. Eleventeen is a fantastic album and it is a shame that it is out of print. And since that is so, if you can get your hands on an album don't ever let it go!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love There money!","review":"Saw Daisy Chainsaw play at the Whiskey A Go Go in the 90's and it was probably one of the craziest shows I have ever seen live! Drilling baby doll heads, potted flower pots on wigs, and glitter buckets! What fun! Now I can reminess watching there videos! A must have for their fans!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Form","review":"I would like to repeat something said by that great philosopher Frederick of Honolulu. He said \\"Repeating silly quotes is the highest form of bad form.\\" Only a liberal nut-job would consider \\"dissent....the highest form of patriotism\\", not reasoned and rational dissent, just mere dissent. Using that sort of messed-up logic would make all the enemies of my country (the USA), patriots, since they certainly are dissenting. It is a silly saying. Dissent from anyone that so highly regards this absurd and ridiculous motto."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bitter grapes make good vinegar, not good book reviews","review":"I find it enlightening to see that all the \\"bad\\" reviews for this book are coming from people who are currently investment bankers. Sort of proves the authors' point, i.e. that a lot of bulge bracket bankers are bitter and washed up. This book is a quick and refreshing read and, if you don't have a vested interest in protecting your self-image, you'll love it. My wife and i both read it, and now we crack a smile every time we see a hotshot, slicked hair, cellphone sporting french fry jumping into a company car on park avenue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Banking in a Nutshell","review":"Monkey Business is definitely a true depiction of the world of investment banking and Wall Street. As a Wharton graduate, I've been exposed to this world, and can attest to the idiosyncracies, stupidities, and ridiculous nature of the world of investment banking. As a participant in the madness, the book poked fun at the very things I experienced and continue to endure.The book is an easy read, and it will probably take no more than a couple of sittings to finish it. It's better to read before you enter the investment banking world, because then you can see how accurate the book really is. Once you've already been there, the book can get a bit boring because it rehashes what you already know. It's still a definitely fun and amusing book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wretched writing","review":"A virtual dictionary of hackneyed phrases and cliche's ... several of them misspelled, incidentally. As for the obscenity, only MBA's could make it this unfunny and tiresome. Beyond the startling insight that 100 hours a week spent copying and collating proposals will spoil your social life, there are no significant insights into the world of investment banking here. Disillusioned with the shallow and mercenary world of DLJ, these young Horaces flee to the bucolic pleasures of hedge fund management. Only their callow assuredness is startling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Monkeys","review":"This book tries unsucessfully to imitate \\"Liar's Poker\\". The authors exhibit an astounding amount of prejudice and tastelessness. More importantly, there is little self-reflection on their part. If what they write is true (which, for an outsider, is hard to believe), \\"Monkey Business\\" raises more questions about the authors' character and intelligence than about investment banking in general or DLJ in particular."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very funny. Great intro to I-Banking.","review":"This book is about as honest of an account of the investment banking lifestyle as one could expect (as far as I can tell, I'm not an I-banker). Slightly childish at times, but overall, very funny and entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very interesting","review":"I read this book on two airline flights, and the time FLEW by! Very, very interesting look into the world of investment banking. As an avid trader (and I worked on Wall Street), I highly recommend this book. Disclaimer: any respect you had for people on Wall Street will slowly dissipate."},{"rating":"2","title":"five stars for honesty","review":"Out there is an army of white males taking or preparing for the LSAT, GMAT, GRE and applying to law schools and business schools. This is not exactly the road less travelled, but neither was the road to Rome, right?I could really relate to this book. OK it's fairly shabbily written - reads like it was put together over a couple of all-nighters - but, especially the stuff on office bishop bashing, it is honest in a way that is sometimes startling. Pick your poison - this is how it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Former Investment Bankers make Bad Writers","review":"I am an analyst at a top-3 Investment Bank in the financial analyst training program. I feel that this book was terribly written, both in grammar and content. The authors, Troob and Rolfe, try to paint an \\"oasis\\" picture of Wall St. banking from the 80's only to be hit with the realities of the 90's. A child might enjoy this book, but anyone with some knowledge of Wall St. and especially banking, should steer clear of this disappointing failure. Stick to finance guys...you're definitely not writers!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yet Another Liar's Poker Knock-Off","review":"This has been done before - and Michael Lewis did it with better writing. Lewis showed a unique journalistic flair for making somewhat esoteric financial instuments like CMOs actually interesting, and he showed a novelist's touch and insight through his musings on human greed and arrogance. Liar's Poker was both broader in scope and deeper in penetration than this fluff. Anyone of 10,000 people could have written this book - it's nothing more than a recording of events that took place in the brief careers of these spectacularly mediocre worker bees."},{"rating":"1","title":"written by whining brats","review":"I bought this book primarily because of its supposedly \\"candid\\" view of I banking. What I found it to be was a book written by two ungrateful whiners. Despite the fact that they are travelling by private jet, staying in world class hotels, and earning over 200K a year, they manage to whine that they are over worked and just \\"cogs\\" in the machine. Give me a break, im sure that by the time they graduated Bschool they knew what investment banking entailed. I banking is not an emotionally rewarding profession, and most corporate positions are not. I dont know what these guys were expecting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must read for those considering a career in I-Banking","review":"I've read many books on wall street and this one is definitely the fastest read. You almost feel like you've worked as an IBanking associate after you've read it. There's no doubt, this is a great book, and anyone who reads it will enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must read for all you wanna be I-bankers","review":"Hilarious book! Gives real insight on Investment Banking, how the business functions, the various methods to value a company, the pains of the job, and examples of a normal day in their lives. If you are a college student dying to get into I-banking, or anyone who wants a laugh and some info on I-banking, this is a MUST read. However, don't let the book get you down. Many firms on Wall Street do not have the culture that DLJ did. I-Banking is a rewarding job with some pain (hours and the egos you have to deal with). It's not for everyone, as Monkey Business proves."},{"rating":"2","title":"The truth hurts...","review":"An excellent depiction of the white-collar slavery that hums inside every investment bank. This book is great for college and business school students who are lured by i-banking recruiters and the prospect of living well at the expense of corporate America.My chief criticism of the book, though, is that it vastly exaggerates the role that associates play in deal execution. (In fairness, this could have been a simplification that the editors wanted.) In reality, most of the grunt work is done by the real \\"monkeys\\" in this business, the analysts, eager graduates of selective four-year colleges, worked to the point of physical and mental exhaustion for two or three years and then kicked back on the street to get \\"real,\\" lower-paying jobs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible! Criminal!","review":"Why is this book getting even one five star rating? Because the people reading it are evidently as shallow as the authors? Because the competition in with regard to the subject matter is similarly weak? I read 75 books a year. This is the worst piece of writing I've seen -- since I can remember. The authors are full of themselves and little else (shallow). This book is not interesting, not informative and not funny. If you want this book, you pay shipping and I'll send it to you free (hardcover, barely used). No kidding! Even then you'll feel ripped off! jmorris@allwest.net"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait for the Paperback","review":"This book, while slightly entertaining, was so horribly written. If you're interested in banking, it's a good anecdotal book on life as a banker. I hope that the reading audience realizes that almost every aspect of the book was exaggerated. We bankers aren't that crass - the 1980s are over! Furthermore, Troob and Rolfe are not of Michael Lewis' caliber - I agree with the other reviewer - guys, don't quit your day jobs!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dead boring","review":"Nothing, absolutely nothing, justifies the publication of this tedious Nothingburger. There are no new revelations about Wall Street, no well-written passages, no secrets, no drama...you name it, it ain't here.

Liar's Poker is infinitely better.I used to work on Wall Street on i-banker deals myself..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vulgarity Lives!","review":"How typical of a person who works at a successful firm to write a bunch of garbage about the firm that pushed this person above the ordinary and through the mill to become a trained and skilled Wall Street employee. I for one thought this book would be a good read, and looked forward to its release. How disappointing for me! I can only hope that the garbage spewed by these so called former bankers does not reflect how many others on the street feel towards their fellow workers, the work and their firm! I am proud to state that I work for the very firm they are slamming, but then they could not withstand the challenge of the firm they are writing about. I have been at DLJ for 14 years and can honestly say, only the good survive at DLJ. Others write books!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Off the Mark","review":"I think that this book was really off the mark. I am a junior banker at a top-3 firm and these guys didn't hit the nail on the head. I think that the reviews thus far were completely processed by friends of the authors..even the grammar in the book is bad. It is a joke that this is where literature is today...if that's what you can call it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's been sitting on my shelf for over 3 years....","review":"When I got it, I read the first chapter, got bored and when on to another book. It's been sitting on my shelf ever since, I think that says enough. Want a good read about investment banking? Read F.I.A.S.C.O by Frank Partnoy - even better than Liar's Poker."},{"rating":"1","title":"OVER RATED","review":"This book is higly informative, however the writers should be bankers and not try to pose as authors the style is weak and the content could stand some work by a professional editor. As for the story these guys are cry babies who complain about working long hours and working for maladjusted ego -maniancs. Boo-hoo I am crying out loud for you when you take a job in banking you sell out for the 200K comp. package. Get real guys you have had everything in you life handed to you. Take this book for the info about the industry and look past these wimps rants. These guys hopefully will never write another book.

Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely funny and revealing!","review":"This book definitely ranks as a must-buy -- if you must buy one book on investment banking make sure its this one. Looks like 'Liar's Poker' finally has some serious competition!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait for the Paperback","review":"The book, itself, was rather entertaining but horribly written. Troob and Rolfe did get the basics of investment banking down - although I am sure they took dramatic license and exaggerated their associate experiences. For those people who are new to the industry, the book will give you some insight into the profession and explain the basics of what \\"drafting\\" means, or what is a pitch book... However, as far as the quality of writing, Rolfe and Troob need some help. Guys, don't quit your day job!"},{"rating":"2","title":"reaffirming why I WANT to be an investment banker","review":"This book is gregarious and funny. As a senior in college about to head into the investment banking world next year, this book reaffirms everything I had hoped about the industry. Perhyaps I'm masochistic, but everything this book portrays makes me more excited to begin.Immaturity, debauchery, frat-like atmosphere, money, travel, etc -- bring it on!Where else can one get overly compensated for acting like a child (and performing many tasks that an Excel spreadsheet can do)? Don't want to put up with long hours and sick bosses? Well, don't forget that one day you will have the priviledge of being the ever-demanding boss overseeing minions who one day want to be in your shoes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Realistic and Funny!","review":"Any and all bankers know deep in their heart that this book is realistic. I am a banker and I can guarantee that Monkey Business is the straight scoop. Yes, there is locker room humor. Yes, there is vulgarity. Yes, that is the way it is. The book is well written and really funny. Anyone with a sense of humor will love this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"They nailed it!","review":"If you really liked Liar's Poker, you'll absolutely love this book. Factual, to the point, no-holds barred account of what makes the world go 'round. Whether you're a passive investor in a retirement account or a trader in the pit, this book sums up what the financial world is all about and what human nature is REALLY all about. If you don't read this book, you shouldn't even be able to access CNBC. Every business school student in the world should have to read this book and have an essay test on it in order to graduate. Just plain old great stuff!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic book, too bad everybody doesn't get it.","review":"This is a great book on a number of different levels. First, it's funny. The pages turn themselves. Second, it's engaging. The authors do what most other \\"Wall Street\\" writers are unable to do - include enough detail of the day-to-day to give the uninitiated a flavor of what's going on, but not too much so as to bury the reader in irrelevant arcana. Third, it speaks truths about the tradeoff so many people make between money and time.It seems like a few other reviewers miss the point. They call the authors \\"whiners\\", because the authors made big $$ as bankers and then had the audacity to open their mouths and complain. Hello! Hello! The point they're making is that there are some things that money can't buy, in this case peace of mind and satisfaction. It's a great lesson, and a great book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"Proabably one of the worst books I've ever read. I'm suprised Warner Books deemed it worthy of publishing. I couldn't wait for the droning and complaining to end. The authors come across as arrogrant and straight out racist. They clearly seem to think that graduating from Ivy League Business Schools gives them the right to look down on everyone else and demand some higher place in this world. Putting their prejudices aside, the book had few interesting or particularly funny moments. After all, these guys only worked for DLJ a little under two years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Someone is so desperate to sell this book they spammed","review":"yahoo message boards. Some loser names fatso708 has spammed CVM, GENZ, WQNI, GGEN, GERN, AVII, AVGN, CARN and countless others. Don't believe me, go to yahoo and type fatso708 under the message search .The book must really stink for them to have to do that to sell it. I bet all the customer 5 star reviews are spam too. Save your money. These guys are losers."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Story of Two Losers","review":"Having read at least one hundred books regarding Wall Street issues, I can easily say that this book was one of the worst I have ever read. It is filled with expletives and vulgar experiences. One would think it was written by a high school or college student rather than two adults.But they are failures. They are the ones who did not make it in investment banking. So they have chosen to express their story in the most awful way they can and try to burn their former employer, DLJ.Don't waste your money on this trash. It is more about two children who could not adapt to real life, rather than a story about tough life on Wall Street."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very vulgar - almost tossed it early","review":"But I didn't. What does that say about me? Still, I was highly offended at all the unnecessary vulgarity.That said, the book was quite readable, and interesting. Still, it was thrown together. Could have been much more informative. Not that great for someone really wanting to know how things work in the investment banking realm.For the life of me though, I simply cannot imagine how one of those authors could tell the world he did what he did \\"in public view.\\" It's one thing to do something so shameful. It's another thing to tell everybody about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I couldn't finish it.","review":"Wow. Such blatant mysogeny is surprising in the 21st century. I was getting annoyed by it, and then the language suddenly turned extremely vulgar and borderline homophobic, too. Unapologetic descriptions of company sponsored visits to strip clubs and sexual harassment are what made me eventually decide it was not worth any more of my time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"If you are a banker you may find it difficult to read this book and have to come to grips that your life stinks. Rolfe and Troob basically came to the realization that the money and the perks did not compensate them sufficiently to work in a profession that made them miserable. This is admirable. The book is extremely funny and a great read. I recommend this book to anyone who is either in banking, going into banking, has a friend in banking, wants to just laugh or even just has a bank account. Read Monkey Business and laugh for four hours straight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully Hilarious","review":"Oh yeah, those guys on Wall St. are rakin' in the dough and living the high life. Right? Wrong! This book is a hilarious account of two investment bankers (IB's) and their exhausting lives as associates at DJL. The book covers their pre-IB lives in business school (at Harvard and Wharton) all the way to the end of their IB days. Whether you're in the industry, know some one in the industry, or have absolutely no connection to the banking industry whatsoever, you will love this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great find.","review":"I stumbled across this book in the business section of a Barnes and Noble here in Denver. What a great find! I had no clue what investment bankers did before I read this. Now I know. They do very little, for a whole lot of money! I am recommending this book to all the young kids I know who do nothing but talk about money. There's more to life than that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Non-profit organization = investment bank?","review":"Since my background is in public health, Rolfe and Troob's deeply insightful book taught me a lot about the investment banking world. I used to work in a non-profit health care organization run by a former senior VP of an investment bank. She ran the non-profit like an investment bank and had all of us health care people go through the same torture that the authors were subjected to. When I finally conjured up the courage to leave that job, like Rolfe and Troob, my sanity was only partially intact. After reading this excellent book, the authors helped me understand that I am still sane -- it's the investment banking business that's insane. (At least I can now rationalize my former boss' behavior). Thank you, Rolfe and Troob!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it, cover to cover.","review":"This book was a riot. I couldn't stop laughing. So much for Gordon Gekko (or however the heck you spell it) and \\"Greed is good\\". Next time I see a Gordon look-alike walking down the street I'm going to loan him my copy of Monkey Business and tell him that the charade is over. He won't be happy!

In fact I read most of it on the flight home from N.Y.The only shame was that I had not seen it listed in any of the \\"New Release\\" lists, as I am sure there are many more people who would like to read about Investment Bankers, the money they make and how hard it really is (or is made out to be).But the book was a page turner - one of my top picks so far this year for entertainment value alone !"},{"rating":"1","title":"easy to read but short of content","review":"It's not the kind of book that bores the reader but I gave it 2 stars only because it's just excessively cynical. What I mean is that the author sees the worst in everything and everybody and yet they have chosen this career after they had previously had the chance to work in investment banking. Why could that be if the this was all about money, status and showing off? Why? Not hard to guess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trash this book","review":"Monkey Business is the story of two investment bankers trying to make sense out of the career that they have chosen. As we all know, jobs can be stressful and it often helps to temper a little humor to keep one's sanity. However, investment bankers have never been known to be top comedians and Rolfe and Troob are no exception. This book is a whiny litany from two little rich boys from Ivy League schools who did not have the tenacity to put in the hard work it required to rise to the top of their chosen field. It is written in a vernacular that one can only call high school locker room and is about as funny as a fart joke. In their world, banking assistants are to be used as sexual toys, the word processing department is a group of \\"Christopher Street fairies\\" and the copy center is \\"a platoon of patriotic Puerto Ricans\\". The book is neither informative nor funny.If you want workplace humor, stick with Dilbert."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful writing","review":"This book tries unsucessfully to imitate \\"Liar's Poker\\". The authors exhibit an astounding amount of prejudice and tastelessness. More importantly, there is little self-reflection on their part. If what they write is true (which, for an outsider, is hard to believe), \\"Monkey Business\\" raises more questions about the authors' character and intelligence than about investment banking in general or DLJ in particular."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life in investment banking is not that bad!","review":"An excellent inside beginners' guide to wall-street written in an absolutely hilarious language! But take it with a grain of salt: the humour often distorts the meaning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truth","review":"I worked at DLJ -- it is exactly as disgusting as the authors have portrayed it - if not more. The place is cruel. As the authors portray, it doesn't seem to have any ethics (promising analysts to hype a deal before they even meet the company). Honestly, I didn't even know they were that negligent in their approach to deals. To prove his case, someone should just take the aftermarket performance (1-2 years later) of DLJ's IPOS and track them verses the other investment banks like Goldman, Morgan etc. -- I think that would really tell the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Junk Food Read, For More Nutrition try Liar's Poker","review":"This book has already been written. Michael Lewis' Liar's Poker is wittier, more intelligent, and gives you more juicy inside information. And he names names, unlike this whining, nervous duo who still earn their keep in the money biz.The three interesting bits in Monkey Business were: 1) Sitting in on the pitch. 2) How the prospectus is developed. 3) The joke that is due diligence.These account for ten percent of the book. The other ninety percent meanders about in artless writing, unnecessarily crude language, and endless iterations of the menial paper shuffling that mighty MBA's must stoop to while earning $200K.Not worth your while. I'm sorry I gave it mine."},{"rating":"2","title":"slam dunk","review":"Having worked in that socially Darwinist and cutthroat institution we call Wall Street, I can attest that this book has it right. Besides being accurate and hilarious, the book is replete with investment banking lingo--hell, there's even a chapter dedicated to valuation!"},{"rating":"1","title":"3 Words (and this is from a DLJ-er)...","review":"Not very compelling. Actually, I haven't finished reading it, and I got it several weeks ago. So far, I've found that parts of the book read like a layman's guide to the basics of investment banking rather than a nitty-gritty exposé of this proverbial boys' club. Perhaps I should finish those last couple of chapters...maybe some time when I'm really bored..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"It is a fun book to read, it gives a real insight of Investment Banking. If you are interested in going into this industry, read this book first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glamour in Investment Banking????","review":"One of those books that MBA graduates must read before considering entering the Investment Banking industry. Fun and easy to read. Useful to understand the cost-benefit relationship about joining an investment bank."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gotta read it.","review":"Troob and Rolfe highlight the real world of investment banking with a unique wit. Anyone thinking about a career in investment banking, whether in NYC, London, Tokyo or elsewhere should read. After all the appearance may be different, but the rules of the game are the same wherever you go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Industry Standard's favorite book of the year?","review":"I work for a large VC shop. Came across this book through a review in the Industry Standard which, as an aside, was one of the best reviews I've ever seen them write. On every count, the review was accurate. This book blazes a trail across the investment banking landscape akin to Sherman's march across Georgia. Scorched earth and all. Like clockwork, I get calls from investment bankers each week trying to grease me up for a little fee work. Unfortunately, professional decorum dictates that I play nice when all I really want to do is throw a couple of sweet insults their way. Monkey Business takes care of my desires for me, and does it in a truly enlightening way. For anybody yearning for a peek into the world of investment bankers, this is required reading. For anybody wants to poke the bear, this is required reading. For anybody in business school, this is required reading. Great stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"I am married to an investment banker. Now I'm not sure why.","review":"Monkey Business made me laugh, and it also made me wonder why I ever married an investment banker. Thanks to the authors, I now know what my investment banking husband is actually doing when he tells me that he'll be coming home late from the office. He is either responding to unnecessary frantic phone calls from clients and senior bankers, or getting lap dances from two-bit hookers. Seriously, this book was great. It sometimes got a little graphic for my taste, but it kept me laughing nonetheless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite Entertaining","review":"Read it BEFORE you get brain-washed by the I-Bankers preaching at your school (MBA or undergrad). It is of course, an exagerated, negative view, but nonetheless needed to compensate the sales pitch of Wall Street on campus."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious & Entertaining Insider's View","review":"The authors not only talk the talk but walk the walk. They've been there and done that... to say the least. As a relatively inexperienced MBA whirling about the world of finance and producing endless Excel spreadsheets, I find this to be the most honest picture as to what awaits an I-banker whether they do their stint in Manhattan or here abouts in Chicago. If you want a true to life picture without any of the glitz and propaganda that so often accompanies this little understood industry then this most definitely is a \\"must read\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"I found this book entertaining, well-written and really fun. It let's the reader in the locker room called investment banking and the authors did a great job. The stories and characters are great and the moral of the story is meaningful. Life is meant to be lived and not just to chase the almighty dollar."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a crazy world...","review":"A pleasure to read by both the masse proletaire and the up-and-coming capitalist piglet. The economist, John Galbraith, was correct: the world's economies have been mismanaged by a lineage of idiots. \\"Monkey Business\\" dredges up a clump of this depraved horde: investment bankers. As a first-hand account, \\"Monkey Business\\" combines humor and candor to expose the extraordinary world of investment banking. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read!","review":"A fabulous book! Really funny, down to earth and a genuine depiction of life as an I-banker analyst!

As far as the cinematography goes, the video is shot professionally. The information that Jared presents is friendly and concise, it is good for both beginners and for the seasoned gun owner. Relating how the non aggression principal coincides with gun training was for me the most unique(and fun) aspect of this video. I especially like the revised definition of the non aggression principal 2.0 I would recommend this as a great gift to any gun owner, it will be a nice addition to their library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fish maby but not Shrimp.","review":"I was very disappointed with this soup base. Not that it has a bad flavor just that is is definitely not a shrimp flavor. Would pass for a fish base but no more than that. Even as a fish base you can tell that they are using flavors that the FDA would pass as natural but we would all be surprised at exactly where they came from. The first ingredient is shrimp and natural shrimp liquids but I would say that there is a lot more juice than shrimp meat. Tremendous amount of salt but that is to be expected in these things. You would be better off spending your money on the cost equivalent of frozen shrimp and use that in place of this. Then you would have a more authentic flavor and more control over the salt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mother board Intel 945","review":"I had built my own computer over 3 years ago and when I reviewed all Intel items available at the time the motherboard, I then chose was rated very high by \\"PC magazine\\" my computer has been very reliable ever since the very first time I powered it up.

However all it talked about was american cars and the evolution af indy cars and Nascar. There are rally cars, touring cars, endurance racing all different types of racing all over the world. In fact racing probably did'nt even start first in the USA. I learned nothing new nor could I interest my young nephew in it. I also got the motorcycle video and it was just as bad.

It was worth every penny! By demonstrating the particular stylistic quirks of Japanese animation (anime) and graphic novels (manga), it has helped her drawings gain the expressiveness she desires. After just one week of studying the examples, she improved dramatically.This book does not have extensive text and thus is perfect for middle school children and older to learn by copying the examples. Unlike some of the volumes in this series, the pictures are not risque.I recommend this book for anyone who has mastered the basics of anime style and is looking for ways to improve facial expressions."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent character designer's crib book","review":"This book focuses directly on character design. Its best feature is that it shows various features and demonstrates precisely how, in the stylistic language of anime, these features interact to form believable character traits. Invaluable for those times when your generic cute girl character needs just a touch more strength, or needs to express a little more shyness.It's possible to complain that the archtypes they show are too generic, but I feel that's one of the book's strengths. It explains the rules and conventions, using neutral characters so that the lesson shows clearly. It expects you, the character designer, to apply these lessons with whatever degree of subtlety you prefer.The book is somewhat expensive for its content (especially compared with such great values as /the animator's survival kit/, by richard williams,) but it's quite useful, and still recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard to find","review":"If your really wish to learn how to draw anime and manga this is the book you are looking for.

If you check ebay, periodically, they auction at approximately $20-$25 for a copy of this, so don't get ripped off by some unrealistic, greedy, seller selling for more than that."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best Fillmore Shows","review":"This captures what the dead were about in the late 60's early seventies, bluesy spacey jams. The first cd incredible, an awesome \\"Casey Jones\\" (much better than any studio version) an awesome \\"Dire Wolf\\", and other great dead classics. Second disc is all about the jams, a great \\"that's it for the other one\\"--> to \\"lovelight\\". The third disc is another really strong set. This is a great cd for any deadhead to own, but the reason I give it for stars is because a person not to familiar with the dead might be a little pushed away from this pick.

These compositions have earned him many royalties as well as enriching Mr.Klugh artistically. Finger Paintings, Dr. Macumba, and the other compositions penned by Earl Klugh have achieved cult status. Though not not widely known by the general public, you have no doubt heard his music on television shows and elevators the world over. His playing has a Segovia-like ring that absorbs the listener in a subtle and mysterious manner. The special gold recordings may be just a gimmick to get you to pay extra for what essentially sounds like a regular CD, audiophiles notwithstang, I would go for the regular CD.

His sense of improvisation along with his choice of material is suberb. The \\"Time of the Season\\" duet with Cassandra Wilson is an excellent arrragement of the 60's rock tune. My personal favorite was \\"All the Things You Are\\" which highlighted his vocal range and true jazz \\"scat\\". Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I want like him, but...","review":"I've tried to listen to Kurt Elling for a couple of years now and am aware that he is being touted as \\"the next best thing in male jazz vocalists\\" but I have to say once you get past the 'slickness', there's not much. His voice is often flat and in my mind he's borderline tone-deaf, not to mention those incessant monotone scat ramblings. I want to like this guy just based on the material he tackles, but so far I cannot warm up to him. I will keep listening though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shoot THE MESSENGER","review":"Kurt Elling's freshman CD displays all the problems of a young artist showing off before taste, restraint and maturity thankfully caught up with him. Aside from a few wonderful cuts, such as the swinging \\"Tanya Jean\\" and a duet with Cassandra Wilson on \\"Time of the Season\\", much of the ablum is an unlistenable collision of Elling's worst excesses in vocal flash against blaring crash in the arrangements. Case in point: The unfortunate version of \\"Nature Boy\\" which opens the album, and which Elling and Co. send to Pluto and back before it slams to Earth. Anyone looking for an introduction to Elling - and he is one of the most thrilling, amazing jazz singers out there, particularly when seen live - would be best off with one of his later efforts, such as the lovely extended mood piece of FLIRTING WITH TWILIGHT or 2003's jazzy THE MAN IN THE AIR, which displays the matured Elling at his best. As for THE MESSENGER, don't bother to answer the call."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheesy...","review":"Kurt Elling has a decent voice, but doesn't write meaningful lyrics. His writing involves copying the style of beat poets to a much lower standard, and placing words above fast solo passages to which he can barely pronounce the syllables. It ends up sounding entirely ridiculous. The musicians on the album sound great, even if they're playing on some obnoxiously smooth arrangments, yet Elling hardly improvises in his phrasing, giving the tunes a hokey, and uninspired sound. Unfortunately, it's hard to find a modern jazz vocal album that is very good. I recommend the classics for this genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressive early effort","review":"As Kurt Elling's discography grows, the quality of this record must be superceded by last year's marvelous \\"Flirting With Twilight,\\" but this earlier CD will not disappoint. It's a real showcasse of his strengths at vocalese - a truly incredible 'Tanya Jean,' set to the original Dexter Gordon solo off 'One Flight Up' - his original lyrics - a beautiful, personal expression on 'The Messenger' - and his sense of humor - the hilarious hipster-jive of 'Just a Thing.' His duet with Cassandra Wilson is very nice, the two voices a rich blend, but it really shows their divergent paths, with Elling standing out as the only jazz singer of the two. The bland, smooth-jazz funk of 'April in Paris' is the only lackluster point of the whole record, but a minor flaw when listening to the leading young jazz singer. And what a singer . . ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drive was wrong color and did not work.","review":"I purchased a black faced Mitsumi floppy disk drive and what I got was a white faced floppy drive that didn't even work.I would stay away from purchasing this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"OKI Fuser Kit","review":"Ordering was simple, arrived as scheduled and ordered item worked perfectly!

This violin (or at least the one they sent me) is better used as a nice wall piece. The nut is too low so the strings sit right on the mishaped fingerboard. Not to mention that the nut is also un-even. The pegs are too short and do not fit the peg box correctly. One bow was strung to tight which warped the wood making it difficult to play with and the other bow's skrew is stipped which makes it a hit or miss if you can even tighten it. The fine tuners hardley do there job and the strings come out of toon very easily. When tuned playing the strings open sound good, but try playing other note... it probably is not going to happen. This may just be a case of me getting a jacked up violin, but there is no reason that this 'unplayable violin' should have made it past inspection."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great violin for both beginners and advanced players","review":"I took a chance on this violin, and I am really glad I did. The sound quality of this violin is truly excellent. The finishing job is good, but not super. The strength of this violin is its beatiful sound quality. My opinion is that the finishing quality is pretty much worth what you are paying for, but the sound quality is at least worth 3 to 4 times the price of this unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Regret this purchase","review":"I live in a condo.

Not being a Regency romance, it lacks the sparkle, wit, whimsy and comic which were her trademarks in that genre that she ruled. But in Cousin Kate Heyer demonstrated that she was unable to write a story of moody suspense, and so it fails as a Gothic. So what is it then? Just a dull, flat story. The characters lacked interest, especially and including the two main characters, Kate and Phillip, who were one-dimensional and boring. There was no suspense to speak of and the events at the end, which could have and should have been quite dramatic, instead fell flat.Unfortunately I can't recommend this book. I don't know the titles of the other supposed Gothics that Heyer wrote, but if I find out I will avoid them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gothic for Spice","review":"COUSIN KATE by Georgette Heyer gives the reader a broader evidence of the unique style of this multitalented author who set standards for Regency romances that have seldom been met.A chance of sponsorship into London society from the influential Lady Minerva Broome is not to be ignored by Kate Malvern. Kate soon discovers Lady Broome has another future for her in mind.

I'm jealously guarding all my Georgette Heyers for re-reading, but with this book, I could not toss it quickly enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"My 3 Year Old Loves This","review":"My three year old daughter first discovered this puzzle at our library. She fell in love with it and looked for it every time we went. The pieces are the perfect size for her to manipulate. It's very well made. We moved, so I decided to look for it for our home. She's spent hours playing with it at the library--and now even more time playing with it at home.I'm rarely disappointed by Melissa & Doug items.My daughter could manipulate the puzzle from about 2 years old--in case you're wondering if it's suitable for your child. We usually store the pieces right in the puzzle; however, for puzzles with more pieces, we put them in a ziplock baggie which we tape to the back of the puzzle."},{"rating":"2","title":"ballerina","review":"Granddaughters love to play with them.

I would recommend selecting a different toy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for ballet fans","review":"My 2.5 year old daughter saw this in a store & begged for it, so we bought it for her - she takes tap & ballet & loves anything with ballerinas.

Although I could still cue up my original vinyl LP to enjoy Verlaine's superlative songwriting and his majestic guitar work on this album, I took the time to digitize the record and burn my own CD. This is an album that I wanted to be able to enjoy at home or on the road. \\"Lindi-Lu\\" and \\"Five Miles Of You\\" are two of the best songs that Verlaine has ever recorded, but there's not a bad song on the whole collection! And his vocals have never been stronger. If you like Verlaine, if you like Television--hell, if you like the electric guitar--you should own this album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes, magnificent","review":"There are several reasons to purchase this DVD, even if you, as I, have other versions of the 6th at home: the interpretation is first rate, the playing impeccable, the sound extremely good, and visually it is stunning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must be seen to be heard","review":"I continue to be in awe over these fine performances of the Mahler symphonies by Abbaddo. I had all of the Mahler symphonies on CD, but must admit I appreciate Mahler much more now that I get to see the orchestra. The sound, video quality and direction are perfect. They call this the tragic symphony but for me it was pure joy. I have watched some Berstein performances on DVD and to date I will take Abbaddo or Thielmann anytime....Those old video recordings do detract from my enjoyment of the pieces....and my musical training simply is not able to tell if one performance exceeds another. I did get the Chailly Mahler symphonies 2,8 and 9 based on reviews....the rest by Abbaddo."},{"rating":"2","title":"There appears to be fatigue in the finale","review":"This DVD gets off to a great start with fabulous orchestral playing and an excellent, maybe too conservative interpretation by Maestro Abbado. However, in the extremely complex finale, I got the feeling the players were somewhat tired. So I returned to the opening movement and I was shocked to hear the difference in sound. In the first movement, the playing has this incredibly rich sound. In the finale, the sound is strained and not very beautiful. What sounds like a labor of love at first, sounds like just labor in the great finale. And the solo horn (always of vital importance in Mahler) has some bad moments. I would suggest trying to rent this DVD before buying it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good meter","review":"The meter is easy to use and simple.

I don't know much about light meters but this does not seem right. I have several plants in that room and they do great. The sensor is very small (about 3/8 of an inch) at the end of the wand and sets down inside the wand. The tip of wand itself casts a shadow on the sensor unless I point it directly at the sun. I think a better light meter would have a larger sensor on it. This one is useless to me.

I knew it would be excerpts from poems, but I didn't want to buy an adult book. Each poem is preceded by short comments explaining the poem. The comments even helped me to understand because some of the poems are about a particular event in history. The drawings are very good, not childish, and I enjoyed sharing them with my son. Rudyard Kipling is a great writer and shouldn't be missed because of lack of time or understanding. This book had me going to look up the longer versions of some of the poems."},{"rating":"2","title":"Astute observations in a thesis style","review":"This is an interesting read that makes astute observations about the effect of American marketing. Statistics and studies are cited, though some observations are more empirical in nature.

The content is suitable for laymen who want a new perspective of how America approaches marketing versus other countries in the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Refreshing!","review":"This is a very refreshing book from a bygone era! I enjoyed the language, the lack of sexual innuendos, and the author's writing style. Gene Stratton Porter was a gifted writer and I've read her books all my life.

It is frankly romantic, a story of pluck and determination, a tribute to all the virtues that are seldom held up as valuable today. All of the characters are well wrought, but it is Freckles himself, with his fine character and his self doubts that so intrigued me. To this day, I am drawn to red haired men...as a result of reading Freckles in my formative youth!."},{"rating":"2","title":"Freckles","review":"I purchased this previously read book as a gift.

Abandoned at birth with only one arm, Freckles chooses to love....and love He does! He finds the world about him the object of his intense love. He finds the people about him worthy of love. Finally, he finds himself not worthy to love one special girl and is surprised in the end with her response. We are led into a magical world where love is not yet tarnished with selfishness. A joy to read again and again and a very special foundation to preteen and teen training in love."},{"rating":"1","title":"Freckles, Library of Indiana Classics","review":"I was truly disappointed in the quality of the book from the Library of Indiana Classics. I wish I had bought a used, original issue instead. The type was smugged or missing in many places throughout the book and quality control is certainly not their priority or objective. \\"Freckles\\" is a marvelous story, though, from the early years of the 1900's and makes for a delightful read.

Not only do they wear down quickly they have a tendancy to stick to tile or other smooth surfaces due to suction. I imagine if you have a cane and are sedentry they would be satisfactory but anyone that wants to get around and really walk you should look elsewhere. The end of my crutches came through my last set from carex after 8 days of use.

He is afraid to try and send back, as he cannot afford any shipping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"Unfortunately, this book fell really short for me. It has the same problem most so-called romance books published these days have...absolutely no romance and just alot of cheesy sex scenes between two people who hardly know each other. There's no real tension between the two main characters so they're both totally underdeveloped, and it seems as if the only reason why they are lovers is not because they have deep feelings for one another, but because they think the other person looks good and can make them feel good in a physical way only. I wouldn't waste anymore money on this author's books."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good Pirate read","review":"This is the 2nd pirate book I've read, and I thought it wasfun.

Marco"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mary a Gem of an Archetype","review":"This book, using Mary the mother of Jesus as the chief example, deals with the balance of an individual, that is with the physical, emotional, intellectual and spiritual aspects of the individual. This book is not only helpful to young women asking the deep questions of who they are and how they fit in the universe, but is also helpful to men and women of all ages. Mary is an important feminine archetype. It is refreshing to study scripture as psychological data and to find new aspects of Mary, such as inner direction, complex thinking, poetry as revealed by her song, and her sexuality. Joseph Campbell has illustrated the power of story and myth and archetypal patterns. Caroline Myss has stated that archetypes are infinite. Mary is a powerful, numinous archetype in a powerful story that continues to speak in this new millineum. This book reads easily and is sprinkled with personal anecdotes and humor which further inhance the readibility"},{"rating":"1","title":"Master storyteller?","review":"The blurb describes the author as a master storyteller. I see absolutely no evidence for such a statement in this book. The book largely seems to lack a thesis. Instead charts are presented on data that are available. Roughly half of the book consists of appendices. There is clearly a reason why you can pick up the hardcover edition for 70 cents second hand on amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointing","review":"Compared to his other superb books, this is one is tedious and boring. The overall thesis is a stretch - trying to find equivalences between pre-industrial (and pre-printing press) 13th century price paterns and those of the industrialized and post-industrial 20th century requires ignoring far to many factors. At a minimum comparing a world in which 90% of the population are attached to agricultural production and illiterate to world where almost precicly the reverse holds is just too big a leap to swallow.Sadly, one suspects more than a little political axe-grinding is involved.Enjoy Fischer's other books where he excells, but you won't miss much if you neglect to read The Great Wave. Besides, the subject has been better treated elsewhere by authors not so obviously out of their depth."},{"rating":"1","title":"A poorly written politically biased book","review":"Being very interested in the effects the economy in general and price movements in particularly had on the history of the civilization, I have immediately noticed this book and bought it. What a disappointment! Compared to, for example, Fernan Braudel excellent study of the European economic history, Fischer's book frequently lacks factual basis and depth. The book is also amazingly brief for such a colossal subject. The author's style is, in my view, below criticism - the book is written as if is it intended for distribution among illiterate peasants. Finally, the part of the book discussing the 20th century monetary history has an easily noticeable political bias and hints at some dark conspiracies originated in the US government and the Federal Reserve to impoverish the American worker. In brief, don't waste your time and money on this book.

Otherwise, it is a waste of money. There is quite a bit of preaching in this book such as \\"When these needs [of a mother AND father] aren't met, development is thwarted...\\" While this may be true, that should be an entirely different book from this one. Advice such as, learn her date of birth (to find mother) or register at a fee based reunion site (of course to the financial benefit of the author!!) is offered and all I thought was that I could have thought of any of her advice without ever having bought the book. Several letters with happy ending responses are also a part of the book, but no step-by-step assistance is in this book anywhere.

Montgomery, you may want to give this one a miss. This particular story focuses on the growth of a little girl named Marigold, from her birth and the debate over her name (one of the better sections of the book), to her early adolescence. Several of the chapters were originally written as short stories meant to stand on their own, and they're definitely the best of the book. (The chapter with the Princess Varvara is a case in point.) Some of the other chapters are weak -- dare I say boring? -- and the ending falls so flat it's disappointing. In short, the book lacks the author's typical spark. She's better represented in her other books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious and dull","review":"Montgomery is nowhere at her best in this book which naver really goes anywhere. Marigold comes across as exceedingly insipid and by the middle of this book the reader is bored enough to shut it.The saving grace is the family discussion on what to name the baby,but even that seems stilted at times.Young and Old Grandmothers add some spark to the book but on the whole I almost wept at the thought that Anne came from the same pen as this dull heroine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intricate mysteries","review":"If you see the title of this book and think there are twenty \\"whodunit\\" mysteries and that's what you're looking for then keep on looking.

There are also wonderful stories by Dennis Lehane, Scott Turow, Pulitzer Prize winning author Edward P. Jones and writer/director John Sayles. While the book is not full of \\"mysteries\\" many stories do have plot twists and surprises that will keep you turning the pages. They all deal with crimes in different ways and how they can effect us. Some crimes happen to the narrator; in some the narrator commits the crime.

I love mysteries, and compilations are my favorite. I will open the book at random and read whichever story comes to my hand. I've read 8 of the 20 stories here and kept hoping for a good mystery. What I read was stories about people that the reader is given no reason to care about -- druggies pushing one of their number off a boat, a thief who meets a bad cop, a depressed divorced man who dates a woman while considering get back with his slightly degranged wife. Ugh. Every character a low-life. This book would have been fine if labeled what it actually is -- a collection of dark violent stories about men on th edge.

The animation is mesmorizing, and with a villain who is an absolute despot as the key element you have the recipe to total entertainment."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am paranoid now","review":"This is a book for someone who lacks common sense and likes to read about other peoples nautical problems. To it's credit it made a few points that I did not know about but mostly if people think ahead a little from their actions a lot of these issues presented in this book could be avoided. I read it all but did not really enjoy it that much. The book may have served to make me a bit hypersensitive to planning to the point I try to analyze every possible angle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent resource for worship, with old and new songs","review":"Curt Keller and helpers in the Illinois Great Rivers Annual Conference of the United Methodist Church have provided an excellent resource for worship with the Deaf. The hymnal contains, in ASL format, every song in the United Methodist Hymnal. The hymns are conceptually accurte, with references to the \\"American Sign Language Dictionary\\" for proper signs of more obscure concepts. Although the Deaf understandably are left out during hymn singing, the interpreter can include them in the worship through use of this reference. The hymns contained in this book include standard, traditional titles and several more contemporary songs, as well as songs from different ethnic backgrounds. This hymnal need not be used only by United Methodists, as the hymns it contains are standard throughout denominations. This is a \\"must have\\" resource for interpreters of worship."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Signs","review":"When I purchased this book I expected to see the signs with the words.

It follows English word grammar and not even close to ASL grammar. Only people with no sign experience could believe this book. This book has no use for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible advice","review":"I received this book as a gift. I completely disagree with this lady. She recommends that one put their baby to bed with lots of diaper cream on their butt and not change diapers in the night. So, she recommends that the baby be left in a dirty diaper! Urine and feces irritates the skin, causing diaper rash and skin breakdown."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me...","review":"The methods recommended by Tracy Hogg are not really meeting the needs of your baby. Babies deserve to have their need for extended in-arms comfort and companionship met. Tracy Hogg didn't even have children of her own. Our society's expectations for infant sleep habits are not based on their natural cycles but on pressure from other parents and \\"professionals\\" and parental convenience. If you want to help a baby learn to sleep on its own, read \\"The No-Cry Sleep Solution.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"The baby whisperer","review":"Excellent book!! I highly recommend it to first time parents. It helps you understand the different stages of your baby's growth and schedule a routine since the beginning. I recommend to read it previous to birth, so you can have a better idea of how to handle usual problems in babies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes my feel like a \\"Bad\\" parent","review":"I want a book that gives me advice, not one that makes me feel like I've screwed up. The author talks about \\"accidental parenting\\" like it's a bad thing. If something isn't done her way she labels it this. Yes, I admit I have made some mistakes like using techniques to get my child to sleep but I wouldn't call it accidental parenting. I personnaly have tried the \\"PUPD\\" method and it didn't work for me at all. It only made my child more upset. Some of the advice is alright but I have found other books much better. Such as \\"Healthy Sleep Habits, Happy Child\\" by Marc Weisbluth, MD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Negative and unhelpful","review":"Another dogma filled child rearing book that exudes negativity... The book spent a lot of time chiding parents for what they haven't done or should have done, without passing on any realistic solutions for parents of real, human children rather than trained robots. None of the sleep solutions she offered worked for us. And the know-it-all tone was enough to drive me to write this, my first book review."},{"rating":"1","title":"Proceed Cautiously","review":"This book emphasized the need to \\"schedule\\" baby for naps, meals, etc. Remember that babies are wired a certain way for evolutionary success. It is not necessarily a bad thing if he needs to feed more often (especially if breast-feeding). Smaller, more frequent meals sometimes have a medical basis (such as if baby suffers from reflux).Also, forcing your baby to sleep through the night too soon may be harmful to his/her emotional and physical development. There is a reason why baby wants to be near his/her mother...because in harsher environments, those babies survived.Children grow up fast, do you really want to encourage too much independence in infancy? For the sake of your baby's physical/psychological/emotional development, proceed with this books advice cautiously."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great resource!","review":"This book was a good and easy read. I followed a lot of the advice and eventually tweaked it to fit my son's needs. The EASY routine is a must for any parent and baby. I found it important, however, to tweak the Baby Whisperer's methods to fit the needs of my child."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book gave me free time back!","review":"This book is great! I purchased it for the information on getting your baby to sleep. My baby was not napping, waking during the night and needed me to fall asleep. After just a couple of days on Tracy's PU/PD method my baby is napping so good and goes to sleep on his own. This book also has great advise on routines that really help you to structure your life and learn to read your baby's cues so much better. I wish I would have had it from the start instead of waiting for 7 months! I would have slept a lot more! Don't hesitate, just buy it...you will thank yourself later!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate this book!","review":"Everytime I read something out of this book, I come away feeling like a failure as a parent. Ask my husband: he has to talk me down every time. I don't know why we still have the book laying around. The author is condescending, anti- attachment parenting, and anti-cosleeping. I hate, hate, hate the term \\"accidental parenting\\" that she throws around to cover everything from nursing your child to sleep babywearing. I disagree with one the previous reviewers (who also reviewed this book poorly), although perhaps our babies are different ages. I think The Whisper does encourages Crying It Out, at least for older babies.I highly recommend chucking this book in the trash and checking out Dr. Jay Gordon, the Sears', or Elizabeth Pantley."},{"rating":"1","title":"More stressful than helpful","review":"This book has some good suggestions for routines, but other than that it has been more stressful than helpful for me. So far my son has gone from sleeping through the night from 8:00pm to 5:30am with 45 minute naps to now waking up at least every 2 hours and napping only 20 minutes at a time. My biggest complaint is that her suggestions are often counter to a baby with reflux and gas issues needs. (I can't up his feedings b/c he spits up what his tummy can't hold.) The Baby Whisperer has solved none of my problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is horrible","review":"This book is unclear. At first glance I thought oh good a sample routine, however the author does not describe her vocabulary like \\"cluster feeding\\". As a first time mother I have no clue what that is and there is no examples just long winded vinettes about other peoples babies that have nothing to do with topic . Very Irritating book.

I know that any book should be taken with a grain of salt, but for some reason once we got this book I felt like everything I was doing was wrong. Ever since reading this book my son's sleeping habits have gotten worse. Moral of the story. Don't just buy this book and think all your problems will be solved. Read all of them and make up your own mind on how to do things. Every baby is different and ours did not respond well to these suggestions. Pick up and put down is a joke if you ask me.On a positive note, this book is comical because the author is british and uses different words for things. Like calling a diaper a nappy. I love the british."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not use a book to parent!!","review":"My 6 month old was not sleeping as great as i wanted him to and my sister-in-law recommended this book. She said her 5 month old was sleeping 10 hours a night! Well i bought this book along with the others by this author. When it arrived i was so exited i read the entire thing and began \\"baby boot-camp\\". Well the first night he sleep 3 hours i thought no way, this is way worse than before, but i kept hoping it took getting use to...well 3 weeks later and he is doing horrible.. he wakes up 5 or 6 times a night and hates bed time... my husband and i couldn't go out anymore and it just sucked!! So i said forget it i am going to just parent the way i want to and listen to my baby not a time-line and the first night off the book/routine he woke up once and slept for 10 hours!! I think that your baby is unique and doesn't fit into a schedule! I would not waste your time with this book... i know i wish i had not put my baby through all the tears :("},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much structure!!!","review":"This book made me so anxious and neurotic about getting on a schedule, constant preaching about avoiding \\"accidental parenting\\"... I \\"fired\\" this book after trying to follow it for 8 weeks. After doing so, I became much more calm and peaceful.Thanks to Dr Weissbluth \\"Healthy sleep habits, Happy Child\\". Our 6 month old baby sleeps for 12 hours through the night (since 12 weeks old) and takes two or three 2 hour naps. Our little one is very peaceful, happy baby.And we didn't have to do any sleep training, no cry it out!The only reason I didn't give it 1 star is some of the tips on soothing where helpful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Problems Unsolved","review":"This book was highly recommended by a couple friends, however, I did not find some of the information and suggestions by the author very helpful. I felt like some of the information was contradictory (i.e. don't rock your child to sleep because then your child will become dependent on it vs. don't rock your child because it is too stimulating for him or her). She discusses accidental parenting in her book, yet I felt like some of her methods could become forms of accidental parenting. After spending two agonizing days trying this method out with my daughter, I started doing something different and we were much happier. I felt like the author made readers feel guilty if her method does not work for them. I do, however, like the overall concept of feeding the child after waking up, having wake time, and then putting the child down for a nap. That has worked very well for us. This book may work for some parents, but it did not for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Baby Whisperer Book","review":"I purchased this book as a gift for my granddaughter who was having her first child. She found it very informative."},{"rating":"2","title":"Baby Whisperer","review":"I did not follow everything she says in her book because some of her information is set up to protect herself legally. She ends up being incredibly careful about food. But her tips to quiet and upset baby or toddler are priceless!

If this book were presented as an option that may work for your family, then fine. But don't call breastfeeding on cue or bedsharing \\"accidental parenting.\\" I found Elizabeth Pantley's books (mother of four) much more helpful with a menu of selections to figure out what works best for your family. Do whatever feels natural to you and works for your baby ... if some of Hogg's advice works, that's great, but don't let Hogg make you feel badly for your choices, those \\"accidental\\" choices are called LOVE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"Simply put, this book makes matters worse! We used the pick up/put down technique to try to help our daughter sleep better when she was 5 months old and she cried terribly, we slept LESS in the process, and the worst part of it was that she lost trust in us which took weeks to earn back. I would highly recommend NOT even opening this book, unless you are looking for a very stressful and traumatic experience and want to break the bond you have with your child. Try Pantley's No Cry Sleep Solution and you will sleep, without trauma, all while keeping the trust in your relationship alive."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Reference Guide and Helpful Resource","review":"At first I did not use the book. I just created a routine and followed it, but now he is 4 months old and I use this book as a guide. I actually am reading it from beginning to end now. The book breaks down each chapter by situation, i.e.. routines, sleep, feedings; then within each chapter she talks about what happens at each age groups, i.e.. 0-3 months, 4-6, as so on.Since I am a first time mom, it is a resource to make sure I am not creating future sleep problems or prop dependencies. I also helps explains why my baby does certain things, such as cries as he is trying to fall asleep. I love this book and I am glad someone purchased it for me.

My baby was 9 months old when I used this method and within a week, he was going to sleep and putting himself back to sleep on his own, no bottle.It was a little rough since my son weighed 28 lbs, and the first few nights I'll bet I picked him and put him down 50 times .... quite a workout, especially with the crib mattress at it's lowest level.The key is to stick with it, even if you feel like you are getting nowhere.

To nearly every sentence as well as the title there should be added the phrase \\"except for sports.\\" In 1969 when I was entering college, virtually all Americans, including those like Mr. Levine who were part of the New Left, were close-minded about sports such as soccer and cricket. Thirty years later the New Left still hasn't become open-minded about foreign sports. Neither The Nation nor In These Times could be bothered to run articles about the Women's World Cup this past summer, nor does Levine exhibit any open-mindedness about foreign sports in this book. His demand that others be open-minded rings hollow, given that he himself is close-minded."},{"rating":"1","title":"maybe he's right","review":"Why has no one provided a good rebuttle to Bloom?

Yes, the reform in the curriculum at the end of the XIX century was necessary but that does not make present reform addecuate. 2) the new standard reflect a more diverse society. But the problem is no that people is reading, let say, writters in spanish so they can understand the tradition of an important share of americans. The problem is they are reading BAD writters in spanish because they say what the left want to hear.

The overall feel of this album is steamy sexiness. The two dance hits from the album \\"Midnight Message\\" and \\"Love Rush\\" are pretty rockin' disco cuts. \\"What I Do To Men\\" is a mid-tempo song with a slinky groove.

The Overture for Tannhauser is without a doubt my favorite, but there are so many other fine recordings that it would be like to rate a fine glass of gimlet or hand crafted beer. I love his message in his music and how he combines art, theatre and music.

If you've had bad dating experiences (as I'm sure we all have) and want reassurance that you are not alone, this is the book for you. I found it a bit odd, however, that the book was classified in my local Borders store as \\"self-help\\" because there's not much advice to be had. The chapters are framed by some good, old-fashioned common sense sayings from the author's grandmother, but to me the book is more one woman's exploration of what she's looking for from herself and a potential partner than advice to others. There are also a couple of places where the publisher should've been a little more diligent in editing - watch for some misspellings and small gramamtical errors.

If you buy The Dragonriders of Pern three in one book there is an index and glossary at the end and would probably be better, but for a trial read just get the first book and don't give up on it.

To her chagrin, she discovered that the tapes did not play on her bedroom radio. The explanation was simply that in order to produce an inexpensive tape the cassette were double recorded and a balance mechanism was necessary on the playing device. We could purchase and adapter (which defeats the inexpensive idea) and then use headphones to play the tapes or use our expensive equipment which is located in our living room to play her tapes. Both of these solutions were unacceptable because her interest was to be able to play the tapes wherever and whenever without regard to the high quality of the components.

It doesn't just stay on one specific topic however, but ranges from Weyr life, to politics between Holds, to romance, (both dragon and human) *sigh*. The only reason I gave it four stars is becasue it is reeeeeally complex. DO NOT ATTEMPT TO READ THIS OR ANY OF THE OTHER PERN BOOKS UNLESS FULLY AWAKE AND FUNCTIONAL! The names and statuses would be nearly impossable to remember if the book didn't have a guide in the back and god help the person who doesn't understand the plot which indeed, seems very complicated as well.

From page one 'till the end I was enthralled. The story of a dredge known as Lessa, her story and her growing popularity among others on Pern was in itself a seperate story. The whole idea of telepathically talking to dragons is beyond anything I've read to date. The going 'between' idea is yet another phenom of McCaffrey's writing.

First of all, I find the concept unbelievable, but beyond that you always end up with the same concepts (ooh, look, we have a paradox here). I liked the story at the beginning and think that the ideas of dragons that need to fight interstellar 'threads' was pretty original, but it just gets bogged down with the jumping between times. Also, I didn't find most of the characters very likeable. Maybe I would have liked it a bit more if I had read it closer to when it was written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Story","review":"This is the first book in a trilogy that was an all time favorite of mine.

I purchased this book based on these reviews, and quite frankly, I was disappointed. What was so \\"gripping\\" and fascinating about this book? Someone PLEASE explain that to me. The book was okay at best. The characters weren't well developed and in fact, I couldn't figure out why Lessa did some of the dumb spiteful things she did. Nor could I figure out why F'lar cared about her. The story was not tension-filled, gripping, or all that exciting to be honest. It was a decent story of a group of people trying to save their world from an attack by threads. Unfortunately, the story was told in a lackluster manner that elicited little emotion from me other than wanting to hurry up and complete the book. I have to give the author credit for being creative in coming up with the world in which these people live, but the story itself was average at best.

I would not recommend it.Simply put: Characters with no grace at all, you never really understand them, and never really care for them. The plot seemed good, but towards the end of the book gets really confusing and there was something in the way she wrote that seemed a bit unclear for me. (english being not my native tongue).I would recommend Lords of the Sky by Angus Wells, you have dragons and a wonderful story in just one book.Maybe the series grows a long the way , but, with such a big variety of new authors to read and fun to have elsewhere, I'm not going for Dragonquest.Beware everyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"My Review of Dragonflight","review":"As an avid reader of Science Fiction/Fantasy/Sword and Socery books, I was quite disappointed with this first McCaffrey dragon series tale. This book outlined a story of the planet Pern and its age-old battle with the Threads - material that fell from the sky and would ingest all organic material on Pern. Needless to say, the dragons played a major role in the defense of Pern and there were other interesting human characters; but the bottom line is, the overall story was quite boring, not very interesting, and definitely did not generate enough excitement nor incentive to read the next book in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"McCaffery's Best Book!","review":"This is /the/ Pern book.

There was something magical about this story. Reading it you'll never look at 'dragons' the same way. You may name your fantasy characters online after them. I never really knew she considered this story science fiction. Not necessary knowledge but it gives the story an added dimension, perhaps. At a time when most authors attempted to distance themselves from the label McCaffrey embraced the term Sci Fi when she didn't need to.The Harper Hall series was also enchanting if not somehow even better. A friend of mine reminded me of her story 'The Ship Who Sang' for which she won many awards. The film 'how to tame your dragon' reminded me of this story.I read the 'dinosaur planet' one also by Mccaffrey and thought it wasn't very good at all.

This book is about the sex life of a MR Mohan Kumar, and in reality about the sexual fantasies of Mr Khushwant Singh. Yet while it does have the simplicity of a typical Singh product, it does not seem very beliveble. PArts of it seem inspired by Richard Crasta and others by a typical Mastram book.

I loved the characters (I like the \\"wounded hero who has a little boy in him that needs love\\" theme). I loved the plot. I loved the story.Then she raped him. Like others have said in their reviews, had this been a man taking advantage of a woman who was incapacited or drunk, everyone would be up in arms. Yet, because it's a woman taking advantage of a man in that condition, it's ok? No. It's still rape. And it's not any more acceptable than any other kind.I stopped reading the book at that point. I can't go on. At this point, I've lost interest in what happens in this story - and wish I could get my money back on the purchase of this book.This is my first Quinn book to read.

This book has a little mystery and makes you think as you read. The characters are well developed as a matter of fact you can just about picture them as you read. Simon's speech problem was handled in a very realsitic way that made you feel sympathy and pride for how Simon accomplished this. I really like the inperfect characters. Daphne's ignorance added humor, which I liked and gave the story line a interesting twist. I know there will be sequels to this book, because the brothers were so well developed.

JQ makes all of her characters come alive to the point you think they must be someone you know. She takes the time to develop the characters so that you believe the story. In this one the Duke is bound and determined to not go against promises he made to himself long ago. Even if it might cost him the love of his life. He is determined to do what he thinks is correct without thinking about it like an adult, just going on the old promise he made as a kid. I loved Daphnes brothers trying to protect her when she is acutally one of the strongest people ever. Even though they were not a huge part of the story it makes you want to find out more about them. This is an excellent romance if you like them with a good story line!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A love story with humor!","review":"One of the things I like best about Ms. Quinn's writing is the humor. All her books are exceptional, but The Duke and I is more so. She has romance, but she shows family ties, not just honor, but a bond that is a strong emotional commitment to each other. A mother who always knows what her children are about, as if she has a sensory that connects to each child. This knowing is displayed in a very funny way. Every page you read makes you want to read another. The anticipation of what is to happen is always with you. Ms. Quinn is definitely a 5 star writer, and The Duke and I is evidence of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT! A MUST READ FOR ALL ROMANCE FANS!","review":"The Duke and I is a great book. Simion Basset is a duke who has sworn off love from the begining, and resloved never to marry. Daphne Bridgerton has sworn to marry ONLY for love. The two strike up a deal to court each other, but only in public places to keep out of the way of the Tons matchmakers. But what happends when they realize that the game is all too real? Julia Quinn writes a superb book, and I have read every other one in her series, and recomend them all. None of the books have a 'dry spot' and the characters are well protrayed. I have to say, this is a MUST READ BOOK!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a fun book to read!","review":"This was my first Julia Quinn book and I must say it did not disappoint me. For once a romance book that had truthful, engaging, loveable characters, that seem to come right out of your own neighborhood.

Really enjoy reading her books ,especially the Bridgerton family series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Filthy. There are much better out there","review":"The story's premise and plot had so much potential, but the intimate scenes were too graphic. Ruined the whole book for me. Less is more when it comes to the description of intimate scenes. If you like wit with your plot, read Georgette Heyer. If you like soft porn read Julia Quinn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning: Bodice Ripper","review":"As an avid Jane Austen and Georgette Heyer fan, I'm always looking for a quality Regency romance. I wish these reviews had warned me to LOOK FURTHER. There are at least three extended sex scenes in this book (I'm talking pages and pages) ... with only the barest of nods to the challenging conventions of the Regency genre. It's no surprise the author is an American ... and a young one at that. Unless soft porn is your thing, re-read some of the real stuff instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book !!!","review":"I loved this book!

Julia Quinn is a marvel. She has a knack for story telling that seems so naturally clever and slightly quirky that I wonder if she has to \\"work\\" at it or if she just has fun when she writes.

Will be getting more by this author for sure!! :) I want the next one in the series for sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Julia Quinn-ish","review":"I wait for when Julia Quinn's books come out because I know that I will enjoy reading her books from start to finish. I loved Daphne. Her humor and her ability to manage her brothers brought smiles to my face. And Simon. What can one say. I don't remember another character that will admit so early in the story his feelings for the woman. He also managed to overcome his \\"handicap\\" without the support of his so called father. This book will definitely go on my favorite books bookshelf, along with all Julia Quinn's other books."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not okay, no matter who does it","review":"I don't like rape in my romance. And getting a character drunk and taking advantage of them constitutes rape, in my book.If you read Regency romances for a more innocent worldview, even with a bit of passion, this is not that world. Not the world where people respect each other's wishes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Corny","review":"Poorly researched book. Many deportments that are anachronistic, especially with the class of people Quinn writes about. The main character, Daphne, has an arrogant feminist superiority that is cringe-worthy and also her display of it poorly fitting with her time. It is not that women then did not have such views but they did not behave in quite the way Quinn's characters are written nor were they quite so condescending toward their men.Much of the humour is too modern and forced which makes the book cheesy.The best part of the book is the beginning depicting the Duke Simon's childhood. It is a story of great potential. Unfortunately, many a good idea is ruined in its author's quest to create a sellable book for pop demand."},{"rating":"2","title":"funny & loving, a great combo!","review":"I really liked this book. This was a touching story. What adds to it, is you love her family and laugh at their ways. My only criticism is that I would have liked to see Simon and Anthony (brother of the heroine) find again the friendship that was briefly lost. A quiet moment together where all is forgiven would have went a long way with me. But perhaps in another novel involving the same clan will show this. Another bonus was the \\"gossip columnist\\" who most definately should appear in any future novels. Could the author possibly be one of Daphne's sisters? If so, I can't wait to meet her! She seems absolutely outrageous. Afterall, the end of this book said she was young, and lived nearby . . . stay tuned!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just like finding a present you didn't know you were going to get","review":"I was pleasantly surprised with the dialogue, wit and humor in this story!

I was very entertained by this story and hope to ready more."},{"rating":"2","title":"I wish it was THE DUKE and ME","review":"This book was fantastic! This was the first book by Quinn I had the great luck to find and read. The story is imaginative with dialogue both witty and tender. The characters are so wonderfully created, that you can't help loving them. The Duke wins your heart immediately and it was easy to cheer on the spirited Daphne. I plan to read all of the books that are related to the Bridgerton family and other creations from the artisitic Ms. Quinn"},{"rating":"1","title":"There is terrible and then there is this.","review":"DNF.While it was quite entertaining at first, I found it got irritating very quickly. I got about half-way through and had to give up. \\"I'm never going to marry,\\" he says but she replies \\"But maybe he'll marry me!\\"I also didn't really buy the relationship, which made Daphne's feelings a little hard to take. These two weren't going to make each other happy. They were going to make each other miserable.Went and read some spoilers in some other reviews and it only really gets worse. Not wanting to get married and have children isn't something to be overcome. I want him to change his mind, if that's the point of the story. I don't want her to change his mind for him. That's not how you do character arcs. Characters influence other characters. They don't \\"make\\" them do things. That is not romance. That is gross."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment...","review":"I enjoyed the first half of this story, but I was frustrated by the second half. I found the reasoning behind the Duke's behavior to be unbelievable and contrived. I also didn't believe that the super-independent heroine, who was raised around horses and stables, knew so little about \\"where babies come from.\\" I don't care how sheltered you are, if you grow up around livestock, you don't have to have the facts of life explained to you!Quinn is a good writer, but the story's weaknesses were so weak, they really ruined my enjoyment of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read!!!","review":"A wonderful historical romance!

Daphne and Simon are both great, entertaining characters. I especially loved the fact that Simon, who has overcome a stuttering problem and a father who rejected him, has a sense of humor. It is great to see a tortured hero who can still be funny. This is definitely a fun way to spend an afternoon."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a book!","review":"I've never read a Julia Quinn book and I can't tell you how pleased I was by the wonderful character's and excellent story. The Duke and I was sweet, humorous and an enjoyable read all around. I have to say that if I hadn't read the reviews on Amazon I probably never would have picked this book up just browsing in the store, partially because it's longer than most Regency romances, and partially because there is a scantily clad man and woman on the back cover that seem more appropriate to the bodice ripping romance novels that I avoid. I'm not sure about anyone else but I love to read in public (i.e. airports, the dentist's or doctor's office, long lines etc...) and I'd rather not have that kind of cheesy back cover shouting out \\"hey everybody she's reading a romance book!\\" That aside, I really really recommend this book as a great escape from whatever you want to escape from."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"This book now ranks as one of the best historical romances I've read in quite some time. Daphne Bridgerton and Simon Basset, the Duke of Hastings, are interesting and appealing characters that made a good couple. I loved their relationship and banter and appreciated Quinn not trivializing the plot by creating silly tensions. The issues they dealt with were realistic and their responses true to character.The dialogue is fast paced and pithy, which I like. Daphne's brothers provided perfect comic relief and the family matriarch, Violet Bridgerton, was a blessed surprise. While the romance wasn't steamy, it was...romantic.I'm in for this series and cannot wait to start the next book. It's great that there are eight siblings for more stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"What Can I Say It A JQ Book","review":"This is the first book in the Bridgerton series and if this book is any indication of how good the series is going to be I can hardly wait to read the rest of them.This book has everything that is trademark JQ with all of her humor and wit.

However, I am sure many of you will love the songs--it's just hard to measure a personal preference.

The authors understand the material so well that they can not see it as the novice would for the first time. I find the layout non-user-friendly and there are many mistakes.

The reading is difficult to understand, even after reading each chapter two or three times. It's as if the authors wrote this text to impress their colleages.

Perhaps Semisonic is too original to pigeonhole even though I had flashbacks of 70's groups like ELO, The Eagles and America. This band is not The Verve, Wallflowers, or Fastball. They are also not REM, fellow Mid- Northerners.What Semisonic has created in Feeling Strangely Fine is an immensely listenable collection of tunes that are orchestrated a little bit differently than other alternative bands. Each song is crisply arranged with plenty of electric or acoustic guitar-driven melodies.

From the opening track, \\"closing time\\" which is a rock song of pure quality that deserved a Grammy, right up to the last song \\"gone to the movies\\" which is quiet and mellow and a perfect end to the album. Highlights include \\"Never you mind\\" with its fantastic trembly guitar riff and \\"singing in my sleep\\" which is quite simply superb. Although the tracks in the middle are of a lesser quality, they don't detract from the strong opening and excellent end. Also the single \\"secret smile\\" is excellent and really emotional.

Songs like \\"Singing in my sleep\\", \\"DND\\", \\"This could be my year\\", \\"Secret Smile\\" and \\"Closing Time\\" have great melodies and catchy hooks. It's also considerably better than their other album \\"Great Divide\\". The only thing stopping me from giving it 5 stars is the odd average song - track 3 and 4 come to mind, but the good far outweighs the bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Semisonic is the best!","review":"I love this CD!

I listen to this CD often and it's one of the few CD's that i can play through without skipping over a stupid song or two. Each song has it's own beat and groove, which isn't something one can say about many bands. I've been to a concert of theirs, and they are also one of the few bands that can play better live than on recording. Closing Time brought Semisonic's name all around, but their great songs and talented band members will keep them there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good compact Disc","review":"This is a very good cd .

However, I saw on Amazon that it was bought by people who also bought the Matchbox 20 album (which is excellent) so I thought I'd give it a go. This album has the most shallow music and lyrics of any album I have ever bought! Even Closing Time (that most of the other reviewers seem to rate) is awful. How can you base an entire song on the fact that the bar is closing? Perhaps they could make the next album even more mundane and have songs about grocery shopping. Do not buy this album - unless you want to buy my copy so that I can get my money back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never You Mind rocks!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"My brother first got this song for Closing Time, then I listened to it for Secret Smile. After that, I listened to all the songs and I loved Never You Mind. Never You Mind is kinda creepy, and you wouldn't expect it from Semisonic; all their other songs are 'smooth,' so to speak. The first time I heard Never You Mind, I didn't like it, until it got to the last stanza. Then, I loved the song for all of it. I love the bass guitar part. I am in love with that song! Singing in my Sleep is also a great song, along with Made to Last. DND rocks too.

A must-have! I bought it for \\"Closing Time\\" and \\"Secret Smile\\" (I don't really like \\"Singing in My Sleep\\"-it's ok, but not a favorite of mine) and was just blown away by the quailty of the rest of the album. I listened to this album for the first time (when I bought it back in '98) and thought it might be ok, but that even if the only good songs were the ones I mentioned above-the singles-that would really be ok too, and worth the price of the album. Turned out EVERY song was good, and several were great! I don't have their first album yet-Great Divide-but plan to get it soon, as I anxiously await their new album coming out soon! This is a band that will be around for a long time, and should be. They are somewhere between pop and alternative, in a class by themselves. I hope to hear a lot more of them in the future.

I listened to it all the way through, as I always do, but didn't particularly like it. But just this past week, I put it in again, and let it play, and now I find I can't get the songs out of my head! Esp. \\"Completely Pleased\\", which is nice, then the chorus kicks in and you get chills, the harmony, and noise... All the songs have great melodies and harmonies, and lyrics, and though I think that numbers 3-6ish are more acousticish than I like, they're still great. The later ones are more rocking. A good cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Semisonic CD","review":"This album mixes the lead singer's voice, (Dan Wilson), and the catchy guitars and lyrics of the band and blends them all together to create a great cd.

The songs get old fast and it's music to fall asleep to. Like in Secret Smile (I can't believe they made a single for that song), \\"Nobody knows it, nobody knows it, nobody knows it\\"...when is it ever going to end?

It was somewhat of an impulse buy, and I wasn't sure it was worth what I paid. I was pleasantly suprised. This album remains one of my favourites. It's been roughly five years since I bought it, and I still listen to it at least once a week. That's saying a lot, because I own an obscene amount of CDs.

Tom and Jerry fight over the ring in a series of different set locations and hilarity - scratch that, lameness - ensues. Bland art & animation, complete lack of plot development, and utter lack of any charm make this one a real stinker. It was a free rental and I still felt ripped off!

Which is good because most of the publication I come across seems to ignore it. In add-ons, the book also comprises different points of view from not only from the old ruling class (Afrikaners) but also includes the voices of people from different ethnics.

But GET REAL, people. If the episodes are not complete -- INCLUDING the commercials that at that time were as much part of the plot as the rest of the action -- then to buy the collection would send TOTALLY the wrong message to the disk's producers.

So I returned it to Amazon with an explanation that they sent me the wrong DVD. So they sent me a replacement copy, which also had the same wrong episodes. I returned it again and was told that they were unable to replace it again. They sent me a refund instead.

This set gives us syndicated versions of \\"Make Room For Daddy\\" episodes which are VERY heavily edited! Many times the edits are abrupt fade out/fade ins, and the missing portions of the episodes make some of the stories difficult or confusing to follow. Putting edited syndicated versions of these \\"Make Room For Daddy\\" episodes on DVD is unforgivable and certainly not worth the money for this DVD set!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No opening credits???","review":"I cannot believe they LOPPED OFF THE OPENING CREDITS! The opening credits are a *major* part of the appeal of any 1950s sitcom. (And actually the main reason I bought this set.)

I'm talking about when Jean Hagan was Danny's wife and the kid's Sherry Jackson and Rusty Hammer were much younger. In my mind, the earlier years with Sherry Jackson and Rusty Hammer being so very young and Jean Hagan as his wife were much funnier than those with Marjorier Lord and Angela Cartright.

By the time Parker realizes whats happening, he's already in too deep...Even though I predicted the ending on page 43, I still read the rest because the writing was very good. Once I started the book, I literally couldn't put it down. I finished it in about an a hour. The characters were thoughtful and (except for Tara) realistic.On the other hand, the ending WAS a bit predictable. I think the author left in one too many hints.

I did like that, but part of the story had to do with Greek mythology, so I didn't quite get how that tied in. Oh, and also. I didn't really like the ending.

The scope of detail far exceeds what one usually expects of romantic fiction. Lady Cat believably rides, walks, and fights her way throughout Japan.

If you're looking for nuanced characters, a well developed plot, or deeper insights into the realities of the actual Tokaido Road, this is not the book for you. It's most decidedly a work of romantic historical fiction, with plenty of gratuitious erotic elements thrown in to spice things up.The characters are stock figures, with little development, and the melodrama is tedious. Yes, the extensive historical research is apparent. But interestingly, I ordered Oliver Statler's Japanese Inn, at the same time as this novel, and read it immediately afterwards. The author appears to have borrowed heavily from Statler's account- so much so, that it seems at times that she simply incorporated entire incidents from Statler's book into her own.

It was another incredible culture experience. I learned more about Plains Indian culture in \\"Ride the Wind\\" than in all my other combined experiences about Indians.While I read \\"Tokaido Road\\" several years ago, my memories of it are still crystal clear, a sure sign that this is one of the best books I've ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"An entertaining informative romp","review":"This is the best single fiction book I have read about feudal Japan.

The heroine Cat is plucky, loyal, sensual, and skilled in the high arts of poetry, spirituality and the tea ceremony as well as the enjoyable lower arts of acting, disguise and kicking ass (with and without sword and stave). This book is great! I read the paperback edition several years ago, and have re-read it twice since. An easy and highly enjoyable entry into Japanese culture."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Can See Heaven with These Eyes","review":"This cassette has a compilation of some of my favorite songs of all time: You Can Say It to Him, I Can See Heaven, Gettin' Ready, Driving Nails, Turn Around, Run to You, What about Him, Have You Made Your Reservation, Already There, and Merciful Lord. Gibbs' voice is distinctly her own and beautiful. Her blindness adds so much meaning to her singing the song \\"I Can See Heaven\\" with these eyes. BEAUTIFUL! I remember my mom playing this song over and over on our record player when I was little. I still play her songs today. There are very few albums to which I can listen repeatedly without it getting on my nerves; this is one of them. My favorite album of all time!!!Highly recommend IF YOU CAN FIND IT."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is it, play it loud, when you get it.","review":"This is it, he plays his guitar like you think others are playing after you've had quite a few."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I was unable to find a replacement bulb in local stores, so when I found a source online that was great news. I placed the order and received the replacement bulb very quickly. I could not see the stem of the bulb while it was in the package so I had to remove it, when I did I discovered that it would not fit in my lamp even though it was the replacement bulb specified to replace the original\\"OTT-LITE\\" light bulb. I was putting it back in the package to send it back when I read the fine print on the packing slip telling me that the product could be returned no problem (if it had not been removed from the package). So I have a light bulb that cost me in excess of $18.00 including S&H, it does not fit in the lamp I needed it for nor does it fit in any other fixtures in my house."},{"rating":"2","title":"Proprietary","review":"$21.00 for a light bulb is a bit steep.

HOWEVER, Since I have only one lamp this will fit, I have no way of knowing whether the bulb is defective or the lamp; considering postage and the trouble, I would hesitate sending it back even though its a very expensive bulb. On the other hand, I can't buy one locally, and don't think it's feasible to order another just to test."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great to read, knit and sew by.","review":"These OTT-LITE bulbs are fantastic. I needed one as replacement for the lamp I received as a gift, a few years ago. It gives plenty of light, even to do tiny sewing like cross-stitch, and it is perfect to read the book, \\"From Circus Dream to Three-Ring Reality\\" by Liliane Parbot-Johnson!. Best, yet, my order was delivered so rapidly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ott-Lite","review":"The Ott-Lite I purchased did not fit the lamp so, I was unable to use it.

This book intertwines the lives of men and women on opposite sides, and whether or not they should trust one another. To help put a stop to the bloodshed still going on in the Channel Islands, they must find this trust, or face the wrath of a S.S. madman still fighting to preserve the war. I highly recommend the book to anyone who loves a book in which the outcome is in doubt for most of the story. This is definitely one of his better stories. A must for any Jack Higgins fan, or for anyone that wants a real page-turner."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING!! Could this be the Jack Higgins We All Know?","review":"To be candid, this had to be the worsdt Higgins I've read to date and hard to believe this waste of time came from the writer who gave us The Eagle Has Landed, Storm Warning and so on. This book was a real chore and difficult to get into. More importantly, it was extremely difficult to stay with. I could put it down and not miss it. Eventually, I thought I'd pick it up and finish and finally said, \\"oh forget it, why waste the time?\\"This is not even worth a look as a beach book or if you're snowed in. Try one of his other titles, this is just a plodding, dreary waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading","review":"Unless you carefully read the cover art, you'll be surprised to learn that Tristano doesn't even appear on a majority of the album's cuts. I enjoy Marsh's playing but I don't appreciate this type of manipulation. Amazon should pull this album and Capital needs to repackage this. And whatever happened to the Charlie Parker/Tristano sessions anyway ?"},{"rating":"2","title":"On the whole, a remarkable album","review":"Eliane gives us a sample of her perceptions of the music of both Latin America and North America, forming a cohesive and interesting whole. I'm a bit biased because I'm in love with her voice, but the instrumentals really aren't ALL consistent--thus the 4 stars. The best tracks are by far the 2 vocal Jobim renditions of \\"Brigas, Nunca Mais\\" and perhaps my favorite Jobim tune of all \\"Chega de Saudade\\". These 2 songs alone make the album worth buying; they are at once seductive, subtle, and sublime. They capture the essence of bossa nova without sounding retrograde. The first track is also a wonderful treat, signifying to me the joy of awakening to a new day, a new era, a new love."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Tao for those who don't want to ditch the laptop","review":"I like my life and my stuff! I don't want to cloister myself on some mountain top and eschew the modern world. This is a great book for all the citizens of the real world who want to explore the Tao, but don't want to become great scholars. Taoism is about being and experiencing, not about pouring through ancient tomes for answers other people have found. If you'd rather get a few pointers on how to be a little more Tao, get this lovely little book. It is truly a diggable and easily portable guide to life on the cooler side of the fence."},{"rating":"1","title":"A word to the wise","review":"When I acquired this book several years ago it appealed to me because it seemed to be an up-to-date take on a philosophy which had long interested me. In retrospect I can see that it needlessly steered me into a lot of confusion and uncertainty. In my opinion the product being marketed here is a toxic concoction of New Age quackery and mental hopscotch masquerading as spiritual guidance.I humbly recommend readers seeking clarity and peace of mind to investigate the book 'Food For the Heart' (available for free online) which contains the collected lectures of the late Buddhist monastic Ajahn Chah. Here you will find tough, no nonsense, gimmick-free insight relating to spiritual practice and the nature of reality."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great intro to the Tao","review":"I found Barefoot Dr's book on the Tao excellent. It explained concepts in a clear and hip manner and provided exercises to incorporate the teachings in a practical way. The work is also in my opinion quite comprehensive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tao is Sexy and Groovy","review":"Tao demystified without cryptic cobweb. It's quick paced, short and sexy with substance. Perfect serving size for those on the global roller coaster, all too familiar with airports and metropolises. Whether you're a warrior or on the path to being one the exercises are great for powering-up. Be a legend - scoop the loop !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Thinned-down Taoism","review":"I thought this book was a watered-down, hipped-up version of Taoism, aimed mainly at the gen-Xers. A true follower of Tao would not advocate the use of illicit drugs, as mentioned in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best game of all time!","review":"Love it! My husband and I love to play this game! Every time we have visitors or holidays this game is always the one everyone wants to play. It's perfect for anyone who enjoys watching movies. Now I just wish they'd come out with a Seinfeld version!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth Playing Again and Again","review":"Overall, definitely worth buying. Only thing I would have changed is the music and sound effects (a little repetitive and annoying into the second game). This game really keeps you on your toes by asking questions that require you to study a scene without knowing what the question is. It takes more to win than just watching a lot of movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"ouch... not so good","review":"I loved Kuschner's first book. It was writen through him, not by him. I was so excited to see he'd written another book. This book was written through ego. He was told he'd written a first great book and to teach us again. He wrote the book and it was more about how he sees religion as the answer. He ignored other processes of people. His first book really guided us to sort it out for ourselves. This book hit you over the head with religion. Sad, I'm religious, but don't want people scared away being hit over the head with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"practical advice with a wide appeal","review":"As he has done in his previous, well-received books, Rabbi Kushner offers us practical, well-reasoned advice about universal life issues. \\"Living a Life that Matters\\" deals with making ethical decisions in everyday matters, and learning to listen to one's conscience and to trust one's best instincts.Kushner's book is deceptively simple, written in a warm, conversational style, as if the good rabbi were sitting across from the reader at Starbuck's sharing an afternoon coffee. He presents anecdotes drawn from real life, familiar and easily identifiable, to make his points about living well and doing good in the world. Christians will be comfortable with every page of the book, although they may get a sense that Kushner's extremely rational portrayal of God makes Him emotionally distanced."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Golden mind and a kind spirit","review":"When I need to search within myself and better understand my relationship with God, I venture to the part of my bookshelf that holds Rabbi Harold Kushner's books.We all want to live a life that matters. This is a guide book of suggestions that are helpful in finding purpose in our \\"every day lives\\".Thank You, Rabbi."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed in the conclusion, tired of the technique :-(","review":"This book began by raising some very interesting questions about \\"mother love\\" versus \\"father love\\", that is, about the need for a person to experience both unconditional love and earned love. I eagerly bought the book, logically believing these provocative questions would be answered at the end of the book, but IMHO Kushner wimps out. He writes that there really isn't any difference at all, despite the fact that he outlined significant differences earlier in the book.I won't be buying Kushner's latest book, which was released earlier this month (although I'll probably read parts of it in a bookstore). I find myself growing a bit tired of his technique of profiling one Old Testament character per book. (He's profiled Job, the writer of Ecclesiastes/King Solomon, Jacob/Israel in this book, and Moses in his latest.) Kushner writes really well, and I'd like to see him break out of this mold and deliver some truly original ideas!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Please read it","review":"Other reviewers have already given good to great summaries of this book.

Wonderful club music, intellegent and fun. It grows with every listenand was kind of his pinnacle. If you like Lords of Acid and electronic and synthpop qand new wave music, this will totally be up your alley. If you like Depeche Mode and Pet SHop Boys and The Cure and Nitzer Ebb and Front 242 and oakenfold and Delerium and Erasure and Nine Inch Nails and disoc and techno, then this is for you. Hard edged but not evil. Dark but colorful. Check out all of his work, you won't be sorry...and some of his cd singles are awesome PACKED with great mixes for every taste. also check out his remix album for a wonderful sampler of his work...Oh yeah, and one of his newer albums called FREAKAZOIDZ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Techno-Industrial Fun","review":"I must admit to never having heard of Praga Khan, and only barely of Lords of Acid, before I picked up this CD based upon a quick listen at Tower Records. After going through the whole thing a couple of times, I think it's a surprisingly good and danceable album. My favorite tracks are \\"Breakfast in Vegas\\", \\"Visions & Imaginations\\" (which is a bit trancey), and \\"Far Beyond the Sun\\". Many of the songs are rather simplistic, but overall it's quite fun in an industrial techno kind of way. The tone of the album reminds me somewhat of KLF's \\"What Time Is Love?\\" but without the rap and the divas, so if you like that single or dark techno in general, I recommend that you give this CD a spin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hey Whipple Squeeze This.","review":"Great book for anyone in the advertising business.

(If you fundamentally hate capitalism reader, get out of the ad business already!) ..to all the budding writers who think this is the passport to success.It's neither. It's simply a great introduction and behind the scenes peek of the business -though far too liberally spiced with his own ads when other great campaigns could have made the point much more cleanly.Just as you wouldn't expect a warren Buffet ad to make an investing wiz, don't expect this to make you an ad wiz.You also need the talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great reading for students","review":"I'm a history major but I'm involved with advertising competitions, and this book has contributed to a lot of my success. For students, this is probably more valuable than executing the demands of a professor who is not even in the industry. It will help anyone develop their creative thinking, and more importantly, it spreads a positive attitude to the reader. Sullivan's sensible enthusiasm about advertising makes the book an enjoyable read, and the copious references to industry giants adds to its credibility.For individuals trying to build a portfolio, this book provides fabulous pointers and a great deal of professional insights that I think anyone could find useful."},{"rating":"2","title":"An honest (but idealized) look at a profession","review":"Luke wrote some damn good ads.

I especially like the \\"legs up, looking at my partners tennishoes, talking about the last movie we watched\\", as in how the ideas pop up. THT IS BRILLIANT!

I was an aspiring copywriter looking for a break with a student portfolio. Whipple had great advice on how to write a message, how to determine who to talk to and what to avoid. About 3 months after taking Luke Sullivan's advice I landed my first agency job. Sullivan is a definite ad pro, and shares his knowledge of successful advertising in a fun tone. This is a guide to writing great advertising and is one of the easiest reads I've come across on the topic. I highly recommend it for creatives (duh) and also for account people.

Unfortunately, any book written by a neutral observer on the Macedonian question is bound to receive a high number of negative reviews. In this case, 10 one-star reviews from Greek nationalists who (judging by their comments) didn't even open the book but use the space here to propagate for their own view is keeping the rating rather low. Don't let this deter you from reading the book, it is precisely because it is neutral and well-balanced that it is not liked."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pero (Slovenia)","review":"This book deals with a contentious subject in a very impartial manner. It goes to great lengths in examining the seeds of controversy over terms \\"Macedonia\\" and \\"Macedonians\\" and it clarifies different meanings of these two terms: difference between geographic and historical Macedonia on the one hand and the current state with this name on the other hand; difference between Macedonians as inhabitants of geographic-historical region and ethnic groups carrying this name together with evolution of this ethnic group. It pays a lot of attention to history of all these Macedonias and Macedonians since 1876 onwards, which is the key period in which distinct ethnic identity of Macedonians took shape. The only shortcoming of the book is a little attention devoted to developments that took place specifically in Macedonia before 1876, while on the other hand it deals extensively with the nationalism and peculiar Ottoman concept of millet and developments in Ottoman empire in general."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Truth","review":"A fallacious account of Macedonian history, most likely fueled by greek propaganda. Most literature on the history of Macedonia is manipulated by foreign parties with their own interests at hand.

I've always loved his 'brutish' no-nonsense way of running his kitchens, as it's depicted on TV. When I saw this autobiography I though it would be a great opportunity to see how much of the bravada we see on screen is real and what is not. Reading this book showed me that, at the end of the day, Gordon Ramsay is really just like you and me. I never knew the tough life he had growing up and how he quite literally clawed his way to the top of his field through nothing but hard work and determination. What we see on TV may seem cruel (albeit entertaining), but what's behind that mean-looking facade is a man who wants his proteges to give 110% because he's never given anything less in his whole life.

The tonelity and language assure it is his words, in terms of how he comes off on television, but what this book is really about are the experiences he went through as a child to becoming a Celebrity Chef, which are remarkable. This book is an easy read, although perhaps having a good understanding of cooking and the culinary profession may enhance the read, anyone might love it. His story is inspirational."},{"rating":"2","title":"An insight into a tough man","review":"I love Kitchen Nightmares and Hell's Kitchen, mostly for the way Chef Ramsay will give such unadulterated feedback. He doesn't sugar coat what doesn't work. But, after he has broken through the crap, he shows tremendous compassion in a real way.In his book, he tells his story, and you will see just what makes him tick. His broken childhood and family troubles that followed him into adulthood. His learning under some very harsh chefs in their own right. His drive to be among the top chef's in the world of serious cooking.I wouldn't say this book is great literature: he writes it as if he is telling you a story over a couple of pints. There is a good flow, but sometimes he tends to move about in the flow. This is not an in-depth look, but a man trying to let you know why he always appears to be in a bad mood.Overall: if you're a fan of his shows, it s worth the read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Short, pungent but sweet","review":"This is an amazing autobiography. If you are a Ramsay fan you get just what you'd expect--some brutal honesty, some settling of old scores, some name dropping, and of course some profanity liberally sprinkled throughout.The first half of the book where Ramsay talks about his childhood, his soccer ambitions, and his apprenticeship into the world of haute cuisine is fascinating. Once he has \\"made it\\" in that world however the stories aren't as interesting to me. However, the book is very short and thankfully this ends before getting too tiresome. Still in all it is a pretty good read and taking price into consideration it definitely is 5 stars given the $2.87 I paid for the Kindle version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor, misunderstood Gordon","review":"I liked Gordon, believed I understood his passion. What a relief to know he is just another whiner, I can save my admiration for those more worthy. He can and does excuse everything, every fault, every failing, it's his father's fault, his brother's, his business partner's, his friend's, he is responsible for nothing that could be called a personal, or business failure.He shagged his boss's wife, well, why didn't the boss stay home? He was young. He didn't have a contract, he was inexperienced, his best friend died and he made inappropriate comments, blame it on his youth, his passion, his ambition.Stay out of his way, not many survive with a good reputation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!","review":"As a fan or Gordon Ramsey's, I thought this would be an interesting read...NOT! Extremely boring. Very little aboout his personal life. Mostly describes his various restaurants.

Imagine a world where half-a%# workmanship and pathetic laziness was unaccepptable, as it is in Ramsay's kitchens. Just imagine.......An amazing book was this. I wished it could have gone on and on. The real story behind a driven man whose ethics of perfection can be easily applied to every work situation in the world, regardless of occupation. Challenge yourself to accept Ramsay's standards of excellence. If being the best was easy, everyone would be great. This book shows why Gordon Ramsay is the very best chef in the world....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Same book different publisher","review":"If you have read this book you have read Humble Pie! It is a good auto biography very interesting insight into Gordon's life and his persuit of perfection.

It makes me hungry for more about his recent life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a recipe for Humble Pie","review":"No this is not a recipe for making or eating humble pie. Despite the title, there is no reference to the humble pie anywhere in the text!Despite this disconnect \\"Humble Pie: My Autobiography\\" offers the reader insights into the cursing, angry, belligerent guy we see on Hells Kitchen and Kitchen Nightmares. Yes - he is all that. But that he has had the drive and ambition to reach the success he has is testament to the fact that hard work does pay and that a difficult childhood with a menacing father isn't an automatic sentence to a life of poverty and hopelessness. I have new respect for the guy, but still dont uderstand the obsession with the Michelin stars which is the holy grail for all chefs and especially for Gordon, the final indication that he has arrived.A little self-congratulatory at times, too defensive of all the run-ins he has had with various other cooking personalities, and laced with the language of his cooking shows, this is still an interesting read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Local Area Networks","review":"This book takes a very technical subject and approaches it with straight-forward easy to understand format.

My favorite ELO tune is 'Hold On Tight' but this whole album is truly great with the exception of'Ma-Ma-Ma Bell' which I would have gladly traded for 'Roll Over Beethoven'. However with a cd of 20 tunes and a really long set at that, this album is well worth the bucks. Here's your chance to hear some great talent most notably Jeff Lynne and the rest of the ELO group.

I called Price Pfister and found out exactly what to do to get a refund. I did just that. I had my receipt and I even had the box it came in. Price Pfister has told me over and over that I had a $140 check coming. This has been going on for several months and I still don't have a check. I've been in my new house for a little over one year and I've put in three kitchen faucets. I'm sure you won't be surprised that I did not go with Price Pfister for the third one.

I would try to draw someone walking using my own logic on what a person walking should look like and I would fail miserably. This book is great for anyone who has trouble drawing a person sitting, running or doing any lifelike pose realisticly.

Much as I enjoy reading this kind of book, I couldn't make heads or tails of this. Ray has insisted to be \\"arty\\" and turn his story into a novel. Problem is, it doesn't come off as all that \\"arty\\", but confused. It's sad to see a pair of brothers who dislike each other as much as Ray and Dave, but I think it was inevitable. They're both kind of on the creepy side. Is there a coherent Kinks bio out there, because neither X-Ray or Kink fit the bill. Just this side of unreadable."},{"rating":"1","title":"good songs, bad book","review":"I have been a Kinks fan for decades. Ray Davies is a wonderful songwriter -- God bless him. This is also one of the WORST books I have ever read. Self-pitying, self-indulgent ... awful. A monstrous ego must be necessary for success in the vicious world of pop music, but it shouldn't be shown in public. Buy a few Kinks CD's and enjoy yourself, or buy this book and suffer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Add 2 stars if you're a Kinks fan","review":"Kinks fans will love this. But I would have preferred to hear Ray's account of the Kinks' history without the Orwellian structure in which an older Ray recounts the tales to a younger Ray. Also, unlike Dave Davies's \\"Kink\\", this book stops short of telling the whole history . . . as though the Kinks ended sometime in the early 1970s. We never get to hear Ray's account of his relationship with Chrissie Hynde, his battles with Dave, and so much more. This book begs for a sequel which is more straightforward and tells the whole story rather than hiding behind a fictional framework."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Kinks and Beyond","review":"I saw the stage show that was excerpted from this book and, conseqently had to read it. A great recollection of what it was like to be part of the British Invasion - and not be named John, Paul, George or Ringo.

He hangs out with younger kids that will look up to him. Ray buys them beer, boasts about his sexual conquests, even stuffs objects in his boots to make himself look taller. But in actuality, he's a frail, pitiful loser harnessing some pent up rage. And when it explodes, look out.The acting in this movie is adequate, but it's the horrendous acts themselves that keep you riveted. Plus there is plenty of nudity as it also explores a dark realm of unabated sexuality. It all culminates into an utterly vicious and frightening climax that will make you feel helpless and vulnerable right along with the victims.Not recommended to the faint of heart.

Coming of age, Frank has arrived in New York City where life is hard but there is always the light at the end of the tunnel, and from his success it looks like he reached it. Perseverance and faith in his ability to trudge on with out falling to the wayside has allowed him to grasp and take hold of the American dream. What a great story.He tells us of his experiences working at the Biltmore, then on to join the army, the loves of his life, and his struggle to get through college and become a teacher. The entire journey is fraught with humor and written in a tongue in cheek manner that is amusing and down right laughable at times. The book on tape is read by the author and his Irish brogue is quite evident as well as enjoyable. I would give this book 4.5 stars.Kelsana 9/24/01"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tis' will touch your heart","review":"I appraoached Frank McCourt's sequel to Angela's Ashes with trepidation, believing it would be tough for this book to come close to the power and understated beauty of its predecessor. However, beginning Tis made me feel like I had never put Angela's Ashes down. This is a wonderful book in its own right, and anyone who enjoyed Angela's Ashes won't want to miss this. The setting is different but the narrative voice and expression are the same. We see McCourt wrestle with the difficulties of teaching literature to high school kids, which seems to be much more difficult for him than it was to initially survive in America on his own as a young immigrant. There are many passages in this book that I found myself reading over and over, or aloud to anyone in the room there to listen.

I'm not quite finished with it--it hasn't held my attention as well as \\"Angela.\\" However, I always am interested in reading about other people's point of view on our country, culture, etc. Mr. McCourt seems to do this very well. It is as well written as his first, you just don't seem to feel as empathetic while reading it. But it seems to wrap up the \\"saga\\" so to speak. I'd recommend it to anyone, as long as they read \\"Angela\\" first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Such a disappointment.....","review":"While I really loved Angela's Ashes, I could hardly wait for this rambling sequel to end. I, in fact, found myself skipping complete paragraphs to get the end of some of these chapters.

Sorry, but don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self-Indulgent","review":"This book seemed completely self-indulgent and self-serving and yet Frank McCourt doesn't make himself out to be a hero. Could it be that this book is his version of Catholic confession? He was endearing in Angela's Ashes: he didn't seem to dwell on his misfortunes, he merely worked to improve his situation and he wanted to make something of himself. He seemed optimistic that he could. Once in New York, however, he becomes a pessimistic alcoholic with little direction in his life, utterly fails in his chosen profession, teaching, and seems to have trouble connecting with women as anything more than sex objects. I think Frank McCourt has lost some of his credibility with 'Tis and I can't help but wonder if he just got lucky with Angela's Ashes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good but a little too cute in places","review":"This book was very interesting, told very well with rich detail, with crushing disappointments and rich humor. But the language was off-putting -- too much like the young Frank McCourt's language in Angela's Ashes. It's as if in some ways Frank grew up in New York, yet in other ways was as naive as the 7-year-old in Limerick. As if he remains incapable of understanding life's complexities as he grows up. He was disadvantaged by his childhood, of course, but he writes as if any happenstance diverging even the slightest bit from his expectations leads him to \\"wonder what kind of a world we live in where...\\" blah blah blah. It's an adult world! Children spend time wondering why they can't eat toffey morning, noon, and night. Adults don't. I think Frank McCourt, having found success in this type of writing, didn't adjust it for his later years. That's what's disappointing about this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"rambling","review":"After reading McCourt's Angela's Ashes, I looked forward to this book. Didn't like the content or the author. He didn't do anything with the characters, and his wife was a mystery to me. - He expanded in great detail about a crazy man who lived with him for a short time, and only briefly alluded to his divorce. He has been blessed with many talents, why doesn't he use them in his writing?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"Impossible to get through.

AT THE SAME TIME CAN MAKE YOU LAUGH THROUGH YOUR TEARS. THE FEELINGS OF A GROWING MAN WHO EXPERIENCES THE PAIN OF ACCEPTING AND BEING CORDIAL TO A FATHER WHOS ABANDONS HIS OWN CHILDREN FOR THE SAKE OF DRINKING IS EXPRESSED BEAUTIFULLY,FOR ANY MAN OR A WOMAN IN SUCH A SITUATION WILL BE CONFUSED.

Actually, there is some slight overlap, because Frank's arrival back in United States is mentioned in both books; at the end of the first and at the beginning of the second. \\" 'Tis\\" recounts Frank's college days at New York University and his career as an English teacher in the public schools of New York City, and, of course, much more.Like its predecessor, this book is a delight to read. Having read either, you will want to read the other and Malachy McCourt'sA Monk SwimmingandSinging My Him Song.

The story telling just isn't as engrossing, but how could it be?What mystified me was the unanswered questions. What happened with McCourt's eye condition? How did the prettiest girl on campus fall for the poor Irish guy with the bad eyes? How could he justify his drinking after what his father's drinking did to his family? Did I miss something? The dots didn't connect for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"'Tis delightful","review":"Frank McCourt is a joy to listen to. I believe he could read the Farmers Almanac and I would find my self listening raptly. But, he reads his own delicious prose in his own delicious Irish accent. If you've decided to read either Angela's Ashes or Tis on paper, think twice. Frank McCourt is an Irish storyteller par excellence. I wondered if he could possibly find in Tis the hard-biting but humerous tone that characterized Angela's Ashes. He could and he did. What a wonderful tale of New York through the eyes of an Irish lad fresh off the boat. Ah, Frankie, Frankie, when can we expect another one, eh, lad?"},{"rating":"1","title":"+- 25% good, 25% mediocre, while 50% is filler.","review":"I was really looking forward to this book after reading \\"Angela's Ashes\\", but was very disappointed in \\"Tis\\". After the umpteenth time of telling us about his bad teeth - his weeping eyes (which had already been well covered in the previous book). The self deprication soon became VERY boring. Unfortunately, it seemed McCord was filling pages to write a quick book. My wife is from Ireland, and I thought I might be missing something in the culture and type of writing, but when she finished, her comments almost mirrored my own. The first and last parts of the book are quite good, and there is a great story here, but Mr. McCord missed it while he is the one who lived it."},{"rating":"1","title":"WTF happened, Frank?","review":"I am curious, How did McCourt lose his fastball so quickly? This sequel falls flat, as most sequels do. I presume because most of us mortals are only blessed with a certain dose of brilliance and once that's used, tough luck. One theory--the author wrote ''Ashes'' long ago, or at least kept a journal so his remembrances were fresh. When the first book took off, he was forced to write the next installment and he was working from faded memory and writing through too many years' worth of cynicism. The lack of humor in the sequel was glaring, and that was the biggest letdown to me. ''Ashes'' was a revelation and ''Tis'' was a slap in the face. Sorry to be so hard on the author, but my expectations were dashed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tis","review":"As a follow-up to his \\"Angela's Ashes\\", this book is a total disappointment. McCourt has exposed himself as just another drunken Irish anglophobe. He apparently did not learn anything from his father's behaviour, that he so condemned in his first book. This book is about on par with his brother, Malachy McCourt's, \\"A Monk Swimming\\", which is no more than an account of stupid, drunken shenanigans."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!","review":"As an avid fan of Angela's Ashes, I picked up 'Tis with great anticipation. I read the first two thirds of the book with interest but then McCourt began to irritate me. I found I had no reason to stay engaged. He obviously learned nothing from his father - Frankie drinks excessively too. He marries because he is obsessed with his girlfriend's looks, not because he likes her. He may be a terrific teacher, but his experiences at McKee don't indicate it. The anecdotes became repetitive - too much to drink, hangover, bad day at school, bad night at home. I skimmed the last third of the book and was incredibly disappointed that this wasn't a repeat performance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frank McCourt 'Tis NOT a Happy Man","review":"McCourt leaves a miserable life in Ireland and has every opportunity and advantage in America. He spends most of his time complaining. He can't pay his electric bill, but he can patronize every bar in New York. The apple doesn't fall far from the tree. Of his students, he says, \\"Still whining, still complaining, when there are millions around the world who'd offer fingers and toes to be in your seats - neatly clothed, well fed, with the world by the balls.\\" Practice what you preach, Frank. When I read Angela's Ashes, I wanted to shake Angela until her teeth rattled. I feel exactly the same about you, McCourt. Grow up and take responsibility for the pain your own alcoholism caused your wife and family."},{"rating":"1","title":"The unabridged Frank McCourt","review":"My, but he can go on...and on. While the basic follow-up story to the wonderful Angela's Ashes was moderately interesting, I could have done without the endless repetition of phrases throughout the book. Perhaps if I had read the words rather than hearing them in the author's own whine, the text would have been easier to take. I found McCourt's lists of complaints--supposedly from his students, his wife and from Angela herself nearly impossible to listen to. If I hadn't spent so much money on it and if I didn't spend so much time in my car, I'd have abandonned it. In fact, I did skip one whole side of a tape and when I realized it, I decided I was better off."},{"rating":"1","title":"An annoying and pathetic sequel to Angela's Ashes","review":"There are very few books that I wish I never bothered to pick up and read, but this is one of them! Frank McCourt wrote a beautifully insightful and humorous book, and then ruined the warm fuzzy feelings with his sequel. Rather than feeling empathetic towards the characters described in Tis: A Memoir, I felt pity and a certain amount of contempt. In this respect the author does succeed in evoking an emotional response from his readers, but I'm certain it is not the intended one. This is the story of a young struggling man, fresh off the boat from Ireland. He whines and complains and lets us know ad nauseum how unfair it all is. While his mother is treated with respect and care, his wife (neighbors, co-workers, students)suffer abuse. The style maybe the same as in Angela's Ashes, but with none of the humour and depth of human spirit."},{"rating":"1","title":"so-so","review":"In this book, McCourt describes going from one bad job and disgusting apartment to another, seemingly ad infinitum, yet I never understood the point of it all. A disappointing follow-up to the witty Angela's Ashes. It's one saving grace, I think, is to remind readers not to take for granted the advantages we have been given and the luxuries to which we are accustomed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre at best","review":"I began reading this book with great enthusiasm, seeing as I thought \\"Angela's Ashes\\" was such a treasure. \\"Tis\\" started out in the same style as \\"Angela's Ashes\\", but lost it's pizzaz half way through the book. What happened to McCourt's stream of consciousness? What happened to his revelations? What happened to his humor? Everything that made his novels interesting and separated them from the everyday novel disappeared. The second half of \\"Tis\\" read like a high school essay where everything was said in the first two pages, but it had to be a 10-page essay so he filled it with boring, useless drivel. Ireland was so captivating, and America became so boring. What is the point of the last half of the book? So he became a teacher?....I have not given up on McCourt yet. If and when he comes out with another novel I will read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money & get this one from the library.","review":"The magic of Angela's Ashes was sullied with this ordinary tale of a lost man who drinks too much, stumbles into careers & women.

I could find no portion of this book where one would not have to wade through the gutters of New York, all due to the filthy language that is so very distracting. How sad that such a brillian man and author would have to stoop to such rot to sell a book. Not only have I lost all respect for him as a writer, but as a gentleman as well. I will be returning it as quickly as I am well enough to go to the post office."},{"rating":"1","title":"A washout!","review":"I've been terribly disappointed with\\"'tis\\" This man presumably is telling the truth in writing about all his failings as a husband and proves to be very much his fathers son in his weakness for the drink.I wonder if he ever had his bad teeth and crusty eyes fixed? Yuk!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a major disappointment","review":"Don't read this book. Just read ANGELA'S ASHES (his first memoir). Don't see the movie (ANGELA'S ASHES), as it sucked. This follow up memoir destroys any likeability that I had for the author. It's just a shame to have followed up like McCourt did here. A crumby book that doesn't deserve a place on your bookshelf. Trust me.........read ANGELE'S ASHES.........don't waste your time here."},{"rating":"1","title":"MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT","review":"Mr. McCourt's life should have ended earlier, or at least he should have stopped writing about it. I remember how anxious I was to purchase the book when it first came out, and what a waste of my time it was, even though, at that time, I refused to not finish a book that I started. I have since learned better, thanks to Mr. McCourt's second book. 'Tis not worth it. Actually, I now dread reading an author's second book- I guess I can also thank Mr. McCourt for forcing me to expand my reading horizon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snow White became Chuky","review":"If you admired the young McCourt boy who survived misery and a drunken father in Angela's Ashes (A'sA), this book is sure a huge deception. The first 80 pages are a great continuation to A'SA, but suddenly the rhythm of the book stops, as if McCourt had suffered from a severe drought of ideas. The storyline becomes chaotic, changing the day-today timeline we were used to to a mixture of anecdotes that take place 5 years forward and jump back again, no order or sense whatsoever.What's worse, nice and naive Mccourt transforms into a copy of his drunken father, constant beating up of women included. It's a huge shock (hey this story's REAL, folks!); it's as if Snow White suddenly turned into the role of the Queen.McCourt won't be the same nice, brave and funny guy for me nevermore."},{"rating":"2","title":"ISN'T TRYING TO BE ANGELA'S ASHES","review":"I can see why, if you were expecting Angela's Ashes all over again, that you could be disappointed. I loved this book. It was a beautiful evocation of New York in the fifties and sixties and the immigrant experience, which was eased considerably for those who arrived speaking English.I do want to mention that although McCourt sometimes found his new home confusing, he never condescends to America or to Americans, but rather has a bewildered admiration for the country and its people, unlike many immigrants who come here and then immediately complain about all things American. The Irish have been particularly guilty of this.This book was a nice October read."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"The most interesting thing about this book was that I found out that my high school English teacher was McCourt's first wife. Boy, do I feel sorry for her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much-needed praise for a wonderful writer!","review":"For anyone who reads memoirs, Tis is a beautiful story of a young man trying to find his place in his newfound home. Unsteady and struggling, he is upset, angry, and downtrodden throughout much of the story, until he finds the meaning of it all. This book is constantly being compared to McCourt's first book, Angela's Ashes, but what people do not realize is that it is a separate book by the same person, but at a different time in his life. Angela's Ashes is written through the voice of a child, while Tis is written in the voice of a young man without any stability to his life. I hope that the difference in tone and content will not steer readers away from Tis, as it has a message all its own to grant the readers. Tis is a difficult book to read, as Angela's Ashes was before it, but the journey the reader takes with McCourt is worth the sorrow he/she might feel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definately Not \\"Angela's Ashes\\"","review":"While \\"Tis\\" is an OK book all in all, it doesn't amount to the grandeur of \\"Angela's Ashes.\\" While in the first book, the simple and direct style of writing was nice and pleasant to read, this approach to \\"Tis\\" left the style dated and rather dull. It really doesn't have a theme, either, but some fascinating historical points exist such as Vietnam, North Ireland conflicts, and Sartre existentialist philosophy. This book is certainly not worthy of half the praise of the original."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tis a great book, tis.","review":"I had Frank McCourt's memoir, Angela's Ashes, on my bookshelf for months before I read it. I enjoyed it so much that I purchased the next two books he wrote, Tis, and Teacher Man. I just finished Tis and was so sorry when I finished the last chapter and wanted to read it again. Part of this stems from being a historian and Irish, I am sure; reading about an Irish man in the 1940's and 50's put my own parents lives in a different perspective for me. I would greatly recommend this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WWII era America","review":"I thought Tis was a better read than Angela's Ashes. Being an American born in 1970, I can not relate to Ireland circa 1925 (it was apparently an awful place - move on). However, I found McCourt's historical accounts of WWII America to be fascinating reading. Americans were so openly racist back then toward every group imaginable. If anyone can claim a reason for America's greatness, it's her ability to change for the better, although Iraq is a bad example. But then again, GW Bush actually lost those two elections, so we tried. I suppose there will always be material for books, like Tis, about ugly Americans who despite themselves turn out to have functioning hearts. A sincere thank you, Frank."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love <3","review":"I love this book. While Angela's Ashes was somewhat depressing but 'Tis is hilarious and enthralling.

Anything this man writes is pure gold that's for sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"'Tis is a woderful follow-up to Angela's Ashes","review":"'Tis continues the wonderful story of Frank McCourt and is written with the same personal touch and deep insight that seems to be the standard style for McCourt. It was a beautiful book and I loved reading it. I would strongly suggest reading Angela's Ashes first to get the feel for his younger life first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring--and unnecessary profanity from a Catholic man!","review":"I listened to the abridged tape on a long distance drive---I was a captive audience. I found it totally boring and anti-climatic. There was no compelling reason to continue to listen, but I was trapped in the car. The frequent use of profanity added no depth to the content and was a distraction to continued thought processes. It made me wince.The story provided good insights into the struggles of our early imigrants and the obstacles they faced. This provided an even deeper respect for my own ancestors."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book should have been named \\"How I Whined Through Life\\"","review":"I read Angela's Ashes and though, ok, he had a round childhood, but so did a lot of other people.

I CAN ONLY SAY \\"MORE BLARNEY\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"a disapointment compared to Angela's Ashes","review":"The prose is nowhere near as beautiful as Angela's Ashes, the story nowhere near as compelling. The characters are less interesting and the wry irish humor is evident less and it seems the very irishosity (as i like to call it) is gone. Being Irish, from Staten Island and spending large amounts of my time in Manhattan let me say that this book is also filled with inaccuracies (though one of these inaccuracies lead to one of the few humorous episode with the shoeshine man who does not have a brother who reapirs shoes) as well as being very repetitive. It's also far less anecdotal than Angela's Ashes and quite frankly far less interesting. The 2 stars are there because I know McCourt is capable of 5 star work (as evidenced by Angela's Ashes. Every time I see McCourt on a TV appearance or his comments they seem remarkably insightful and brilliant. The question I'm left to wonder after reading this book is \\"What Happened?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Tiresome!","review":"Although Angela's Ashes was interesting and different ( although I still can't see the humor in it ) it was pathetic and pitiful.'Tis is just pathetic and pitiful. I don't think this book really added anything to Frank McCourt's story. The only scene that really touched me was when he was in the army and ended up at the ovens of Dachau. From there on it just seemed to drone on about the same thing. How he didn't know how to be a clerk/teacher/husband/father until I was just tired of the whole thing and wanted it to be over.He didn't even know how to be Irish but he did know how to drink and drink . . .Also, it's amazing that he taught in our high schools for 30 years but never seemed to know how to teach. I kept waiting for the big revelation of how he mastered the art of teaching but that never happened.Seems like 'Tis is just a rehash of Angela's Ashes and not a very good one either . . ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip it.","review":"The first few pages looked promising, specially with the thing with the priest.

I was amazed to learn of the poverty in Ireland and America only like 50 yrs ago! I think it is amazing how an author can amuse you & make you feel touched and sad at the same time.

They say we Irish aren't happy unless we're complaining. Well writing all this must have made Mr. McCourt very happy with all that complaining. I appreciate how far this man has come however, he should have let us enjoy his journey instead of complaining and blaming all his misery on someone else.

There are definately some interesting and poignant moments, but more often it is a self-indulgent ramble about a seemingly ordinary life in America. It was a challange to finish the book and my time could have been better spent writing my own memoirs since they are way more compelling than Franks's!"},{"rating":"2","title":"'Tis Great","review":"I consider this the best of the McCourt trilogy. I never reviewed Angela's Ashes, because what else could say about the Pulitzer Prize winning book to convince you to read it? Teacher Man was good and helped round out his life, but 'TIS is a masterpiece that shows what perseverance can get you. It also showed how tough it can be for an outsider to make it here -- twice as hard. Even if you don't know FMc and never read Angela's Ashes, you will appreciate the memoir of this much-missed writer and teacher."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time","review":"I was very disappointed with this book. While Angela's Ashes was one of the best books I've ever read, reading 'Tis was a letdown. Frank McCourt comes to this country and has some understandable rough times here, but a lot of the rough times he endures are self-created, and any sympathy I felt towards him in Angela's Ashes was lost in 'Tis. I found myself at times thinking to myself as I read, \\"Well, what do you expect to happen when you act like that?\\" I wish I never read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Frank McCourt is endearing","review":"If you read Angela's Ashes, and like me, could not help but want something good to become of Frank McCourt, this book is a must. If you have only seen the movie \\"Angela's Ashes,\\" by all means try the novel. I was certain 'Tis could never measure up to the first book, which in spite of Frank's misery, he still made me laugh. But 'Tis had me just as enthralled. I am waiting to hear the rest of Frank McCourt's life story."},{"rating":"1","title":"'Tis","review":"This book is a disappointment after Angela's Ashes. McCourt's \\"all about me\\" excursion fails to capture the reader as the life he reports is neither good enough nor evil enough to be of interest. One keeps waiting for McCourt to either enjoy the bohemian life he is drawn to or else reach a turning point in which he accepts the middle class life he toys with. But instead the reader is forced to wade through page after page of Irish Catholic guilt impotent to bring anything more to the author's life than self pity. Hopefully McCourt has not expended all his creative his energy on giving us more than enough information about his own life and will now use his remarkable writing talent to create something worthy of his capability."},{"rating":"2","title":"tis very honest","review":"I thought this book was very good, and while some may say it was not as good as ASHES,(I disagree) the point is it is a memoir of Frank McCourt not a fictional story. It is funny and poignant and at times irritating to read the choices that he makes. His honesty in his memoir is blunt and he seems to hide nothing from the reader. He includes so many bad choices(that many would have shied away from revealing) that you can't help but respect his openess about his life. We aren't intended to judge him, but to peek into his life and to see how we are shaped by events and choices in our own lives, in the short and the long term. It may also make us look with a bit more compassion on those around us whose lives we \\"just don't get!\\" and to appreciate the blessings we receive no matter how small."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful book","review":"After having read Angela's Ashes, I have to say that I enjoyed 'Tis even more. I found the subject matter to be more relevant to me (a Brooklyn resident) and if this is possible, McCourt's writing style is even more direct and refined than in Angela's Ashes. In 'Tis we get a fascinating look at Frank as he tries to make his way through life, a product of a poor and broken home. McCourt's point of view is so unique and special, I found myself shaking my head in awe at the ends of some chapters."},{"rating":"2","title":"NOTHING WRONG WITH SECOND BEST","review":"Just finished reading this out loud to my wife and both of us enjoyed it a lot.

I think this is a story that didn't need to be told."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as Angela's Ashes . . .","review":"But I must say it's hard to attain such perfection twice. No, 'Tis isn't quite everything that Angela's Ashes was and it's very likely the success of the first book is what caused Mr. McCourt to write this one. But, despite this, his style is still fresh and original and makes the pages just fly by. Definitely a sadder tone and ending than Angela's, perhaps reflecting Mr. McCourt's overall depression and outlook of life. It does gloss over some things. I'd've liked to hear more about his teaching adventures but overall, the style is still wonderful and the subject material always interesting. You owe it to yourself to pick this up if you enjoyed Angela's Ashes."},{"rating":"1","title":"This sequel ain't equal...","review":"...to Angela's Ashes. Like others, I loved Angela's Ashes but was very disappointed with this sequel. He needed a Maxwell Perkins of an editor on this one. It could and should have been half as long. In AA McCourt's language was lively and colorful and his story engrossing. In 'Tis the language was dull and repetitive and the poor me theme was tiresome. I expected better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Frankies Done it Again","review":"After I read Angelas Ashes I couldn't wait to read Tis. I heard from more than one source that the book was terrible I was shattered. About a month later I saw it on sale and decided to buy it. When I opened it and started to read it I was amazed at how good it was. I almost liked it better than Angelas Ashes. Frank McCourt is honestly the best story teller I have read. His way of writting is absolutly amazing. This book will make laugh, cry and you feel as though you know Frank personally. It is a great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must read if you've read Angela's Ashes","review":"I loved the how truthful he is...and it kept me reading and very interested. I recomend this and Angela's Ahes to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"'Tis rather disappointing...","review":"As much as Angela's Ashes was a story of survival, this sequel was mostly a collection of snippets from the author's adult life. True, the first half of the book recalled young Frank's struggle as an Irish-American in New York. Perhaps he could have paralelled his achievement of the American dream with his mother Angela's decline, and given us an insight to her thoughts with regard to her sons' success and her own past sacrifices... rather than just fill space until the inevitable ending, when the full circle comes to a close."},{"rating":"2","title":"McCourt shines!","review":"The beginning of this book was perhaps a little laborious. It just didn't flow as well as Angela's Ashes did. This is not to say, however, that the book stunk. Far from it. Only the first few pages were hard to read through. By the end of the first chapter McCourt had found his zone and never looked back! The book was as well written as Angela's Ashes but given that the circumstances were not as bleak as Limmerick, Ireland it wasn't as moving. Still, I found the book deeply interesting and wholly wonderful. If Frank McCourt DOESN'T publish another book, whether that be fiction or (somehow) another memoir, I will be severely dissappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"We all live in hope","review":"Yes, we do all live in hope, unfortunately, I was disappointed with the result of Tis.Angela's Ashes was my first experience with Irish culture and I was entranced by Frank's story.Unfortunatley, the ramblings and constant whining in Tis was mediocre.Is it no wonder that the early years in Limerick seem much more gay than those spent in NY (where Frank was desperate to live - but ended up always the outsider)Wake up buddy - we are ALL outsiders"},{"rating":"2","title":"Will Make You Appreciate Your Life","review":"McCourts tale of his life as a poor immigrant, alone and struggling, will make many of us appreciate our lives....as well as what our ancestors had to go through. An excellent book, although, I would have liked to have known more about how he became an author and go where he is today. A must buy for anyone with an Irish heritage!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as moving as Angela's Ashes, but powerful nonetheless","review":"'Tis is not nearly as heart wrenching as Angela's Ashes, but it is a pleasure to read and as inspiring as any memoir I've ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"A fast start ,but a loser by the finish.","review":"McCourt's sequel to Angela's Ashes is interesting at first, but rambles from the middle on. His descriptions of early jobs in New York and his tour in the Army in Germany are well told. The difficulty in starting and actually finishing college with no high school diploma is also well documented. Unfortunately, once he gets his degree and starts teaching the tale becomes rambling and at times downright boring. I found myself speed reading till the end of the book finally came. Like movie sequels nothing beats the first effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"intriguing","review":"I am only part way into the book, but I want to read on. I am disappointed in the lack of the Irish brogue in this novel. I find Frankie still honest and his words heartfelt. I am interested in how this novel ends."},{"rating":"1","title":"An unrelenting subject","review":"Although I loved Angela's Ashes and laughed and cried and marveled at Frank McCourt's way with words and mind pictures, I was sorely disappointed by the sequel, \\"Tis.\\"It was so, well, unrelenting and, after a while, monotonous. I didn't want to hear the description of his sore, red eyes the 50th time he mentioned them... or for that matter, the 20th time!Where the first book's tragedies and sad stories were leavened by the truly hilarious bits, \\"Tis\\" had few humorous moments. The last chapters seemed to be \\"dashed off\\" and boring. I raced through them to the end of the book.I will approach his next book with a jaundiced eye, I'm sorry to say."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tis, a disappointment","review":"Angela's ashes was wonderful and entertaining, this much anticipated sequel was a huge disappointment. Where the first novel was engaging and witty, this one reads more like an ongoing complaint. Yes, Tis has it's moments, but it is not worth the effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tis No Angela's Ashes","review":"When I read ANGELA'S ASHES I was stunned by the humanity of the story. I hadn't even finished it and I was recommending it to friends and buying copies to give to people. Naturally I couldn't wait to read TIS. Well I finished TIS last night and what a let down. Mr. McCourt shares his father's problem with alcohol and like his father he can't see it. His idea of Irish social drinking isn't funny and his antics and his friends antics under the influence are sad not humorous. After the success of ANGELA'S ASHES I saw and heard many interviews with Mr. McCourt and it was obvious he had an edge to him that I misstook for rightous indignation. I was wrong, Mr. McCourt is an angry alcoholic who never grew up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Maybe this just isn't my kind of book, but I just didn't care for it at all. Boring and difficult to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very very bad book","review":"It was obvious that this man did not have a clue about what made his first book so wonderful. It is truly sad that he did not stop there. I am truly amazed that this book got any good reviews. I do hope he will stop now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to par","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed Angela's Ashes. TIS, I did not enjoy at all. I could not wait to finish. Very repetitive with the descriptions of himself and others ad nauseum. I found it extremely boring and uninteresting. One best seller does not make another."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Inspiring American Journey","review":"As a reader with family connections to Ireland, I appreciated reading of Frank's journey to finding his \\"American\\" dream of belonging and succeeding through his profession of teaching. Frank's undiminishing spirit in finding and realizing his dream is inspiring.Another book, which I LOVE by Ariel and Shya Kane called \\"WORKING ON YOURSELF DOESN'T WORK: A BOOK ABOUT INSTANTANEOUS TRANSFORMATION\\" has guided me in awakening my own dreams into realities. Those realities include a loving and fun relationship with my husband, enriching relationship with my friends and a job I truly love.I whole heartedly recommend the Kanes' book to anyone interested in having their own life's dreams become true and lasting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Service","review":"After numerous attempts to contactthe seller, Istill have not received the book. Connie spahr 10/13/2008"},{"rating":"1","title":"HMMM.......BAD","review":"This book was a great disappointment since I had set a very high standard after reading his first book. I seriously DO NOT recommend it, it's badly written and tedious. Even though the grammar in Angela's Ashes was quite poor, at least it wasn't BORING!! It's just a bunch of words printed down and bound into a book, it doesnt go directly to your head which only a truly excellent book does- it's not like in the other one when you could actually feel his pain and see his life through his own eyes- you were there."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is boring, depressing, and most of all incomplete.","review":"If I could give this book a grade, I would give it an Incomplete. Having read and listened to interviews Mr. McCourt has given, I expected to hear more about his teaching experiences than his carousing New York, and I thought there would be some positive insight into a past filled with hardship. The book reads more like a drunkalog than a memoir.Family alcoholism is horrendous, and if Mr. McCourt is going to write any more books exposing himself and his family to public view, I would highly recommend that he take in some AA meetings. Maybe it would help him to write a more honest view of himself and his family.After the \\"courage, strength, and hope\\" of Angela's Ashes, I am disappointed and saddened by this latest installment."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment after Angela's Ashes.","review":"I loved Angela's Ashes and eagerly awaited Tis from Frank McCourt. What a disappointment. His second book was almost as bad as his brother's A Monk Swimming, and I threw that book away half way through it.I hope that the second book is just a fluke and he will hit his original stride in a third book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"This book is a wonderful extention to Angela's Ashes. I think that Frank McCourt is a fanaminal writer and makes you feel all the emotions of someone growing up in his situation. Great for the days you want to laugh and the days that you want to cry."},{"rating":"2","title":"A long awaited arrival","review":"'Tis was a book that was anticipated because of the joy we all got from reading Angela's Ashes. 'Tis isn't the same but it has the same feel and you love to look into McCourt's eyes on life and think how he thought. There are a few missing elements in the book that I wanted to see, but overral the book completed the curiosity I had from the ending of Angela's Ashes and it is a book you want to read, it isn't such a waste of money as others would put it. Read and enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"still a great read","review":"when Frank McCourt came out with Tis,I didn't think that the book could possibly live up to Angela's Ashes. But, I was surprised that this man had still more of those humorus\\\\sad stories that everyone loved in the prequel. It is a little drier than Angela's Ashes but his storytelling ability definitely did not fail his readers in Tis. I continue to be marveled at how many experiences this man has. wow!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is such a disappointment and most of it unnecessary.","review":"Obviously, everyone enjoyed \\"Angela's Ashes\\", but \\"Tis\\" will put you to sleep. This and his brother's book \\"A Monk's Swimming\\" leave a bad taste in my mouth. Don't waste your money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Angela's story","review":"If you haven't read the first of Frank McCourt's books \\"Angela's Ashes,\\" then I suggest you do so. I read that book for my college English class and realized what a talented author he is. So when I found out that he had a sequel, I had to check it out. \\"Tis\\" starts off where he left off in the first memoir. He tells about his adult life trying to make it in New York city. His biggest goal is to teach, but he must first climb over some obsticles that come his way. He wants to go to college, become a teacher, get married, and have kids like every American.This book has some funny tales of his mischeif while in New York, and I couldn't help but laugh at some of the stories he had from teaching high school. He still has to deal with past demons from his childhood with his mother and father, which makes you both angry and sad. I suggest this book to anyone who has an open mind, and a soft place in their heart for our ancestors overcoming odds in America."},{"rating":"1","title":"I found Tis very disappointing","review":"After reading Angelas Ashes and then hearing a sequel was in the works, I looked forward to it with great anticipation. As I read his first book, I kept wanting it to go on forever, while reading Tis I couldn't wait for it to end. I found the book tedious at times and filled with cynicism. I kept reading it hoping to find a light at the end of the tunnel but only found a small glimmer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a patch on Angela's Ashes","review":"Let's face it- had it not been for the success of Angela's Ashes, McCourt would never been able to get this rambling and only occasionally interesting memoir published. Like other readers I found this self-indulgent and repetetive. By the end of it I liked McCourt (as a person and as a writer) far less than after reading Angela's Ashes. I wish I hadn't spoiled the magic by reading this volume."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big disappointment","review":"I loved \\"Angela's Ashes\\" but \\"Tis\\" is incredibly boring and self-satisfied. McCourt just waffles on and on and repeats himself endlessly (including large chunks of his first book). I have tried to finish this book but I can't be bothered. I put it down for over a month without missing it - something you can't say about \\"AA\\". Please save your money - if you have to read it get it from the library or wait until it's in paperback. Alternatively you can have my copy for a buck!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"Just as Margaret Mitchell's other writings could never add up to her first book, 'Gone with the Wind', so it is with 'Tis. This is the second memoir, after his wonderful debut book. As good as the story is, it just does not have the punch of his first, but it is still an excellent tale. I do love this man's writing style!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Tis\\" not as Good as The First","review":"Tis, a Memoir. The life of Frank McCourt is sad and makes you think, infact it also makes you feel fuzzy on the inside, in a good way of course. However while a great book his life seems to drone on a bit when things go good for him, a horrible thing to say i know, but the major people puller of the book was just how was he was going to pull through it, but when he does it it is boring. The 1st got a 5star rating from me. But the sequel gets only a 4star. Ofcourse a 4star is still a great book and thats what this book is. Recomended but wont be enjoyed as much as the first."},{"rating":"2","title":"The rest of Angelia's story","review":"After reading Angelia's Ashes, I was certainly looking forward to Tis. Tis picks up where Angelia's Ashes left off and Frank McCourt keeps the reader interested, for the most part. There is some repitition, however, this is Franks writing style and I enjoyed his life in America very much. The only part of the book I did not enjoy was Frank's continious references to his classes and the students. Otherwise, in my estimation Tis is another success. Hat's off Frank."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointing","review":"Angela's Ashes deserved all the acclaim it received. 'Tis deserves the mostly bad reviews it has received. As I began to read it, I almost thought McCourt was still a child - I was surprised to realize he was 19 years old at the start of the book. His outlook on life is naive, especially when you consider the desperately hard life he came from. Could he really have thought America would be all his dreams come true! McCourt also irritatingly uses certain phrases over and over, almost to the point of making you want to put the book down. But mainly my problem with 'Tis is that it was full of misery, self-loathing, and hopelessness. It lacked the ability to see the beauty of life through all it's misery and problems. Angela's Ashes had that quality and was heart breakingly beautiful because of it - 'Tis did not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Superficial.","review":"Mr. McCourt was my English teacher in high school. This book was a disappointment, although I had eagerly looked forward to reading it (hey, I like the guy). While he was a great teacher and a wonderful storyteller, he did have a way of exaggerating to make his point, and 'Tis is no exception. In fact, oversimplistic generalizations and a self-pitying tone not only left the impression of a very superficial work, but made me wonder about the sweeping condemnations of Church, Ireland and society in \\"Angela's Ashes\\". Certainly many generalizations in 'Tis are simplistic and left unexplored. On the topic of the immigrant experience, he offers nothing that's new, or insightful, or even all that interesting. It kills me to say this, but 'Tis is a loser. If you must read it, get it from the library before you decide whether to buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"'Tis","review":"I felt that Frank McCourt had written a truly insightful account of his early life in Angela's Ashes. However, as an educator myself, I throroughly enjoyed 'Tis. McCourt portrays himself in a clearly honest and not always flattering manner as he pursues the American dream. Frank resents his father's drinking and desertion of his family. However, he clings somewhat to the same course. They share the love of the drink and a self-centered view of the world. This is, in many respects a pitiful account of a man searching for answers in his life, but insights are often laced with profound humor."},{"rating":"2","title":"You can hear his voice","review":"I was excited when this book came along because it meant that I could revisit Frank and continue hearing his facinating story. I think the brilliance of it is the narrative in which it is written. You hear his voice in every sentence; you hear him as he spoke in whatever stage of his life he was in. It's just a wonderful read and, although his story is mostly a string of tragedies posing as birthdays gone by, it's a story of hope. Hope because despite all he had been through he still managed to become what he wanted to be and has succeeded. And to do that and still retain a sense of humor is amazing. Saying anything more about the actual book's contents would do a browsing customer a great injustice. This is just simply a book you have to buy. That is, of course, AFTER you order and read Angela's Ashes."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Nice Follow-up to Angela's Ashes","review":"'Tis is the tale of Frank McCourt's adulthood, and his adulthood is less depressing -- and a bit less interesting -- than his childhood. You won't find much in the way of chamber pots and consumption here, but you will find the same poetic writing that made Angela's Ashes such a wonderful book. I enjoyed Angela's Ashes more, but I'm glad to have seen how everything turned out."},{"rating":"1","title":"I question why this book was written","review":"It seems that most of what Frank has to say in Tis could have been summed up with two more chapters on the tail end of \\"Angela's Ashes\\". I was quite disspointed and felt as if this book was written for the sole purpose of making a few bucks..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tis'nt","review":"Having just finished Frank McCourt's sequel to the wonderful Angela's Ashes, I feel totally underwhelmed. I could not wait until this book came out and was one of the first purchasers at the local book shop....but it took me FOREVER to complete this. I usually read a book in one sitting but the dullness of this book made the normal January dreariness even more unbearable. I thought it jumped around too much and some of his sentences were three paragraphs long.While I could still hear his lyrical voice, I found myself more and more skipping whole sections, just to get to the next chapter. Upon arriving, I found that it was one of those books you just couldn't help but put down...."},{"rating":"1","title":"A rambling, foul, vulgar discourse.","review":"This book was a great disappointment. I believe the author is living on the laurels of Angela's Ashes. The story is a rambling, foul, vulgar discourse on what appears to be many imagined stories. McCourt admits in interviews he did not keep any diaries or notes. I find it difficult that he remembered all this in such detail. The sad thing is that it appears he turned out no better than his drunken father. I had hoped his life would be more of a shining example to other immigrants who strive for the American dream. It seems his only intention in this book was to see how much garbage the reader would tolerate. I would not recommend this book to anyone. Save your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"'Tis Disappointing!","review":"Angela's Ashes was a great, poignant read. But this sequel tries too hard really and oh, the writerly style, though fresh and intriguing for the first few pages, kind of got annoying and unreadable--the sentences just run endlessly into each other--which might suit the comedy at times or the gruff, unaccostomed affections between men, but i had to plod thru it for the most part till i was only reading it out of duty and a stupid determination to see it thru to the end (see why run-ons get tiresome?)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank God for Frank McCourt","review":"Although I have never been able to figure out the title, this is still a wonderful (and important) story of coming to America. I own the book but I actually listned to the tape version since McCourt narrated his own work. Essentially this is a follow up to Angela's Ashes in which an older Frank chronicles his return to New York City. The story os told with humor and graviety and given an earthy perspective. I was so upset that Frank McCourt left us with so little work to his credit but what he had left us is wonderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very powerful journey, this book is great!!","review":"When I first started reading Frank McCourt's work I was very impressed with his verbage, and his ability to tell such telling facts in the manner in which he did. I did not read Angela's Ashes first, I decided to read Tis, I thought it was much better than Angela's Ashes, the film was brilliant and Alan Parker's work was stunning, he is a great Director and Frank McCourt is a wonderful writer!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"'Tis not","review":"You know how when you get through talking to a good teacher (or cabbie or firefighter...) you hear yourself say to them, 'you should write a book.' Thank God most of them are to busy to actually do it. This sort of thing should never be allowed to happen. Perhaps it is true that everyone has one great (ok, good) book in him. He should have just let it go at that. Every fault of the first book, the character tainted by memory and weighed by the perspectives of disaffection or warmth, the events churned through that same filter (here much less relevantly than in AA), the whole 'David Copperfield' perspective thing, is magnified and put in the way.All in all, it's much less well thought out. I'm sorry for readers who expected more, but more, I'm sorry for the kids he's not teaching, it's clear he was pretty good (and consistent) at that."},{"rating":"1","title":"From pity to annoyance","review":"I finished it, but I was wondering why long before it was over. The first compelling tale doesn't carryover. I found myself more annoyed than anything, particularly with his drunken performance on his wedding day. Skip it and hope there isn't a third."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reader's Choice","review":"The man who won a Pulitzer for ANGELA'S ASHES does not emerge from 'TIS with his past grandeur. Only when he continues with the story of his family does he touch on literary excellence. One is interested in what happened to his family, what happen to Frank McCourt in America,and possibly finding the key to his genius.Instead he feeds the reader endless character sketches and boring classroom scenes. The repetitious narative (Michael what's left of him) at times became tiresome, but then Frank McCourt astounds the reader with his unique style born of heartfelt love for family. And this, after all, is why the reader will choose 'TIS!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Natural Born Storyteller","review":"The only thing more pleasurable than reading Frank McCourt's memoirs is listening to him read them! Wonderful! You will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Villa Kula Book Club","review":"Our book club, made up six girls read this book. Although there were mixed opinions, overall it was a thumbs up. We admire Frank McCourt's ability to find humor in the most difficult situations. His writing style gives the reader a vivid picture of each character and setting. If you enjoyed Angela's Ashes, 'Tis is a must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"'tis is an absorbing, compelling read.","review":"I was thoroughly impressed with this continuation of Angela's Ashes. I normally only read fiction novels, but this book had me fascinated. The story flows through NYC and gives an entertaining and historical impression of the time passed.

Where Angela's Ashes spoke compellingly of a time, a place and a life, 'Tis whines. The author has indulged himself in a pity party and invites us to buy his book and listen to him moan. I am glad I borrowed this book from the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Tis","review":"Oh Mr. McCourt how could you? I was so enchanted by Angela's Ashes that the moment 'Tis hit the shelves, I had to own it and read it. I am sorry to say that I was terribly disappointed. The rich textures and vibrant images that delighted me in Angela's Ashes are missing in this confusing, angst-ridden sequel. Having savoured 'Ashes I tried hard to be patient, waiting for the old magic to appear. It was nowhere to be found. Not only did I not care about the protagonist - he bored me. If another book is in the offing, I will not rush to buy it until Frank McCourt redeems himself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhere along the line, I stopped caring","review":"I really *wanted* to like this book. The beginning holds some of the same innocent, youthful insights found in Angela's Ashes. Somewhere in the middle, though, McCourt just becomes a whiner and a loser. I only read the second half because I thought that eventually he would recognize his own self-destructive patterns and the book would end with some sense of redemption or triumph over alcoholism and broken relationships. Somewhere between the ages of 17 and 30, Frank McCourt forgot where he put his bootstraps."},{"rating":"1","title":"We know what it 'tisn't","review":"It's clear what 'Tis isn't - it isn't Angela's Ashes, the Pulitzer Prize winning tale of McCourt growing up in the slums of Limerick. Although this books begins where the last left off with the author arriving in New York, the adult McCourt appears to have very little more to tell and waste the reader's time with tales of his drinking and sexual exploits (or lack thereof) amid endless whining about his career choices."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great storyteller","review":"I read \\"Angela's Ashes\\" and loved it. Heard iffy reviews about \\"Tis\\" but read it anyway. It is such a well-written book. Frank McCourt is a wonderful story teller and I love reading his WORDS! If you read \\"Angela's Ashes\\" then you deserve to find out what happens to young McCourt as he wanders the streets of New York and into NYU! A very fine book, indeed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great follow-up to the massive bummer that the original was.","review":"I enjoyed reading this. Angela's Ashes, while a great book, was such a total bummer and McCourt obviously had a better go of things at the time in his life that he chronicles here. I like when things turn out all right and I can totally relate with McCourt's wanting to stay away from Rhode Island's social weirdness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Irish Eyes Are Smiling","review":"And I thought Angela's Ashes was the best. I couldn't wait to check out \\"'Tis\\" at my local library. First I was on a waiting list, but it was well worth the Month's wait. This book touched me in so many ways! I highly recommend it. I can't wait to own it! You'll laugh and cry and wonder why all at the same time. Frank McCourt's writing is inspiring and very moving. Angela's Ashes and 'Tis are soon to be treasured on my bookshelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"hey, frank, what's next?","review":"frank mccourt has done it again!

It was charming and insightful.In this book the author still struggles through most of his adult life trying to comprehend things and seems to fail at every turn. It comes off as simply pathetic and clueless.If I hadn't been interested in the characters to begin with, I'd rate this a 1-star book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A whiny narrative full of self-pity","review":"After enjoying Angela's Ashes, I could not wait to read 'Tis. The burning question we all had: how did the incredible Frank McCourt who survived so much adversity fare in the \\"land of opportunity\\". The answer, sadly, is that he held a grudge most of his life. Like most children of alcoholics Mr. McCourt remained the victim and prefereed seeing all the events in his adult life as caused by the flaws in others. He never took any responsiblity for the pain his own alcoholism caused his wife and family. The constant \\"poor me\\" outlook got very tiresome and boring. Grow up Mr. McCourt and learn some gratitude!"},{"rating":"2","title":"'Tisn't as good as Angela's Ashes but -","review":"\`Tis - A Memoir by Frank McCourt Schribner 1999Frank McCourt's coming of age in America is a wonderful story - full of humor, sadness and integrity. Frank brings with him his Irish roots and while he tries vainly to sink them into American soil, he never really succeeds. He remains as Irish as the day he came and tells his story with wit and verve.In Angela's Ashes the poignancy of poverty and a run-away father told in a child's voice brought me to tears as did his constant struggle to live up to a church whose stern voice incessantly called for repentance. \\"\`Tis\\" is a different sort of book and while charming did not have the same emotional pull as\\"Angela's Ashes\\".A good read and I would recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let Down","review":"I loved Angela's Ashes. I felt their pain and suffering. I felt my Irish Heritage.I felt so much was left unsaid in \\"Tis\\". I felt as though much adieu was given to Mr. McCourt's talent, and I did not see it exhibited in the book. I was very let down. So much verbiage was repeated and was so unnecessary. I was unimpressed, but perservered.It wan't until the last paragraph in Ch. 48 that McCourt let the reader feel what he let them feel in Angela's Ashes. Finally, when he looses his Mother & Father, regardless of his feelings towards them, the reader is able to participate as they were able to in McCourt'e first book.I felt it was a very big waste of time and money ( in overdue fines. I couldn't turn it in w/o reading it's entirety.) Glad I read it, but wouldn't recommend it, if Angela's Ashes was liked. Thanks for the ear."},{"rating":"1","title":"The nut didn't fall to far from the tree","review":"I loved Angela's Ashes and couldn't wait to read Tis however I had to force myself to finish this book. I kept thinking that at some point this man would realize that he had everything he needed right in front of him to find happiness. But he never did. He was in many ways very much like his father. He didn't apear to have any passion or inspiration behind becoming a teacher. Every situation seemed to add more confusion to his wo-is-me daily existance including his romance and marriage which was told with a surprising lack of emotion or love. It seemed that the only time he lifted his meloncolly tone was when he spoke of his daughter. I believe that before Frank McCort writes another book he could benefit by reading another best seller by Phil McGraw called Life Strategies. Why did he write this book? There seemed to be no purpose or meaning other than to add another cover to the tavern wall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious and whiny","review":"I just finished this book, and let me tell you, it was a chore reading it. I couldn't put Angela's Ashes down, but it took me weeks to plod through this one. Not only is the story not nearly as gripping, but McCourt seems to have lost the art of storytelling. It takes him pages to tell what could just as easily have been told in a paragraph or two. But what really turned me off was how he held a grudge against his father and even his mother, blaming them for his sorry state, as if his father was responsible for his drinking, his disappointing career, and his failed marriage. It's time to grow up, McCourt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing follow-up to Angela's Ashes","review":"I loved Angela's Ashes and was thrilled to learn there was a sequel. I was very disappointed in Tis, however. McCourt's writing style was charming in Angela's Ashes since he was writing from the perspective of a child but didn't translate well once he was recalling his adulthood. The book is way too long and there are many random, uninteresting anecdotes. I won't be reading McCourt's 3rd book."},{"rating":"2","title":"INTERESTING FOLLOW-UP","review":"Frank McCourt's \\"Tis\\" is an interesting follow-up to his Pulitzer Prize-winning \\"Angela's Ashes.\\" It follows the McCourt family, and especially Frank, as they continue their lives in America. Frank's wit and his serious nature both come through in this one, although this book isn't as much a page-turner as \\"Ashes\\" was. In my opinion, the book would mean much more to the reader if he read \\"Angela's Ashes\\" first. We need that background to understand the family and to see how they have evolved into the people they are. \\"Tis\\" is an enjoyable read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tis Not What I Expected","review":"It's very difficult to review a biographical book that you didn't really enjoy because in some ways you feel as if you are being critical of the author's life. However, I really feel as if this book had no 'oomph'. There was a flatness to it that made me feel depressed everytime I picked it up. I didn't experience any connection with McCourt and his writing didn't make me care about him or any of the people in his life. If McCourt has a sense of humour, this didn't come across either - although I did notice places where he was perhaps attempting some humour, but the overall tone of book made it fall flat. It's like listening to a terribly depressed person trying to make a joke where instead of being funny, it just sounds bitter and disspirited.I would just like to have seen the story told in a more enthusiastic and interesting manner rather than the flat monotone it was delivered in."},{"rating":"1","title":"a real bore to read","review":"After falling in love with Angela's Ashes, I was deeply depressed reading this dreadfully boring book. Everything in this book is a total bore. He has boring stories, he has boring characters, and he keeps wining thoughout the book.His treatment of woman is especially horrendous, and does his mother a great disservice in the way he describes her.Take this book out of the library first. If you love it, buy it, but, most likely you'll be bored with everything that in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent book!","review":"Frank McCourt's writing style is witty, charming, thought-provoking, and absolutely enthralling. I have a hard time putting the book down when my lunch hour is over!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Can Frank Mc Court's 'Tis Match up to Angela's Ashes?","review":"This book was good, but not as good as Angela's Ashes, and not as good as I expected it to be. The book started out just as Angela's Ashes left off, with him starting out in New York City. Then he joins the military and trains dogs in Germany. In the book he experiments with several women and lives his life as a ordinary bachelor, until he meets Alberta. At that point he had already talked his way into NYU. The book gets into the detail about teachers and gets somewhat boring. I still reccomend this book despite it's repetiveness, and droning of hangovers and debt."},{"rating":"2","title":"More great stories, a different setting","review":"I've read some rather scathing reviews of \\"'Tis\\", and I don't think it deserves to be pounded. The narrative style is the same; and, it picks up precisely where \\"Angela's Ashes\\" left off. Anyone else notice that \\"Angela\\" hadn't gone to ashes at the end? I don't think this book was a rushed effort. Rather, it seems that the aspect that makes it mildly less satisfying is the fact that it doesn't challenge us to look at our own lives and compare, the way \\"Angela\\" did. The main differences: a change of venue (we're in NYC, now; not Ireland), the age of the narrator and the disappointment in his values and morals (or lack thereof). If you're looking for a book about growing up, a memoir in which the writer maintains his dignity and morals, read Paul Watkins' memoir: \\"Stand Before Your God\\". But, don't be afraid of \\"'Tis\\". Frank McCourt is still a wonderful storyteller, even if he doesn't horrify us and make us reflect on poverty vs. comfort in this second book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing work after a good first novel.","review":"Perhaps my expectations were a bit high after Angela's Ashes but this novel did not go anywhere for me. Sure, there were some amusing stories but seemed like trudgery to get through 'Tis. When I can't look forward to picking up a book at the end of a day then I know it's a boring book. Reader beware."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fabulous continuation of Angela's Ashes","review":"Frank McCourt really knows how to turn a phrase so that it seems he is reading the story aloud. His conversational style is work, but of the most enjoyable sort. These aren't just words on pages. Both of his books evoke strong emotions. I laughed AND cried throughout each book. I'm certain Frank McCourt is someone with whom I'd love to share a pint and a story or two."},{"rating":"2","title":"'Tis after all, the story of a man's life!","review":"Having loved 'Angela's Ashes' I was somewhat cautious with my expectations of a sequel, as sequels tend to be dissapointing generally! I could'nt put 'Tis' down. The honesty of Mr. McCourt in presenting to us the suffering and heartbreak that he had endured and managed to rise above is inspirational. All of us have memories of childhood locked up and shelved in our mind, to be able to bring it all out in the open and confront the very being that you are is a gift. It brought tears to my eyes, I would love to read more from Frank McCourt!"},{"rating":"2","title":"'Tisn't as good as Angela's Ashes but 'Tisn't that bad","review":"The biggest mistake Frank McCourt ever made was winning a Pulitzer prize first shot out of the box... 'Tis is good. Angela's Ashes was great. And now 'Tis is only read in comparison to Angela's Ashes (Sequelitis). If you haven't read either book I suggest reading 'Tis first.I do agree with other critics that the First half of 'Tis was the best part and infact it was more like a seamless continuation of Angela's Ashes, but then Frankie's life got too easy and the story got kind of boring. All in all though it wasn't a bad read. Frankly I'm always surprised to hear that an Irishman has even read two books let alone written two."},{"rating":"1","title":"'Tis a Shame","review":"Major dissapointment. I enjoyed \\"Angela's Ashes\\" and as a second generation Irish-American believed much of what he said to be true, based on similair stories I heard from my own childhood. I also enjoyed his quick wit an humor. Tis was pathetic, what exactly did Frank McCourt contribute to society when he came to the U.S.? All he does is whine,talk about his sloppy drinking, and treat all the women in his life with total disrespect. There are so many wonderful stories of the Irish that came to the U.S. and built companies and contributed to their communities it is a shame he adds fuel to the notion that the Irish are lazy. A complete waste of time I have lost all respect for him as a writer and more important as a gentleman."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Tis\\" not","review":"Having read and enjoyed Angela's Ashes, I was very disappointed with Tis. Frank painted himself as a pathetic Irish drunk, who learned little about meaningful relationships in over 40 years. If this is really true, at least he could have made the book more interesting with less self-deprecation and at least a pretense of some purpose in life. I probably would not have finished it had I not been stuck in an airplane with little else to read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed. Reads like it was copied from a daily log.","review":"All the sentiment, emotion and spirit of Angela's Ashes is gone and in it's place is a tale of resentment and anger. I thought Angela's Ashes was written with a sense of pride and understanding but neither can be found in McCourt's TIS. TIS contains too much whining and complaining and not enough inspiration to be recommended. This book is depressing enough to make Oprah Winfrey's book list."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Beat Goes On","review":"I find myself surprised at the reviews that concern the different style elements between 'Tis and Angela's Ashes. To me the style is the same for both, just at different ages. I suspect that those who like these books the most are fans of Jack Kerouac's On the Road or J.D. Salinger's Catcher in the Rye. To me these book are \\"real\\" and never \\"phony\\" in a way that Kerouac and Saliger could only dream of. This is in many ways this a typical American story that is told more from the heart than from the plot points. I think this is the best writing of the Beat Generation. Go Mr. McCourt now give us some poetry -- HOWL!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's good to see there was a happy ending.","review":"Angela's Ashes brought readers right into the lives of the McCourt boys. I loved the book and couldn't put it down; but at the end I did feel like I was left hanging. It was wonderful to read the continuing story of Frank, his brothers and his mom. As an Irish American who grew up in New York City, I always love reading about the two things closest to my heart - the Irish people and New York City. And I'm glad to know the McCourts of Limerick came out on top."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tis a great read","review":"Thank you Frank McCourt for sharing your rich life with such compassion and humor. I recommend 'Tis with enthusiasm. Please keep writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was very disapointed. I expected more .","review":"After reading Angela's Ashes, which was great, I wanted to like Frank McCort's second offering but I could not. I was not impressed by his simpering self loathing...I could not even conjure sympathy, merely pity. A pathetic attempt at best, sorry Frank."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Irish teen comes of age in post war New York","review":"One that should be on everyone's must read list! Although it may fall a bit short of McCourt's instant classic, Angelas Ashes, readers will certainly be entertained by his tale of the awkward teen coming of age in New York. McCourt's prose, truly rich with Irish wit and humor, encourages the reader to become part of his world. His style makes you feel as if you are having a long converstion with the author. Adding to the richness of the story is McCourt's points of reference. I felt like I rode the subways and swapped stories with him throughout the Bronx and Manhattan.An inspirational tale, that turns heartache and struggle, into a flowing and humorous story."},{"rating":"1","title":"The literary glue stayed in Ireland","review":"Naturally, I bought the hard copy book of \\"Tis\\" because I loved \\"Angela's Ashes\\". I had seen Mr. McCourt on tv interviews and wanted to follow the progression of his adventure. The second book seemed to be \\"jumpy\\" in content, as if he were working too hard to find material worthy of telling. Parts were compelling and yet the majority of the book forced me to continue reading in hopes of better passages ahead. Perhaps by the end of \\"Tis\\" I realized his new life had become as mundane as mine!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tis a Disappointment","review":"After thoroughly enjoying \\"Angela's Ashes\\" as well as the recent movie version, I was looking forward to \\"Tis\\". I'm now skimming the last 50 pages just to finish it already! No doubt Mr.McCourt's fans of \\"Angela's Ashes\\" (along with his publisher) were demanding a sequel to that bestselling memoir. Unfortunately, the author's life and experiences after he left Limerick just aren't interesting enough to warrant another book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entranced","review":"Frank McCourt's way of writing is entrancing. Since I had begun his life story series (Angela's Ashes) on audiocassete, I was compelled to again purchase the additional audiocassette version as well. While this version did abridge the story found in the hardback book, listening to his own oral version was the best. (this is not always the case) Even if you have already read the book, don't overlook listening to the cassette as well!"},{"rating":"1","title":"'Tis no Angela's Ashes","review":"I have to admit that I was quite disappointed with 'Tis. In my opinion, Angela's Ashes contained more emotion than 'Tis. With Angela's Ashes, you \\"knew\\" who Frank McCourt was but with 'Tis, you only knew what he did with his life. I was anxious to read 'Tis to find out what happened with Frank's life. Although some of Frank's journeys as an adult were adventurous, there were some aspects that just weren't even worth reading. Angela's Ashes seemed to delve more into the heart and soul of Frank McCourt whereas 'Tis seemed to be missing this. 'Tis pales in comparison to Angela's Ashes. As long as you know this before reading 'Tis, you'll be able to get through it."},{"rating":"1","title":"She's a bad motorcycle","review":"What a crock!Either this editor doesn't ride or he just doesn't get it.This compilation of stories about \\"riding\\" misses the mark...that is,unless your idea of riding is endless accounts of \\"outlaw bikers\\" lifestyles and detailed accounts of their continuous partying.The few stories contained which actually have a theme about the sensations and joys of undertaking a trip on two wheels could almost be printed on the jacket.Get a clue,or better yet,get Peter Egan's \\"Leanings\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"...me, me, me\\" stories written by RUBs, dabblers, & dreamers","review":"I enjoyed a couple of the stories but the rest of them served to repeatedly remind me: these stories were written by WRITERS (I should've paid more attention to the subtitle.)...not by motorcyclists, bikers, enthusiasts, etc. If you absolutely love motorcycles then you'll likely find the stories to be trite, self-aggrandizing, and irrelevant. Most of the \\"writers\\" treat bikes as transient items in their respective lives...mere accessories to their inflated sense of \\"coolness\\" and self-importance. The book is filled with stories that follow the \\"I did this, I did that, I knew him, I saw this\\" model."},{"rating":"2","title":"truly underrated.....","review":"I don't think I can put it better than \\"Sonic Reducer\\" below me did. This band is so underrated and seemingly forgotten about now, and that's just a shame. Almost every song on this album rocks with catchy melodies and punch, and shoulda/coulda been radio hits with a little push. These guys had a great sound and put on a very cool live show. Fans of unpretentious, early-90's power pop should definitely pick this up."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best pop-punk album.","review":"and yet they get no credit. what a shame. make sure you check out \\"Turn Me on\\". it is almost as good as crush. the albums before crush are more rock and not nearly as good as crush or Turn Me on."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not a value pack","review":"This item is listed incorrectly.

I called the company and was advised these items are listed incorrectly and it is for only ONE cake. The company said it would credit my Amazon account."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huh?","review":"I'm having trouble trying to figure out what is wrong with this book. Is it a mystery? If so it's really bad. Is it written for elementary students? If so they would have flung it out the window after the first 3 pages.It's just a 'novella' with a lot of little vignettes which a 5 year old can see coming. Amazon has a lot of nerve to charge $9.95 for this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thumbs up for Christmas at Cliffhanger Inn","review":"I enjoyed this story. The characters were believable and interesting. The mysteries that were solved captured my attention with the dialogue and actions of the characters.Christine Collier takes a normal character and puts them in incredible situations that draws the reader in to help solve the mystery. I picked up the story to read a few chapters, but couldn't put it down till I had read the last page. I will be waiting to read her next book to see what other mysteries she thinks up for her character's to solve."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hate to say it, Dumb","review":"This is a very thin book, only 72 pages and sounds very amateurish. There is no real overall plot - each short chapter has a \\"mystery\\" that is resolved in the chapter (like an old note that is found hidden in a staircase saying a body is buried in the basement many years ago - it turns out to be a pet dog; the skeleton of a severed foot is found in a Xmas tree lot - it turns out to be a man who had an accident many years ago that cut off his foot). The writing is awful. Yet, somehow, during the holiday season, it makes a nice read - just don't expect much..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!!","review":"Keep up the good work!!

He loved all the colorful pictures and I loved all the cute things it covered about the city. It does a great job of including all the big sights in (Arthur's seat, Holyrood Palace, Castle) and even some of the lesser known spots as well. It's like a little trip down memory lane every time I read it with him."},{"rating":"2","title":"another informative entry in the sasek series","review":"sasek's books are all visually lovely, no doubt about it, however they are also incredibly informative, which i quite appreciate. this book is littered with amazing images and interesting facts. i would definitely say this entry has some of the more poorly printed images, as they appear fairly washed out in comparison to the rich colors on the cover. this does lend it a lovely throwback feel, though, so little complaint from me there.and as with all the updated printings of sasek's books, there is a welcome list of \\"this is the city...today!\\" at the end of the book with changes listed since the original printing. it is great to see both the way the city WAS as well as the present day differences.i highly recommend this book if you are interested in either edinburgh, or simply in wonderful illustration."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Pictures, interesting facts","review":"Fun book to page through.

I saw a definite difference in my comfort level with chiropractic alone, chiropractic and arnica, and with all three. When I took the bellis perennis I had no pain or discomfort, while I still had some discomfort with arnica alone and still a little pain between adjustments without any homeopathics.Many will argue that homeopathics are placebo- well there is nothing wrong with that if it works for you! No side effects, safe when pregnant and nursing, seems like a great deal! This is not one of the most popular remedies and even though I live in a major city I had to order it. Amazon made it easy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"On their way up","review":"This is Queen's first album and you can tell they are going places. Yes, Freddie's voice was thin and the subjects of their songs are weird, but the music is great. If you are unfamiliar with Queen, please understand that a lot of their songs are tongue in cheek and the boys often made fun of themselves or a situation.The bonus tracks and remix of \\"Liar\\" are an added treat! I have read many references to \\"Mad the Swine\\" and have read it was popular when they toured in the early days, now I have a change to hear it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keep Your Vinyl Alive!","review":"The sound quality is spectacular.

However, if it weren't for Keep Yourself Alive, Doin' Alright, The Night Comes Down, I wouldn't even own this. This is on a par with Hot Space, in my opinion. My Fairy King (come oooon, Freddie!), Son and Daughter, Great King Rat (cool title, corny lyrics--AND I LIKE CORNY LYRICS!!), and perhaps the WORST SONG EVER RECORDED IN MODERN HISTORY, Jesus (with the exception of Starship's \\"We Built This City\\").They got better with QUEEN II (thank the good lord!), peaked with A Night At The Opera and News Of The World, attained global domination with The Game, lost all credibility with Hot Space, went all new-wavey with The Works, then regained my respect with Innuendo (especially the fabulous cover art), then Freddie died and it was...over.But there are always their albums to keep me company. Just not Queen I."},{"rating":"2","title":"QUEEN'S FIRST","review":"The debut album from Queen contains a few of the elements that would eventually define the band, but is very much a early 70's Prog-rock/metal album. Freddy Mercury's distinct voice and Brian May's original guitar tones are in evidence throughout. The legendary excess and theatrical flair is a mere tease at this stage.The key tracks are the ones usually plucked for the many Queen anthologies, \\"Keep Yourself Alive\\" and \\"Liar.\\" The Kings and medieval themes prevalent in the era are available on \\"Great King Rat\\" and a tease of Queen II is offered when the album closes with \\"Seven Seas of Rhye.\\" For the most part, the show is May and Mercury's, with a quick peek at Roger Taylor's vocals on \\"Modern Times Rock and Roll.\\" The band has not quite gelled and the Queen everyone knows and loves emerged in full on the second album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning Debut","review":"This disk was a showcase of the magnificance of future Queen productions. Each member contributes lyrically and musically to the selection, and the vocals are perfect harmonies. Brian May's guitar layers sound almost like syntesizers, prompting the liner notes (and on subsequent releases)\\"No Syths\\". The songwriting moods change throughout, including the May penned hit \\"Keep Yourself Alive\\" and the dramatic moods of Mercury's \\"Liar\\", which begins to showcase his ability to draw from diverse sections and construct a song that works. I particularly like \\"The Night Comes Down\\", appreciating the mood changes, the flaminco guitar influenced part that starts the song, and the actual chord structure that plays upon a D variation. Great stuff, but not necessarily their best work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Footlocker, But Not Quite","review":"This item is not like what being sold years ago. Only one key is shipped instead of the normal 2 keys that are provided for door locks, padlocks, motor vehicles, etc. A cheap plastic lock is used instead of the older metal-style locks; so, why need a key at this point. It has 2 wheels built in to the bottom. Wheels may work for some suitcases but will they hold up well for the heavier load that a footlocker would normally hold for going to college. The item is made of a material that is not as strong as the older styles. There should really be a good handle on each side of the footlocker for carrying purposes instead of just one on the non-wheel side. I know after one year of use, I'll either have repairs to do or replace it with another one. This is one of the things where older ideas beat out newer ideas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good experience on verdian Macbeth","review":"I found this one unexpectedly but after looking at I can recommend it as a very good experience on Verdi's version of Macbeth.It attracted me specially because of stage direction of famous italian director Liliana Cavani, but I discovered many other points of attraction: specially an interesting stage conception (the mixing of dress styles, the onmipresence of chorus and the idea of theatre on theatre).Sylvie Valayre sings a great Lady, but it is Leo Nucci\`s performance that captured me, so great at his last aria.Some disappointing issues are a not so well light design (some scenes would be great with shadows and blue light rather that full light) and a weak Macbeth last fight with Macduff, but generally speaking is an enjoyable version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bravissimo","review":"I bought this for my husband for Christmas.

Also, the questions themselves are poorly done and include things like \\"find the Mickey Mouse ears in the still shot\\" rather than actual trivia questions. One might argue that this should be expected from a Disney/Children themed game, but even the Harry Potter edition of this game doesn't dumb it down so much.Nevertheless, this game was still fun to play. I would reccomend it for younger kids (under 13) and possibly families."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Disney Fun!","review":"This is a fun game for anyone who is a big Disney fan. We have the orginal Disney Scene It? game and this is a great addition. New movie clips from the latest movies. New trivia cards. It also includes 4 more game pieces to choose from. I would recommend this to the die hard Disney movie fans. It's lots of fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Awesome!","review":"Okay, I would've preferred more love scenes or something, but it was great, and it kept me on the edge of my seat.

The product was terrible. It didnt' smell like \\"beef\\" base and sure as heck didn't taste anything like \\"beef\\" base. In fact, it tasted terrible. Not bland (it is the low sodium version), just bad. The lower sodium version of Better Than Boullion, unfortunately, has more sodium than this one but it tastes SO much better. I'll have to go back to using that as this is just plain BAD."},{"rating":"2","title":"This beautiful vintage movie overflows with life","review":"\\"\`Calendar Girl' has a wonderfully constructed story, and I found it immensely entertaining. It has all the trimmings of musicals at their very best. I really loved the idyllic Broadway feel of this exuberant movie. This beautiful vintage movie overflows with life.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly crafted, -could have been so much better.","review":"I had such hopes for \\"Carved\\" as Tartan Asia Extreme is generally known for well written, well-constructed films and sadly, this one is neither of those. The story develops in an implausible manner, the scenes drag on and on and the characters do mindlessly stupid things. It is like someone watched a cheap American slasher film and copied its mindless structure. As an example, the one-dimensional characters do not seem to be able to defend themselves and just lie there like stage props appearing aghast for an eternity before entity claims them. The relentless focus on violence towards children is disturbing and must be reflective of a child abuse problem in Japanese culture that is not being addressed. The ending was a silly, predictable \\"slasher-film\\" ending clearly borrowed as the result of a lack of general creativity in the writing. Tartan Asia Extreme should be ashamed of this one. It is a real stinker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre at best","review":"In terms of special effects and effective moments of creepiness, it works fairly well. The depiction of Kuchisake Onna won't disappoint if you are familiar with the urban legend and have imagined her in your own mind's eye.However, and because we get a pretty good look at her early on in the movie, she ceases to appear so menacing. In my opinion, the mask shouldn't have come off until much later in the film, allowing the audience to build a sense of dread as to what's beneath.The pacing is uneven, sluggish at times, and the \\"twist\\" ending appears forced. In terms of running time, it could very well have ended 15 minutes earlier and wouldn't have made much of a difference."},{"rating":"1","title":"mediocre horror at best","review":"this was just ....ok.. nothing special. I have seen much better j-horror...at best this is only worth a rental...want to rent a good one get \\"Shutter\\"....now that one could put this to shame...."},{"rating":"1","title":"The story was suck!","review":"I choose to buy this film because it is one of the famous urban legend once in Japan and it arouse my interest to look at this \\"remake\\" version.To my disappointment, it try to create another new version that the Split mouth lady is a psychotic, and then turn into a ghost.No wonder this movie had not been shown in any theratre in Hong Kong."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Am I Pretty?\\" -A Creepy and Depressing Film","review":"Carved is a horror film about the legendary slit-mouthed woman. It's creepy and depressing, but it also has some flaws.I personally thought the story was engaging and powerful. If you're uncomfortable with violence towards children, then this movie will be effective towards you. There is also children death. This should be expected though, since the slit-mouthed woman abducts children. Her design was creepy and disturbing. She asks, \\"Am I Pretty?\\" often, and repeats \\"Aim for the neck\\". It's not the scariest movie but it is creepy. The acting and music was fine, as well.I did not like the ending, though; I felt it was a bit lackluster. There were also a couple of unanswered questions.Overall, I enjoyed it and highly recommend it. If you have Netflix Streaming, it is available as of 7/16/12.This movie has violence and blood (involving children). No nudity or sex."},{"rating":"2","title":"A creepy, moody, nasty movie.","review":"The bottom line here is that the mood is incredibly dark and unsettling, the subject matter is strange and disturbing, it is beautifully shot, and it leaves a chilling impression.

But the payoff is big if you will let it be."},{"rating":"2","title":"the slit-mouthed woman","review":"At first, i was not sure what to think about Koji Shiraishi's film, Carved: The Slit-Mouthed Woman. If you are a fan of Asian horror (and I know the craze is long gone for this genre), this is a film to see. I own tons of Asian horror films, and while most seem formula, this was not one of those. There was more dept to the storyline and history of the \\"long haired ghost woman\\". If you're not a fan/or unfamiliar with Asian horror, then this might not be the introduction or the film for you.I hope Koji Shiraishi gets more attention for his films. I find them better than most other Asian horror films. \\"Noroi\\" and \\"Ju-Rei\\" are his best works."},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked it","review":"If nothing else, now I know that rose is made from red grapes, but they take the skins out.

The music is excellent, and you have three soundtracks to choose from.

Chaos is the real deal when it comes to yoga, and I recommend this video to anyone who wants to perform their practice at home.

I'm confident that I'll know the basics for most of those small contacts with Italian-only speakers and I'll have a dictionary for more specifics.It is not specifically targeted for vacationers. It doesn't focus on standard tourist situations, which would have made it even more perfect.It was great for my needs! Very happy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good","review":"I have used these to develop my Italian and for review. there is nothing of course like being thrown into a country to learn the language, but this gets you prepped to do so. The only thing is YOU have to commit to it. You can't do one lesson wait a week then move on. The lessons are contingent on learning in levels, So you can't get through lesson 5 if you don't get through 1-4 etc..

I used them only in driving back and forth to work. I covered each lesson twice (sometimes 3 times) before going to the next. When we (wife and I) arrived in Italy, we had a lot of fun with this and the naturally warm people of Italy seemed to have fun with us. We weren't exactly ready to read Dante in the original language, but for the scope of what this program intends to do we had a great experience.If I had more use for the language than that of a tourist, I would like to go through then Pimsleur long course(s). This is a great way to learn a language. This is the best simulation of learning a language \\"naturally\\" that I have seen. The results were great and the pain was very low. Every word they teach is present in the context of use. There really is no rote memorization.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent Recording but No Written Material","review":"I like the recording very much.

There are more slow, melodic ballad types on here, which they pull off nicely.You'll hear a lot of people comparing this band to other bands, especially Joy Division. Now, I absolutely love Joy Division, but unless you're the band who invents a genre (like Joy Division did) you're more than likely going to resemble another band. Okay, so there are some similarities, but if I was in a band, I would most likely resemble my inspirations as well...Give the band a chance because they rock.

The album sounds like the previous album, but has none of the inspired lyrics or hooks.

Does anyone else hear the Big Country guitars in the songs like I do?? This is a great second album and the band is certainly not suffering from any sophomore slump. \\"An End Has A Start\\" sees the band beginning the maturing process. Sure, \\"The Back Room\\" was fantastic, if a bit one-dimensional. This album has many elements of \\"The Back Room\\", yet new sounds are creeping in there as well. I must add that these guys are a great live band too. The only comparison to U2 is that with a little time, they might be as big as U2 someday. Yes, they're that good and so is this album!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Very Impressive","review":"I'm reluctant to give any photographer a bad review, as I'm sure they put a lot of effort into their work. However, when you publish a book and ask people to buy it, you open yourself up to criticism. And since there are so many other Colorado picture books out there, I don't think that people should spend their money on this one. Most of the photographs in this book have the look and feel of images taken by an amateur photographer. The cover photo is pretty much representative of the entire book. It's a fairly boring, trite photograph with flowers in the foreground and mountains off in the distance. There is nothing interesting about this image, and there is almost nothing interesting about this book. If you are looking for a good Colorado picture book, I recommend taking a look at my list-mania list called Best Colorado Picture Books (by clicking on my name). I hope that this list is a good resource for anyone looking to buy a Colorado photography book."},{"rating":"1","title":"a waste of time and money!","review":"Very disappointing.

After about 10 minutes we decided to stop watching it and took it back to the shop. This DVD is extremely annoying because what I want to see is T Rex and not a load of people talking about how great T Rex were. Everytime they start showing a song one of the critics interrupt it, meaning you never get to see an entire song and rarely even get to see and hear 10 seconds. Worse still, the bits they do show are of a poor quality.We changed it for 'Born to Boogie' which I can recommend to any T Rex fan; a fantastic DVD in marvellous colour and sound!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit dull","review":"The video quality is no better than VHS. Obviously an older video was just slapped on DVD without menus or anything else.There are not enough \\"erotic\\" bits, and the ones that are here are too short. There's a long sequence showing a photo shoot, something I always find annoying (photographers don't seem to realize we're not interested in them).Ms. Wakana, though lovely, is not \\"voluptuous\\" and doesn't seem to come across all that well on video (probably the photographer's fault).In this series, I'd recommend the video of the curvaceous Haruki Mizuno.

It works great like on outside light fixtures, snowmobile exhaust parts, small auto rust spots,ect. It does take alot of air to operate. I have a 5 HP 30 gallon compressor but it won't keep up with the pressure needed, but will usually last through the sand the gun holds, and catches up while I refill the gun. Being gravity feed, it doesn't work pointed at upward angles (like car rocker panels) I bought the Black Blast media from Menard's and overall it's done the job, but it's best suited for the small job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic CD","review":"Dive was my second Sarah Brightman CD, and I really enjoyed it.

Save your money and buy \\"Eden\\" or The Webber Collection instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sarah Takes a Dive!","review":"Well, there's not too much I can say about this album that hasn't already been written. I only ordered this CD because I really like Sarah's stuff and it was on sale, despite all the bad reviews I had read about it. So, next time I'll be sure to pay attention to the reader comments a little better next time. This is one bad album. There is this nautical theme that runs throughout the whole disc. Why? If she were always singing about the sea that would be one thing, but it's like let's just throw this album out there and see what happens. There really isn't any redeeming quality to this CD. Some guys might get a big kick out of her see-through outfit in the cover of the CD, but that sure isn't enough reason to throw money away on this one. My advice... saves a couple of bucks and buy either \\"La Luna\\" or \\"Eden\\" if you don't already have them (which you really should because they are head and shoulders better than this one)."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing performance","review":"I became a devoted Sarah fan after hearing portions of \\"Time to Say Goodbye\\" being played in my favorite bookstore. I immediately began to collect some of her other offerings and found this one to be \\"unlistenable.\\" If you enjoy the pure tones of this delightful soprano, don't waste your money on this recording."},{"rating":"1","title":"Similar to Pavarotti singing rap.","review":"I bought this on-line & I really hate it! Sarah is a great talent but the material is pure tripe & the accompaniment is distracting & out of balance. The balance is so atrocious that anyone could be singing & it wouldn't make any difference. This album is so bad that I would never buy another album on-line unless I heard it first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Captain Nemo should have said \\"No way.\\"","review":"While Sarah's voice soars as usual and the musical accompaniment is often very strong, this record's inane grade school lyrics send it to the bottom of the sea. Save your money and buy \\"Eden\\" or The Webber Collection instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"sarah brightman is the best!!","review":"I thought this is one of her best cd's she's ever done.I recomend this if you liked Eden."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bummer","review":"I was so looking forward to this cd...since it has sarah brightman with dreadlocks and looking so different, but the music on this cd is horrible. Her singing is always great but the songs are dull and there isn't a single catchy tune on the whole cd. I loved \\"time to say goodbye\\" and \\"eden\\" but this cd falls WAY short. Don't buy it. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Sarah Brightman I know and love","review":"I bought this CD because I love Sarah Brightman, and because it got good reviews, but I was very disappointed. I chalk it up to taste, because obviously a lot of people like this CD. All I can say it if you are expecting the Sarah Brightman of classical cross-over, you will be disappointed. This is her attempt at pop, and I am just not appreciative of it. Give me \\"Classics\\", \\"Time to Say Goodbye\\" and \\"Eden\\" and leave this one in the store. I'm not giving it one star out of respect for Sarah Brightman, and because I can't believe I would buy a one-star CD. :-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so Good","review":"I am a big fan of Sarah's but this is the worst album she has done. I was very disappointed but look forward to hearing her next album. If you are looking for \\"Eden\\" type songs, don't bother with this cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Colourless and unimaginative","review":"While Sarah Brightman does possess a considerable voice range, it's essentially a small and fragile voice. The tone is colourless and her interpretation unimaginative. After listening to this CD twice, I've no intention to hear it again. A vastly overrated singer."},{"rating":"1","title":"diva takes a dive","review":"This cd is a waste of money, If I had not heard brightman sing some of webers music, I would think she could not sing.this cd is bland coated with dull. save your money"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great listening music","review":"If you are a Brightman fan, this is must have CD. You get to hear soft modern pop music that only Brightman can sing. It's the melding of classical vocals with pop theme music. What are you waiting for. ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't judge an album by its cover!","review":"I must confess I was scared off by the (I hate to say it) gosh-AWFUL cover art (front AND back covers). Just goes to show that it's just as important to choose art attractive to the eye! I finally decided to get it because I was suffering from Brightman withdrawl and took the plunge, as it were. Was I glad I did! This album could easily compete with any of the modern pop singers these days. By the way, if the cover bothers you, too, just find another photo to replace the cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a Dive for me !!","review":"I'm sorry to say that after reading others reviews here I bought this cd. I have others of Sarah Brightman's works and her voice is mature and clear. This did nothing for me. No excitement. No tingles with her voice levels as with others she has done like Eden. There was such a lack of maturity in this and the choice of songs were boring. Of course this is my own opinion but I would have to say : if it is a first time listener to Sarah...don't get this one...try another one like Eden or Surrender...or others......this does no justice to her voice, quality or range...it's just not her at all !!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Just a Broadway or Classical Performer!","review":"Sarah Brightman may be best known for her role as Christine in Phantom of the Opera, but her vocal talents expand far beyond musicals and classical performances, as her pop album \\"Dive\\" superbly proves.Nautically inspired, the album offers such beautiful and memorable tracks as \\"The Second Element\\" and \\"Captain Nemo.\\" Unlike many albums today, nearly every song on the CD is worth listening to repeatedly. Fans of Sarah's other work (such as \\"La Luna\\") will find this album quite a treasure indeed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sea of Harmony","review":"A very thorough album, with references to water and nature all over the tracks. Sarah's voice is extraordinarily suited to these themes, and the album sports an all around solid production, at times reminiscent of Broadway."},{"rating":"2","title":"The magic of Sarah and Frank Peterson","review":"This not the first colaberation of Sarah and Frank, but it is a must for the Sarah collector and a great example what these two most talented people can do. They write or co-write most of the songs on this album and we get a glimpse of who these people really are. Four to six songs on this album will be among your most favorite group of Sarah's music. This album is more a pop style than a classical such as her \\"Time To Say Goodby\\". This album is a bit more like \\"Eden\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very relaxing","review":"This was my first experience of a pop Sarah. All the other cds I own and have heard have been either classical or Andrew Lloyd Webber type songs. But I have to say I really do like this album. All the songs have a \\"water\\" theme, and with the soft synthesizers and haunting vocals, this makes for a very relaxing album. Highly recommended for fans of Sarah, or anyone who loves great music. And the booklet includes all lyrics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Check List-Keep track of your coins","review":"This book allows the beginning coin collector to easily keep track of their coins.

Obvious observations intermixed with vapid posturing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much respect for 'Respect'","review":"I just received this album in the mail yesterday; the last time I'd heard it, was 5 and a half years ago on tape...the tape got mangled by the machine and that was that. Robyn Hitchcock has never sung a note in his life...and yet, if he'd never started making records, we'd all be the poorer for it. My fave track is probably 'Railway Shoes'; I love singing harmony with that song. Second fave would be 'Driving Aloud (Radio Storm)'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing thoughts from a whale","review":"It may sound crazy that this book is from the perspective of a whale, but it is extremely insightful and touching. The whale is recalling his life and the lives of other whales through mental pictures and sounds. He thinks about his kind and their experiences with whalers, other species like dolphin, sharks, etc. and deals with how terribly dangerous humans can be. In a cool twist we also get the thoughts of a soldier on a Russian sub that is trapped, much like the fate of the Russian sub earlier this year. This book is amazing. It once again convinced me of our actions and what we do and don't do and how it can drastically change the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great youth novel","review":"Looking for an interesting book for middle/high school students to read that are interested in sea life. Not the best for factual information, but a good, interesting read for students."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soundings","review":"This is a most thoughtful and well written book I've read. The relationship between whales and mad is described from the whales point of view. The submarine is a well discussed important part of this novel. This is well worth the 3 hrs to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"New appreciation for whales","review":"It's hard to tell how much is based on science and how much is fantasy. Either way, I have a new appreciation for the intelligence and reasoning power/communication skills of whales. The book was an easy read, but emotionally it was difficult, as a bittersweet ending was assured from the beginning. Still, I will never again scoff at the mention of \\"whale watching expeditions,\\" nor will I roll my eyes in boredom when I hear an audio recording of whales communicating. They deserve much respect, and this book instilled that in me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great tool to get in those places that are hard to reach","review":"This is a great little set of bits to get in those places that a screwdriver or a full size hex tool can not get to. It can take a lot of torque with out breaking, the only problem I have with the set is that the bits are numbered and do not have the sizes on them, it would be nice if they were stamped with the size so you knew you are grabbing a metric tip instead of a standard."},{"rating":"2","title":"curtains...","review":"The curtains were just a bit more rust color than burgundy but still nice and very good quality, great item for the cost."},{"rating":"2","title":"Answering the basic questions","review":"I picked up Vickie Farris' book on a whim and laughed and cried my way through it. Farris' very personal book touches on the subjects of curriculae and scheduling, but if that's where you're at, there are probably better, more detailed reading materials out there. This book deals with the step before that; the point where you feel maybe home schooling is for you, but you're lacking confidence that you have what it takes to do it. Farris lets you follow the path that took her to where she is, a home schooling mother with 10 kids (3 of which are now adults!). Her honesty, vulnerability, and straightforwardness is very encouraging and moved me from being terrified to being excited about home schooling our son. Couldn't have done it without her!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"If you're looking for a resourceful read for homeschooling moms, keep looking, this is NOT it. Especially the chapter on keeping our homes as well as teaching our children, Mrs. Farris' answer to that question is to hire a housekeeper as she does. If my husband were an attorney, like hers, that may be a solution, but in the real world, HS care for their homes themselves, we can't afford to have someone else do it for us. We are looking for real answers and real solutions, not just hiring someone else to do the job God gave us as wives and mothers. So if you need hard answers to keeping organized with homes and children that are HS, don't waste your money on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kohler faucet","review":"Wanted an upgrade from the cheap faucets the builder put in.

I'd say the artist was trying to appeal to children with his cartoonish style, but then every few pages you get this over the top gross scene of someone getting torn into bits with gore guts and blood. (it's all black gray and white). This is part one but I've really no interest in wasting my time with the 2nd part.

Our only regret is that he didn't include \\"famous blue raincoat\\" or \\"joan of arc\\" or maybe \\"because of a few songs\\". Leonard sings poetry. I can't describe it in any other way.

Absolutely a treasure to own. With this concert DVD I got soooo much more then I had expected. The music, instrumentals and impressionisms are outstandingly Leonard Cohen. Well worth the few dollars I paid for it. Better then front row seats at the actual concert!Live In London"},{"rating":"2","title":"Live in London","review":"Leonard Cohen has always been a unique performer. Sort of an enigma in real life with a talent that cannot be denied. Live in London filmed on July 17, 2008 at the O2 Arena presents the man at his very best.Performing witha spot on nine member band and looking a very dapper 75 years young, Cohen gives a very appreciative audience a performance that served as a great retrospective of his now four decades plus career. Filmed in closeups that focus on the band and not on the audience by Edward Sanders, Cohen is in top form as he performs standards like Bird on a Wire, Everybody Knows,Hallelujah, I'm Your Man, and Closing Time. There is not one slow moment in the entire two hour and thirty nine minute performance.This is a show that was well worth waiting for and well worth purchasing. The only DVD extra is a copy of the song lyrics but really that is all that was needed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Concert","review":"If you are a follower of one of the greatest composer/singers of any generation, then this DVD is a must!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous !!","review":"Am so happy I purchased this video.

The video is very good, considering that it is a largely static subject (a band on a stage). The problem is the audio: there's a constant echo.

I was definitely sweating, and I also felt a good bit of endorphins towards the end. I love Ms. McGee, and will buy pretty much anything she puts out.

It is fresh, lively, funny, soulful and it makes you want to dance. Gene Harris plays the piano as energetically as ever, accompanied by the Three Sounds and what sounds to my ears like someone blowing the meanest, funkiest, brashest and most insolent jazz kazoo you can ever imagine! I have over 10,000 straight-ahead and bebop jazz mp3's on my drive, and this is my favorite one right now. This song should be our national anthem. The tragedy is that \\"Put On Train\\" was released on a Blue Note vinyl LP album (\\"Gene Harris / The Three Sounds\\" - Blue Note BST 84378) which was never re-issued as a CD. Finally, beware of the live version of \\"Put On Train\\" featured on the CD \\"Live at the IT Club - Volume 2\\", which is a good performance but IT LACKS THE KAZOO!

This album is breath-taking vocally, musically, & lyrically. Dina Caroll has a voice that is of a true diva, powerful but can be gentle & smoothing and never showy like Celine Dion's or Mariah Carey's voices. She appears to have been influenced by Taylor Dayne and Laura Branigan beacuse of the album material ranging from adult-comtemporary-soul tracks like \\"Escaping\\" etc. and soulful club/dance tracks like \\"Special Kind of Love\\" etc. A must have for those who appreciate music of substance not just style."},{"rating":"2","title":"3 words","review":"\\"CANDY LOVER'S \\"CRACK\\"\\" THIS STUFF IS AWESOME!!!!!!!I DON'T EVEN MIND PAYING $3 A TIN FOR IT."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brookmeyer & Friends","review":"This album is beautiful.

There's nothing commercial at all about the first track. Because it's in a major key?It's almost like a folk song, soulful and groovy. And nothing else on the album is really very commercial at all. This is jazz! And jazz at it's best.I recommend this to anybody who likes great music.

The story of a Scottish immigrant who uncovers a planned mass uprising has a stirring climax. Although the book has a \\"white man's burden\\" tone at times, the writer makes clear his admiration for John Laputa, the (black) clergyman who plans to cleanse South Africa by purging it of whites."},{"rating":"2","title":"Prester John","review":"My grade 8 teacher read this book to my class 48 years ago (I can't believe that number).

The journey these two fractured souls take is similiar to that of many in the Post Civil War world. Dreams died on the battlefield and afterwards. Alongside the story of Jake and Shannon run several others- Jake's forgotten sister, Jenny, who is fighting to keep her home and Grace's, a woman carrying an illegitmate child and many fears. Somehow, all these seemingly unrelated stories come together, but not without a price. The many shifts and plots tend to make it feel fractured and confusing for the most part.Free will doesn't mean you choose what happens to you, just how you react to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Compelling read with poor conclusion","review":"This book is a short easy read. At the start it is very interesting and pulls you in. However, towards the end the book takes turns with little reasoning behind them. For example, the main character Kerry suddenly declares her love for Ethan. Throughout the book an attraction was described but at the end it just jumps to love? However because she refuses to become a vampire and he refuses to become human (which is odd b/c apparently you can go back and forth in this book) they decide to part and never speak again....what type of love is that? I guess both characters have never heard of being friends before. Overall I felt that details just materialized in this book without explanations and the ending was very incomplete."},{"rating":"1","title":"I kept thinking it was going to get better, but....","review":"I love to read YA fantasy, and was told this book was different but still good. As I read I kept thinking it was going to get better, that something juicy was right around the corner.

I read this book for a Teen Literature class. Although the story was interesting and there was a good deal of suspense, the characters were flat and not well developed with the exception of the main charactrer Kerry. This would be a good read for someone looking for a little thrill without much substance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dated","review":"Unfortunately, in the light of recent series and publications about relationships with vampires--not the least of which is TWILIGHT by Stephanie Meyer--this novel by Vivian Vande Velde comes up lacking. First published in 1995, the book's plotline takes nearly a hundred pages to really get moving as the main character tries to wrestle with what the readers have known before opening the book: Ethan is a vampire.Though the narration is believable and easy to read, the plot takes too long to get going, ensuring some readers will never finish. The author clearly has talent; perhaps in the 1990's, her Kerry Nowicki stories were engaging. In the 2000's, they have too much competition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Five stars?! Are you serious?","review":"I read alot of books and alot of them are with vampires and this book to me just sucked. I am though a romance at heart though so i prefer to have a more or less happy ending and this was definatly not one. Vampires can be killed by sunlight.. couldnt you be alittle more creative? And most people, or for me atleast, the main attraction for vampire novels is the overall great romance that comes along with them, i.e Twilight (had to say it), Vampire Academy, Glass Houses, ect. and Companions of the Night definatly didnt have it. The ending sucked... simple. It might have been good back then but compared to all the books now.. this one doesnt even compete."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!","review":"This is by far the worst book I have ever experienced. The characters were flat, the plot was almost nonexistent, and overall, there was nothing to recommend this book to a reader. The book had no element or romance, action, or fantasy. It was just 175 pages of nothing. Again, this book has no redeeming qualities. I strongly recommend no one reads it."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent young adult book","review":"I'm sorry I didn't read this book sooner. This book has a highly original plot and characters. I enjoyed the mystery that surrounded Ethan, and how Van Velde never revealed the truth about him. To any teenager and adolescent, I recommend this book. It is a solid story that won't leave you disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cinematic Entertainment","review":"Companions of the Night will always be a favorite of mine. It is a page-turner and the characters aren't just the usual two-dimensional stereotypes you usually find in vampire books. In fact, the story was wonderfully original--well, at least I couldn't think of anything similar--and there weren't any angsty, dark-makeup-wearing vampires here.It played like a movie in my mind, and Kerry is a sort of everygirl...she has characteristics I could really identify with. I really, really loved Ethan though. He was intelligent, mysterious, mocking...he made a wonderful character, one that you know you probably shouldn't side with but can't help falling in love with anyway. Marsala as a villain was a bit weak to me, but the fact that he was just your average man trying to do what he felt was right was quite realistic.And I think that's what draws a lot of people into CotN...you almost feel as if this could happen without your knowing. And who knows? Maybe it has. ;)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to read in one sitting","review":"It is easy to see why this book is an award winner. Right from the beginning Kerry, the teen antagonist, is thrown into the realm of not one, but two vampires. When she rescues Ethan from three ruthless men who claim he is a vampire...she does not believe in vampires. She is soon shocked by the hatred generated by a mysterious man who kidnaps her family because he believes Kerry is a vampire as well. Kerry can only trust Ethan, vampire or not. The reader is often as unsure as Kerry when unexpected events unfold. This novel contains suspense, romance, and violence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still an excellent story","review":"Somewhere in the archives of reviews for this book is one I wrote with my best freind 5 years ago. After all this time I still enjoy reading \\"Companions of the Night\\" even though I'm not really obsessed with vampire stories. I think this is because of Vivian Vande Velde's writing which is realistic poingant and above all captivating. She knows how to bring a story to life.As for a possible sequel I think VVV kept the ending open for the reader's imagination not to write a second story. Also the more I think about it, (and well the older I get) I tend to think that Kerry and Ethan would not work out on account of the fact that he's a cold, callous manipulativ [person]"},{"rating":"2","title":"Vampires!!","review":"This book is good, but the author is in no rush to get the plot rapped up!

They believe he is a vampire, but to the girl, he looks innocent. She helps him escape, but when he drives her home, her dad and brother are gone. He says if she helps him, he'll help her find her dad and brother...This is the beginning of a dangerous and exciting adventure...it will be impossiblle for you to put this book down!

Sure it has its thrills, but it was awful. I always look for new books to read. So I decided to look for opinions online and I found this book. Of course the only reason I was looking was because I was bored stiff. I love stories about vampires. The authors I love to read are Amelia Atwater-Rhodes and J. K. Rowling. Its hard enough to wait for their books to come out. So I always look for new books to read. I liked Kerry and Ethan a little I guess. The fact that Vande Velde vampires can be killed by the sun bores me. I prefer the knife in the heart way. All am saying is that I hated this book, but thats my opinion. So don't let my opinion stop you from buy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vampires and kidnapers and teenagers, oh my!","review":"My sister first recommended that I read this book, and though I was skeptical of vampire weirdo books, I did. And I enjoyed it, alot. I was surprised at the twists and turns in the plot. It was quite interesting, and I can honestly say that it is not your average spoofy vampire story. It was funny, frightening, suspenseful and even a little romantic. Just what a novel should be. I wouldn't call it horror, I'd call it fiction. Very enjoyable fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"This is one of the best Vampire books I've ever read. It's nice to see a Vampire totally at peace with himself.

Certainly not the best vampire story out there (or romance story for that matter). The characters could have been more developed. I never felt I truly knew what Kerry, the main character, was feeling. By the end of the novel that fact became infuriating. I found the plot interesting enough, but the ending?!? That's what makes a damn novel! And this one was truly dissapointing. It didn't wrap things up, just kind of left you there breathless, desperately searching for more pages that weren't there, thinking over and over \\"is that really how it ends?\\" Perhaps some find the ending \\"realisitic\\" but I found it gravely unbefitting. But, I give it props for having an original outlook on vampires.

Wooden acting, dull stories, and voice-overs from Loken that are horrible.

Unfortunately the stories miss the point. There is an ongoing plot line that had my interest through ought but some episodes were too pointless for the plot line.One of the reasons I was excited about this show was because it had the lovely Kristanna Loken as Jane, maybe it was the character she was playing but it looked like she plumped up before this series and was in need of some Jenny Craig.The acting was OK but you could tell by the third episode why this show only lasted one season. Too bad because there was a good idea behind the story, I think this show was doomed by the unimaginative writers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible movie","review":"Had heard some hype about this movie, but the actual movie is nowhere as bad as this documentary.

All of the recipes have been tested and proven and ingredients and cooking instructions are listed for both 19th and 21st centuries.Of course this book would be an excellent resource for anyone that likes to cook but would also be a great reference for anyone in school that needs information about foods and their origins.This is not just a recipe book for 19th century cooking but is pertinent for today's busy cooks.

They rereleased Frozen as a digipak and have added bonus tracks! They did four cover songs and have accomplished a great deal by making them as fresh and new as the original recording artists. The album was amazing to begin with. The somber mood and depressing lyrics make you feel the agony that convinced them to write the material. Songs like burn, drown together, the suicider, for the love i bear, one with misery tell the tale of heartbreak and desire. Along with these they added House of the rising sun, which i feel is the stand out track of the new material included here. Along with that they arranged the original song order and it feels like a whole new composition when you hear it.

It merely teaches that the big and strong can dominate the small and weak. This is not a lesson I want to teach my son. Intentionally inflicting pain upon a child is barbaric and to present this as a Godly way to parent is an abomination.My copy of this book has already been deposited right where it belongs-- in the recycling bin!

They will not learn to behave because it is the right thing to do/pleasing to god; they will, instead, learn to behave because they are afraid of you. They will learn that they cannot trust their emotions and that it is indulgent to meet their needs.

Don't buy this product if you want a reliable humidifying system that will last longer than a month."},{"rating":"1","title":"Honeywell home wrecker","review":"This piece of junk just cupped my floorboards with a leak I can't locate, so I've thrown it out after 2 weeks! During those 2 weeks, it was LOUD, despite its name. Don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expensive disposable unit","review":"Filter elements are expensive and only last 2 to 3 weeks. The fan stopped working when less than a year old. The unit cycled off/on repeatedly when moderately cold (35 deg F). It's a poor design with an underpowered blower. Do not buy; it's junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE","review":"I have to buy one of these pieces of crap every single year. This one is no exception. No matter where you buy these things, nobody stocks the filters. Have to order them online.No biggie. After 1 year using it during the winter the fan starts making all types of noise. Not only that but from day 1 the thing seems to work, however it blows the moisture out of the bottom, so it basically humidifies the floor of the room and not the room. Excellent design Honeywell.Honeywell, Holmes and all the rest of them should do the world a favor and STOP MAKING PRODUCTS THAT DON'T WORK.DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF RUBBISH!!!We still wake up with stuffed noses, and chapped skin. THE PRODUCT DOES NOT WORK.I'll be looking at the sharper image humidifier that actually blows out a mist you can see. This thing does not. This thing is an absolute POFS!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"MOLD!!! MOLD!!! MOLD!!!","review":"This is a stupid, idiotic design shared by the whole line of these products. The fan sucks humid air through the fan turbine and the parts of the machine that are not accessible for cleaning. In a couple of months of use mold grows all over the inside, including the fan turbine blades. De-molding it is nearly impossible. So, great, now instead of breathing dry clean air you breathe moist air with mold spores.All the fancy stuff they add to fight germs (UV light, ProTec cartriges) are a joke -- it does not help a bit.I just cant figure out why the designers did not reverse the air flow, so that humid air goes through fewer parts so that when mold grows you can clean in easily."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many 1 star reviews to buy this","review":"I take all the reviews very seriously and after reading them I will not be buying this product. I hope the manufacturer reads all these and realizes that I'm not alone in making this decision. Make a better product and make it in the USA!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not good","review":"One bad thing vents point down ward instead of up and out, I need the humidity in the air not on the floor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good, smells horrible","review":"We have went through many humidifiers. We thought this one was a good one. It smells horrible, like moldy feet. We clean it regularly and change the filter, yet just after a few days it begins to smell. We are done using humidifiers after this one. I just want my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad product, equally bad warrenty","review":"This product worked fine the first winter, but when I took it out of storage the 2nd season, the fan would blow air but as soon as you hit the humidity button the unit turned off. I tried several days blowing air only but the water level did not go down, so it was not adding humidity to the room. I called the customer service number on the box and was told my house must be over 95% humidity, and was told I had to pay the return shipping for them to verify this units condition. As the cost of the return is close to the cost of this unit, needless to say I will not be buying another Honeywell product anytime soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lasted only 1 winter","review":"We bought this in January of 2011 and used it through the rest of couple months in the winter and it did work fine with no noise as such. Then we had to put it aside for 7-8 months and have started using it for couple of months now. It started with a creeky weird noise and after a few weeks is now totally dead. Not sure why??? Will have to call the customer care to get it replaced.Will definitely not recommend to buy this product. Worthless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fan Failure","review":"The fan motor will fail. It is a cheap \\"Made in China\\" product with inferior materials. I had one and I will not buy another, not until they update the fan motor."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY","review":"I bought this product in April of 2011, and this morning (March 2012) it just stopped working. The light wasn't on, there was plenty of water, but it just wasn't working, no matter what I tried. When I first got it, it was quiet, and before it broke it was really loud like a speeding car or an airplane. Not worth it for only 11 months."},{"rating":"1","title":"too loud","review":"works good and could tell a difference in the air quality. but it is too loud!!! my 2 year old is so scared of it that i have to run it while he is not in the room. definately not quiet compared to the smaller models. so disappointed that i cannot run it all night in my son's room."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish it would have lasted!","review":"We've had this brand of humidifier before. I automatically replaced it with the same brand. This one has only lasted two months. First got noisy and then failed. I wish they would make it better because I liked the large tank and filling was easy. Now I don't know what I'm going to do!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"JUNK","review":"This was my second unit. The first one lasted 2 seasons. This unit only 1. In both cases the fan died. I've learned my lesson. JUNK!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great but short lived....","review":"Loved this humidifier - easy to fill compared to other units. A little loud but did the job great, this is actually the 2nd identical humidifier I bought - the first one's motor wore out after two years and just stopped - no rhyme or reason. Well folks, this one did the same thing just this week. Incredibly disappointed in how things are made these days.I hope you read this review before you buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great for watering the floor","review":"Bought this attractive unit with high expectations only to be let down hard.This unit is completely non-functional unless you keep it in a bathtub and refill it twice a day. You know how gravity works right? Use your head and follow the flow path. Water on top -- air outlet on bottom. Set it on the floor the first time I used it and not more than 30 minutes later there was a large puddle from all of the water that comes spitting out of the outlet once the wick is saturated.There's nothing quiet about it. Maybe quiet compared to a box fan or a cheap dishwasher but its not something you'd want to share a room with. Further still the UV filtration is a total gimmick. If you open it you will find the tiny little bulb inside. Looks good if you've never seen an actual UV sterilizer. I have one for our aquarium and it must be 50 times larger. Positives? Well it sure did come in a pretty box and looked great before I turned it on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Humidifier I've Ever Owned","review":"I've owned many humidifiers over the years and this one is by far the worst. I eventually returned it to the store and here are the reasons why: 1) Even on high, it struggled to keep my average size bedroom humid enough. 2) At least twice it started to leak from the back for absolutely no reason. Once when it happened, it wasn't even running. 3) The moist air coming from the bottom caused the carpet to be continually moist and eventually stinky, but maybe this was leakage I just wasn't seeing when it happened. 4) Almost every time I put the tank back after filling it, a spray/mist of water came out the front and again, onto the carpet. 5) The filters got smelly way faster than normal. I have nothing good to say about this humidifier and Honeywell should be ashamed of themselves for not testing their design better. I now own a Holmes humidifier."},{"rating":"2","title":"complete colored pencil book","review":"wanted to know how to handle colored pencils for portraits . I really like the demonstrations in the book for flesh tones and drawing hair. It helps to see the realism for portraits and other subjects that a person would like to draw.

It said how great the book was and the person was speaking after purchasing a decent amount of books.Well if I read a little further I would have read the negative one saying this book offers nothing.THIS BOOK OFFERS NOTHINGIt is just eye candy and not very much of it. All you see are pencil pictures and comments about them. This book teaches you nothing. It doesn't even go over how to do anything!! It just shows you pictures of what it is it is showing ex: this is a sample of texture.Ok I knew that, but how did that happen? I wasn't looking for step by step although sometimes that helps out a lot.This book was a complete waste.Don't bother"},{"rating":"1","title":"Little Substance in This Book","review":"I have a personal library of over twenty books on colored pencil and unfortunately, this is the weakest book I own on the topic. There is very little on technique and there is a general lack of substance. If you are looking for an overview on colored pencil, there are far better books available. One that comes to mind is Exploring Colored Pencil by Sandra Angelo. And if you are looking for technique or practical information this book simply doesn't cut it."},{"rating":"2","title":"a \\"Complete\\" review","review":"I purchased this book because of a recommendation from the Ann Kullberg ezine. I found the book good for beginners by explaining the various pencils and papers, drawing tools, and studio space. It was also good for intermediate artists by explaining advanced techniques and and tips. But as usual I found I wanted more information. The color examples were excellent on showing a specific look and I enjoyed the author's easy to read style."},{"rating":"1","title":"A repeat of his other book","review":"I was so excited to get this book. Extremely disappointed when it arrived! Most of the illustrations were from his other book. New cover and not much more. I paid good money for the same thing I already had! Pictures are worth a thousand words, such a disappointment-- won't purchase any of his books again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kind of a Yawner...","review":"Well-crafted pop songs but where's the quirkiness that I've come to know and love in Bent over their past two full-length recordings? Their kitschy samples were what separated them from the millions of other ambient, downtempo, and, dare I say it, adult contemporary bands out there. Now it's just all seeming like so much of the other fluffy, Enya ripoff schlock that's on the market these days. Haven't picked up the 'Flavour Country' EP yet but after giving this one several serious hard listenings, I'm a bit hesitant to do so...."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little love!","review":"This is a great album. I have loved Bent since the beginning. The emotion you've come to expect from Bent is evident in every track and have obviously not lost the ability put you push you into a warm sleepy summery mood. I'll admit that this album took longer to grow on me than the others, but give it time, and you too will see that Bent is back.
