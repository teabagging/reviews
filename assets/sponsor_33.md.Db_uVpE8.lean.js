It is not Kettle Corn - not even close. This is a caramel corn with a thick sweet coating. Real Kettle Corn is a slightly sweet, slightly salty popcorn.Second, each very small bag has 1.5 servings in it. When was the last time you opened a small bag of snack food and only ate 2/3's of it? They purposely made the serving size unrealistic to make it look healthier. The whole point of paying for individual size bags is that it limits you to a set portion. Remember when a can of Coke had 1.5 servings in it? The FDA made them change the label. If you eat the whole bag, you are eating 200 calories of popcorn. No better that a bag of potato chips or a few cookies, so this is not a lesser evil - it's just the same old junk food with a new name.I won't buy this product again. It's the same stuff you can get anywhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Being Evil is Fun...","review":"Delightful popcorn mix which is great for snacks and is a really nice treat for lunches.

The stories are only short anecdotes and many of them aren't even a page long. A reader could finish the entire book in under three hours. It's not very satisfying, either. It doesn't reveal much that fans haven't already heard about, nor does it discuss anything in depth. It offers little more than a small collection of cute factoids and famous quotes. There are also some mistakes. One of the most glaring is the description of the front cover photograph containing Leafs' Ponikarovsky and Senators' Magnus Arvedson. The description says the picture is of Mario Lemieux and Nevin Reid. I'd recommend this book to any fourth grade hockey lover with a book report due the next day. For rest of us, this bone offers hardly any marrow."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice collection of vignettes about hockey","review":"Folks who know me or follow my posts realize that I read a lot of books about hockey. A LOT.Dan Diamond's \\"Hockey Stories On and Off the Ice\\" is a nice read. The stories aren't very deep or very long, BUT they're a nice selection of tidbits across more than 100 years of hockey. (Most are about professional hockey, but not all.) I'd heard most of these before - I've been collecting and reading about the topic for around 40 years! - BUT the telling was still pleasant and a nice reminder, and there were STILL a few that I'd never heard before.Give it a read. You can pick it up, put it down for awhile, then pick up right where you left off, and while that might not be an endorsement of \\"literature\\", it means that a book like this achieved its aim."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoughtful, descriptive.

I felt that the characters were undeveloped and uninteresting. The plot lacks the 'spice' that makes you want to rush home to read more. It was interesting to see how the characters lives were going to come toghether but the book was so slow moving I ended up not caring as much. The only thing positive that I can say was that Cunningham writes well, I just wish he had written something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boy I'm glad I'm finished reading this book","review":"No fancy verbiage here, only helpful info for other average, avid readers, that don't have bachelors, masters or PhDs in English or Literature, who read to relax and enjoy. Probably the majority of us.This book was extremely confusing and totally lacked continuity until the last dozen or so pages. Have you ever dropped your book and lost the page you were on, then picked it up and started reading in the wrong place? That's what it was like reading this book!So much space was wasted by the author displaying his vocabulary, and supersaturating the reader with descriptions that added little to the story.I am surprised by the high ratings by other reviewers."},{"rating":"1","title":"A sheer waste of time","review":"I got this book just for the hype. Remind me not to do that again.What were these characters? You don't even feel them and the book ends. Wow!!

It refers to homosexuality alot, so if you are offended by such content you should find a different book.

That they should have been created when their pitiful self-loathing is detailed at such tedious length and with such loving skill is altogether another matter. Many people have praised this book judging by the reviews but I found it's characters' total lack of redeeming qualities nauseating and predictable over and again. The lack of plot was forgiveable as I had read one of his previous books. I imagine I would have avoided this book like the plague had the cover hinted, not so much at it's prizewinning genius, but more accurately at it's narcissistic 'hipper than thou' self hating monotony.

The author clearly thinks many/most are barely clinging on to their sanity, going through life faking it, and living day to day looking for a way out. No joy of living here. Life is a *****. A Pulitzer? Jeez! Prozac for one and all. Get a life. ENJOY life rather than read about mopers who spend time inching flower pots around on coffee tables to get just the right effect or contemplate what might have been rather than taking what life has dealt you and giving it your best shot.

But ultimately he failed, in my opinion. Just as I began settling down with one character and thinking of her perspective, there would be an immediate and abrupt jump back to another character. As a result, I felt a lack of connection and also a lack of sympathy, for any of the 3 women. Each was interesting in her own way, but there just wasn't the time to mentally bond with any single one of them. While it was an interesting literary technique, I found myself losing interest in the book half way through and had to force myself to finish it, which is unusual for me. All the hype didn't help as it heightens ones expectations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Coffee House Blues","review":"When I read, I hear the voice of the narrator in my mind. As I read \\"The Hours\\", the voice I heard was that of a \\"pretentious offbeat hippie\\", putting on airs in a coffee house of the 60's. My impressions may have been intended by the author, since much of his tale describes characters of the period, who populated the coffee houses of New York's Greenwich Village and the Near North side of Chicago of my own youth. That the author was a Pulitzer Prize winner surprised me. The book dragged initially, and I found myself wondering how one could make a movie of it. It is definitely not my cup of tea."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful read","review":"I really loved this book..I had just finished reading two very disappointing books and to read such a treasure was wonderful...I went out and bought Mrs. Dalloway by Virginia Woolfe as well as Mr. Cunningham's two other Novels and am looking forward to reading them all...I plan on reading The Hours again."},{"rating":"2","title":"I wish it was much longer","review":"The revelations in this book, combined with a comforting empathy and confident prose, combine to make \\"The Hours\\" into an eye-clearing experience.I've just finished it, and can't imagine concentrating on other works of fiction.A truly seminal experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"oddly compelling","review":"This book was oddly compelling and one of the best books I've read in a long time. Not much happens, yet every time I put the book down, I couldn't wait to pick it back up again. Contrary to other reviews here, I did not find the writing pretentious. I thought the writing was direct as much as it was poetic, precise and uncomplicated. The ideas are deeply layered, the overall effect absorbing. If you haven't read Mrs. Dalloway, I recommend doing so (or even watching the movie) before you read The Hours. The experience will be much richer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Echoes of Mrs. Dalloway, but more and less.","review":"I read \\"The Hours\\" and \\"Mrs. Dalloway\\" back to back and found \\"Dalloway\\" breathtaking and \\"Hours\\" a great read in its own right. I think it's really unfair to try to compare them, though Cunningham certainly invites the comparison. I found the principal characters of \\"Hours\\" quite interesting, the story line(s) fascinating, and the prose very expressive. Although I really love this book, I found one bit of geographic sloppiness very distracting: an early scene (p.50) describes an event occuring in lower Manhattan at the corner of Spring and MacDougal Streets. No such corner exists. I suspect the author had in mind either Prince and MacDougal or Spring and Sullivan."},{"rating":"2","title":"A dead-on evocation of the intertwined lives of three women","review":"This book moved me to tears more than once. The power of this author's writing comes through not only in his brilliant ending but in his understanding of the hearts and souls of the novel's three women - Laura Brown, Clarissa Dalloway, and the inimitable Virginia Woolf herself. At times I had to stop reading because I felt as if Michael Cunningham's grasp of these womens' souls was so true that it was almost eery. He writes elliptically of the shadow lives that many of us feel are out there - the lives we might be living had we not answered that one phone call, chosen that certain dress, turned down that street instead of this one. He is one of the few writers I trust completely; he puts his own soul on the line in his graceful, beautiful fiction and, consequently, he cuts to the heart of what it means to be human."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"I would agree with the reviewer who found the writing style contrived. Worse than that, I found the book to be misogynistic. I realize it is supposed to be a feminist book, of sorts, but it was far from that. Despite a common thread of bizarre and annoying self-importance, all of the female characters in the book were sexually ambiguous, all were hopelessly tied to a lover of some sort, and seemed to feel little if any control over their own lives.I understand this is a book about three women of separate times, \\"connected\\" by their similarities, but the (perhaps unintended) effect was to show women in general as unhappy, hand-wringing, self-involved, and unstable creatures. Virginia Woolf must be turning over in her grave."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't wait to read it again","review":"I've always felt a good book makes you truly feel emotions. And this one does it. Not only do you feel the words deep in your heart, but the ending, the next page... nothing is certain and it doesn't matter if you've read Mrs. Dolloway or not, it's simply a great read.This is a book that my grandma and friends read, then encouraged me to read. I loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A work of art, Cunningham at his best...","review":"When I sat down to read, THE HOURs, my expectations were so high I figured they would be dashed instantly. They weren't. THE HOURS, a homage to Virgina Woolf, is a brilliant work of art which, along w/ THE POISONWOOD BIBLE, became my favorite book I read all summer. It could be titled as 'a quick read' but you are so facsinated by the material on the pages you want to read it as slow as possible, absorbing every last ounce of it til it is gone. For the people who gave this book a bad review, they probably did not understand what they were reading. I did, and thanks to Michael Cunningham I now understand even more.I hope that you buy this and read it because in every decade there is one writer's homage to another writer that grasps your heart not letting go. This is that novel and with it's strong characters and sensational plotting, you will be craving for more at the last page."},{"rating":"2","title":"Splendid!","review":"Cunningham's eloquent integration of the lives of these three women is only topped by the last chapter. As I read each page, I was upset that I was getting closer to the end because I didn't want it to be over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spend \\"Hours\\" in literary hell...","review":"Two words describe this book - pretentious drivel. Obviously this past Pulitzer winner got a book contract based on the award and not on the merit of this book. Save your time and money. If you like Virginia Woolf, buy a book by her, but not this sopping mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does very little for me","review":"I never felt like I got anywhere with this book. Yes, I saw how the women's lives merged, but that does not a story make. I think that is my problem. I expect a story. Books like this one and Catcher in the Rye are not focused on the story as much as the feelings and emotions of the characters. They try to give the reader a sense of what it is like to be depressed or to hold back rage and strong emotional feelings. I respect that but have not gained from it. I don't read books to be pulled down by depression and angry emotions. I read to be entertained, and that requires a story."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was the point of that?","review":"Yes Michael Cunningham is a wonderful writer of prose, but it is inserted in unrealistic streams of consciousness revelations during his characters' mundane activities. The lack of action in this book causes the focus to be on the characters who are revealed as self-absorbed, narcissistic and somewhat delusional while consistently whiny. It is not hard to discern why this book, as insignificant as it is, has been lauded by the press and Hollywood. It caters to sympathies that the press and Hollywood universally suscribe to without a search for greater truths or real meaning. Additionally, the writer creates no sense of urgency or intrigue for the reader. It is the equivalent of watching a soap opera in which the writers are trying their best to write like Shakespeare."},{"rating":"1","title":"Left me cold","review":"The book is beautifully written. Cunningham is clearly an outstanding writer. But the subject matter of the book is cold and as I was reading it, I kept thinking to myself - \\"who cares?\\" I never developed even the slightest empathy for the characters, whose lives I found totally uninspired."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully Written","review":"Beautifully written! If not for his prose I may not have enjoyed the book as much. While I was not neccessarily smitten by the storyline I was hooked. His lyrical tone kept the book in such a beautiful rythm."},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally deserving","review":"I suppose if I somehow thought of myself as being in the running for the Pulitzer, I might have found myself posting something as bitter and resentful as the previous reviewer. Thankfully, I am not that person. And The Hours is not the book that person describes. Never intended as a substitute for Woolf, The Hours is an incredibly complex narrative disguised as a simple one. It communicates volumes on the nature of our existance, of human longing, and of the role literature plays in our lives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly beautiful","review":"I've read the first chapter several times now, both aloud and to myself. I've rarely been as moved by the beauty of such poetic fiction. The rest of the novel, and its interwoven stories, is equally magnificent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought provoking","review":"I have to read this book a number of times to understand all the contents and the importance of Mrs.Dalloway. I haven't read the actual Mrs.Dalloway, but I read some reviews that the actual book is very similar to The Hours's novel that reference Mrs.Dalloway.Sadly, this book cannot be taken as a pleasure read. It takes a lot of your brain energy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't see the movie first","review":"I saw the movie first and wanted to read the book to see if there was any explanations for a bunch of stuff I found confusing. The book was almost exactly like the movie for the first 50 pages, so I got bored and stopped reading it. It now rests in the bookcase between an Authentic Italian Cookbook whose recipes were way too complicated, and my Young Lady Chatterley DVD. If you're really into literature, I suppose you'll love it, if you're a casual reader, you'll probably grow bored."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't get through it","review":"I really don't know what all the hype was surrounding this book, I guess it's a matter of preference, but I found it so excruciatingly dull, I eventually had to give up on it (something that I never do - I love reading!). Maybe it needs a different environment to read (like lying on a beach, rather than on the #5 subway downtown!), so I'll keep it and hope to return to it someday, but for now, it just didn't grab me...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Parallel triple tale matches Wolfe's Dalloway","review":"What a lovely curiosity of ladies, decades apart, yet connected by the concept of the hours of life. Having read Wolfe's Mrs. Dalloway certainly helps stir one's interest in Cunningham's work. But the triple story of three separate women in three separate time segments of the 20th century make for a bit of suspense as the chapters layer one another with individual revelations. If you are planning on seeing the Oscar nominated actors in the film version, do yourself a favor and first read the book. And once finished with Cunningham's book, go back and read Mrs. Dalloway. There is genuine appreciation of writer conception and craft when one absorbs all three. Well worth the hours spent!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than life...","review":"This is a marvelous book! Cunningham's writing is amazing. You begin it with Virginia Woolf's death, coming off very strong. It shows the real meaning of life, and you start to question everything about your life. I may not be able to say much, there are way too many words TO say. Just wow. One of the books you need to buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre at best","review":"I was disappointed in the book, I didn't feel there was enough story in this book. I think there were too many characters in the book to gain a true understanding of the characters. The book felt like it was written for the movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wondering why it gets rave reviews?","review":"I just read \\"The Hours\\" right after reading two otherbest-sellers. Frankly, I don't understand why this book received thePulitzer Prize! Perhaps it's due to the socially timely topic. The overabundance of details in the book did NOT make it come alive for me - in fact I started skipping these paragraphs. The unnecessary details remind me of an over-decorated Christmas tree, with every possible color, shape, and size of decoration thrown on. I also found the main characters boring. The only (intellectually) pleasing aspect of the book was the last chapter - it gave the book a surprising twist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible","review":"I read The Hours just after finishing Mrs. Dalloway, and I was drawn in. Every sentence is perfect, and there are sub-themes and symbols running through the book that kept me thinking. The book itself was based loosely on Mrs. Dalloway, but it stands on its own as a book about the terrible fears of inadequacy we all face, and the importance of small moments and dear memories in our lives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exquisite, just exquisite","review":"\\"The Hours\\" shows even more than \\"Mrs. Dalloway\\" does how very, very precious life is, and contrasts so well the ordinariness of life against its most precious, exquisite moments, those moments that we hold on to. A beautiful and highly recommended read. Don't give up before the end; don't get lulled by what may seem to be predictable and quaint. Cunningham provides a very, very powerful ending to his masterful reworking of \\"Mrs. Dalloway.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Defining \\"wonderful\\"...","review":"The Hours defines wonderful. A novel full of wonder by author Michael Cunningham, that is the fine line seperating the understanding from the knowledge that indigo and blue are in fact two different colours. If this book does not revolutionize your perception of this world and what \\"life\\" really means from one person to the next, I fear the worst. Michael's talent and ecrition are unsurpassed; he writes with egality in beauty to great authors such as Kate Chopin, and of course Virginia Woolf. Although a fictional piece of work, The Hours leaves you with intense empathy and for the characters and a hint of brilliance in one owns mind. This is truely a work for the times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hours of Preciosity","review":"At the risk of sounding like a philistine, I have to admit I was rather disappointed with this book and all the hoopla surrounding it. Cunningham fashions some pretty sentences, but his writing has neither the intellectual rigor nor the incandescent beauty of Woolf at her best. At its essence, this book is just another foray into the lives of sensitive bohemian types with the specter of AIDS looming ominously as a surefire means of eliciting sympathy and respect. Cunningham should concentrate on developing his own voice as a writer and not paying homage to writers who clearly outrank him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just too sad, and, sadly, real","review":"OK, I admit it, I've never read Mrs. Dalloway, and don't recall that I've ever read any V.Woolf. I'm sure there are many people who go through many days the way these three sad, beautiful women do, and I guess it's a testament to Mr. Cunningham's writing that he could show me this desolation, but it was hard work to keep picking up this book and live through this day with them. At times I thought the writing was just too self-conscious, too ornate; it distracted me from the story. Perhaps I'm just one of those meat-n-potatoes readers who likes story over style.I did like the ending; gullible me, I was surprised. I gave it two stars instead of three to avoid being wishy-washy, and I give myself five for making it through to the end of the book! I would not recommend it to the depressed, or to anyone suffering from post-partum blues!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Well-Written but Boring","review":"If you want to read this book because it won the Pulitzer, don't be so stupid. Granted, this is a very well-written book, replete with great metaphors and a very successful omniscient narrative. But it's so boring, even though it's about lesbians. Wait until this book is made into a movie, or becomes a prerequisite for a college class."},{"rating":"1","title":"One mere line cannot adequately describe it's awfulness.","review":"Overweening in it's pretense and preciousness. I suspect Hollywood will be hot on it's heels. Read Woolf, not Cunningham. Absolutely phoney."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Hours: Most Overrated Novel of the 90s?","review":"In a word: vacuous.Content: Does Cunningham add anything to the plot of \\"Mrs. Dalloway\\" except for reflexive criticisms of traditional lifestyles? This novel is like a bad cover version. And, to paraphrase Elmore Leonard, Cunningham seems to specialize in writing the type of passages which people \\"skip over.\\"Style: Cunningham is a blandly elegant writer. He makes the serious mistake of quoting passages from \\"Mrs. Dalloway.\\" Now, I am not convinced Woolf's writing is always completely successful, but she is undoubtedly highly original and thoughtful in her prose style and is brimming with things to say. The contrast was seriously damaging to Cunningham.That this novel won the Pulitzer Prize shows that the prize has become an entirely pr-driven affair. I actually picked up the book because I wanted to read it prior to seeing the movie with Meryl Streep. Now, I'm not planning on seeing the movie anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"A masterpiece","review":"The Hours is a masterpiece in prose, structure and emotional impact. Of the many contemporary novels I've read, this is the finest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't Like This Book","review":"I really didn't think this book deserved a Pulitzer. I have read many more richer and more satisfying novels. In fact I hated the book and wish I hadn't invested the time reading it. I'm sorry"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious City","review":"Simply put, this may be the most pretentious novel of the year. It's supposed to be some sort of Virginia Woolf pastiche, but she was an accomplished and original stylist. This is simply someone trying to flaunt his prodigious verbiage. If you like Woolf, read Mrs. Dalloway or The Waves instead.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highlights are too modern","review":"The modernization of Woolf's life in this book is a little too unrealistic and fabricated. The novel is filled with too much modern day nonsense to be taken seriously. The dark, moody, sombre tone of the book is depressing. One feels as though they have taken a ride on the 'dark side' with Cunningham as the author. Better to read a biography about Virginia Woolf!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivated by \\"The Hours\\"","review":"I found \\"the hours\\" to be an intricate and captivating story of three women and just everyday life. I found that cunningham did a wonderful job of writing women from a males perspective. It's amazing how each of the women have a small yet present echo in each others lives. As you read you see many parallels between their stories. You begin to see the strength and yet a resounding weakness that each women pocess. Cunningham is able to have three completely different lives but one soul between the women. I found that this book is great for anyone to read and being only 16 I had no struggle with the book only understanding."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good book...once you get into it","review":"At first, I found the book extremely boring. I almost put it down. Luckily I didn't. It is a wonderful piece of literature. Mr Cunningham did a wonderful job of creating rich characters that you want to care about. I bought three books worth mentioning This one. CHILD ABDUCTION: How to protect your children, and Self- Matters. All worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Left disappointed","review":"I enjoyed the author's method of writing, and his vivid descriptions were wonderful. I was somewhat satisfied with the book until the last few chapters when things just got, well...stupid. I think each character was beautifully written, but the way they were brought together was uncreative. I was appalled with the simple ending to this book. I fumbled throught the entire book hoping for a decent amount of closure, but was left disappointed. In all I applaud the author for his characterization and style, but I would ask him to sit a little longer next time thinking of a more solid plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Beautifully Overrated Gem","review":"Perhaps if the book had not received the prize and so much praise I would have been pleasantly surprised, but after all the hype I would tend to agree with the dissenters here below, that The Hours, although superbly crafted and elegantly written, is a hollow and ultimately disappointing reference to Virginia Woolf's masterpiece. Cunningham's prose moved me, but his invented characters did not. (Of course Virginia herself is untouchable.) I am puzzled, still, at my disappointment; have I missed something, or am I merely more discerning, wary of the aura of prize-winning?"},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst, couldn't finish","review":"This book was chosen as a book club selection. I would consider myself a very open minded reader and choose books from all subjects. There are very few books that I have not been able to finish and this is one of them. I found myself having to re-read parts just to remember what character I was reading about at that point. I would not recommend this book to anyone and now I know why the library I picked it from had only one copy and it was on the shelf. This is one book I definately won't be paying a late fee on and will be back in plenty of time for another sucker to pick up off the shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"ick","review":"One of the worst books I have read all year.

I got half way through, realized I didn't care about any of the characters, didn't enjoy reading a ridiculous unnecessary cluster of words over and over when it should have been written just freaking straightforwardly. I am in the minority in saying this, I know, but s-k-i-p this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Precious Little","review":"This gimmicky paean to the gay and lesbian lifestyle \\"drags\\" on for hours. The only section that rose above the whiny, self-indulgent norm involved Virginia Woolf, her niece and nephews, and a dead thrush. The prose is finely chiseled (So precious! So cute!) but it says nothing and takes you nowhere.At one point, \\"Mrs. D\\" speculates as to the fate the future will assign the writings of another character. The only fate imaginable for this slight volume is total, permanent oblivion closing in quickly, as the glitterati move on to the next shiny, superficial work which reflects their infinite self-importance and self-pity. It's both laughable and a sad commentary on the state of American letters that this claptrap garnered the Pulitzer Prize. Perhaps next year the judges will free themselves from the service of the so-called cultural elite and reward a book with substance as well as \\"style\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kryptonite","review":"Why do I hate this book so much? Well, let's see...it opens with a dramatic reconstruction of Virginia Woolf's suicide. That struck me as rather tasteless.If this was the only problem with the book I might have reserved judgment. However, Cunningham continues the \\"good work\\" begun in his earlier novels of portraying women as flobby wandering half-souls whose emotions occasionally crop up, as warts or an ingrown hairs might, to further confuse them in their blind stumblings through the world.Silly women, always getting in the way. I'm probably not going to get very many \\"helpful\\" votes for this review but I strongly, strongly suggest that you read MRS. DALLOWAY, the novel that Cunningham's work is ostensibly based on, and never even consider picking up THE HOURS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated and boring","review":"I finally finished reading this book after putting in down at least a dozen times. I finished it only because of the overwhelming hype surrounding it, aided by its brevity. Dull, dull, dull. I haven't seen the movie, but the previews for it look quite interesting. I would love to have been the screenwriter for the movie. I would have been able to flesh out and develop the characters in ways the author does not. From what little I've seen of the movie trailers, they have done just that. I kept at it, hoping something would happen. Here's a clue... almost nothing does. Oh, and there's no grand message either. The written story is dull and depressing; the movie previews appear to have more vitality.

Also, because it's based on Mrs. Dalloway, which I think is one of the finest novels ever written. Having read it, I can see why it's gotten the attention it has--it's just the sort of referential--and reverential--book that academics love. But it's boring and full of cliches about contemporary urban life as well as suburban life in the late 40s. It has none of the subtlety, brilliance, and depth of Woolf's own writing. Not one of its characters engages the reader's interest--instead, they're all dull shadows of Woolf's sharply drawn originals. You won't waste much time reading this book, as it's very slight both in length and content, but if you're looking for good writing and true insights in human character you'd be better off reading Mrs. Dalloway again,."},{"rating":"1","title":"uninspired fiction","review":"Cunningham is a talented writer and this book is well written so I give it two stars for that. The problem is that the subject matter is painfully boring. I never developed any empathy for the characters, who I found extraordinarily uninteresting.

A great follow up to Mrs. Dalloway if you don't mind brooding for a while afterwords."},{"rating":"2","title":"A brilliant, brilliant book","review":"Michael Cunningham's new book is breathtakingly beautiful, haunting, aching. It's full of life--its beauties and its many horrors, from social events gone wrong to plagues and bone-crushing despair. Gorgeously imagined, observed with the eye of a scientist who loves nature as much as himself, and as restrained as the best poetry or painting, THE HOURS is proof positive that literature has its own kind of necessary intelligence, without which we cannot hope for the survival of our culture. This is the kind of book that has to humble anyone who even aspires to writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Think of it as a piece of music....","review":"Fans of straightforward story-writing might be frustrated by Michael Cunningham's book, which swirls back and forth between modern New York, 1950's California, and late Edwardian England like a whirlpool. But its emotional effect is powerful and it is worth an effort.I found it had a profound impact on me once I started reading it as though I were listening to a piece of music. Themes rise to the surface, submerge, and reappear (purchasing flowers; a kiss shared between two women; a life-threatening illness; an interrupted attempt to run away from one's life; a suicide reconsidered)-just as in music. Let it wash over you rather than analyze it, and you will be well rewarded."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended","review":"I picked this book up at the airport bookstore before an overseas flight based on its numerous awards. It was 200 pages of whining, depicted people totally devoid of courage, and was sickeningly sentimental. I hated it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't wait to put it down","review":"I'll have to side with those that were disappointed with this book. It was our Reading Group's selection for June. I think that it is going to get roasted. It reminded me of a bad art film that centers on the bleakness of our existence. It was beautiful in spots, interesting when it talked of how creative people create, but weak as a whole. I'll give those familiar with Virginia Woolf the benefit of the doubt that Cunningham has done something clever here with her ideas. I can't help but to think that they are probably strong enough to stand by themselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Presumptuous but it works","review":"I found the idea of an American male attempting to write a companion novel to Mrs. Dalloway, in the style of Virginia Woolf, quite presumptuous. Needless to say I was extremely sceptical. After reading The Hours, I must say it was beautifully executed. Although this is not a sequel of a classic and does stand alone, anyone wanting to read this should read Mrs. Dalloway first to appreciate all the nuances and subtle referrences. Any fan of Mrs. Dalloway (my favorite Woolf novel) should read this... you surely won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elegant and mesmerizing","review":"This novel is both an homage to Mrs. Dalloway and a quantum leap beyond it.

A lot of his works were \\"covers.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"A book as lovely as it is true.","review":"It's not necessary to read Mrs. Dalloway before reading this, but it helps. Mrs. Dalloway inspires and informs The Hours, and Michael Cunningham references that book in such a way that he reminds you of certain feelings and events without rehashing them. This book was such a joy to read, I inhaled it. And there were so many truths about life and human nature, and not to be trite, but there seemed such wisdom in the storytelling. I am eager to read more by Michael Cunningham."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious; saving grace is that it's so short","review":"A friend recommended this book, and I think he was trying to impress his girlfriend by having read it. Pretentious, flowery writing swamps a thin storyline. The saving grace is a neat little narrative tie-in towards the end. This is the kind of novel that wins awards because it deals with 'important' subjects - homosexuality, suicide, AIDS, etc. Thinking back on how I had to endure reading this for my book club, I'm going to scale my rating to a 1."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was a class assignment.","review":"Everything that I felt about this book has already been said in other reviews. It was contrived, it was juvenile, it was all of that. The characters all basically have the same voice: Cunningham's. Also, this is another example of a gay man whose creation implies that he believe a gay man can have only one sort of soul mate:a woman. Perhaps it's some kind of internalised homophobia. I found the whole thing rather creepy and sickening myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth my time","review":"I really wanted to like this book, but I couldn't get past the feeling that the author thinks he's writing something important. All the details and observations about the characters remind me of the writings of a 15 year old who feels they've got the world figured out. I think the details may have been an attempt to avoid writing a short story."},{"rating":"1","title":"I had trouble finishing it","review":"I had what is like an allergic reaction to this book.I have this fear that if I don't say something this might be mistaken for a great novel...there is no great poetry here; just fascination with death and death.My reaction was like litmus paper:this is a disgustingly self centered book about:1) suicide2) homosexuality3) \\" painfully susceptible sensibilities\\"\\" Virgina Woolf put a stone into the pocket of her coat , walked into a river and drowned.\\"Over and over and over...It makes you afraid of reading Virginia Woolf.Well, the book made me want to read Mrs. Dalloway by Virginia Woolf anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Minuteman.","review":"Just cause you won a Pulitzer Prize don't mean you can lay down heavy pipe in your old lady's aqueduct for hours and hours without missing a beat. Respect yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing story","review":"I read this book, based on its Pulitzer prize status and it being a feminist story, however, I was disappointed. It was very well written and had a few lovely and poetic parts, but mostly it was full of unhappy, depressed, hopeless gay people who I could not sympathize with in any way. They were either unable to accept and live with being gay or couldn't figure out how to get help or antidepressant meds. I couldn't understand what was the point of all the angst and misery. The theme seemed to be \\"life is hopeless and terrible, and if you are lucky, you may get a few good hours in a lifetime\\". Very big downer. I won't see the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"An intriguing look at the way lives intersect","review":"Although it took me awhile to get into this book, I ultimately found it to be a rewarding read. For me this book was all about longing, longing for love (lost and current), longing for identity and self, and longing for solace. Each of the three characters brings to the story similar and unique perspectives on these needs. Although I felt for the characters (especially Virginia Woolf), there is a strong sense of aloofness and detachment with these individuals. We are never fully allowed into their worlds, (especially with Mrs Brown) and we are given only minimal insight into the motivations for their actions. This distance can leave the reader feeling somewhat unsatisfied (Why are these people doing what they're doing?). But I think that's the point, it's up to the reader to make up their own mind as to what is going on here. \\"The Hours\\" is thoughtful, pensive and open to a variety of interpretations. A quick read but certainly not a \\"light\\" one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting, unique good read","review":"The Hours was an enjoyable and challenging book which alternated among 3 sets of characters in each chapter. This one is not brain candy, but a true novel that makes you think. Each set of characters is unsatisfied with some element of life. The characters were very alive with real emotion: the frustration of the suburban mother who just wants to be alone to read; the confusion of a lesbian mother who feels like a sell-out; the emotional breakdown of an author who is both brilliant and fragile. I absolutely loved the ending of this book. Definitely worth reading, but not my favorite book that I plan to re-read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seemed like days.","review":"This book has all the cliches of a senior-year English final. Although the author has a mastery of the language, he does not use it to illuminate my perspective on these characters with sensitivity to the precious few HOURS I have to read for entertainment and relaxation. Try poetry next time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"A little masterpiece, clever and bright as it is heartbreaking. A friend read it thrice in a day. Once in a lifetime is enough for me. I'm interested in seeing the film now. If this is the future of fiction, it will be a very nice place. Not a word or notion wasted. Thanks, Michael Cunningham."},{"rating":"2","title":"Resonates Long After the Last Page","review":"Don't miss the book, even if you catch the movie. The final thread connecting Virginia Woolf, the New York Mrs. Dalloway, and Laura Brown arrives with considerable affection and subtlety. The writing throughout is spare, precise, sympathetic and true. The novel, far more than the movie, delivers on the title: every single human battles depression and loss, but there are those Hours, when life is suddenly all that we think it should be always. They come unexpectedly, often unrecognized but we stay alive for them, alert for them, even when it seems impossible that any one will ever come again.Highly praised novels often disappoint me when I finally get around to reading them. This one did not, but understand that conventional action and plot development are conspicuous by their absence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful, haunting, memorable","review":"Cunningham not only brings Virginia Woolf to life in his novel \\"The Hours,\\" but he also brings her novel \\"Mrs. Dalloway\\" to life as well. The book is a joy to read:*it's unutterably clever in the way it unobtrusively echoes the plot and characters of \\"Mrs. Dalloway,\\" serving as a tribute to that novel and recalling its very themes*it's gorgeously written in long, rhythmic, sumptuous sentences that echo Woolf's own style*it's brilliantly constructed as it moves back and forth among its three story lines, and I truly can't remember a more satisfying conclusion to a novel in years*it will move you and it will stay with you once you've finished reading itAnd now a confession: when I read \\"Mrs. Dalloway\\" as an immature college student many years ago, I failed to appreciate it.

I, who had never been able to stomach Virginia Woolf as a young man, read \\"Mrs. Dalloway\\" first. I found it profound, amusing, wonderful, and I revised my opinion of Woolf utterly. Turning to \\"The Hours,\\" I felt it was an interesting failure, drowned, as it were, in the light shimmering in my mind from Mrs. Woolf's incandescent prose. I imagine the Pulizer committee made up of English professors who, having failed to persuade students to appreciate Woolf, were overcome by the happy memories of their long ago love affair with \\"Mrs. Dalloway.\\" In the end I found the two books about as successful as the parties each bring us to.

The twist at the end was okay, but by then I felt a bit cheated.I'll admit, Cunningham's prose was stylish and well designed, but a pretty package is only good if you don't open it. So, buyer beware. I'm a bit too jaded to fall for some romantic notion of running from my life because the world is spinning too fast. This book might well have been a breakthrough had it been written forty years ago.

The story line on the back really had nothing to do with the story itself. A word to the wise, whoever is doling out awards for writing sure didn't read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Human Nature","review":"Does anyone remember what Ayn Rand said in the Fountain Head? In her book there is a character that writes a poorly written, no plotted, ridiculous book. Some how it is published, and all of NYC and beyond go wild for it in social settings. However, no one actually believes it to be a good book, they are all just too afraid that they'll show some weakness or defect within themselves if they admit to its lack of anything stimulating.This is the only reasonable explanation for Michael Cunningham's The Hours. I can not fathom why anyone would think this to be a good book, unless of course they are just caught up in the hype and too afraid to untangle themselves.I feared that this book I had purchased would be passed down and fall into the wrong hands causing someone to spiral down into a pit of despair. So immediately upon finishing it, I closed the cover, took a deep breath, walked over to the woodstove and threw it in. Something I'd never done before or since."},{"rating":"2","title":"You may want the companion book","review":"Cunningham's book reminds us that we should take the time to appreciate the time that we have. Life is a beautiful thing and should be cherished.His story is well written and is framed within Virginia Woolf's book \\"Mrs. Dalloway.\\" Within this book, three women's lives are being discussed in parallel. The writing is engaging, so the book can be understood on its own. However, character names and events parallel the life of Virginia Woolf and the heroine of her book. By reading this first, like a companion text, characters, situations, and ideas become more apparent and lasting.Even if the story was not interesting, watching the way Cunningham weaves his book with Woolf's is worth the reading. I would recommend reading this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Hours","review":"I didn't find this book engrossing or even challenging. In fact, it was an effort for me to finish reading this rather smallish book. I found the writing to be superficial and the characters undeveloped. Of course, the connections among the three women were obvious and there were no surprises to be discovered. Anyone familiar with the Bloomsbury Group and specifically Virginia Woolf is aware of everything included concerning her life and her writing. The similarities among the three characters were so tenuous and the characters so underdeveloped (I felt no attachment to any of them), that although I am aware of the rave reviews, I find it impossible to agree with them. If this is a Pulitzer Prize winning novel, then our writing establishment, and our civilization by extension, are in deep trouble."},{"rating":"2","title":"An updated review....","review":"Maybe the readers who don't like this book were in a hurry...this book requires, almost demands, to be read slowly, deliberately, and not in one sitting.I've not found a book in recent time that held my attention and drew me into the story more than this one. I read it after hearing a piece on NPR...and I've passed my copy on to friends who have also enjoyed the wonderfully crafted prose.Although there are three separate stories going at one time, I never felt disjointed or disrupted during the shifts.I've even re-read the book three times and will read it again...it's that good.If you can get beyond some of the negative reviews, and if you can give yourself time to absorb the Cunningham's glorious prose, you just might find a gem of a story just waiting to be unearthed.Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A juvenile exercise.","review":"I found this book to be pretentious, boring, sophomoric and most of all, contrived.

Since he has been such an faithful imitator of her style, Mr. Cunningham might do well to remember that Woolf would not accept awards or honorary degrees for her fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything a novel should be","review":"This novel was heartbreaking, uplifting, enraging, and empowering. I read Mrs. Dalloway in college and couldn't quite yet grasp what was being said. I read this novel as a desparate housewife of a sort, and wept. I wept for myself, for women through otu the ages. I wept for my dying spirit, and in that realization I was able to find myself again. I suspect many women have had the same reaction. In subsequent readings I've found there are some problems with the plot development, but this novel is so beautiful and so poignant that it doesn't matter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insightful and beautifully written, a true masterpiece","review":"For whatever reason, I found this book hard to read when I first tried a few years ago. The second time around, it proved to be a true revelation. The lyrical prose, the brilliant interweaving of three stories, and the unforgettable characterization all come together for me. And it's been more than 30 years since I read Virginia Woolf.I agree with those who said the book can be understood as a fugue with repeating and interlocking musical themes. I also want to emphasize the \\"Laura\\" story. Even beyond the connection to the other two stories, it stands as a poignant evocation of a life of quiet desperation. The whole world of suburban California in 1949 is rendered brilliantly -- the postwar affluence and complacency, the continuing homage to those who fought for their nation, the circumscribed role of woman as wife and mother.I have not read Cunningham's other books but I will make sure to do so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes me want to write","review":"This is one of those books that makes you so sad but also makes you feel like you had no choice but to read it. It's beautiful and thoughtful and Cunningham does a great job of bringing all the characters together, despite their disparate lifestyles and eras. I will be reading more of his books and even watching this movie.I can see where this book would be frustrating for some people. I liked how the first-person narrators fit together, but they are similar. Also you have to appreciate more of a poetic writing style for this. I loved how very basic the characters' activities were, but that's probably another point of frustration for some people.Regardless, I could relate to the characters and their thoughts and hopes and sadness. Refreshing read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite a Disappointing Award Winner","review":"I expected more brilliance from a Pulitzer prize winner. Although I found the structure of the novel well-crafted, little else impressed me: the prose was flat, totally without poetry or lyricism, and the characters, shallow. They needed to possess \\"humanity, humour, depth,\\" as Woolf suggests in the diary entry quoted in novel's prelude. She says that structure alone isn't enough. Since he included that quote in his book, Cunningham, surely, understood that, too. He just couldn't pull it off. For its structure alone, I would recommend it to most readers; however, I can't believe it won the Pulitzer prize.It's not that good."},{"rating":"2","title":"An unforgettable book - read \\"Mrs. Dalloway\\" first","review":"I had read all of the reviews about \\"The Hours\\" prior to reading.

The author attempts to explain OO development management by creating an object model of the concepts within the development process. It is an intriguing idea, but it doesn't work. The object model provides no insight that I can see to the development process, and it makes it painful to read, even when he is explaining simple situations. The one valuable part is the detailed review of other process methods (e.g. SEI's). But that alone was not worth the price, at least for this reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"good book , bad kindle version","review":"The book as written by William Walker Atkinson is pretty good.

When I recently purchased a Kindle-compatible device, this was one of the short-list of books I wanted to buy for it.After purchasing and downloading the book, I thought it was strange that the words LOOK like old ink type scanned from the pages of an old book. Testing showed that this must be some type of effect, because the words can be selected and dictionary definitions looked up. Interesting, but I'm not sure what the point of it would be.My problems started when I tried to \\"Go To... Location\\" to find the table of contents or other front matter of the book. For some reason EVERY time I try this, the book crashes, and the Kindle app opens another book in my library.Without the ability to navigate the book, it's worthless to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"tamron breakthroghe","review":"i would like to praise this tamron lens for being so light wight,campact and easy to use with a price range that fit everyone,just remarkable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oz Coloring Book!","review":"This is a very cute coloring book! as other reviews have stated it is both text and coloring.

In some books, the events are the same as those in the TV show, just in a different setting. It's starting to annoy me that the jacket copy and publicity don't mention clearly \\"Xena Uber Fiction\\" so I know I'm not getting original character conceptions.This book is a cut above in that is has a futuristic, edgy feel that avoids sentimentality. Beck is not afraid to transform the the Xena/Gabrielle characters as she builds her world.

Being a loyal Nikon fan and user, I was somewhat leary of the Tamron Brand. I did some research and used the lens to take some test rolls. The test results were fine. The Zomm action worked very hard in the beginning & Within six months it was so loose that you could not hang it over your shoulder without locking the lens, because it would extend to 300mm on its own. I just returned from Alaska and the Tamron was not satisfactory in my opinion. Half way through the trip it started to take longer for the auto-focus to focus - if it did at all. During a glacier trek it was damaged - I'm not getting it fixed! I'll lose 100mm and buy the Nikon 28-200 Zoom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get the Nikon 70-300 instead","review":"This lens does have some nice features, the most notable of course is the ability to go from a semi-wide angle shot all the way to 300mm and zoom in. The lens has a locking feature that allows you to lock the zoom.Unlike the other reviewers I was not happy in the least with the prints I got using this lens. I took six test rolls of film and found the pictures to be sub-par. The auto focus on this lens seems to be the main culprit. Even in conditions with good lighting this lens seemed to be forever focusing, and half the pictures still seem to lack focus. The color separation was horrible on the prints. Until I bought this lens I never had a problem getting good pictures using automatic settings on my camera (N70).I brought this lens back and bought the Nikon 70-300 and continued using my Quantray 28-80 for the majority of my shooting. The difference was noticeable, immediately noticeable. The Nikon lens focus's quicker, and the prints come out a heck of a lot better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh mY gOd!","review":"A friend of mine told me to get this cd cause he knows I like agressive metal a lot. First of all the production is not that good in my opinion. And I really can't enjoy nothing from this band since there's no melodies et no break from the pounding drums and screaming vocals. But the good point is that Neuraxis is a bunch of talented musicians and I respect them for doing metal for so long!

The new MASON band is hot! Their style is fresh, their rhythms are sweet, and their songs have substance... I especially like the raging guitar and keyboard work. The vocals have a special, unique quality that makes me feel like that this is truly original.Get it, try it!

I can not wait to see them in person...!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Radio version of CG","review":"This CD has the version of \\"Classical Gas\\" most widely heard on the radio...that is, with orchestra accompanyment. The orchestra is okay but seems a bit overbearing at times; Still, this is a better version of \\"CG\\" than the re-make done with Mannheim Steamroller 20 years later (too much electronic sounding schlock).I personnally prefer the version that is ALL classical guitar with NO orchestra."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the Trip","review":"This album brings back golden high school memories. He's an off-beat, sometimes off-the-wall artist. The melodies segue one-to-the-other like whipped cream, and the lyrics, if you focus in on them, will often bring a puzzled frown. He's just immature enough to elicit a laugh or an \\"oh, brother\\" flick of the wrist. As off-beat as he is, though, it's not weird music. The first notes will bring on heavy late 60's/early 70's flashbacks, especially if you remember the fantastic \\"Classical Gas,\\" which speaks for itself. All in all, the Mason Williams Phonograph Record is a pleasant listen, and an enjoyable visit to yesteryear."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nostalgia of youth","review":"My parents had this album as an actual phonograph record when I was a young boy. I listened to it repeatedly because I liked the big orchestration on some of the tracks along with the pop sounding music. Years later, after having played in many orchestras, jazz bands, and rock bands, I am still just as fond of the music on this album as I was decades ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounds mostly like a bunch of 60s TV Classical Gas best item","review":"I've always liked Classical Gas, it was the reason I bought this CD, most of the rest of the album is a disappointment. 12 selections are on this thing and ten of them sound like something from a 60's TV soundtrack, not very interesting in my opinion even if they did seem to be well handled. The only other selection I cared for was #3 Dylan Thomas, 30 seconds long starting out with some good banjo playing then finished (spoiled)by someone singing a few words.There's a note on the back of the CD about the album being recorded on analog equipment with the CD preserving that sound as closely as possible which might reveal the original limitations. I thought it all sounded very clear, Classical Gas was the only selection I'm familiar with and I heard unfamiliar detail, no static."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mason Williams record","review":"This is only one song I wanted off this album. It is Classical Gas. I have a son who I am trying to get learn this song on his guitar."},{"rating":"1","title":"More a curiosity than a keeper","review":"Mason Williams would compose musical jokes on his guitar for his stand-up routines. As a sketch writer for the Smothers Brothers, his \\"Classical Gas\\" was the theme for a display of classic paintings on the show. On the ablum, the gags in \\"Overture\\", \\"Dylan Thomas\\", and \\"The Prince's Panties\\" mix poorly with the other earnest attempts and make for a very uneven album. The combination of french horns and guitar riffs do make for a nostalgic return to late 1960's theme muic. 2 stars for the overall album."},{"rating":"1","title":"It Could Be Much Better","review":"I have enjoyed Classical Gas for years in two versions, both as a solo and with orchestral background and now with Manheim Steamroller I'll be able to have three excellent pieces of music.Sunflower is another piece better done with the Steamroller.Longtime Blues was well done by the Kingston Trio many years ago. The rest of the album is more or less a waste of time unless you happen to be happy with second rate stuff.Sorry, Mason but thats my feeling."},{"rating":"2","title":"A finely crafted, and all around enjoyable album","review":"When my dad replaced his 8-track collection with either CD's or LP's, he gave me all of his old 8-tracks, and one of my favorites was \\"Phonograph Record\\". All of the songs, particularily the first 4, as well as \\"Classical Gas\\" are outstanding, and sound great, even 31 years after it was recorded. Also, Mike Post, who later became a well known TV theme composer, produced this album, and even wrote the first track \\"Overture\\" (an effective sampling of each song on the album in 1 and a half minutes).

But time and posterity shuffles the music of the past-- when it all works right, the cream rises to the top and the rest falls away. It looks like this is finally happening with Steve Harley's music-- his imaginative, catchy, and quirky songs have slowly but inexorably been climbing their way into classic status. And that's where several of the songs on this import hits collection should be. Any fan of 1970's glam rock will want to hear Harley & Cockney Rebel's passionate contributions to the style. By comparison, Harley has the cleverness and ingenuity of David Bowie but with more heart, some of the manic flair of Roxy Music but with more warmth, and the popular touch of Brian Eno with greater directness. I recommend this disc enthusiastically."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting","review":"An interesting biography, written in blank verse; creates a picture of a time and a place unfamiliar to many people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works as advertised","review":"As a contractor, I'm always looking for tools that save time.

For personal prayer time, I prefer the Anglican Breviary, but that language is quite archaic, and so I don't use it with the family.What's also nice with this book is that it has some nice devotions, like the stations of the cross adapted for more of the family environment. It also provides several variants of Morning, Daily, and Evening prayer so that you have choices.My only complaint is that it isn't indexed very well, and references are made to other sections that are awfully hard to find. For instance, in the non-traditional language Morning Prayer you are instructed to use week1 Psalmody for Passion Week and week2 for Holy Week. Finding the week1 and week2 Psalmody is quite difficult. It turns out its buried in the traditional language Morning Prayer (I think that's what is being referred to)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anvil - 'Hard & Heavy' (Unidisc)","review":"Originally released in 1981,this was the Canadian metal band's first album.Not that impressive,I'm afraid.I've heard other CD's of theirs and I know they can do better.It's been noted they're like Canada's reply to Motorhead.I don't THINK so!Whenever I listen to this disc,I need to remember there are only five of the ten tracks here that I even want to the take the time to listen to,which are \\"School Love\\",\\"Bedroom Game\\",their so-so cover of the Stone's \\"Paint It Black\\"(too many bands cover this tune,anyway),\\"Oh,Jane\\" and \\"Hot Child\\".Might possibly appeal to some fans of Exodus,early Slayer,Testament and Heathen."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Hate it.

Apparently, the drivers are unstable making it unpredictable whether the unit will be recognized by my recording software, Garageband. So invariable I have to unplug my USB cables and plug them back in again, quit out out of Garageband and constantly reset Garageband preferences to select the US-144, turn off the Mac, download new drivers, delete old drivers, and this has been going on for over a year. One need only do a search of reviews on the US-144 to hear a chorus of complaints. The unfortunate thing is Tascam was once a brand you could trust for professional grade recording equipment. Tascam has discontinued the US-144 leaving loyal Tascam customers in the lurch.

You hear of friends who have died etc. Lots of things have changed and loved ones etc. have passed away. It causes great sadness and you realize how short your life is.I am glad she got to go back and see how things had changed. I am glad that she still had good memories of her past.

A story of a woman living with her son and his wife in an apt. just wanting to see her life long home one more time in her life. Sounds like a simple plot, but layered with so much life and beauty and no fluff. Peter Masterson, thank you for making this film, as you had to know it would'nt be a financial bonanza. It's a prime example that acting and story-telling are the key to a masterpiece on celluloid. Can be seen by any age group, and I recommend it is. No sappy getting on in years movie, but a peek at a realistic event that eventually comes in many elderly peoples lives.

Their book begins with an emphasis on the purpose of marriage, which finds its purpose in God. The husband and wife's role also find their purpose in God, which is addressed in chapters 2 and 3. These are areas which are rarely addressed in most books on marriage. The Ricuccis give a good, basic, complementarian perspective, which is the exception rather than the rule in most books. The Ricuccis also include 3 chapters on communication and 2 chapters on romance and the sexual relationship. They write with an easy to understand, practical style which people find very helpful.

The author connects the unsolvable equation with group theory but does not provide any way for the reader to understand exactly what it is that is wrong with the equation. Why could the equation not be solved? There is a reason for this fact, and the mathematical theory explains it well--but not this book. Perhaps a mathematician will write a book explaining why the 5th degree equation cannot be solved in general.

This kit does the job I need, and is an awesome price.

Print is well spaced and there are lots of credits at base of each page (some take up half the page) but that is to be expected in a work of ancient history where the author is gathering information from many sources. I prefer it the way itHistory of the Island of Corfu, and of the Republic of the Ionian Islandsis done rather than in an appendix as you know the source of each area of information. There are also a few nice prints in the book as well.

The only problems that i have encountered have been a slight distortion around the edges at about 150mm and up. The focusing is relatively fast, and pictures are generally sharp. The lens is heavy, but to me it is better than lugging around multiple lenses. Its maximum aperture range is good for such a wide range of zooms, and the included lens hood is very useful for the outdoors. All in all a very good zoom lens, with a few minor drawbacks.

And it is great fun to play on my Strat-Plus into my Marshall. Heavy, Heavy, slow track. Plus \\"Never Deceive Me\\". Wow. Great drumming and thick, crunchy distorted guitars. Very proficient guitar playing, a little closer to Mick Mars than Steve Vai, But that's good, because Mick rocks!The rest of the tracks are pretty good, too. 1 or 2 that may be considered filler by some, but all in all a great metal album.When I saw they made a movie about these guys(the 2 whom are left), I said \\"I gotta see that\\". And I will soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of the Bunch","review":"This album is the best thing that this band ever put out. Their first three pretty much personified what the band was all about and they peaked with this, their third album. I used to watch these guys play in bars around Sudbury and always thought they were the best bar band i saw that never got huge. You haven't lived until you've seen a guy doing a beer bottle slide guitar solo while dressed in nothing but lip-covered long johns and a black leather cod-piece. This album suffers from slightly muddy production but their songwriting peaked here. After this it was pretty much the same thing album after album."},{"rating":"1","title":"SILLY","review":"Don't be fooled by the great package or cover art.

While some of his explanations are a bit murky and some of his linkages a bit half-baked, this a brilliant book. Nobody to my knowledge, saving perhaps only Alfred Chandler, has done a better job of explaining the evolution of administrative systems or the linkages between that evolution and the advances in information technology occuring in the 19th and early 20th centuries. I recommend this book to anyone with an interest in management control, competitive dynamics, or technological/economic history.I only wish the author had taken one more cut at simplifying and clarifing his basic thesis, It is also a pity that the volume was written prior to the development of transaction cost economics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"Reading Beniger's Control Revolution is a bit like reading Hans Moravec and others who see the world as an evolution of artificial intelligence. Economic explantations of society is insufficient, Beniger says, the best way to understand society is through stages of control crisis and control revolution. His reasoning is not too unlike Norbert Wiener and people of the cybernetics generation as he links control (cybernetics) with life in general. So what is the moral? Is the purpose of humanity to create a HAL9000 that will control us all?

But for someone who wants to delve deep into the more obscure corners of the world of the Royal Navy during the 18th and early 19th Centuries, this book is a worthwhile addition to the library. 50-gun ships suffered from being neither fish nor fowl, being too small for the line of battle and too large to serve as frigates, and are usually neglected in histories of the era. However, they did see considerable service and Winfield's book fills in the void in the historical record. And there is a bonus here for fan's of Patrick O'Brian and his hero, Jack Aubrey of the Royal Navy. One of Jack's least favorite commands, the \\"Horrible Old Leopard\\", is prominently featured in this volume, including meticulously detailed cutaway drawings and hull plans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where have you gone Rock and Roll?","review":"Rock and roll is dead? not so. that is what the record companies desperately want you to believe. REEF is alive and making some of the best rock and roll, straight up rock and roll, since the late seventies and the reason no one thinks they are is because the main media outlets don't lift it to the level that they do for britney spears and the backstreet boys. We've become, that would be the record buying public, expectant to have all the music delivered to our door. REEF is worth seeking out and delivers with this album. This is one of the most stripped down and to the point rock albums of the past ten years. This band continues to flourish in a world that doesn't seem to notice or care.

I purchased this CD a year or so ago.The Valses are well-played. Tombeau is wonderful, save for the very end of the last movement, where he stumbles over the climactic bars. When he is good, he is very, very good - the little preludes/postludes which bookmark this recording are breathtaking, making me stop in my tracks whenever I hear them.Some folks might think that he plays some of these pieces a little too fast, and sometimes too loud, but I'm willing to forego that criticism, and note that he attempts to communicate his feelings about the pieces through his playing - one does not forget that this is a living, breathing human being putting his stamp on the music laid out before him."},{"rating":"1","title":"eratic and mannered","review":"This is my first encounter with Dejan Lazic's piano playing. It will be my last. His playing of Ravel is, quite simply, absurd. It is so ridiculously erratic and mannered, one can barely make out Ravel's glorious creation. His complete disregard for tempo and the printed score makes this disc impossible to be taken seriously and should be dismissed as irrelevant. How someone of this level of incompetence lands a recording contract is beyond me when are there so many legitimate artists so deserving of the honor of being recorded. Make no mistake: Lazic is to piano playing as Bocelli is to opera singing. Lazic is a wanna be who should never have been. Channel Classics should be ashamed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite pick","review":"I got the green Medium-Light pick and it's great for strumming.

I've honestly found that my playing is substandard with other picks. These picks have great grip and unlike some Dunlop picks, the ink from the logo won't rub off and stain your fingers. I love the gel picks and I've yet to see this \\"splittering\\" effect that everyone is so concerned about. Maybe I just don't play hard enough, but I would still seriously reccommend these picks to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty decent picks","review":"I've been using these picks for the better part of the past ten years for acoustic playing. I find the medium-light gauge produces a good amount of control for picking single strings but still offers enough flex for a smooth strum. They also become slightly tacky when exposed to the oils in your skin so you won't find them flying off your fingers too often. Unfortunately they're a fairly rigid material and if you really bang away they will crack and break. They're not as prone to cracking as the blue light gauge but it does happen from time to time. If you're looking for a more sturdy pick in the same gauge I would recommend the orange .60mm Jim Dunlop Tortex picks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Opening the book on a facinating, private man: Greenspan","review":"Justin Martin does a masterful job of helping us understand what is behind one of the most powerful economic forces in the world today--Alan Greenspan. From his early years as a child prodigy and his early adulthood skimming economics books between sets as a jazz musician to hobnobbing with world leaders and making nail-biting policy decisions (at times to do nothing) as fate the world's economy lies in the balance, Greenspan makes a fascinating protagonist in a drama that continues to unfold. The subject of this book has clearly been meticulously researched and reported by Martin who seemingly has left no stone unturned and has the uncanny ability to make complex economic issues accessible to the non-financially inclined. I wish he could do the same for my portfolio. Final analysis: 5 stars (and I may bump that a quarter percent if things start to overheat due to irrational exuberance)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Understanding The Enigma","review":"I found this book to be very well written, introduces you to one of the most powerful man in the world in a lucid and friendly manner.

I enjoyed the book thoroughly."},{"rating":"2","title":"ALAN GREENCHRIST SUPERSTAR","review":"I liked the book but one should have to wonder why so much power should be given to a government agency that decides how our economy should be. When Greenspan's Fed decides to apply the brakes to the economy, the ones who work hard and play by the rules suffer. In fact, they suffer in spades. I wonder if Greenspan or any of the Fed governors or any of the FOMC officials ever experienced a layoff? Since the Chief Executive is held accoutable for the health of the economy, why not put him in charge of interest rates? Put him and the Congress responsible for price and wage inflation, instead of this technocrat and his unaccountable government agency. And as a token to America's workers...put Greenspan and the Fed as a sub-agency of the Treasury and into the spotlight where they belong."},{"rating":"1","title":"People Magazine Bio","review":"An extremely shallow book that offers no insight how Greenspan thinks or makes his decisions. The reason Greenspan is such an interesting character is how he has managed to constantly adapt to changing market conditions. The real story would be why and how he came to the decisions he did, but this book just reports his actions. There is almost no economic anlysis or justification. Anyone looking to gain some understanding of Greenspan's thought process will be left wanting and extremely disappointed with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrid","review":"This is the worst softening of a great band since Metallica.

I picked up their latest and must say I am quite saddened to find that VOD has turned into a wannabe chimaira/switched/Damage Plan. Is it still hard? Yes. Is it straight ahead hardcore? No. The first 5-6 songs plod along with no real originallity and nothing to differentiate one between the other. The 2nd hald of the album picks up a little, but not much.What happened to these guy? They were a hardcore band and now they have tried to turn into some kind of metal band and they sound the same as about 8 other bands out in the market today. If this is their attempt to appeal to a larger fan base then i expect they won't have a record deal in 2-3 years"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tape measure not as good as the old one","review":"I used my last Keson 100' tape almost daily for 18 years. As an appraiser, I would measure 2-3 homes a day. That's a lot of use before the last one wore out. I was really happy to see that Keson is still making the same tape measure.My original review was rated excellent which I cannot change. My updated review would be one star...lousy.This is an edit done on 10/09/07. Unfortunately, the new tape did not meet the quality of the old tape. The vinyl strap on the side of the housing broke after two weeks on the new one. Then, about 2 weeks ago, the metal pin that guides the tape in and out of the housing broke. Now, as I reel the tape in or pull it out, the so called strong fiberglass reinforced tape is shredding in 12\\" to 18\\" strips off the edge of the tape.Too bad they can't make 'em like they used to as this new version of their old tape is no good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be Sure of What You're Getting Here","review":"We need to warn people here.

I decided to do a Google search and found the Rain Collector still available after all these years. The price was less than the 1995 MSRP so I went for it. It was delivered in no time. Installation took about an hour and it plugged right into the existing junction box for the Weather Wizard II. A simple test confirmed it was operating properly.

In previous books Sean's character was intriguing, so I found myself looking forward to his story with great anticipation. When I finished the novel I didn't have any better insight into his character than before I began to read it. The entire novel fell flat from beginning to end. There was no tension between the characters, no excitement, no intrigue. In short, the mediocre character and plot development resulted in a shallow, disappointing book.

I almost skipped this book (wish I had), but I thought the character of Sean Galen was so great that I didn't want to miss his book. I felt the character was done a complete disservice with this book. I felt none of the spunk or witty behavior that he exuded with Eve. I lost the sexy vibe which made his character so interesting. Pairing him with a hard woman like Elena seemed bitter to me, and I wanted his life to be sweet. Not sappy, but to feel good going down.

I could pretty much write the next Johansen book and not be too far off by just following her usual formula. That said, however, I actually though this book was slightly better than some of her other recent formulaic efforts. She actually found some other word to use besides bull and damn, and I actually thought the interaction between Galen and Elena was fairly well described and believable.

I was hoping for a \\"smoking gun\\" in the long debate about who (probably plural) amongst Cronin, Yawkey and Higgins is responsible for this black mark in Red Sox history.

The music in this DVD doesn't match the dancing, and since the girls aren't professionals, the dancing itself is pretty awful. If you want to see girls dancing to techno music, go to a club.

The author is very politically driven in this book. Arafat is a saint, but Sharon and Bush are warmongers. The Republican Supreme Court judges gave Bush the election from Gore.

Michael Droshin has present a valid piece of research into The Bible Code. It is very easy to understand and an enjoyable read. I do believe in The Bible Code. The issues I have with this book are two things. The first has to do with Mr. Droshin claims he meet with world leaders on this subject. I just don't buy it. Maybe it is true but I find it hard to belive. The second has to do with 2006 in The Code. Without giving the book away basically 2006 was to be a WW3 with millions dead and other bad things.

In the first page of the book, Drosnin starts out by telling us he is an atheist, then goes on to say he believes that there are hidden codes in an ancient book that is supposed to be written by GOD. So either he is a moron, or a liar. He frequently makes off the wall conclusions, simply because he found 2 or 3 words encoded near eachother in the torah.

All of the examples are in Hebrew and no effort whatsoever has been made to translate them to support the author's argument that they are code words.

Indeed, within two days UPS delivered a brand new one.The Rules are very thin, bend easily and seem flimsy at first, but once you begin using them, their durability becomes apparent and measuring into the 64ths of an inch with precision is easy.Having the three different rules is an added bonus, as not every measurement is a straight line across a straight edge. Yes, it was tough to reconcile the nearly $72 for the set, but these rules seem that they will last and will remove the guesswork out of any measurement.Hope this helps."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book gets 5 stars!","review":"I thought this was such a neat book!

The book is really just a play-by-play of his 'career' -- and the writing is slow, at times meandering, and just boring. I've concluded Flynt himself is boring. Among other things, I would have loved to hear about his long feud with High Society publisher Carl Ruderman (one of the world's richest and least-known porn kings), but Flynt bails on us. Instead he opts to recount the demise of his wife and the legal particulars of his case with the Supreme Court. At times it's a bit reminiscent of the undoing of Lenny Bruce, standing on stage reciting court transcripts to a crowd expecting jokes. In the end, it's all just sad, pathetic and SOOOOOO old."},{"rating":"1","title":"America NEEDS more pornographers!!!","review":"The fact that Larry Flynt has earned the undying gratitude of the Democratic Party is more of a sad commentary on that party than it is a compliment to Mr. Flynt! Yes, he's worked his way to the top and is now a millionaire --- but we could say the same about John Gotti or the Reverend Jim Baker, and I certainly don't respect them!No, I'm afraid Mr. Flynt is a flash in the pan, who will soon be discarded by his Democratic Party friends as the 2000 election nears. And these books showing him to be a heroic figure will fizzle out as well --- after all, Larry Flynt's loyal readership requires full-frontal nudity in all of their reading material."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice, but a few minor comments","review":"Pros:Nice user interfaceNo problem with game installation (ordered CD from Amazon)Beautiful classic tile set - best one I have seenCons:Cannot change tile set (in case you wanted to)Cannot get a \\"hint\\" until you are down to 1 remaining matchNo reshuffle \\"of the remaining tiles\\" when you become blocked - game overI really miss the reshuffle.

Handy size paperback, with practical information that doesn't insult your intelligence. Especially helpful in describing transportation options.

Very insightful in how to make the most of your time. I found the descriptions of things to do especially helpful and the hotel and retaurant reviews and price ranges were accurate, for a refreshing change.

This book also said nothing about a departure tax at the airport while it seems to address alot of fluff.You would do better with other guide books.

There is no CD that I play with the frequency of this one.Al's ability to craft a song into an event cannot be matched by anyone.

I believe that this book is one of Gilman's finest. She writes on a higher level than in most of the Polifax mysteries: this tale is more in-depth, and builds the main character to such detail that we can hear what she hears, know what she thinks, and feel what she feels. Here Gilman reveals to us the character, rather than just telling us a story. This extraordinary character plunges into her life memories and takes us with her, and her recollections, which come alive again, are intriguing and touching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining story!","review":"I listened to this book on tape. I did not particularly enjoy the reader; I felt the main character's voice was too high, and another's voice sounded too contrived.

There is a lot about Africa, African tribes and the Sahara, which is wonderful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very well written, but the immorality spoils it","review":"I have always liked Dorothy Gilman's Mrs Polifax novels. They are well-written spy stories with danger and suspense, but no graphic violence or immorality.In Caravan, Gilman writes a much more serious story of survival and hardship. Without giving the plot away, i will say that the story is riveting and well written. What kills the story is the sexual immorality she includes-not just mentioning it, but JUSTIFYING it! No matter what hardships we face, we MUST stay true to right values and live a decent life-this the main character (Charissa) failed to do.When she found out that her husband killed her lover, she contemplating killing him, but didn't. Good-it showed she has decency and a knowledge of right and wrong. But this evaluation was turned on its head when instead she enters an adulterous relationship for DECADES!

The other books in the series are pretty true to the paper versions. I can only think that the demise of Justice House/Yellow Rose and copy rights had something to do with this much torn a part version. Or it was simpler to convert her website version of this story, since this e-version pretty much matches up with the way the story goes on her website.

I actually never made it through the first disc of MSAA. It's not funny, it's not cute, the animation starts out fine, but goes south FAST. The dub is just dreadful, and I am normally a fan of dubs, especially ones from ADV. On top of all that there seems to be no real plot. I've stopped watching maybe 2 anime at some point in a series because of sheer boredom, but never because of being completely irritated and disgusted.If you're a serious anime fan don't let the cute girls on the dvd cover fool you into thinking this is worth your time!

I understood that point based on the title and didn't need to be reminded on each page.

Once the car was moving, it would float and the static would get worse. Part of the adapter (that fit inside the lighter) got stuck inside and wouldn't come out. So, now the metal ring doesn't keep the lighter in place and it comes out and rolls on the floor.I took the transmitter back for a refund and got a cassette iPod adapter instead.

Adjusting the position relative to the vehicle antennae helped only slightly. After deciding that the unit was defective, I contacted Belkins who were very helpful and returned it for another. The new unit worked identically to the first. I'm absolutely amazed Belkin, as a leader in ipod accessories, would put a product like this on the market. However, the bottom line is that it does not work. It is ridiculously poor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love the concept, hate the product!","review":"I think this product design concept is great. I love the flexibe arm size. It fits great in my car. The CRAPPY part. I live near metro st. louis and i could not hold a signal ANYWHERE! I always had some intereference. whether it was fuzz or the signal going in and out. This product did not meet my expectations, especially since the back of the package states I should have crystal clear sound. This is not true.

I want something to work!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This things a piece of junk...:(","review":"This is the letter I wrote to the company who sold this to me on Amazon...I did receive my Belkin Ipod car transmitter but it works horribly. I spend over a half an hour in my car trying to tune the thing. It's user interface is clunky and confusing, along with the horrible reception my radio picks up. I use a similar device to tune in my XM radio so I know it's not my radio. That and the fact that my IPOD nano, which it's supposed to be compatible with, doesn't fit any of the interchangeable plates. So when it does sit in the cradle it's constantly connecting and disconnecting from bouncing around.My main issue with your company though is that you don't refund shipping. And this piece of junk will cost me more in shipping to send it back to you than I'll get back from it.I don't know why this thing got such a high rating, it's a piece of junk, my old discman radio transmitter worked better than this. Must have been why it's on sale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty disappointed","review":"I was really just looking for a charger unit and couldn't find one so I bought this one.

This made this unit effectively useless to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT COMPATIBLE WITH 3G NANO","review":"Contrary to what the technical details of this product says, it IS NOT compatible with the 3RD GENERATION iPOD NANO. This website says it is, the Belkin site says it is, the BOX even says it is.But it is not.After opening the box and consulting the User Manuel (where is clearly lists that it is not compatible with 3G) I called Technical Support and was reaffirmed that 3rg Generation needs a different transmitter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!!","review":"I purchased this device with high expectations. I tried the device in 3 different vehicles and with 3 different types of ipods (Nano, Mini, and Video Ipods). I followed the manufacturer's instructions each time and the device failed to work!

Do not waste your money or your time with the Belkin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Design, Poor Sound","review":"I love the flexible arm on this thing, and it's fairly easy to set up presets. Unfortunately, the sound quality is pretty bad. As others have said, when you're in an area with a lot of radio stations (I'm in Boston), there is tons of static and overlap. I've tried open frequencies all along the dial and nothing seems to work very well. I'm convinced this is a failing of the model, as I've tried the Griffin RoadTrip (which doesn't have as nice of a physical design) and the sound quality on the RoadTrip is stellar. Someone please combine the best of both models!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nope.. this doesn't work well","review":"I tried this with my 5G Video iPod in my Toyota 4Runner and was very unhappy with the results and the product was returned. I opted for the Tuneflex version from Griffin that uses the cassette attachment (included). I've been quite happy with the Griffin Tuneflex version and would recommend that for those with a cassette player. Search Amazon for 9865-TFLEX5G. Also... my wife has a Nano and it works in this also."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unexpected quality of the product...in a bad way :(","review":"It seriously broke into pieces after I used it a few times. There was this annoying piece of plastic that pretty much ruined the whole product. I tried to put everything back together but missed the spring and never was able to find it again. I was quite upset. Luckily I got well taken care of by Belkin and they were able to send me a new one again.TIP for using this product: once you plug it into the car charger, don't take it out if you don't have to. Unplug the ipod instead; otherwise, you would end up just like me."},{"rating":"1","title":"FAILURE","review":"Waste of my money...Its a waste of time and money, this doesnt work as it says that it doesEvery station i tune to ALWAYS has static save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"High hopes but disappointed","review":"My Honda Odyssey has a pretty sensitive FM receiver. I notice that it pulls in stations better than our Honda CRV or our Honda Civic. So I thought the Belkin FM transmitter would work fine for my iPod Nano. Unfortunately I tried many ways to obtain a clear transmission without success.The Nano would play through the car stero, but always with unacceptable noise. I tried locating areas across the FM band from the bottom to the top where there were no stations broadcasting and set the transmitter to those frequencies. In every case it did work but with poor results. I will be returning this otherwise well designed unit. Sound is what it is all about but this unit failed to produce.I will be using a cassette adapter instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"works better than itrip","review":"This model has been working much better than the Griffin iTrip (one with just the small dock connector). Very little static and consistent performance. Really like how it plugs into the lighter socket to give it stability and ease of use during driving. So far, so good. Just had the Griffin iTrip replaced with the model with the charger cord and though I haven't used it yet, it looks like the cord is going to pose a hassle and create clutter.

The markings are easy to read and it works perfect for what its made for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice tool, manual not so good","review":"This is a very handy and useful tool, it's used every time I do woodwork instead of my T-square. However, the manual is more of a reference and assumes that the reader is an experienced construction framer.

The iconic Swanson Speed Square has been an important construction tool since 1925 when it was invented by Albert J. Swanson. Since then the name \\"speed square\\" has become a generic term, but every speed square is not a Swanson, just as every facial tissue is not Kleenex. Swanson is still the best. I purchased the 7\\" Swanson to use along with my trusted 12\\" model. It comes with a little instruction manual, which can be used to find all the uses for a speed square.

They have aided me in developing an understanding of the Word of God and how the Kingdom of Heaven operates. I could write a short essay on this alone but this book was a call from the Lord. It reminded me that as Christians we are born to intercede or stand in the gap(pray) for our loved ones, lost ones, our nation, elected officials and anyone the Lord places on our heart. It's one of his pocket sized books but it gets the point across with clarity.This book is excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sun Electric '- Via Nostra","review":"VIA NOSTRA sees Sun Electric dive into a free-jazzy new direction, from the \\"Tee\\" to the breaks of \\"Fried Ed.\\" They don't abandon their chill-out tendencies, as with \\"Things You Like To Hear,\\" but the bass on \\"Tortuga\\" makes it absolutely clear where their groove is headed; indeed, \\"Blue LED\\" makes the bass even funkier. Even the electric tones of \\"Emanon\\" carry the suggestion of jazz with them, while \\"El Trauco\\" brings in some dub reverberations. There's still a moment of tech-related brightness with \\"7:07,\\" which plays with a near-acid tone (something that'll be reprised on \\"Sierra\\"), but it's the playfulness of \\"Bonga\\" that stands out the most, a bobbing joyousness. Alas, VIA NOSTRA would be Sun Electric's last album proper, but with the release of LOST & FOUND, we can at least see where they would go with this sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware","review":"I recently purchased this item for my daughter for christmas.

The slick silicone material doesn't stick at all, is very lightweight and I love how easy it is to clean as opposed to metal scrapers. Since my favorite bread shaping surface is a plastic mat a metal scraper is impractical, too.The only reason this didn't quite make 5 stars is that the material is very easily nicked along the edges and I fear that, after awhile, accumulated nicking of the edge will reduce functionality, but at 5 dollars replacing the scraper even once yearly wouldn't be a big deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Handy kitchen tool","review":"Love this product and was thrilled to find it available at Amazon.

He does a great job of covering Luther Wright's \\"(If Loving You Is Wrong) I Don't want To be Right\\", but he missteps on the Motown classic \\"You Keep Me Hanging On\\". \\"I Was Only Joking\\" is one of his most underrated songs and one of his best."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Love This CD!!!","review":"This is a great CD!!!

I can recall whe nearly every track on this record was played on FM radio. The lead off track Hot Legs really cooks with some gritty vocals, cool lyrics, and solid instrumental support. You're Insane and Born Loose continue this trend.However, Rod shows a tender side as well. I Was Only Joking is a very touching tune with lyrics of a relationship gone sour. Some good acoustic and electric guitar solos add to the tune. You Got A Nerve is another tune with an intriguing vocal and a nice low key instrumental touch.All in all this a good CD before Rod went the disco route and alienated many of his rock n roll fans.

Why is Charles is ostracized by his community while Bennett is rich and successful? and as the book delves deeper into the nature of the crimes of these two men, it really got me to ponder about soceity's value systme and the personal code of ethics that is encouraged.

It also explores family heritage as the right in which Charles Blakey struggles to define in the novel as whether to sell his family heirlooms found in the basement or turn them into a heritage museum preserving his families legacy. I found the relationship between Charles Blakey and Anniston Bennet complex, intriguing, and suspenseful as they both explore there reasons for living as well as the consequences of past actions.

Don't want to give away the ending, but I waited in vain for the twist that would repay the time wasted. Some growth, understanding, something.

I really liked it -- somewhere between Bukowski and Pynchon, but with the direct of O'Henry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dirty Little Novel","review":"Charles Blackey is down on his luck and needs money. So he accidently finds a white man who wants to live in his apartment. Fine, but where's the good parts in his book? And besides, the book is really dirty. I don't recommand it to anyone under 16. The book is nothing but a poor depiction of some of the nation's pariahs live their lives. The writing style is terrible. Dry and simple, looks like a high school kid wrote it. Don't waste your time reading this book. There are a lot of better ones out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly Tripe","review":"Charles Blakey is a paper-thin character who divides his time between masturbating and making racial generalizations. That's because Walter Mosley delivers a steam-of-consciousness plot that lacks direction or purpose. Anniston Bennet, the guy caged in the basement, just wants to commit suicide for having grown a conscience. The characters are inconsistent, the writing is sophomoric, and the only thing worse is the monotonic reading by Ernie Hudson. I borrowed the audio novel from the library and still I'd like my money back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very dark, but strangely enjoyable...","review":"This book was definitely a trip. Part \\"Twilight Zone\\", part \\"The Stranger.\\" It was a book that I wished I had picked for my book club so I would have someone to discuss it with. There is a lot squeezed into this short novel: it's a psychological profile, debate on race and ethics, and a complex, literary character study all rolled into one. I am definitely glad I picked it up. I would also recommend it to others in order to have someone to bounce my ideas off of. This is a book that I think would be even better after spending some time looking back, drawing connections, and discovering new subtleties. The depravity human beings are capable of is pretty unsettling, and many might not like the idea of letting down our guard and exposing ourselves as Charles Blakey does in this novel. He is often naked, literally and figuratively, as is his captive, but not in the way you might think. Great writing here, Mosley!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, riveting, disturbing","review":"I'm a fan of Moseley's non-Easy Rawlins' works. I read Futureland earlier this year and when I saw that his latest novel, THE MAN IN MY BASEMENT, was not part of his mystery series I grabbed it from my local library. This novel is mesmerizing---I read it very nearly straight through. The main character Charles is despicable in many ways---lazy, selfish, corrupt, a thief, a womanizer---and yet Moseley makes us like him---mostly because Charles is very, very funny.Mr. Bennet, who Charles agrees to allow to stay in his basement in a makeshift prison cell in exchange for a pile of cash, on the other hand, is pure evil. Compared to Bennet, Charles is a saint, and as Charles gets to know just how evil Bennet is, it helps bring about his own redemption. The kinds of evil Bennet is involved in gives me chills even several weeks after reading the book. An excellent study in the real definition of evil and responsibility."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent...nuff said","review":"unlike many of the other reviewers, I'll leave a brief REVIEW and not a BOOK REPORT that hits all the major plot points and gives away the flow of the novel. (god bless the internet and its accesibility) the writing is excellent, pulls you in from page one. the writer has a way of drawing flawed characters and making them human and makes the reader empathize with their plight, even if they are characters, for the most part, we wouldn't want to spend time with in the real world. Walter Mosley gets to the heart and soul of his characters, something that many writers fail to do. He's not afraid to show you the unprettiness of his characters and this country. What amazes me is how many reviewers are genre-stuck and not able to grade a story on its on merit. \\"it's not a mystery..\\" DUH. This novel is another expample that shows why Mosley is great. it's not about race or genre. He's an excellent writer, period."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Man in My Basement","review":"This was a strange story. I have to admit that I did feel the need to turn the next page to find out what was going to happen next. I liked the overall plot of the story but to get to the end you had to read through a lot of weird stuff. I read this fairly quickly because it flowed nicely but was dissapointed with the ending. This was my 1st Walter Mosley novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bizarre and not believable","review":"I was truly drawn into the novel during the perhaps the first half of the book, and then it just got too bizarre. First, Charles is such an unappealing character and the man in the basement is just not believable. I'm sure there is a lot of philosophy regarding atonement, evil, sin, justification, etc., but it just didn't touch a nerve with me that I was hoping that it would."},{"rating":"1","title":"different but disappointing","review":"This very different story piqued my interest at the start. Charles Blakey's life seems to be going nowhere, with financial problems mounting up. Then, a strange man (Annisten Bennet) appears and offers Blakey a lot of money to stay for a short time in his basement. The mystery behind Bennet, and Blakey's search for himself through his non-slave American roots impelled me to keep listening to this audio-book. Ultimately, I was not satisfied either with Bennet's secret surfacing not the transformation of Blakey as he deals with Bennet and other issues in his life. This unorthodox story was ultimately neither believable not engaging. Even a good reader could not rescue this somewhat disappointing short novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"This novel makes you think:","review":"\\"The Man In My Basement\\" by Walter Mosley is wonderful.First of all Mosley writes in a style that just grabs you from the opening sentence and pulls you along until the final sentence. The rawness of his characters alone is interesting enough to keep you reading. Add in an intriguing story line, and a great cast of characters, and you have a recipe for success.The plot of this book, (as you can read about in a lot of other reviews), is very different. While reading you are always pondering the different things that are going on.At the end of the book I was left thinking deeply about the different things that happened throughout the book. For a piece of fiction to do this, that is something indeed special. It feels as if you were taught a lesson, and you didn't even know it. Very deep.Do yourself a favor, and give this one a read. You should enjoy it.Happy Reading!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ceviche: Seafood, Salads, and Coctails with a Latino Twist","review":"A great book for all those who like fish.

I thoroughly enjoy well-researched, stimulating novels, and CODE does not disappoint. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply amazing..........","review":"This was my first encounter with Dan Brown's writing, and it certainly will not be my last. This is one of those rare novels that gets you to think about your own beliefs, and has you racing to the internet for background information. Being non-religious myself, I found myself looking for information on the Holy Grail, and the way that Dan Brown interprets the Bible. Prepare to be impressed with his character development, and the history involved in his writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm simply amazed","review":"Clearly everyone and his dog has had his or her nose buried in this book for quite some time, but I didn't get to it until it was loaned to me by someone whose opinions I respect, then recommended by another friend in the same category. Oh my goodness. I'll acknowledge that I only read three chapters. The writing was so bad I just couldn't get any further. Combine that with the assertion, in the third (and my last) chapter that a spring evening in Paris was \\"winding down\\" prior to 1 AM (as evidenced by the main, purportedly, character's observation that he had been asleep 20 minutes prior, which time was given as 12:32). A small detail, yes, but evidence that this author has so little respect for his audience that I would not invest any more of my time when there are actually well-written, non-pandering books out there to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mid-Life Mystery: Nancy Drew meets Encyclopedia Brown","review":"Did you ever wonder what happened to those young crime fighters when they grew up? Now you know. A murder brings together Sophie the 30+ cryptographer and Robert the 40+ historian forcing them to answer a series of riddles and puzzles in order to solve the caper. The puzzles have all the sophistication of writing in lemon juice and reading messages in the mirror. Can you think of a five letter word associated with Sir Isaac Newton? If not then you will be left spell bound by cryptic hints like \\"we could use some fruit from the tree of knowledge to solve this one!\\" Except for the occasional references to sex to remind you this is adult fiction, this is the Hardy Boys all over again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Participating In The DaVinci \\"Lovefest\\"","review":"I am constantly amazed at the assertions I hear people make regarding the excellent story contained in the DaVinci code. It was embarrassingly weak and the characters were very one-dimensional. The Bourne Identity it wasn't. I took solace in the fact that the derth of religious information, Brown claims to be fact, was really quite interesting. Unfortunately I wasn't allowed to enjoy even that for very long as I have read or heard most of his assertions debunked by those far more in the know in their particular fields than Brown. I wish I could have the time spent reading The DaVinci Code back so I could substitute a read of real entertainment or intellectual value. In the past I have avoided reading fads. It was a mistake to deviate from that rule; I won't again."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!","review":"I actually had to force myself to slog through this book. The writing style is similar to \\"The Bridges of Madison County\\" - a flowery style filled with gratuitous adjectives and ridiculously over-stated descriptions. The plot was alternately absurd and boring. I read this book based on all of the hype and I really expected something interesting. Except for a few brief moments, I found this book to be very easy to put down. The entire experience was an insult to my brain cells."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazing Rubbish!","review":"This books start out very well but truly disintegrates in the end. Sloppy, poorly believable plot and no story. The very end is a mess. Avoid this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you kidding?","review":"You'd have to be fool to think this is a good novel.

Funny thing is that someone bought it. This may be the biggest piece of formulaic BS I have ever read. The writting is very weak, and although I am not an historian, I doubt any of it is true. Maybe it's me but, I cannot believe all the hype this book has recieved. It frightens me that so many people speak so highly of this trash. Maybe that's also why Sarah Palin is so popular. HYPE, HYPE, and more HYPE, with an intriguing cover. USA! USA! USA!Save your time and money and skip this book. Or better yet, if you want to see great writting read the Best American Travel Writing. They also have collections for sports, science, and short stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read for entertainment","review":"This is the second Dan Brown novel I've heard, the other being \\"Digital Fortress\\". The story line is a history teaser. It makes you want to go look at DaVinci's paintings, read up on Sir Isaac Newton, and find out about the Priory of Sion and the Knights Templar. I was disappointed in one area...these so-called experts couldn't figure out the codes to open the cryptex. When they said it needed 5 letters to open it, I knew right away that it would be some name for Sophie. After all, her Grandfather made the thing. The same thing happened in Digital Fortress...the smart people took too long to figure out an obvious password and an obvious secret identity of a character.Overall, I would recommend this book, but go in with an open mind. It is work of fiction based loosely on historical fact."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dry but Interesting Reading","review":"This novel is written rather dryly but is intriguing enough to keep the reader hooked. It is actually quite fascinating. You may also want to do some actual historical research on many of the topics it references and alludes to. Importantly the reader should never forget that this is a work of fiction but expertly presented."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Code\\" Blues","review":"Watch out Michael Crichton, you've got competition. With \\"Da Vinci Code,\\" Dan Brown rivals you for one-dimensional characters, preposterous plot and misogynistic flourishes. However, he does you one better with his crypto-paranoid conspiracy theories centering around the Catholic church and forays into third-rate art criticism. The appeal of \\"Da Vinci\\" is mystifying, especially when Brown's \\"Angels and Demons\\" is a far better book, if you want a religious thriller. That one actually thrills. This one just makes you snicker with its completely inept writing style, character development and plot. Never has Paris been so slighted in fiction-this book is supposedly set in the Louvre but Brown's Louvre has all the atmosphere of a mall poster shop. If you must read a thriller, try Dean Koontz. If you must read Dan Brown, try \\"Angels and Demons.\\" This \\"Code\\" isn't worth cracking."},{"rating":"1","title":"biting his lower lip","review":"Dan Brown sits in his study, biting his lower lip. \\"I think it is all true.

The wind whispers warnings as it passes the Eiffel tower.If you liked this you'll love the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait... What's the big deal again?","review":"I finally got around to reading this the other day and I can't figure out what's the big deal or why it's any more popular than, let's say, any formulaic Dean Koontz (or pick any number other thriller stories where guy and girl run from some mysterious baddy.) The surprises are totally unsurprising and weakly hidden from the reader. The whole Teacher character and how his identity was kept from the reader -- when it would have obviuosly been revealed early on by a certain character he interacted with -- was ludicrous and unfortunately one of the main plot elements of the book. Many other of the plot devices were just as poorly handled. The payoff was totally retarded. I laughed out loud numerous times while reading and any time I actually got into the story some bad choice pulled me right back out of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Formulaic Fantasy From Brown","review":"Bottom line: If you have ever read any other Dan Brown novel then you're going to get through the first few chapters and suddenly feel an overwhelming sense of d��j�� vu. This is dime-store literature at it's best, or worst, depending on your preference. Definitely not worth all the hype.On the bright side, if you happen to love dime-store novels, and have never read any of his previous \\"works,\\" then you should be content curling up with this one. (I used the term \\"works\\" loosely, thus the quotes.)Brown novels are different settings, the same predictable \\"surprise\\" villains, and fashionable Hollywood thrills. Ad nauseam. Amazing that this book has garnered so much attention, but religion + conspiracy = controversy, which amounts to a \\"bestseller\\" even if the writing is sub par and clich��."},{"rating":"2","title":"An exciting, fun and intelligent read!","review":"What's great about this book is that it is loaded with quality historic research and conspiracy theories that make you start to wonder about things you never thought of before! This is the kind of novel that gets the intelligent person hooked and keeps them up all hours of the night just to find out what's going to happen next! I don't read a lot of novels, but this one is smart, exciting and just a lot of fun! A must read for those interested in The Holy Grail."},{"rating":"2","title":"truth or just controversial?","review":"Yes, this is a very controversial book.

A good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredible poor research","review":"While its not that poorly written, this is by far the worst book I've ever seen when it comes to research. People concerned about condemning the church or setting up Mary Magdalene as a cult figure may enjoy it as a potpoiler, however if one is into somewhat real history this is a laugh.I just can't understand the fuzz about it, whether its from Christians or conspiracy believers. This book is just not worth the effort.

I found it boring, contrived, at times cheesy/hokey, and very poorly written. Everything needs to be explained to the point where the text loses its momentum. The villains are laughable, the way the main characters figure things out is so damn contrived that I found myself laughing out loud. People who are getting mad about how it goes against the Catholic Church and all this other nonsense, I have one thing to say to them: Don't bother! It's a waste of breath!

Only one person does all of the voices, which wouldn't be too bad, but for the fact that the narrator's French accents are straight out of Pepe Le Peau and Inspector Closeau. The male voices are low and guttural and the \\"female\\" voices are high pitched and cartoonish. The result is unintentionally laughable. What were they thinking when they heard the playback?

Somewhere around page 20 I numbly realized the author wasn't even trying to give each character his own dialogue; conversations only serve to drive the plot 80 miles an hour to the end of this longwinded puzzle. And that's all there is to the \\"Code\\": riddles and word games wrapped around a framework of a lite detective story.

However, as another reader said, the plot lost steam about halfway through, and I had to make myself finish the book. I got to about 10 pages from the end and put it down because it was just taking so LONG! Those last 10 pages were somewhat interesting, but like the rest of the plot, it was just too conveniently wrapped up.

But if Dan Brown wants to try it, fine.I find it kind of funny that everyone wants to read this book, which is supposed to be SERIOUSLY good, when it is rather silly, drawn-out and corny. I mean, how can someone making a pretentious dork of themselves be considered REAL literature? This is a book for your romance novel reading granny. I highly doubt, as someone who has her Ph.D in English, that this book will ever transcend time on its positive merits. ;) I certainly wouldn't waste your time on this garbage (I'm sorry I did;)) when there are so many good books out there.

Applying the Magellanic Code of Circumnavigation, I have come up with three possibilities: a) Langdon was really staying at the Ritz Best Western which is located north of the Opera House near the airport; b)2+2 really does equal 5; or c) someone didn't consult a map of Paris as part of the research for this book. It sort of spoiled the rest of the story for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"An authentic best seller!","review":"I just read an article on the BBC of some of the books that some people have read, but then deny reading them, the da Vinci Code is one of them. I admit it, I read it. Did I enjoy it? Yes! Do I recommend the book? No. Why? Because it is trashy literature, plain and simple. Did I watch the film? No way!!!Everybody was talking about the book at the time, so I had to judge it for myself. There's no doubt that the book keeps you engaged, and it is an easy reading, on the other hand it is quite predictable and the epilogue is very childish.If you have a couple of days, or less, to kill then read it, but that is only if you have nothing else better to do, but if you are looking for any type of intellectual challenge, then read you cereal box or play with your belly button, you'll achieve much more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor translation?","review":"Ok, I have neither bought nor read this 'book', and never will, but I read the excerpt.If English is Dan Brown's first language, then he has major problems, unless he is a 10 year old slow learner. Ok, he has made a lot of money from this piece of rubbish, but why not take a quick course in creative writing beforehand to learn the basics of style.The Hardy Boys books are advanced literature in comparison!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just what I thought","review":"After reading Angels and Demons I didn't rush into this book, and my reservations (and myriad bad reviews) were borne out."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm Hooked!","review":"Okay, honestly the only reason I picked up this book to begin with, was to find out what all the hype was about. From the moment I read the first sentence I could not put it down! I'd find myself eagerly awaiting 5 o'clock each afternoon, not just because I was getting off work, but so I could read more! My ultimate goal was to finish this book prior to the release of the movie. Now I wish I hadn't! This is another case of the book being so much better than the movie! But that's neither here nor there. Anyway, Dan Brown is a skilled author. His writing is easy to follow and very descriptive without being overly \\"wordy\\". I absolutely adore Robert Langdon as a main character! He's like Indiana Jones in a tweed jacket!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cleverly misleading","review":"I read this book in one setting, which is a testament to this book's ability to keep one's attention. Nevertheless, anyone with a little knowledge of religious studies or art history will find Brown's blatantly erroneous accounts of Christianity's development or Da Vinci's work unsettling. He comfortably weaves such falsehoods with fascintating historical information in such a way that the average reader will be unable to distinguish the two. At best this is manipulative, however, at its worst, it is grossly deceiving and unprofessional."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAAAD Fiction, worse author","review":"If there was a NO STAR selection, it would have been NO STAR. Interesting premise, incomplete research, hack author. Overuse of adjectives, especially the word SENSED, thin plot line, absurd police chases. Only humorous idea is he made the plot in France so it was the FRENCH police that are so inept."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many twists and turns","review":"Since this book was displayed everywhere and such a hot topic--I just had to read it. Towards the end it was utterly painful-I was wore out with all the twists and turns. Sophie and Langdonalways managed to escape just at the very last minute. Awe come on it's just not possible.I kept reading this book because Iwanted to find out who THE TEACHER was--it was never revealedand this is unforgivable.The idea that Jesus may have had analternate life is very interesting and something to ponder butplease do a better job of writing the novel!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good original story without originality","review":"I am not into adult novels (I am a 5th grade teacher I read novels appropriate for their level that do not have bad words-...) but this one has an enterntaining story. It is original in the sense that it takes historical myths (The Holy Grail which is the backbone of this novel) and makes it a novel. Besides that, there many historical assertions that are innacurate (read the previous reviews). At some points I laughed at the absurdity when it refers to Jesus being married, having children with Mary Magdalene etc... As a person with some theological background and a Christian I found it enterntaining. To add to the innacuracies:the phrase \\"P��lido como una fantasma\\" is incorrect. Fantasma is masculine and should have the masculine article \\"un.\\" I should know this because I also teach Spanish.Take this novel as its face value. IT'S A NOVEL! NOT A HISTORICAL ACCOUNT. ENJOY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The DaVinci Code","review":"I love mysteries that are also thrillers. However, with this book, the mystery was secondary to me (I actually guessed the Teacher fairly early on :)...... all the interesting historical information was the intriguing part of the novel for me and led me to do additional exploration re Leonardo Da Vinci. I think I can safely say, this was one of the best books I have ever read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hate God? You'll love this book!","review":"This is a fairly well thought out thriller, but it becomes apparent soon enough that the main thrust of this book is that The Bible is not the word of God, but just a collection of fiction.There are plenty of good books that don't make a Christian feel dirty reading them. This one is a waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jesus was of the Royal House of David","review":"In reply to 'A reader from St. Louis MO United States '- Even if you do not except that Jesus was the Son of God- he was of the house of David (KING david) and therefore of a \\"Royal\\" lineage"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a best seller?","review":"I haven't read Dan Brown before, suspecting that there was little substance vs. style in his writing. However, after seeing this book on the best seller list for so long I gave it a try. Darn it, I was right the first time. As I read, three issues stood out. First, all the research could have been done in two days on the internet. If the author spent more than that, it was not apparent. Second, character development was cartoonish at best. You could not feel sympathetic or engaged in these shades. A cryptologist who can't recognize an anagram? Bah! And finally plot development,as if you could find it. This book is similar to so many others that believe that excessive description will make up for a lame plot with overworked and trite devices. No doubt, Mr. Brown will make more money in the future, try not to let it be yours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Writing Contest","review":"I just read this book. I can say that it has really given me great pleasure...laughing out loud at the incredibly bad writing! What a bunch of overblown melodrama. Some of the dialogue is so bad, I couldn't decide if it was more like an episode of THE HIGHLANDER television show or some of Dr. Evil's lines in an AUSTIN POWERS movie. Someone should start a Dan Brown/Da Vinci Code bad writing contest. As for the story itself, it is definitely a poor imitation of an Umberto Eco novel. Brown has about half the erudition of Eco, and a quarter of the writing skill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much ado about very little","review":"I have to give Dan Brown credit; he had a great idea for a book. But he has neither the skill or the ability to carry it out. I can't find anything in this book that justifies the enormous hype it has received. The quest for the Holy Grail, and what the Grail actually represents, is fascinating, but Brown tries to wrap it in the stale trappings of a pedestrian whodunit that doesn't do the material justice. The characters are one-sided and don't really engage us, and the writing is just plain sophomoric. The idea of Mary Magdalene as the wife of Jesus isn't original with Brown; it's been done much better by other writers, most notably by Jos�� Saramago in \\"The Gospel According to Jesus Christ\\". I came away from this book with a deep sense of disappointment. Brown had a good idea for a book, but somebody else should have written it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not a good story","review":"Ok, Dan Brown, we know you're smart; stop hitting us over the head with it! Why don't we use some of that energy that was used in all those puzzles and plot twist to make some likable characters. Heck, I'd settle for un-likable characters over these flat stereotypes. There was a very smart idea in this book. But instead of letting it shine dully through a well crafted novel, Brown lets it blind blatantly without any sort of veil. I felt like I was at a lecture at some points in this book. And when it did that, this novel lost any saving grace. I love learning new things when I read fiction, but more than anything I love a good story and the Da Vinci code was severly lacking in that department. Online customer, save yourself the hassle; I'm sure a movie is on the way, save the time and fork up the 7.50."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good at first then....","review":"When the book begins, it definitely hooks you in with its creative storyline, promises of secrets, conspiracy theories, etc.; however once the main characters leave Paris, the story becomes absurd. As many other reviewers have said, the dialogue is horrible and ineloquent, the chapters are left with \\"cliffhangers\\" that are honestly really lame, and the lead character seems to know EVERYTHING. I mean, can he be stumped for more than 5 seconds? It gets so ridiculous. I'm not going to reveal the ending, but the longer the book progresses, the worse it gets. If you want a quick read with no pre-requisite for thinking, borrow it from the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"mediocre page turner","review":"Yeah, this book keeps you going, and it's probably great for a long plane ride, but my god, do a better job with the writing and the characters! These characters are supposed to be solving the 'greatest secret of all time' and yet they are completely clueless. Some of the least imaginative writing to make the best seller lists. And just for perspective, I am not Christian and have no opinion on either side of the Jesus/Mary Magdalene debate. If you like conspiracy theories and secret societies, go read Eco's Foucault's Pendulum. Now THERE is a book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What is all the fuss about?","review":"The writing is bad. The characters are one-dimensional stick figures. The plot is unbelievable. I had to force myself to finish the book. I am not sure what Mr. Brown is trying to accomplish here. There are many interesting references to Christian and pagan myth, but these are not seamlessly woven into the story, rather they are delived as little lectures that jerk us out of the story. Given the extremely interesting buidling blocks of Jesus Christ, Mary Magdalene, the Holy Grail and Opus Dei, this could have perhaps been a great book in the hands of a good writer. As it is, I wish I hadn't bothered. In fact, I am irritated that I wasted money and time on such an amateur effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"provocative ideas, shallow characters","review":"Robert Langdon is a bookish Harvard professor who needs a holiday. The symbologist is then drawn into the an implausible mystery involving the holy grail. The existence of the Priory of Scion, Jesus's marriage to Mary Magdalene or the arbitrary decisions at the Council of Nicea raises interesting quetions about the the church. One would expect that a scholar would be revealed to show more reflection and background on these topics. But his character, like Sophie's, is intended to be more visual. Rather than having read the book, I could have waited for the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly better than its reviews","review":"I didn't think I'd even like this book from all the negative reviews as well as the fact I usually only liked high-tech sci-fi or cyberpunk books. But I bought it, read it, and was surprised. It's pretty good. I recommend this book, and I also recommend other Dan Brown books, which I have now also read, that are equally good, such as \\"Angels and Demons\\", \\"Digital Fortress\\", \\"Deception Point\\", as well as really good sci-fi and cyberpunk like \\"Altered Carbon\\", \\"Ringworld\\", \\"Ringworld Engineers\\", \\"Prey\\", \\"Neuromancer\\", \\"Darkeye: Cyber Hunter\\", and many more."},{"rating":"2","title":"A quick read that encourages further discussion","review":"While this book does read like a screenplay, I still found it intriguing, entertaining and apparently very well researched. It moves along quite rapidly and creates enough suspense to make the read worth it. Some of the scenes were over the top, but it's still a good book.One positive aspect of the book is that those who read it are actually looking into the many premises offered up by Mr. Brown. Whether reading other books on the subject, researching on-line, or just talking with others, people are actually using their heads. In my book, anything that encourages learning is a good thing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Clever by Half","review":"This very popular book uses alternative ideas of the history of Christianity as the basis for the plot. The author has taken a large number of crackpot ideas about the history of Christianity and European history in general and stitched them together to produce a conventional thriller. In general, all these ideas center around the common theme of a hidden or secret history of Christianity suppressed by the Church. The plot elements are cleverly integrated using a series of puzzles. The overall story is cast as a kind of Grail legend with virtuous knight (a la Parsifal) and an evil sorcerer type (a la Klingsor). The quality of writing, however, is poor. The characters are schematic and exist only as devices to move from one gimmick to another. The action of the plot per se is rather silly. Not recommended, even for light reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too much hype for this book.","review":"After hearing a lot of great reviews for this book, I was excited to read something \\"fascinating\\" and \\"fast-paced\\". Unfortunately, the book didn't live up to the hype. I am a voracious reader, but this book took me three weeks to finish--I kept putting it down and reading other novels. I found this book slow, far-fetched (not the premise, but the massive scavenger hunt by two normal people), and predictable. The author's use of the term \\"sacred feminine\\" every ten pages or so was irritating. I did not find the book upsetting nor enlightening. I don't understand the uproar made by some people, its a work of fiction, and not very good fiction at that. I probably won't watch the movie since the author has said it's just like the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"completely historically inaccurate","review":"The book is mildly entertaining, but readers beware of the gross historical inaccuracies littered throughout the book.

And - it simply didn't hold my interest very well. The plot seemed fairly lite, and the characters weren't well developed. I probably scanned through about 1/4 of the book's pages.

Brown has created a labyrinthine plot full of suspense, style, and damned good writing. If you read only one book this week, make it The Da Vinci Code."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intellectually Stimulating, Fast Paced","review":"What amazed me about this book was the fact that Brown uses the thriller genre, where every chapter ends in a cliffhanger that leaves you breathless, but it's jam packed with fascinating historical nuggets, ALL of which serve to drive the plot and keep the reader guessing. It's a dozen puzzles within a dozen puzzles, but all of them clearly logical and based on ancient paintings, writings and historical facts. Just when you think he's said something ludicrous, you go to the painting or edifice named and it's all there.And though he demonstrates how much of the Church is based on myth -- all thoroughly documented -- he manages to do it without being sacrigilous or mean-spirited. Once I started reading, I could not stop and had to finish it. A perfect blend of pop adventure and deeply intellectual research. It all fits and it doesn't cheat. Brilliant."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Da Vinci Scam","review":"This review contains a spoiler. First of all no art scholar would refer to Leonardo as Da Vinci. Secondly, Leonardo painted St. John in the same effeminate manner in another portrait. No conspiracy there.Dan Brown is pulling our collective leg and getting rich doing it.I am amazed at the praise this amateurish novel is getting. Are people so anxious to defame the Catholic church that they will lower their standards to such a level? Next thing you know the Hardy Boys will be exhuming Martin Luther and Nancy Drew will be translating the Koran."},{"rating":"1","title":"not so good","review":"Low grade fairy tale. I understand what people are saying about it \\"just being a book\\", but Brown himself claims the historical references are fact. Actually, they are not fact and the stretches of conjecture used are rather insulting propaganda. Why do people reward this? The people that like this book say it makes them think, but if it made us educate ourselves about history then Dan might deserve his money.It's easy to be condescending to readers that become angry at \\"a work of fiction\\" but the book is not presented as fiction and many readers are believing it.People should be saddened by this book and what it represents but instead they turn their attention and anger toward a movie that teaches love and compassion in the face of brutality. What does this book teach? All teachings require faith - which deserves it more?

I've spent precious time and money, and feel I owe my investment to the author as well as myself to finish their story. I read every genre of fiction: mystery, romance, western and sci-fi so my tastes are broad and sometimes quirky, so I expected to enjoy this book. Instead, I had to put it down before I threw it out the window. The story was infamatory towards religious groups and oddly lacking in truly interesting characters. The synopsis was the most entertaining part of this book. The author (or his publisher) obviously has an exceptional P.R. machine, because that seems to be the strongest point of this endevor.This reader's review is save your money on this over-hyped, boring, bizarre book."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this book!","review":"I did not want to put this book down!

But of course, the book promises to be no more than a thriller, and it doesn't even succeed at that level: anyone who can't spot the real killer has no experience with potboiler fiction.This seems to be the kind of book--I believe Michael Crichton started the trend--that is written in order to be turned into a movie. I'm sure it will be a success; and equally sure that I won't see it until it appears on Showtime.Read Eco's Foucault's Pendulum to see how a much better author treats similar material in a much more sophisticated way."},{"rating":"1","title":"read the original - it was better","review":"if you found this book as lacking in intellectual stimulation as i did and you would like to read the excellent original from which the idea for this book were culled, read Focault's Pendulum by Umberto Eco.

I teach religious studies, and have no objection to reading creative reinterpretations or fictional accounts.

Within 5 chapters I could predict the structure and conclusion of every subsequent chapter. The shameless manipulation of narrative to allow for more of the author's ideas to be disseminated became more and more transparent. While not as badly written or as execrable as the Celestine Prophecies of some years ago, Da Vinci shares the same basic problem which is that underneath it all, it is a mediocre book with a host of interesting ideas. On top of that is the problem that some of the ideas are whoppingly spurious. See other critics for some glaring examples. The list is too long for a short commentary.On the other hand I read it in one day and it was an effortless read. And that seems to be the current qualification for greatness these days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!","review":"If you are a catholic, please don&#65533;t waste your money in a book that calumniates the Catholic Church with all kind of accusations including murder, fraud and others.

Although I am not a member I have known Opus Dei quite enough to make me grin when reading a member committing murder or the Opus Dei Prelate involved in the plot.By the was, almost all the text written in Spanish is full of grammar mistakes, perhaps like this review but at least I don&#65533;t earn my money writing books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Da Vinci Code warning label","review":"I enjoy well written novels.

I would recommend reading pages 119-121, 124-126, and pages 231-233 to see if you are comfortable with the author's theme. For those who are not, it would be a waste to purchase this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheesy Farce Fiction","review":"When I first picked up The DaVinci Code, I'll admit I was curious. Almost immediately the reader is catapulted into an intense Parisian murder scene at the Louvre. I was into it, really into it, I actually devoted up to six hours of a saturday to read this book. However, I found myself shaking my head more and more saying, \\"no, this is ridiculous.\\" And then there just came a point when I said no to the whole idea of it. The distortion of facts about DaVinci and his paintings is just TOO much. Not only does the book become a complete farce, but the writing deteriorates at a rapid pace as well. The whole thriller starts unraveling with laughable coincidence that springs up from places where you would most obviously expect.The person I really felt bad for after putting this book down was the man who had been defamed with no way to save himself, that would be Leonardo DaVinci. Readers would be wiser to pick up an actual art history book that truthfully follows this master painter."},{"rating":"2","title":"The loan reviewer","review":"I finally decided to read the Da Vinci Code.

I feel that Dan Brown has a gift for pushing the boundaries of Innovation. I do not consider myself to be a religious person, but very much so a spirtual one. I was not at all offended by anything depicted in this book, because it is a work of fiction. I am always suprised when people express such strong views about this book, because it is a work of fiction.

I'm only 14 after all. When I started reading it though, I literally couldn't put it down. There was adventure, mystery, riddles, interesting facts and even romance. I was stunned that an author could actually put all of that into one book and make it work. The Davinci Code most importantly, raised questions that before I didn't bother thinking about. I know that I couldn't possibly know if the questions raised were valid or correct. All I know is that the book caused people to look at new options and ideas, even when their religion compelled them not to. If a book can accomplish that, cause people to think about explanations they had just taken for granted, then that book is really something. It's up to the readers to think what that something is.

Two-thirds of the book is copped directly from the references the author gives beginning Chapter 60. The other one-third is a weak attempt to merge mystery religion with what the author believes is a thriller. Anyone who has read even one of the four historical studies cited by the author knows all about Da Vinci's so-called checkered activities and his flakey antics such as backward writing and cryptograms.

Most of the \\"evidence\\" that the author relies on is flimsy at best. Some of the theories he presents on various symbolism are intriguing to contemplate, but they are very weak as presented in this story. As far as the story involving a French Cryptographer, what was the need? There is nothing more complicated in this mystery than a few grade school riddles and a simple rotational substitution cypher. If the Priory of Scion was seriously trying to protect their secret, why would they pick passwords like sofia and apple?

The plot involves and ancient old secret society: the priory of sion, the conservatice catholic opus dei, fighting over the greatest cover-up in the history of the world. The Holy Grail, is not as believed jesus cup. The author is a christian, and at Dan Brown's website a bibliography is included. As to wether or not the disciple at the left hand of Jesus, in the painting of the last supper, is clearly a woman. Anyone who claims other ways really should take a look at it.

Cutting to the chase, everything else not withstanding, even if Jesus and Mary Magdalene had married and produced a \\"royal bloodlike,\\" the Passion, Crucifixion, and Resurrection still stand on their own right. In other words, \\"What difference does could of this make in relation to one's faith and one's perception of Christianity?\\" The only difference is much padding to Mr. Brown's bank account.

However, this book is pure fiction and at the end I can't stop thinking: \\"...and so what?\\".The value of what I can get out of this book is rather limited just because it is just pure fiction. We all like to dream about knights, kings, fairy tales and so on. How about something more relevant for today's world? The internet, religious sects, marketing, changing social structure...these are the things that are part of our daily environment.For readers that are looking for a book that describes and studies the \\"code\\" of our modern society I have a recommendation: Social Code by Cass Tell.

Afterwards the days were spent time at the Louvre beginning at the Arc du Carrousel for a walking tour of the area around the Louvre.Without a doubt, the tour brought out the best in Chagall, and allowed us to appreciate characteristics of his work that we might have noticed before, but not had the occasion to fit them together into a complete story - and a special respect for the story certainly is what set Chagall apart from his contemporaries.

I solved the three main codes in less than a minute each, but our expert cryptologist and religious symbolist aggonized over them for several pages. Also, the author is oblivious to the facts and folklore that provide the backdrop of his book. As just one example, the Holy Grail derived from an earlier pagan legend about a magic cauldron, not the idea suggested by the author. This is the worst book I have read in ages.

I also purchased 3 booksof da Vinci's paintings. I wanted to see how accurate hisstory was. Oh my, yes it seemed so true! Not only is the main character a symbologist, so informative, he hooks up withthe daughter of the murdered curator to form a team that totallypiques our curiosity. I have gotten my nephew at NYU, my best friend, and assorted others to read this book. I also pass on my printed web-pages and da Vinci books. Many are those who are not into top-ten fiction.

Although he keeps the same storyline -- Robert Langdon gets a call in the middle night, is drawn in to solve a grizzly murder with the help of a beautiful and smart woman -- this plot is rich in its historical facts and details, alluding to theology, art history, and symbology.The only drawback (pardon me for being so critical) is that Brown's writing style reminds me of books recommended for 9th grade readers.

And yet the talentless fair-haired boy, Dan Brown, just keeps smiling vapidly and watches the cash keep rolling in, to my increasing frustration. Even putting aside the blasphemy and the_monumental_bald-faced lies about historical figures, we're left with plenty to object to in the forgettable characters, the convoluted and boring plot, the laughably predictable plot \\"twists\\" (he employed most of them in \\"Angels and Demons\\"), and the bland, puerile writing.

Basically it is not a very good book. It certainly must have an excellent advertising agency behind it to produce all this media attention and indeed is undoubtedly making this author quite pleased with himself and well-off financially.The premise is an interesting one to fictionally exploit. Why not? It's only purports to be a mass-market thriller, not a theological treatise. Unfortunately, it is poorly written, poorly organized, and doesn't provoke much in the way of interesting speculations. As an historian, I find several mistakes only due to poor research, albeit these could be overlooked for the sake of plot - if one could find a truly enticing plot to follow.There are some remarkably excellent fiction authors currently producing works that can be educational and thoughtful and, at the same time, just plain fun for a light read. Save your money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much ado about nothing...","review":"It's hard to believe this book has generated so much hype. Brown is nothing much more than a Robert Ludlum wannabe; to call him a pale imitation is too charitable.The book's improbable and (rather) abrupt denouement makes one wonder whether Brown suddenly exhausted his store of tiresome plot twists or, alternatively, his publisher simply (and mercifully) placed a hard ceiling on his page allotment. Either way, the result is unsatisfying. While Ludlum is no Graham Greene (or even a John Le Carre), he certainly does this kind of thing much better than Brown.Brown's numerous historical canards have been well-documented elsewhere and serve only to further undermine this puerile effort.

The two main characters are experts on symbols and codes...but you wouldn't know it unless you had been told. Every other line is \\"It was so easy, I should have seen it before!\\" Then the bad guy...it sounds like Dan couldn't figure out who he wanted for the bad guy until he was forced to show him. Awful. Most of the book was sitting and listening to information. Lecture lecture lecture. RUN FROM THE BAD GUYS. Lecture lecture lecture. RUN FROM THE BAD GUYS. Lecture lecture lecture.

And, no, it's not just because it \\"challenges\\" \\"traditional\\" Christianity. It's because the so-called \\"challenge\\" was so weak. Even just a little bit of historical research blows Dan Brown's theories out of the water. Constantine collated the New Testament --- really? Who does he expect to believe this junk. The gross historical inaccuracies aside, the writing isn't very good either, honestly. There was a lot of potential for a good novel here, but he wasted chapter after chapter preaching and trying to persuade the reader. Just not a good book.

I read this book while away on a business trip and it filled my nights after hectic days of work. I recommend this book for someone who just wants a fun thriller that is a page turner and not so difficult to follow that you need to be on your toes while reading. The premise is intriguing enough to make you want to delve in and the twists and turns are suspenseful enough to make you want more. Maybe the character development leaves a little to be desired but what is there is fun and entertaining.

It reads like an adult Nancy Drew mystery, and in the end, is little more than a boring entertainment. Dan Brown should take lessons from Ken Follett on how to write an engaging suspense novel.What confounds me is the public interest in the novel. Thee must be 10,000 midlist novels that tell a better story, books written by authors who can't afford to quit their day jobs. It's all very depressing.

The book, it seemed at first, was very good. It was riveting and exciting, with so many questions to answer that I couldn't put it down. Even the religious theories were very compelling. However, it soon came to a sudden stop. Dan Brown, in an attempt to keep things interesting while exerting as little effort as possible, starts to flail around blindly in his attempts to further unfold his theories. If this were not enough, he causes his characters to take a disappointing dive into the depths of stupidity, having them stumped by amateur riddles and kindergarten clues in an attempt to drag out his nonsense. The book is then wrapped up in a \\"ha ha! tricked you\\" manner that did not appease my anger at having wasted my time. The book, on the whole, reminded me of the stories that I used to write in middle school...which is very sad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Premise, weak characters","review":"I had heard of all the hype about the Da Vinci Code, and finally, out of curiosity, I picked up a copy.

What I did not like about the book was the poor character development. Langdon and Co. were there only as plot pushers. The main story was the Grail. I felt that when the story was over and done we didn't know any more about Langdon than when we first started. He only sprouts information at the right moments, as with Sophie Neveu. They seemed to know everything under the sun about symbols and codes, and yet we didn't know anything more about them.However, the premise was good, and that is why I give this book 4 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW, HAS THIS GOT THE INQUISITORS GOING, OR WHAT???","review":"It is a breath of fresh air to finally see the subjects of the repeated Inquisitions out of the closet!! With the thousands, maybe millions of books to look up on this history, try Kessinger Publishing for a few of the oldies.

I'm no historian or teacher, but I do know a thing or two about writing. I wouldn't want the tedious, never-ending job of finding out where to get ANY of this information.But somehow he did. He did it well, too. This book is already pretty much a classic, and I think it should be. I wouldn't tell anyone to take it as 'the gospel truth'. I don't think it was intended to be.

Dan Brown's book keeps you on your toes (and fingertips) as you turn each page.Brown's incorporation of sites, art, and history create a world in that wonderful realm of \\"conceivably true.\\" It is this quality that draws the reader in. He mixes facts with fiction so seamlessly that the reader is left with a very immersive and almost believable experience. My only complaint is that the plot seemed to lack some of its previous strength as finish.However, this book is definitely a page turner. If you want a book that will keep you until the end, this book has my recommendation. I enjoyed it enough to read Angels and Demons as well, but enjoyed this one more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story!","review":"\\"The Da Vinci Code\\" was actually quite good. It was a great mystery novel with nice twists and turns that nobody would expect to happen. The storyline was incredible, and the explanation of the historic background of everything actually was not boring. Remember though, that the facts of these cults, groups, and others are not factually correct, most of them are just explanation of conspiracy theories. The author really built somewhat of a relationship with the characters in the book and the reader. It was a real shocking and disbelief when a character turned out to be someone else. Overall, this book was a good read, it was very entertaining and was not dull at all. I totally recommend it!BTW, this review is coming from a 14 year old."},{"rating":"1","title":"ignoring an issue","review":"everybody keeps talking about this dumb bookbut what about this charge of racism?why are y'all ignoring this Q?"},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst books I have ever read","review":"The plot of this looked so intriguing and had the potential to be an entertaining, educational thriller. What it emerged as ,however, was a sophomoric waste of time. I found myself angered at the predictable, ridiculous plot and the thin characters. Without exaggeration, this book would be great for a junior high student looking for an adverturous novel. As a well read adult, I was appalled that this poorly written garbage would ever get published.If I could count the number of times a hidden code was magically deciphered through a simple \\"Oh my God, I've got it!\\" it would outnumber my digits. I am apalled that people are not only buying this [...] but enjoying it. Funny thing is, I bought it with the intent of reading a mindless, entertaining novel. What I got was a waste of time and money.

His claims have been uncovered for what they really are (lies) by REAL historians and theologians. As a Catholic, I was unable to enjoy this otherwise well-written book because his claims were so false and so insidious that they greatly upset me.If you do decide to read this book, keep in mind that it is FICTION, not fact."},{"rating":"1","title":"Something's missing","review":"As with the other Dan Brown books I've read I wasn't happy with this one. The plot is great, the characters are wonderful. But somehow I felt like I was reading Brown's notes about the plot and people rather than walking in their shoes and listening to their thoughts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"This was a wonderful read. I could have done without some of the blood and guts, but many of you would probably miss the violence if it was left out.I was delighted with the story: an explanation of what is meant by The Holy Grail in some quarters. (This definition certainly makes more sense than most others.) I particularly like to read about first century events, and since I don't really admire the Church in Rome, this sort of story certainly resonates. Altogether a wonderfully plotted and executed book, and I cannot praise it too highly.

I am going to ask for my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bad book and a bad narration","review":"The book is an overwrought thriller, long on unimaginative descriptions and short on real people. And the narration for the book on tape is dull, dull, dull."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hype -- over the top","review":"Sixty million copies sold -- but don't expect thisbook to be sixty times more thrilling than a thrillerthat sells a mere million copies.The idea that Jesus had offspring must be the maingenerator of commercial success. The action andsuspense alone could not account for it (it is aboutthe same as what Dan Brown does so well in his otherbooks).I wish I had read this book before all the hype. Iwould have expected less and enjoyed it more. If youhave not read it yet it might be too late for you. Ifand when you do read it, you may suffer diminishedreading enjoyment due to excessively raisedexpectations.

The detectives and prime suspect all do things that strain my ability to suspend disbelief beyond the breaking point. The history and explanation of the hidden codes were interesting, but could probably be explained better in a straightforward and scholarly book better. The story started out unbelivable and got worse from there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pap & Treacle","review":"This leviathan of inanity has generated such a tremendous amount of attention that I was suckered into reading it. After doing so, I honestly can't understand why it got any attention at all, let alone the busloads it did... it lacks both the emotional depth of even a mediocre novel and the energy of a Grade C bus-depot thriller. I honestly can't fathom why, after reading this terrible book, one would want to do anything other than try to eradicate any trace of it from one's brain. I could say that it's numbingly pedestrian, that it's deplorably ordinary, or that it's unsettlingly tiresome, but in the end what matters is that \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" is dull, dull, dull..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utterly boring","review":"A \\"cut and paste\\" replay of the author's \\"Angels and Demons\\". Badly written, not a trace of humour, stuffed with boring non-information. I stopped reading when I reached 2/3 of the book. What is the sense of this all? I have still no idea.People who dare to compare this inane scribbling with e.g. Umberto Eco's work should be flogged on the spot.Incomprehensible that these nonsense should be on top of bestseller lists, which proves the craziness of the booksellers world."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the hype????","review":"OK, so this seems to be \\"THE\\" book to read right now. And so, hearing the raves (although not from anyone I know personally), I went out and read this one. What a disappointment. The big flaw in this so-called thriller is that Brown doesn't let you in on the solution. He tells you only so much, giving you obscure clues that you could NEVER figure out, introducing clues at the last minute. And giving you an oh-so-pat ending that you feel like throwing the book across the room when you finish it. And the characters are incredibly dumb and unconvincing (a cryptologist that doesn't recognize DaVinci's backwards writing? Gimme a break!). Trust me: spend your time reading something more rewarding. Like, maybe, the National Enquirer?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pulp fiction","review":"This book is poorly written. There is nothing here but a bad copy of Robert Ludlum's writing style and a feeble attempt to popularize Freemasonry. The only reason for the hype surrounding this book is that it attacks Christianity and Catholic church. As a computer security expert, I find cryptographic references in the book laughable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Addictive And Good For You","review":"When I tell my friends about this book I tell them it is like \\"Crack\\"...You can't get enough of it, and never want it to end. I went nuts for this book. It appeals to my interest in religious studies and history, but mostly it appeals to my escapist desire for an excellent mystery/thriller.I've given three copies to friends in the last month. When ever I find out someone is a reader, I ask \\"have you read The DaVinci Code?\\" I'm gushing...hope you like it as much as I do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting premise but poorly plotted","review":"I read this book because it was in the listing for our book club. I thought it started well, but petered out pretty quickly. The characters are poorly drawn. Plotting is weak. Not much happens by way of story. Mr. Brown the teacher seems to have triumphed Mr. Brown the author. Reach Foucault's Pendulum instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Holy Book?","review":"From the first page of the Davinci Code I couldn't put it down. I thought the book was intriguing and original for several reasons. First of all the subject matter, I thought the subject matter was original and captivating. I have never read a book like this, where religion and history are the most interesting part of the book. I also enjoyed the plot. As I said Brown pulls the reader in on the first five pages and he keeps you attention the entire book. With many plot twits and surprises to keep in entertaining the book was good from the beginning to end. The way things are explained in the book was also good. The book can be read by many ages and many levels of readers. I didn't think the book dragged on too much either. The length was good. It kept the reader interested bit didn't drag out. The ending of the book is strong, though a little cheesy. Overall I enjoyed the book a lot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Historian's Nightmare","review":"I'm very disappointed by this novel's flaunting of itself as being correct in its details, though essentially fiction. For instance, the finding of the dead sea scrolls is misdated, and that's only the beginning of all the errors. It's sheer fantasy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maddening!","review":"Brown's purpose, an intellectual demonizing of Christianity, avoids direct confrontation of scripture, rather he cowardly chooses to use the ancient institution of the Roman Catholic church as his stand-up substitute, then fails to state \\"facts\\" truthfully, all the while hiding behind the fiction genre. Poorly developed, weakly entertaining, intellectually both maddening and disgusting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keep to the Code","review":"The Da Vinci Code by Dan Brown is a magical thriller. Brown pulls you through his well written book by shifting plots frequently. He keeps you wondering, who is the next target, what is going on over there, or when will these situations fall together?Brown's manner of writing, itself, is enough to claim and hold your interest. The short chapters keep you thinking where he could go next in his amazing story. Robert Langdon, a professor and writer, and Sophie Neveu, a cryptographer, must decipher the codes given to them from the scene of a murder in the Louvre, the famous museum and home to the Mona Lisa.I recommend this book to anyone who has a few spare days and is in the mood for this fast-paced thriller. You will catch yourself searching for answers to the puzzle in books, on the internet, and from random people or close friends. I really enjoyed Brown's brisk-paced storyline and hope you do the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Book Disturbs Me","review":"I do not like the premise of this book. It casts doubt on Christianity and the true nature of God. It disturbs me that this is on the best-seller list, and that millions of people are being exposed to this rubbish. Your time would be much better served by reading The Purpose-Driven Life by Rick Warren. He describes the truth of Christianity with such wisdom that your life will be transformed forever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Take away the controversy...This book really sucks","review":"I am convinced that Dan Brown is a angry lesbian. Actually I would guess that Dan Brown's wife is a angry lesbian. Seriously if you just read this book and forget all the \\"lame controversy\\" that this book tries to create you will find that The Da Vinci Code is very poorly written. It reminds me of some dollar store mystery novel that should be thrown away and never be talked about. The characters are hardly interesting, the dialogue is poor, and the facts in the book were not researched at all. If you are thinking of buying this book grab a screwdriver and stab yourself in the foot. If you do buy this book take a look in the mirror and I guarantee you will see a overwieght lesbian women probably in your 30's with a bad mullet and a long upper-lip 'stache.

Dan Brown really masters the art of keeping the reader on pins and needles in this work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Silly at times, but always entertaining","review":"I enjoyed the book for the simple reason that it kept me engaged at all times. Some of the details were really a bit silly, but it would be hard to find a more entertaining read. I don't go in for the underlying conspiracy theory, but it was interesting how the author was able to weave together so many different threads to at least make the case."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could not put it down","review":"This book was sooooo good that I could not put it down even while I was on vacation for a weekend in Las Vegas.

Fascinating little page-turner!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fantastic for all the wrong reasons...","review":"This book was the worst! I laughed out loud the whole way through. Dan Brown treats you like a moron so you feel like a genius when you solve the riddles before his world famous (but not very bright) experts do.Two page chapters! Ridiculous dialogue!If you've never before heard the theory that the bible might not have been written by God Himself, never used a library search engine, and never been outside of your home town, then this is a book of challenging ideas and exotic landscapes.I admit it - I loved reading this book - but it's not getting any more stars from me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent writing for a 3rd-Grader","review":"I don't like to judge books without reading them, and sadly I did finish this sophomoric (is there such a thing as freshmanic?) work of \\"literature.\\" Dave Barry said it better than anyone else by \\"writing\\" his own version in a column that was not only wittier, but more engrossing -- all in about 1/2 page. When you have to stoop to cheap cliffhanger tricks at the end of every chapter to make certain the reader doesn't just stop reading and go play on the swingset, you might as well put down the pen and go work in the yard.This book simply confirms the dreaful state of affairs produced by the pitiful public education system we're saddled with here in the US."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a page turner!","review":"I haven't met a person who has read this book and not loved it. I just had to read it and am so glad I did. It was one of the best books I've ever read, and I read a lot. The conbination of fact and fiction really bring the story to life. It really makes you thing about everything that happens in this world that we don't know about."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Read, but the Eight is Better","review":"The DaVinci Code is a great page turner, with plenty of action and intellectual puzzles. It's great for an airplane ride or a day at the beach. The puzzle draws you in immediately and keeps you spellbound.

I did not like the way this goddess worship is portrayed as superior to Christianity. I was able to figure out several of the \\"clues\\" before the characters did and I saw the end twist coming.

I place this book on the same literary level as a trashy romance novel (and I don't see Daniel Steel writing bestsellers). There are FAR TOO MANY coincidents among the main characters. It is VERY VERY poorly researched and the \\"facts\\" are quite inaccurate. Any FICTION writer that has a \\"FACT\\" page at the front of their novel should be shot.

That being said, I also kept getting the sense that I was reading the script for a movie. The suspense is definitely there but reality was really being stretched as the story unfolded. Some of it also tended to be predictable. I figured out the text under the rose on the box immediately and ran to my bathroom mirror to decipher it before reading on. Brown definitely has done a lot of research on the subjects of the Holy Grail, Mary Magdalen, Opus Dei, and the Vatican and has used the information well to write this fast-paced book. But it seems too incredible to believe that all of this story and all the coincidences could fall successfully into place in a 24-hour period. Would I recommend the book? Yes, absolutely.

(We are supposed to be enlightened than the Elizabethan period???)The book is also not a theological treatise. I found reading the theories about the Chalice and Sword, Mary Magdaline etc.like reading theology from Marvel Comics.

If you are even a casual Christian - the premise of this book will offend you. (The following provides some insight but does not give away the ending.) The world created by Dan Brown requires you to believe that Christ had children with Mary Magdalene, and that his rising was fabricated by the Catholic church in its effort to subjugate the world. Ugh! Ron Brown depicts Christians, and the Church was the bad guys, and the goddess worshiping, new age spiritualist as the protagonists.

The uncovering of the ultimate mystery is liken to the arduous process of removing worthless layers corrupting an original masterpiece... tedious and unpromising... and yet intense, electrifying, and most importantly, satisfying when closing in on the final result.

It's got everything from suspense to murder. The book starts out a little slow but towards the middle of the novel is when the book gets better. This book takes place in England and France. Some of the main characters include Robert Langdon, Sophi Neveu, and Fache. What I don't really like about the book is that the author jumps around from chapter to chapter. I found it to be distracting. My brother-in-law read this book and recommended this book to me. Despite the book starting off slowly, I would recommend it to anyone.

A friend loaned it to me along with an art book of Da Vinci's sketches and paintings that were mentioned in the novel. I was very impressed with Mr. Brown's research regarding the Priory of the Sion, Grail Lore, sacred geometry, Mary Magdalene, LdV's artwork, and the research on Rosslyn. What he has written is not new to individuals who are interested in this aspect of religious history. There are a myriad of books out there discussing the Grail Lore. I am just so impressed with his ability to take these facts and weave them into a modern murder mystery, starting out at the Louvre, winding around Paris and its outskirts, until the reader is flown to England and zipping around London. I could *not* put this down. Bravo!"},{"rating":"1","title":"How bad can a book be? Dan Brown tests the limits.","review":"Simply the worst-written book I've ever read. Yes, the plot is (just) amusing enough to keep you reading (though pretty implausible), but only at the expense of having your intelligence insulted by the most clich��-ridden, clumsily-written prose you're ever likely to encounter.Perhaps the rave reviewers don't mind how their entertainment is delivered (just as millions are apparently satisfied with their daily burger), but if you require even the most basic attention to literary style from your reading material, avoid this book like the... um... well, I'm sure Dan Brown would have a suitable expression to use here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Langdon returns","review":"While Da Vinci Code features Robert Langdon, last seen destroying the Vatican Library in Brown's Angels and Demons, reading the earlier title isn't a prerequisite to enjoying this one; Da Vinci Code stands alone. Like Browns' earlier title, this one is a page-turner that is hard to put down, full of twists and turns at a breakneck pace as the search for the Grail becomes a simultaneous flight from attack. It is also a title that can be re-read, packed with interesting trivia that bears re-examination; while it is a \\"fun read\\", full of fast-paced action, there are elements of the novel that themselves might serve as the subject of scholarly analysis; this title defines \\"intellectual thriller\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid, Absurb, Ridiculous and Overrated","review":"I thought that this was one of the most stupid books I ever read. The plot stunk. The history so faulty it was laughable. The characters were boring, underdeveloped and tedious. The riddles were the most ridiculous and predictable. The conclusion....ho-hum.Don't waste your time"},{"rating":"2","title":"ingenious!","review":"Simply put, if you were not to read The Da Vinci Code, you have no idea what you are missing. The way Dan Brown blends fact with fiction so brilliantly keeps the reader turning the pages and wanting to know what happens next. The reader is constantly thrown off center when he or she realizes that the way things appear never really is what it seems to be. The action, the betrayal, the sheer drama keeps the reader begging for more with every chapter. The way Dan Brown suddenly makes obviously clear the riddles that seem impossible at first glance force the reader to look at every riddle with a keen eye in order to look beyond what initially seems to be is absolutely ingenious. If you have not yet read this book, you must read it as soon as possible. Dan Brown has done more than just hit a home run with this novel. Fact and fiction come together masterfully in this marvel of a novel. Go out and buy The Da Vinci Code today!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Well told story, wacky theology","review":"This book is written in an engaging style and the story draws you in quickly. The writer's knowledge of France and Art is impressive. The mystery aspect is pretty well done also, but there are HUGE problems. The bizarre theology and deep and ongoing conspiracy theories are hard to tolerate. The wacky theological presentations are especially offensive to devout Christians, accurate historians, and others who respect the Bible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eco does it better","review":"This is a good beach read but that is about it. My main problem with it was that I had been lead to believe by the hype that it was intellectual. As far as I can see, Dan Brown has taken a mis-mash of tired old theories about the power of the Church and symbology and formed them into a pretty good thriller. There is very little new here in the way of ideas and the writing style is not particularly lyrical (two things that I personally like in novels.) Umberto Eco has done somewhat the same thing in Foucault's Pendulum and he did it infinitely better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stilted and Amateurish...","review":"It GREATLY disappoints me that the \\"facts\\" in this book are conjecture since that seems to be the only thing that is interesting about DaVinci's Code. Now I have no idea if I have truly learned anything new or if it is all fiction. The characters are thinly drawn and \\"grinning\\" in all the most inappropriate places. The plot is fairly predictable. If this is considered to be a GREAT read by mystery readers, I had better stick to literature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much better books are out there.","review":"After hearing a friend rave about how complex and interesting this book was, I decided to sit down and read it. Considering that there are so many great books around with similar concepts, this was pretty much a waste of time. I would much rather have spent the time rereading Eco's \\"Name of the Rose\\" or Wilton Bernhardt's \\"Gospel,\\" both of which pull off the religious-mystery concept far, far better than this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying","review":"The minute I knew who the knight was, the \\"orb\\" was obvious, but I had to spend the next 50 pages reading about a \\"Harvard professor\\" and a police cryptolgist who were not readily able to figure it out. While that ought to be enough, I would also mention that the alleged right/left masculine/feminine equation is factually inaccurate. This book has pretenses of being intellectual and clever, but the characters are shallow, the plot not unpredictable and the pretense somewhat outrageous. I am not catholic so that aspect of it did not offend me. One might read Umberto Eco, Phillip Kerr or others instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"da Vinci, Brown and the Occult","review":"If you enjoy reading books on the occult, mysticism, astrology and abhor Christianity and Catholicism you will like this novel. Brown starts out with a pretty good mystery and then transforms it into the absurd. Christ fathered a child? The Bible and thousands of written records are totally irrelevant when Brown cites \\"authoratative sources\\". My biggest regrets: 1) I not only read this garbage to the end but 2) I actually paid money for this tripe. Even as fiction this premise is hard to swallow."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Illustrated Da Vinci Code","review":"This is a magnificent book.

I have ordered the rest of his books and can't wait to read them. Couldn't have been better."},{"rating":"2","title":"All nighter","review":"I was up all night reading The DaVinci Code--Dan Brown's newest thriller is too hard to put down to let something like a good night's sleep get in the way. He manages to give art, religion and history lessons wrapped in a fast-paced mystery novel. Throw in a little Holy Grail mixed with lost gospels and faith-shakingbiblical conspiracy theories and it's an irresitable pull toward a satisfying conclusion.I wonder if Opeis Dei has put out a fatwa on Dan Brown? If I were him, I'd keep one eye open."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good story, poor writing","review":"Dan Brown may be a bestselling storyteller but he lacks, or doesn't care about, basic writing skills. One of the first things fledgling writers learn is \\"show, don't tell.\\" This book is rife with mundane sentences stating that a character was amazed, or stunned, or worried, or that she/he looked puzzled,confused, alarmed. These emotions should be shown through the character's actions, body language, dialogue.Point of view jumps all over the place. Chapters begin with one character's point of view and before long, out of the blue, it's someone else's, then someone else's.The question is: Why didn't an editor pick up these blatant errors, along with misuse of capitalization (i.e. the Pope, when it should be the pope)?These things were annoying. I finally scanned the last half of the book simply to find out how the story ended."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst part is...","review":"The worst part is: some editor actually thought this guy could write. I stopped on page 50 after 50 pages of annoying writing. I gave the guy the benefit of the doubt, but he just can't write. If you like pulp fiction and are not annoyed by bad writing, you may enjoy this for the plot. I still like the plot and wish someone with talent had written the story. ew. ew. ew! This book reads like a freshman writing workshop project gone bad (and there's no such thing as a freshman writing workshop)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting possiblities.","review":"This lively mystery takes us all the way back to the time of Jesus and Mary Magdalene and to a centuries old search for the Holy Grail. Along the way we meet a fairly interesting cast of characters and events filled with the twists and turns that leave the reader speculating on who is friend and who is enemy, and whether or not the hero and heroine will fall in love. I was intrigued by the author's exploration of the relationship of Jesus and Mary Magdalene and of the way in which Christianity and Catholicism over the centuries have supposedly dealt with woman and their potential for power and influence. The story of the battles within the church and the endless intrigues that resulted were fascinating and, for the most part, credible. I found the end of the book just a bit flat and the tieing together of the various threads somewhat of a stretch of the imagination. Otherwise the book was an enjoyable read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious Fantasy, Bad History","review":"This book was hyped as some sort of innovation when it came out. It was acclaimed by many, but after reading it I thought all these people must have drunk the cool-aid. This was too dense to be enjoyable. I mean the first 15 pages were good, but then it just got plain tedious. And this is coming from someone who thinks textbooks are enjoyable to read. Then it just gets bogged down in Brown's mental paradise which is filled with some very odd images. I mean, really, a great conspiracy to keep all this covered up? Not likely. Anyway, I just thought this was boring and too long. I would have read Differential Equations or something else more accessible than this. Avoid this book!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good book","review":"good book, at times unbelievable but definite page turner. recommend this book for 2 reasons: 1) pretty good orginal fiction thriller (based on the nonfiction bestseller holy blood holy grail) that will keep your attention until the end. 2) makes you think to keep an open mind for EVERYTHING especially any religion and appraoch whatever you read or learn with suspicion.guess they are going to make a movie out of this now with ron howard on board."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books I have read for a while","review":"This was an excellent book that was very difficult to put down when started. A fascinating read with lots of twists and turns of a classic chase, but also so much information about so many aspects of religion. Fascinating. And I am not a religious nut.

So whatever I say now will certainly seem like cliche. However I must say that all the shouting around has done enough to make this book a NYT bestseller.

Dan Brown is a master story teller and I thank him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast paced Fun","review":"This book is entertaining and keeps going from beginning to end. Its amazing though that some people think the story is true. Its the same people who think the United States is covering up UFO landings. They don't realize that most myths are based on a little bit of fact. Of course some people would prefer to read a fictional story and think they've uncovered truth than to study real history.

As a work of fiction I'm sure many people would enjoy it however the book is blantantly Anti-Catholic. Many will take Brown's research for this book as gospel, which is far from the truth. You'll find Brown's so called historical facts regarding the Catholic Church, the Knights Templars, and Christology are completely false. Anyone that doesn't think so should get the other side of the story and click on www.opusdei.org"},{"rating":"1","title":"What is so startling about this silly book?","review":"I am amazed that so many people have been taken in by this trite, poorly written novel. The supposedly explosive subject matter is common knowledge to anyone who is evenly reasonably well-read, and it has been discounted long ago. Books like Holy Blood, Holy Grail, and a plethora of others about Mary Magdalene are based on much spurious information and an abundance of paranoia about and downright hatred of Catholicism. It is easier for most people to comfort themselves by bashing the Bible than for them to read it and live it. I am surprised that I hear intelligent people trumpeting these half-baked theories about a Catholic conspiracy. I thought we left that garbage back in the days when it was commonly believed that Catholics ate babies, drank blood, and stored guns under their churches so they could eventually take over the world. Even my Wiccan friends are laughing at this one!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It takes a great book to offend so many people!","review":"This book was excellent! I couldn't put it down. The writing is top notch, the plot is full of great twists. I see from reading the reviews that a lot of Christians are offended. That's to be expected. The fact of the matter is, Christianity has always concealed things and has always borrowed from other, older religions. To say that Mr. Brown's facts are wrong because they are not supported by the bible assumes that ones believes the bible to be the end all, be all, which many people do not. I like this line from the book: \\"The bible did not arrive from Heaven by fax...\\" It is a myth, just as any other religion is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low brow Protocol of Elders of Zion for Catholics.","review":"Low brow Protocol of Elders of Zion for Catholics."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is fantastic","review":"It is one of the best books I've ever read. It's nearly as good as the Lord of the Rings. And you learn from it all the time you read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reality is more interesting & mysterious than a fiction speculates","review":"Obviously, the objective of the book is, from my viewpoint, to satisfy people's general disposition to love mysteries and also to sell it for the author's and his family's bread next day. I do not think that the author's intention is to undermine some of Christians' beliefs. However, because I am a self-claimed non-materialist, I know, and perhaps also you know, that there is a book published in 1972 by the late Jane Roberts: \\"Seth Speaks\\", in which the non-physical entity Seth spoke about the Christ story. This very story, you agree with me if you read it, may undermine Christians' beliefs more than this Dan Brown's book might have done. However, as Henri Bergson stated in his \\"The Two Sources of Morality and Religion,\\" the moral written in New Testament should be definitely great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The DaVinci Code","review":"This is a very great book. Although it is fiction it does make you think. But on the flip side to that I didn't really care for what it ended up suggesting once revealed. Dan Brown sure has a very strong imagination and works so well for the book. Too bad hollywood destroyed a great book. The book is something that rivets you to keep on reading. I lost many hours of sleep at night because it was so riveting."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail","review":"A re-write of \\"The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail\\"In this book, the authors put forward a hypothesis that the historical Jesus married Mary Magdalene, had one or more children, and that those children or their descendants emigrated to what is now southern France. Once there, they intermarried with the noble families that would eventually become the Merovingian dynasty, whose special claim to the throne of France is championed today by a secret society called the Priory of Sion.Miller attacks the Da Vinci Code on multiple levels, referring to it as \\"based on a notorious hoax\\", \\"rank nonsense\\", and \\"bogus\\", as she points out how heavily the book rests on the fabrications of Pierre Plantard (including the Priory of Sion which did not exist until Plantard created it) who in 1953 was arrested and convicted for just such frauds.~Wikipedia"},{"rating":"1","title":"A gripping thriller with an axe to grind","review":"Dan Brown can certainly write a gripping thriller and the book is hard to put down with non-stop action from beginning to end. What a pity, then, that he has wanted to use the Da Vinci Code to write an anti-Christian tract. Particular venom is reserved for the Catholic Church, or \\"the Vatican\\" as the author likes to call it, somewhat anachronistically when he is speaking of the Church in the 4th Century AD. The references to Opus Dei are so inaccurate that it is virtually impossible to recognise the organisation as it exists in real life. It appears the author did very little proper research, at least for this aspect of the work. I feel his having such an axe to grind really detracts from the overall quality of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS BOOK IS FALSE.","review":"I'm summarizing another review on here, because it seems like most of you guys would rather skim the important negative reviews, then turn right around and still give the book five stars.Didn't you see?!? Those socalled \\"well researched factual ideas\\" ARE NOT TRUE. I hated the book just because it was written badly, but now I know that Dan Brown LIED, hoping that you guys would do what you've done and think that he was telling the truth.This is pathetic sensationalism, and you guys bought into it."},{"rating":"1","title":"just disappointed","review":"I really, really, REALLY wanted to like this book. The premises and subject matter hit my sweet spot. I got sucked in for the first few chapters, then I started getting angry. Repetitive suspense about things I stopped caring about, and factoid paragraphs slammed into the middle of the story as if taken verbatim from a 3x5 note card. \\"Okay, I need to throw this scholarship in........HERE!\\" I'm really not that hard to please. But if I'm going to help an author get rich, for chrissake, I'd at least like him to take some care and try to weave a mildly intelligent tapastry with the story and the scholarship, as if he really, truly cared about real storytelling.I will say, though, that if every history professor took up their subject with the same spirit as Mr. Brown, every child would be a historian.But for stories, this just makes me want to run back and hunker down with my David James Duncan and John Kennedy Toole and Flannery O'Connor."},{"rating":"1","title":"I fail to understand the hype...","review":"After all the media acclaim and recommendations from friends, I was really looking forward to reading this book. And was *sorely* disappointed. In the first place, I think Katherine Neville, Umberto Eco and others have dealt with the subject matter much more skillfully - not to mention coherently. And in the second place, I found it to be simply a poorly written novel. Yes, I admit that it's plot devices were entertaining but the book is one plot device after another with absolutely no character development.

The factoids contained within the work ( the \\"Divine Proportion\\" being a terribly interesting example) are well-spaced and many are totally mind-boggling. They teach the reader without drawing him/her into the spiraling abyss of a pedants mind. The characters are humanly possible, quite life-like actually, and the scenes are well-described, yet still seem to stay to-the-point. I won't bore you with a long-winded summary, considering you have probably perused one in one of the previous reviews.

What kind of airplane is that? I've got to find out more about the Priory of Sion right now! Where's a map of the Louvre?The reader is given a chance to solve the puzzles before the answers are revealed, and the plot line is so compressed (the whole book takes place in under 24 hours) that you never get bogged down.Great for thriller fans or art fans or religous conspirators!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Please, it's FICTION","review":"Many reveiwers have taken the time to explain the historical inaccuracies of this book and his poor writing.

I wish someone would explain why Christianity is the only religion debunked and belittled in books. I gave it one star because it could have been a good mystery.

I have driven past Christian book stores and seen \\"cracking the da vinci code etc\\" and wondered...then I heard a little about the content of the book. The book's actual story probably would have gotten a 4 (an albino monk with prenatural killing powers?), BUT I am definetely on board with the idea that most Christians have not a clue about the real history of their religion and the historocity of jesus christ's life.In a nutshell, the book was extremely interesting.PS-it seems that if you have the courage of your convictions and faith in your god a stupid old book shouldn't even faze you, there are lots of books out there that are much more controversial."},{"rating":"1","title":"How did this book sell even 10 copies?","review":"This book is a masterpiece of poorly written scribble. I cannot understand how this book sold so many copies. The only guess I can venture is that American's watch too much tv and are unaware of any decent literature.

The author wanted a controversary, and he got it, but it wasn't built on strong basis. The point he is trying to discuss is not clear. Did he want to say that Jesus was a man? Or that Jesus was married? Or did he just want to defend pagan rituals? Honestly I can't figure it out yet. The novel also presents flawed information, and that is quite misguiding. It also weakens the author's position. If you want to prove a point then don't tell me lies. I also didn't like the \\"everything is based on a conspiracy\\" tone. Secret unknown organiztions don't control people. The story of Mary Magdalene was well documented years before this novel came into existence. The image of Jesus has been discussed for thousands of years across different religions and ideologies. This book poorly collects inofrmation presenting it in a misleading sensualized manner. I don't recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Thriller","review":"This is quite a good Thriller. Much much better than the movie. Brown does a good job linking everything together (obviously what he does best). It's not my favorite work from him, I like Angels & Daemons much better than this one, but it's certainly a good read and I would recommend it if you like thrillers. The illustrated edition gives you a much better idea of the things they refer to throughout the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"its about marketing-stupid","review":"Someone suggested that you sit down with a glass of wine when you read this book. I would suggest a bottle of vodka or better yet get a hold of the hallucinagenic drugs that Brown must have been on when he wrote this junk. I take it back, if he had been on mind expanding drugs, he might have written something creative instead of this low level pulp. Indeed, he would have had to have been completely sober to put together such a contrived story (screenplay) so obviously aimed at the masses. For his success at so cleverly exploiting the current anti-religious public sentiment he deserves the accolade of \\"genius\\" so liberally handed out these days to the likes of Madonna, Britany Spears, Justin Timberlake, 50 cent and every other wunderkind of marketing.If you don't demand too much in the way of literary talent in your choice of reading, are ignorant of history and or have a huge capacity to suspend disbelief you may enjoy this novel.

Furthermore:1) The use of French phrases throughout the book was unnecessary and pretentious.2) Could ANY police force be that incompetent?3) Could one, just ONE character been interesting (ok the Professor wasn't too bad).The combination of all this and other things really lost me. The book had little credibility just by how it was written (i.e. poor character development, implausible scenarios, predictable romance) leaving aside the controversy of the subject matter. Read another religious based best seller from 25 years ago instead: The Name of the Rose by Umberto Eco."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some like it hot","review":"If you like your biblical revisionism hot, THE DA VINCI CODE is your book.

A whole week of specials devoted to it on National Geographic?

Let me give one example. Brown contends that the cannon of the scripture was put into existence in the 5th century AD., but the fact is, Tartillian a Lawyer and Early church father (in Alexandria Egypt) listed the cannon in total in the second century A.D. Most of Browns theories are not from the early church traditions, but from the middle ages, when the knights Templars came up with he holy blood line. Really this is a rehash of a rehash, holy blood holy grail also did the same thing 20 years ago. It would be better if people sake the truth. One good way would be to read the new testament, The Apostle Paul's epistles totally blow brown out of the water; Read Da Vinci if you must but look at is as fiction; Read the new testament if you want the TRUTH."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard to put down!","review":"I absolutely loved this book.

It was good, but after hearing the hype over the years I expected a magnificent story when, as it turns, the writing was pretty standard. There are some great scenes that the movie portrayed but, overall, the story was actually downright formulaic and predictable. I knew who \\"the Teacher\\" and the pacing is a bit ridiculous. It's fun, entertaining, but not worthy of the critical praise it has received."},{"rating":"2","title":"PHENOMENAL THRILLER","review":"Although wrapped as a thriller, this nailbiting yarn from Brown braces a controversial subject. Little surprise then that it has provoked such pointless debate here in the reviews. Funny, because a bit of literaly license is not uncommon, e.g., in the description of the Pyramids in \\"Death on the Nile\\" (Agatha Christie), or old England imagery from Sherlock Holmes, or the veracity of \\"Blairwitch Project.\\" This is not intended as a documentary, it is fiction, so it is in fact quite a positive thing that it mirrors reality SO closely.As a sinister thriller with a killer plot, be prepared to immerse in speculation, action and intrigue. Fascinating. As a book about religion or cults, assuming that really gets your goat, well it will incite you to get to your keyboard (as it did me) and that's a good thing, people!A highly recommended book to own. I could even stand an entire second reading!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"Dan Brown succeeds in entwining historical data and hysterical myths. If you didn't know there was firm historical evidence for truth in history, you would think this guy was on to something. Sex as an underlying reason for all motivation instead of pure belief. Some will like it no doubt. Not me. I want a thriller with twists and turns and plots that make me catch my breath...this one made me grab my stomach..and I'm not even Catholic."},{"rating":"1","title":"okay read if you like revisionist history","review":"Okay writing, mediocre thriller. I'm not a Catholic, but I am a Christian and I find the vast majority of the conclusions Brown leaps to in this book laughable. Take the Last Supper analysis for instance. That is not Mary Magdalene seated next to Jesus. It is St. John painted in the same beardless effeminate manner that Da Vinci painted him in his St. John the Baptist portrait. The hand and knife belong to St. Peter who would later use a knife to cut off the guard's ear in the garden. Peter is leaning hard on his left elbow to speak to John thus projecting is left hand out.Brown might be right about one thing \\"Everybody loves a conspiracy theory.\\" So if that is you, buy the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"An intriguing tale, but...","review":"An intriguing story but the ending may lead to more than a few raised eyebrows. The author has a talent for writing and storytelling, but the book could have been a better read by eliminating the repititious and rather juvenile fascination with the female anatomy. It detracts from an otherwise well-written story and provides absolutely nothing for the either the plot or the puzzles. Because of that and because the fiction borders too close on the fantasy, I only gave it 2 stars. I'm glad I only borrowed the book instead of buying it and I probably won't bother to read his other publications."},{"rating":"1","title":"Remember, this book is fiction!","review":"Read a real history book if you want to know the truth. Anyone who knows history would think this book is trash."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books of 2003","review":"While Da Vinci Code features Robert Langdon, last seen destroying the Vatican Library in Brown's Angels and Demons, reading the earlier title isn't a prerequisite to enjoying this one; Da Vinci Code stands alone. Like Browns' earlier title, this one is a page-turner that is hard to put down, full of twists and turns at a breakneck pace as the search for the Grail becomes a simultaneous flight from attack. It is also a title that can be re-read, packed with interesting trivia that bears re-examination; while it is a \\"fun read\\", full of fast-paced action, there are elements of the novel that themselves might serve as the subject of scholarly analysis; this title defines \\"intellectual thriller\\". I also read an article in Canyon News in the November issue of Star gazing, that this author has sold his book rights for a movie deal. I hope this movie is just as good as the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Echo of Eco","review":"Brown's conspiracy has been cribbed from the Illuminati Trilogy and Umberto Eco's masterpiece Foucault's Pendulum. If you're under 25, read the Illuminati -- it's not nobel material, but it will blow your mind. Eco on the otherhand needs no introduction -- he is one of the foremost writers of our generation, and Foucault's Pendulum is at once gripping, astoundingly well written and steeped in every historical conspiracy. By contrast, Brown is but a dilettante."},{"rating":"1","title":"Robert Ludlum meets Tom Clancy","review":"I thought we'd all had enough of Jack Ryan (is he GOD by now?) in those paper thin cutout character clones that permeate Clancy's work. I also thought that we'd had enough of the mega conspiracy novels starring the (only millimeters thicker) Jason Bourne who seems to have identity crises without having an identity.Put this irregularly-paced (pacemaker required?) up against more thoughtful work by Le Carre or the brilliant Ian Rankin (Rebus) or even Michael Connely (Bosch) and it pales by comparison.The Da Vinci Code is shallow and pretentious, replete with leaps of untenable measure. It is uneven and unpolished as it moves from breathtaking (gasp) action through the doldrums of didactic lecturing and pseudo moral suasion.As with many works in this genre, it seems prepared for the inevitable Hollywood screenplay with fast-paced exciting (yawn) car chase scenes and cartoon-like characters.I'd rather spend an evening at the WWF thanks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absurd!","review":"Nothing about this book was believable: not the characters,not the plot. This reader got the impression that theauthor was writing it with a movie in mind. On film, hemight have a winner because the artwork and scenery woulddetract from the fact that the plot is absurd. If the actionwere speeded up, people who like adventure films starring Staloneand Arnold whats-his-name would probably eat it up."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm amazed at all the hoopla .","review":"With all the buzz about this book, I was looking forward to a good read. The book starts quickly and definitely grabs the reader, but it's a quick spiral downward to a truly bad novel. The writing is amateurish, the characters and their dialogue absurd and the coincidences simply beyond any credibility. This is a truly bad book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally overrated.","review":"Reading Dan Brown's \\"The DaVinci Code\\" brought me instantly back to the way I felt when I first tried John Grisham: this is the perfect author for someone who either has difficulty reading or doesn't really enjoy it. Strictly eighth grade level, at the most. No one you will ever meet in real life talks or acts remotely like Brown's banal characters in their contrived predicaments.The \\"DaVinci\\" plot could have been actually fascinating, but Brown's shallow, cliche characterizations and simplistic writing style are insulting. Any \\"Harry Potter\\" book is more intelligent and engrossing, not in any way meant as disrespect for J.K.

What more do you want?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Written like a bad soap opera","review":"It was absolutely dreadful trying to read this book. It came with a strong recommendation, but anyone who can call what Dan Brown does \\"writing\\" should never be trusted again. The novel is full of clich��s and is so dumbed down I felt like I was reading the script for some third-rate, low budget soap opera. It blows my mind (as well as scares me) that people are giving this book good reviews. His \\"historical facts\\" are skewed, his prose is indistinguishable from heap of manure, and his story reeks of every bad detective novel or miniseries ever created. I'd recommend 1,000 other books before I'd recommend this one... unless of course the person who's asking is about 9 years old or with a reading level as such.Pass it up, there are better ways to torture yourself..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth yout time","review":"If you are a real reader and like plots and characters you will be disappointed by this crap.

The characterizations are inconsistent and the plot is simplistic. Dan Brown is unable to develop any coherent ideas of his own. I wouldn't recommend reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is just not well written","review":"After all of the reviews I was expecting a good thriller to involve me. However, the writing style is just not that good. The author never misses a chance to let the reader (the ignorant masses, I suppose) know how much he, the author, knows ... about just about everything, turning the read into a plodding effort. Further, too many of the interior monologues are just downright sappy, which eventually renders the protagonist to a cartoon character status.Long and short, if you are well-read and with a wide reading interest, you are probably going to be bored fairly quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-rated","review":"I purchased this book because a few of my friends told me that it's \\"The best book ever\\" and other such comments. I should have read these reviews first... Apparently, those who do not know what it means to be a great book tend to over-rate anything they actually read. As the other reviews have said, you will finish this book quickly because it is very fast paced. And it does have some interesting parts. But, in general, the story is completely ridiculous, which makes it very unsatisfying. I also find it to be shallow. If you read books for cheap entertainment value, read this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read, very quick","review":"Overall a good read, it goes by very quickly and can turn into a page turner. Unlike some other \\"page turners\\" this one does require the reader to pay close attention to figure out the case. Some of the aspects of the book were a bit of a let down as they were rather predictable, but probably seemed more so because of the unexpected twists and turns the Brown offers. A good book if you are on the road and want something to read at the airport."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible!","review":"There is no way to keep this book from pulling you in. There is so much suspense and intrigue that it is impossible to put the book down. Not only is it entertaining, but it forces you to look at the ideas of truth and history in a completly different light. Do not read this book if you are not comfortable with new and radical points of view. For everyone else, I promise you will love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring mumbo jumbo","review":"Started very interesting, has too many boring, dull, ridiculous details that go on and on unnecessarily.

In the beginning, primitive societies worshipped rocks, the spirits of the dead, ridiculous deities and so on. In 2006 nothing has changed. We continue to contrive answers to eons old questions while allowing religious and literary opportunists to fill up their pockets on account of secular emptyheadedness.Humankind lacks the capacity to satisfy these questions, so we either choose to have faith in Divine Providence or fall prey to mind manipulators. The success of the Da Vinci Code is not due to literary or artistic merits but to people searching for answers in the wrong direction. Nothing is sacred anymore.Andrew J.

I was promised a thrilling end, but was disappointed, or frankly speaking cheated. What began as an interesting thriller, ended up in a series of ridiculous twists and turns. Don't waste your hard earned $$$ on the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"astonishingly mediocre","review":"Should anyone be surprised that a book with such a low level of artistry should be a runaway bestseller? Yes, I say. There are so many good books out there going unread while this junk enjoys astronomical sales. Go figure.How can anybody take seriously a conspiracy that implicates The Little Mermaid? And if they are not taking this seriously, but reading it for the great suspense, then maybe they ought to branch out into the genre. This is really really low level mystery writing.Having said that. I agree that it might make a good B grade movie. The kind that Spielberg had in mind when he made Raiders of the Lost Ark. As a screenplay it works. If screenplays are your idea of a good read, go for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rubbish","review":"This is a horribly researched book.

This said, I might even consider myself semi-well-read. So take my opinion for what its worth:This book is so poorly written, I cannot imagine recommending it to anyone over the age of 15. I am 35, college-educated and even used to read Stephen King relatively energetically... but this book, whooooo.... its so bad. The story has lots of potential, even kind of a good story, the kind you could tell at a dinner party... but the way its written puts it on the shelf next to the Fabio-airbrushed covers of cheap romance pulp... if I still had it. Which I don't. Second hand shop around the corner has my copy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dan \\"The Fraud\\" Brown","review":"Dan Brown uses the research of others and passes it off as is own.This book is nothing but a murder mystery weeved into the Holy Grail myth already written in \\"Holy Blood, Holy Grail.\\" That book came out 20 years ago! Brown makes no mention of this book in interviews nor is it featured on his own website, because it would hurt his own book's business.Someone called Brown a charlatan on one of the reviews. I think that sums up his characther very well. So he's getting rich off the work of Richard Leigh and others who put their life into research of the Grail and the Ancient Scrolls.The murder mystery is terrible and just shows that when Brown is not rehashing the research of others that he is incapable of fabricating a credible fictional plot or characthers.I give this book 2 stars only because its the kind of book to recommend to those who do not read and they will like. It also serves as an inspiration to others that ANYONE can write a bestseller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Intrigued by Da Vinci Code? Don't be. Please.","review":"The idea wasn't bad. But the writing is horrendous. And the dialogue - dear God.If you're looking for a real intellectual thriller, don't despair: Umberto Eco, Arturo Perez-Reverte and Sebastien Japrisot provide some of the very best, and they actually do research. Nikos Kazantzakis' \\"Last Temptation of Christ\\" is brilliant for those interested in alternative theories of Jesus. And Strunk and White's \\"Elements of Style\\" is an old classic that Dan Brown should have glanced over once or twice."},{"rating":"2","title":"this book is great","review":"This book grips you from the first page. It keeps you in suspense, with many twists and turns, right until the end. The author's vast knowledge of religion and art history certainly lend to the suspense and makes The Da Vinci Code stand out from other books in this genre. Have an art history book on hand when you read it - and maybe a bible and the Internet, too. Have fun!Another book that I highly recommend is \\"HE NEVER CALLED AGAIN.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"I liked it when I read it the first time...","review":"The funny thing about Dan Brown's books: they are all the same. I read one and really enjoyed it, and then read another and thought \\"Wow, it's like I'm re-reading the same book.\\" He is definitely a formula writer; he found something that worked for him and used it for everything else afterwards. It's almost as if he has a computer program that lets him substitute names, places, and circumstances, yet the events and timeline, even the relationship between the characters are exactly the same. This guy is a hack and an insult to every reader who has any sort of intelligence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slickly written but mean-spirited","review":"I was prepared to like this book because it was recommended by family and friends. It grabbed my attention immediately and was very exciting. The more I read, however, the more I didn't like what was written. As a Catholic, I just kept saying \\"That can't be true!\\" The claims of this being a well-researched book just struck me as wrong. I would recommend reading an article called \\"Dismantling The Da Vinci Code\\" by Sandra Miesel. It takes Mr. Brown's \\"facts\\" that sound so reasonable and documents why they aren't true. I love reading good fiction but I don't like it when fiction is presented as fact."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mystified","review":"Strengths: This mystery gets better as it goes along, rather than losing steam as so many seem to do. The last third is very good. The basic premise is excellent.Weaknesses: Too much indifferent dialog, especially in the first two thirds; too much dialog replacing action. Not that much happens in the first two thirds.Question: Why? Why the runaway success? This is no better than many other first rate mysteries. An unheard of book (by comparison) is Robert Goddard's \\"Days Without Number\\" ... yet the same genre and in my opinion just as strong. So why the huge success for \\"Code\\" while so many others (in the same genre, even) are neglected? I have to believe it has nothing to do with talent, everything to do with marketing and media hype.Having said, if Brown's intent was to master the formula in such a way as to have a tearaway bestseller success, he certainly pulled that off.Entertaining -- and way over-hyped."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paleeeez","review":"A bit too James Bondy for me.While the historic accuracy is debatable, I did however enjoy the mockeries Leonardo DaVinci placed within his paintings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Naive and quite boring...","review":"I am not sure why it is so popular... probably just because some pseudo-scientific remarks regarding Catholic Faith.

It started off with some interesting premises, meant to make the reader think he/she must be rather clever to understand the seemingly arcane knowlege possessed by the characters. By about page two hundred I realized that this book had gone nowhere, that the \\"hidden knowlege\\" was a bunch of pseudointellectual bull, and that the reason I kept falling asleep every time I picked it up was because it was deadly boring.

Thought I'd check it out because of all the recent hoopla. Seems to me that the subject matter could have been the basis for a series of novels or at least one big thick one, but Mr. Brown (or his publishers) decided to present a tidy little boiled down version. Unfortunately, the underdevelopment of the characters and the use of long french proper names makes the book actually hard to read, and definitely not a page turner for me.One can learn about much more shadowy individuals and intricate plots by just googling the words illuminati, golden dawn society, new world order, knights of malta, rosy cross, priory of sion, et cetera ad nauseum."},{"rating":"2","title":"Close to the best","review":"I had a very good time reading this book. I am fascinated by puzzles, word games and cyphers, and I have more respect for history and science than for blind religion. Therefore this book met all of my expectations. The author's style is particular (many very short chapters) but it fits the style of the story and it didn't bother me (unlike other reviewers). And the fact that the book (cover) contains a bunch of extra information you wouldn't expect (check out the book's web site) did feed my hunger for more puzzles and games. This book is close to the best you can get. Why not the best ? Because the author sometimes seems to add too much non-fiction (information) that is not enough related to the plot, just for the purpose of showing how much research he did - though the research is likely limited to the list of books included in the story. He should've avoided this pitfall, and the book would've been the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"yes no let me know","review":"the rage will be short live surviving only in church book clubs and oprah fans. a page turner all admitt, however, the premise of controversial religious topic is the real suspect to blame for gluing your finger to the page. the writting was mediocre not to ripe the book apart but i was just as enthused by picking up a goosebumps book. only suggestion- read it for yourself the opinions seem to vary drastically"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh my goodness---tedious hardly covers it","review":"I give it 2 stars because I actually finished it. With a final sigh of relief I turned the last page and closed the book for the last time.Plot holes, cheap tricks of suspense, wooden characters. You name it--the logic is faulty and sometimes downright weird. Oh, and let's not forget the author's not so hidden agenda with which he likes to wack the audience upside the head excruciatingly about every page or so.This is a strange theological and semi-historical exploration thinly disguised as fiction. Brings to mind \\"The Celestine Prophesy\\" another new age book that, to the credit of \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" I was not actually able to stomache long enough to finish. But it was a best seller too. Go figure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazing...","review":"What is amazing about this book is that it actually made its way into print and then was received as an intelligent work. Having lived in Paris, I can vouch that the descriptions of that city bear no relation to reality. The supposedly intelligent characters spend most of their time gasping in amazement over the obvious. The presumed history is anything but, and even the premise of the book, lifted freely from the Rennes-le-Chateau enigma in southern France, has been deformed beyond recognition. And lastly, the book is a rather large slur against Catholicism, painting the Church of Rome as alternately incompetent and psychopathic. I suppose that the book would not have annoyed me so much had it not come so highly recommended, and had not the author suggested that his work was factually accurate. I'm sorry to say it (I can't recall every giving a book one star), but at nearly every level, this book is just so much schlock."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Fiction, after all.....","review":"I keep telling people: it's a work of fiction. Gladly, the author never claims to be anything else but fiction. He confuses a lot of historical elements and passes them for facts by using the lecture style of the character. For example, all he says about the Gospels is completely inaccurate: he gives the impression that the 4 Gospels known to all and all others were written at the same time and then the \\"church\\" selectively chose the four. History doesn't agree. We have no proof. He even claims that Jesus wrote \\"Q.\\" This document, \\"Q\\" is hypothetical (it's mostly a scholarly construct). As for the \\"Da Vinci\\" stuff, I am not learned enough to respond. For crying out loud: let's keep in mind that IT IS ONLY FICTION, poorly written, but still fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"'Best Selling' doesn't mean 'Best Writing'","review":"This book is a good example of why the review \\"stars\\" should have the option to go below zero.

It does one thing, and one thing well...its puts the lost women of the Gospels back into the story. After (or before) you read the DVC, you must read Elizabeth Cunningham's The Passion of Mary MagdalenThe Passion of Mary Magdalen: A Novel (Cunningham, Elizabeth, Maeve Chronicles)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre writing and too much hype - bait and switch marketing","review":"This book is the definition of literary mediocrity. It's probably not the worse book I've read, but it's certainly not good.But the publishers used some smart marketing to dress the book up in some more intellectual themes of art, religion, conspiracy and enigma. I think that's why many readers are so disappointed.If this book hadn't sold so well, there would not be nearly as many controversial opinions floating around.I think most people -- myself included -- are really more angry at themselves for reading this really worthless book and at other readers for buying so many damned copies. I honestly expected something quite more literary than the action-movie script that it actually was. To me, this felt like a bait-and-switch."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY unrealistic ... gets annoying toward the end...","review":"I'm glad I heard this book simply because it was such a popular book. However, I didn't enjoy it very much. The plot, while moderately amusing, was NOT believable at all. Everything came too easy for them. They never mulled anything over. There were far too many \\"aha!\\" moments and that really annoyed me. I like the character Langdon a lot but the others were pretty annoying. By the last CD of this set, I was very tired of the whole plot, all the characters and was ready for it to be OVER. Mildly entertaining but not anything I would EVER listen to a second time."},{"rating":"1","title":"????","review":"I'm extremely surprised that such a mediocre (meaning BAD) writer as Dan Brown can have this type of publicity. Besides the fact that the story is full of clich��s and it basically does not make sense, Mr. Brown simply has no idea of how to write anything, let alone a book. I would strongly suggest him to read, I don't know, Borges, Umberto Eco, but the mere notion of having these authors associated with Brown is ridiculous. He should definitely find another line of work. This is one of the worst books I have read in my life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grabs you on Page 1","review":"I really liked this book. I couldn't put it down. I thought this was one of the best stories I've read for quite some time (ok the plot stretches a little thin at the end, but ...).I'm really looking forward to Dan Brown's next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"An unexpected page turner","review":"I bought this book because it was on the NY times bestseller list and the small blurb I read was interesting. I had no idea I'd be so captivated by the the story. It was a page turner that kept me wondering... what will happen next and who's involved. I do believe that these reviews should just be a REVIEW and not a book report, so I will end by saying, I recommend this book to anyone... I am not an artist.. or any sort of scholar or even a student researching DaVinci or secret societies... I read because I love to and this book beckons any on who's into a good mystery."},{"rating":"2","title":"The modern got in the way of the ancient","review":"This was a fun book to read. The historical information about DaVinci, secret societies and alternate interpretations of the Bible was interesting. I thought the characters were very one dimensional. I never developed any empathy for them at all. They were simply vehicles to get to the very creative clues and puzzles in the story. I found myself hurrying through the plot elements, to get to the next clue or historical information. Overall, it was enjoyable. It was very fast paced, and hard to put down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"I was really excited to read this book, and was really dissapointed to find that it did not live up to the hype. Dan Brown obviously did a lot of research to write the book and about the only thing that I found interesting was the art history. The storyline is weak and somewhat boring. The cliffhanger chapters get tiring after a while, and the end is unbelieveable and far-fetched. It is extremely overrated and is probably one of the worst books I have ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stop, Go, Stop, Go","review":"Well, it started out to be interesting with a good plot that included murder in the Louvre, secret codes, messages written by the victim during his final minutes, treasure hunts, clues within clues. But, there is no depth to the characters, no cohesion between lecture and action and no end to ridiculous conjecture, factual misrepresentation and theological misintrepretation.I have never before read the end of a book before I naturally got to it, but in the case of The Da Vinci Code, I was compelled to out of sheer frustration.In another vain, this book worries me. Will people read it and believe Brown's lectures on Christianity, Catholicism, etc. as fact? His history isn't even accurate.In summation, I would describe this book as disappointing and frustrating to read. I read a review that called the book \\"perfect for ladies book clubs\\" (which is why I read it). That's insulting."},{"rating":"1","title":"awful writing","review":"After I read that one-in-five Americans have read this book, I decided to join the crowd. I found the premise interesting and looked forward to the story. However, this is one of the most poorly written books I've ever encountered. The prose is so pedestrian and the \\"suspense\\" so predictable. Finally I just couldn't take it anymore and thought I see the movie version. And now I hear that it is equally bad. Why do so many people like this book? I'm mystified...."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like Grisham... maybe. If you like true literature..","review":"I must say this book is one of the most poorly written books I've read in quite a while. I suppose I must say it was entertaining, though not entertaining enough to buy, just borrow from a friend or the library. If serial novels and suspense thrillers are your thing, you might enjoy it. I personally could not even keep it. I bought it and swiftly returned it two days later. If you want suspense that is enriching too I would recommend Khaled Hosseini's \\"Kite Runner\\". That is a fantastic book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother with this book - read Umberto Eco instead!!","review":"I agree with the reader from Evergreen, CO - if you're going to write a book like this, do your homework first! I'm not an art history scholar, but I have two degrees in medieval history. The inaccuracy of the author's assertions about almost every historical reference I ran across in this book was appalling! I too tried to have fun with the story, but the bad research was so distracting that I never truly engaged in the book. If you are interested in reading a great book that also deals in similar subjects, go to the master - Umberto Eco - and read Foucault's Pendulum. Eco's breadth of knowledge is vast, and he deftly navigates not only history, but philosophy, theology, semiotics, philology, etc. and weaves them seamlessly into a captivating plot with 3-dimensional characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"It should be made into a movie.....","review":"This is one of the best books I've read in a long time. It made me want to research religion, secret sects, look at paintings by Da Vinci, and go back to Paris!

I couldn't put it down!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I Wish 0 Stars Were an Option","review":"The people who hate the movie \\"The Passion of Christ\\" will love this book. And they are the ones who will not go see the movie. Their hatred of Christ keeps them from being honest in their reviews.This book does act as a fair story. Obviously, it must to become one of the best all-time fiction books in the world. Yet, it is so simplistic and, worse, so blatently anti-Christian in its views. It doesn't just want to mock the roman Catholics, it also wants to mock the Protestants and it does so \\"under the radar\\" so that many readers won't see what is being done along the way of taking them from point A to point B."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Davinci Code","review":"The book is written well, however, the story has no truth to it.In my book of the bible it is written different. I hope the author will some day find the truth about Jesus, who is not at all, what he writes about. He is not just someone that has a fling with some woman. He is the Savior of mankind and the son of God."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whatever happened to Faith?","review":"I actually couldn't bring myself to finish this book. I got about 3/4 of the way through it and had to stop because I got so tired of all the mumbo jumbo and conspiracy theory. And if you really look at the theories, they don't make any sense. What this book failed to even acknowledge is that Christianity isn't based on proof. It's based on faith. Even though I believe that there is proof of Jesus Christ's existence and identity, more than anything I believe in the joy and love that he has put into my heart through a relationship with him. As far as I'm concerned this is nothing more than propoganda itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Christians Should be Horrified","review":"Never having read any of his books, the synopsis sounded interesting. However, as a Christian, I found this one of the most disturbing books in print. More credible scholars than Dan Brown, even those in the 1st century, agree that the formation of the Bible was accurate. Jesus was not married and did not sire offspring. None of the 456 Old Testament prophecies about Jesus mention a spouse or offspring, but the ones predicted came true. DaVinci talented/genius? Yes. We humans do not want to read that something we are doing is against His will, so we make up stories to fit our lifesytle. The Word of God was given to 23 men to share in 66 books. Woman are vital to the church, but not as Dan Brown would have you believe. Read the Bible, know the truth!"},{"rating":"1","title":"People! Beware of \\"fiction\\" books full of half-truths...","review":"Those other one-star reviewers are right! This book is full of untruths. It occured to me that I've read other so-called \\"fiction\\" books full of untruths (and the even scarier half-truths), too. It's a conspiracy, for sure, being carried out by the liberal, leftist, academic elite.For example, I was reading this other \\"fiction\\" book called \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", and it occured to me that this Tolkien guy was just full of it. I mean, there's no such thing as Elves or Goblins, or, geez, Hobbits! Magic rings? Give me a break. He even goes so far as to include a map of this so-called \\"Middle Earth\\". Middle of what? I only know of one Earth, and it's the whole thing. I'm tellin' ya, that book was just full of out-and-out falsehoods. And *oy*, with the singing all the time, I mean give me a break!The nerve this guy has to fill a \\"fiction\\" book with untruths. I give it one star, and from now on I'm only reading true fiction!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry Pot-- I mean, Da Vinci Code review...","review":"This novel relies heavily on facts to complement the fictional plot. The reader can tell that the author is very informed on the subject matter, which is a refreshing discovery. However, some of the plot progressions seem a little too linear and \\"Hardy Boys-esque.\\" If one should decide to read this book, he or she will not find much of the happenings surprising, yet the author manages to maintain the reader's attention. I would recommend this book to anyone that enjoys learning about historical occurrences, while not really having one's brain overworked. All-in-all, I would say this book is an outstanding contemporary piece of literature that will be read and enjoyed for years to come."},{"rating":"1","title":"Failure to believe....","review":"This rating system doesn't have an option for a \\"no star\\" because it doesn't deserve it. I wasnt surprised when I heard this book was going to be published because if you are a true christian you wouldn't believe one bit of information it tells you. This book confuses christian believers and make them think twice about whether their belief is true or false? People these days will come from every corner to lure you into their stories and believe that they hold the truth and evidence for christianity beliefs. I for one, am a true christian and I will stick to what I believe and that is Jesus Christ, Is-Have Been-And Forevermore will be the Son of God, the Beginning and the End, the Alpha and the Omega, the Life, the Truth, and the Way."},{"rating":"1","title":"PAGES MISSING - DO NOT BUY THIS EDITION!","review":"Do not buy this edition of the book!

I found myself unable to put this book down once I had started it. Although some of the characters are predictable, I didn't feel that this aspect took away from the quality of the story.I am currently reading the predicessor to this novel, Angels & Demons (also starring Robert Langdon) and am having difficulty putting this one down as well! I do hope that this will turn into a book series about Robert Langdon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Irritating","review":"What was all the fuss about? Apart from the central idea regarding Jesus's lineage, which is interesting (but isn't exactly original) this is a tedious old read, full of dumb cliches, unbelievable characters (especially the villains) and with these ridiculous childish anagrams and puzzles peppered throughout which, I'm guessing, are supposed to flatter the reader into thinking he/she is some sort of genius cryptographer. Complete garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's FICTION Folks...FICTION!","review":"Plain and simple...This book is a FICTION novel my friends. There's no need to take offense to a novel written based on false ideas.As for the story, WOW! This thing was spectacular! I could not put it down. It starts off a bit slow (The first 80 or so pages), but then really gets going.You gotta get this thing. Best book I have read in years!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is like Foucault's Pendulum....","review":"just written for slower folks, with all interesting mind fodder removed. I disagree with some of the other reviews stating this is a total ripoff.... even within the text Brown acknowledges that all of these ideas are old hat and have been for at least decades. As my title indicates, however, Umberto Eco was able to weave the old legends of the Templars into a much more relevant and poignant work. Besides, with Bush's current fantasia of rationales for provoking illegal wars, the nature of truth as elucidated in Foucault's Pendulum is much more pertinent."},{"rating":"1","title":"P T Barnum was right","review":"If only I had 1000 acres of Florida swamp land; I would solicit all of the folks giving this hardbound nonsense a 4 star review.

Truly a side show that would have made Barnumdrool."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible mystery wrapped around fascinating facts","review":"Brown constructs a 3rd rate mystery to carry a boatload of amazingly interesting facts about the early origins of Christianity and the Holy Grail. I wish he would've just written a book on the substance and spared the extremely amateurish and poor writing. I was also irritated to see how much he ripped off \\"Foucault's Pendulum\\" by Umberto Eco, which was light years ahead of this extremely disappointing book. If you're a fan of fine writing in mysteries, like Alan Furst, you'll be very disappointed in the Da Vinci Code."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insulting","review":"Pity is all that i feel for anyone who would be stupid enough to believe anything they read in this book. I mean come on. I know that its easy for simple people to get sucked into believing thinks that are untrue but to believe something this ridiculous... you would be deserving of spite. I don't know, I just feel sorry for anyone retarded enough to thing something this obviously false was true. The Da Vinci Code is an insult to my intellect. I think that Dan Brown just hates Christians and wanted to piss us off.

Langdon has to solve a murder and interpret the mysterious signs around the mans body.

Together they must solve the mystery. All while evading the authorities and other unknown enemies.The Da Vinci Code is one of the best books I've ever read.

Dan Brown has made an appalling attempt to rewrite history, couching his ludicrous \\"research\\" in an insipid thriller.Educate yourself people!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Recycled trash","review":"This is pure pulp, recycled trash and soft-headed conspiration theories. Take a spoonful of a guide to the Louvre, half a cup from of table book about Da Vinci's work, and add six chapters from \\"Holy Blood, Holy Grail\\" by H Lincoln, M Baigent and R Leigh from 1982. A Harvard scholar who, even for a second, believes in this conspiracy - Jesus never died on the cross, instead he married and had children with Mary of Magdalene; the Merovingian dynasty (cloaked in the dark ages) could trace its origin back to this union; guarding this SECRET was the true mission of the Knight's Templars and the ficticious secret society Priory of Zion - belongs in a loony bin. This hoax is recycled trash, and the author is laughing all the way to the bank. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad Day for Writers","review":"This is hands-down the worst-written book I have read since Naked Came the Stranger - and it was *meant* to be bad.The man can't write, his facts range from iffy to downright hooey and yet he outsells everyone.

This book is one reason why I only read fact. Just way to out of wack"},{"rating":"2","title":"They want to ban his voice","review":"It rather amazes me how much controversy this one book has raised amongst both Catholic and Evangelical Fundamentalist Christians around the world. Dan Brown is not a preacher, a pastor, evangelist, or even a Sunday school teacher. Yet his words have conjured up such a retaliatory position from the church that it really makes you wonder if he's on to something. The book is a wonderful read. Brown is an exceptionally great writer and storyteller. He skillfully mixes fact and fiction together with artistry and colorful skillfulness. How he presents the controversial issues provokes meaningful thought and much discussion. I believe that Brown may be on to something here; the church at large obviously believes that also, which is why they seek to censor his voice. Although Brown does not claim to hold any clerical office in the church, from his writing he may be functioning as a modern day prophet and not even know it. Masterful writing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dan Brown goes on my must read authors list!","review":"A friend sent me the RandomHouse internet quest for the Da Vinci Code ...I was hooked! I spent half a day in the office solving the clues, getting other colleagues involved. The pre-marketing was great. On my last visit back to the states, I picked up the book in the airport. I nearly finished it durning my 8,5 hour flight (instead of sleeping). I couldn't put it down. When I arrived, I immediately bought a book about Da Vinci, to check out painting details that I missed when visiting the originals. The combination of art, history, twists on religion and even just revisiting the Louvre, were so well described .... it was just like being there. I have recommended the book to EVERYONE I talk to! Long live the the Priory of Sion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-hyped","review":"I listened to this book on CD because so many friends recommended the book. I'm not a mystery reader but thought I'd give it a try. Why all the hype? The book includes one tired clich�� after another (His blood ran cold. No wait! Now his blood is boiling!). And somehow at just the right time the main characters stumble across exactly what they need to advance their investigation.And the audio recording? Egad. The reader outdoes Inspector Clouseau with the phony French accent, but this isn't supposed to be funny.My advice: Skip it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Fiction","review":"This was a fun, quick and easy book to read. The mystery story line was captivating and enjoyable. The recognizable settings (Paris, London) and references (Da Vinci, the Bible, the Holy Grail) draw the reader into the plot. However, that easy familiarity might lead one to conclude that the author's assertions about religion, art, history, and literature are both true and accurate. To the contrary, they are not, but are based largely on spurious documents and academically discredited writings.

(Examples: \\"prone\\" for \\"supine;\\" \\"like\\" as an adverb; excessive use of superlatives as \\"the most amazing thing he had ever seen\\") Colin Stinton, the reader, added to the sleaze by attempting a different accent for each character, some of whose names he couldn't pronounce.....

The chapters are very, very short. And there are lots of them. The writing style is that of an eighth-grader. It is simplistic and tells more than shows. It does all those things you were taught to avoid doing in order to write well.

Theological inconsistencies abound, such as a root question: why might such a preposterous ruse ever have been initiated in the first place? I noted that Brown refers to Leonardo as 'DaVinci,' a nomenclature never used by art historians, who refer to him as 'Leonardo.' The representation of Opus Dei was patently fabricated ab ovo, bearing no relation to the real entity; this is the case whether one loves or loathes the prelature in question.

The fact is that everything in this work has been completely debunked.This like D.W. Griffith's movie Birth of a Nation is a work of fiction.

The reason that is the only star has to do with the boring made up descriptions about the Holy Grail that makes up the last two thirds of the book. It's just too much reaching and grasping for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"The DaVinci Code","review":"Just as it feels good to stretch our muscles, and bones, it also feels good to stretch our minds, and our imaginations. If you have not yet read The DaVinci Code, do. It nothing else it's a fun tale.As the old adage goes...\\"A mind, once stretched by a new idea, never regains its original dimension\\"Oliver Wendell Holmes"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not entirely accurate, but an entertaining page turner.","review":"\\"The Da Vinci\\" code has been much critisized for its lacking accuracy of supposed historical facts. Regardless of how many of the book's claims are true, Brown makes one important point: There's always two sides to a story and the history books are written by the winners. Keep in mind: Don't assume everything someone says is true, be it the Catholic Church or Dan Brown. Check both sides, do some research. Don't automatically assume this book to be true, but it might inspire you to question some supposed facts of Christian history.This is not the first time a fictional work claims to be based on fact and whether Dan Brown truly believes in the Priory of Sion - which has been revealed to be a hoax - is not really important. As long as you read this book as a thriller, it is definately an entertaining page turner, well worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"A stupid, silly, overhyped book -- see the movie instead!","review":"At first, I was proud that I was not among the 25 million or so people who have allegedly read this book. But since I am an art history buff, and I like Ron Howard's films (and his film version of the book will be coming out later this year), I thought I would give it a shot.You have to hate a book where you figure out the riddles pages and pages before the main characters do. And I am certainly not a cryptographer, a symbologist, holy grail expert, or genius. It's simply that these riddles were written to fool the lowest common denominator. It barely held my interest and I almost did not finish it.Save your money on the book and go see the movie instead. I suspect it will be far better because of the excellent cast and director. It will also probably be shot in a way that does not make the riddles seem so obvious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Check your brain at the door as Mr. Brown re-writes history","review":"Mr. Brown and the publisher have made an obscene amount of money by presenting a fantasy novel as an historically accurate, \\"exhaustively researched\\", and credible piece of fiction to the detriment of the reputations of others. They have perpetrated a grave injustice that is an affront to the intelligence of the reader. They should be ashamed of themselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor plotting plus author's bias equals bad book","review":"The Da Vinci Code is suffused with bias against Christiantiy and the Catholic Church, in particular. The author's plotting is contrived and ridiculous; the ending is particularly weak. Too bad, because the potential was there for an interesting story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved It! Liked It!!! Hated It!!!!","review":"This book had such possibilities, but fell terribly short of achieving them! I'm running somewhere inbetween the person who gave it rave reviews and the gosh-awful trash-reviews. It's true, the very clever people in this book couldn't solve most of the clues fast enough for me (who in the world couldn't tell the one clue was written backwards -- come on!!!) This book was so interesting at times, I actually took notes - and so painfully boring at others, I had to force myself time after time to pick it up again just to finish it. Wish I'd stopped about 2/3 of the way through - my opinion and enjoyment factor would've been a lot higher! What a bunch of bunk at the end!!! For those who swallowed the bait Brown was dishing out - -here's some interesting info: Rearrange the letters in ELVIS and you will see LIVES - - therefore ELVIS LIVES!! It's a miracle!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak and disappointing","review":"For a thriller billed as intelligent, I was disappointed in how easy many of the clues were to figure out. As supposed experts in their fields, the characters should have solved several of the puzzles much more easily. When the reader figures out the clues before the characters, it makes the story development slow and frustrating.The writing style was pedantic and plodding. There are other books on this topic written with more flair. Give this one a miss.If you'd like a similarly detailed historical over-the-top mystery, check out The Eight by Katherine Neville."},{"rating":"1","title":"Toilet paper would be cheaper","review":"Not sure what one sees in the book. It is a bad piece of fiction. I don't understand how the author lives with himself. I suppose this was his way to make his fortune... at the expense of Christ, not only getting Da Vinci's life wrong as well. And this was intentional.Toilet paper would be cheaper.May I suggest that it would be best to spend your money on something real, even a REAL piece of good fiction.

I don't believe that the Catholic church cares one way or the other about the \\"Holy Grail.\\" The \\"quest\\" for this undocumented object is perpetuated by fiction writers, Hollywood producers, and misguided individuals who believe that objects can be endowed with supernatural power-the Jerry Springer crowd.The great tragedy about this mystery book is that the writer wastes his time on this boring subject. He is multi-talented as a writer, but an untalented chooser of what to write about.

This book is just your standard Catholic bashing dressed up as \\"intellectual fiction\\". Well, fiction it is but the intellectual description will only sit well with the \\"aliens killed Kennedy\\" crowd.Any doubts about the motives of this book quickly disappear when you see the author advertising web sites that also promote his anti-catholic message. Do yourselves a favor and skip this book. If you have any belief in Christianity, you will be offended by this fiction. Even the fans of outlandish conspiracy theories really will have to stretch their imagination to buy this. For those who don't fit into either of these categories, don't confuse this book for truth. It is in the fiction category for a reason."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly researched heretical garbage!","review":"Not worth the money. Choppily written.

Bought it 3 months after it was released thanks to the extreme media fervour. It seemed this one the book that did no wrong.. the perfect book.. plot-wise, fantasticlly merging fact with fiction.

The so-called facts are completely conspiracy based and left me feeling hollow- like I'd taken a big bite of air.I really do not understand the interest it generated. Was it because it 'claimed' to be based on factual dark secrets of the Catholic Church?If there was a 1/2 star rating, I'd have given it that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth reading","review":"This book is poorly written and definitely not worth the time.

You're kidding me. I've read at least a dozen mystery/thrillers this year better than THE DA VINCI CODE. The plot - about a religious sect seeking to keep an ancient secret hidden - comes right out of a Saturday morning cartoon. And the characters are about as believable as an honest politician.

It just goes to show you that popularity isn't everything.Antelope Jones"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Da Vinchi Code","review":"This book is a marvalous story with twists and turns around every page. There are twists that change the book every moment. The story makes you think and it makes you contridict the things the Catholic Church teaches, in some parts.

I strongly suggest you going out and picking up a copy and reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"exciting, yes. but even more interesting.","review":"I love learning about the subject discussed in Da Vinci Code.

They, too, enjoyed it as much as I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Getting Caught Up in the Suspense","review":"This book was a real escape from the day to day realities of life. The fact that the entire story takes place in one day was also very interesting. You never had time to rest. I found the book hard to put down once I got started.

I would highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looked forward to this book but it may be the worst-written","review":"book I have read this year. You can find several howlingly-bad sentences per page.

I learned interesting things from the novel but, as a thriller afficionado, I could not believe how talentless a hack Brown is."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a dismal failure.","review":"Dan Brown, the author, has stolen most of his material from others and has tried to pawn it off as unique. Oh jeez, the writing is sub-par and the content is shallow. If you buy this book, I assure you that you will be disappointed with what you get. The book received a great deal of hype -- but, so did O.J. Simpson's trial. Try another title, like The Tale of the Devil: The Biography of Devil Anse Hatfield, or West Virginia Tough Boys. Shoot, try \\"I'm A Soldier, Too!\\" Anything would be better that this hard-bound dissapointment. Ugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Da Vinci Code","review":"Like others,this book was highly recommended to me. Although the subject matter was very interesting, the writing style left me wanting more. The characters were not fully developed and after a while, it became predictable.

After all the high praise, I was dissapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cranking up codes","review":"Brown does it all over again: some intriguing ideas, good writing and a not so new story.

This book will soon be taking up space there. Ever so often a publishing phenomena such as the above mentioned comes along and captures the attention of the public then drifts into obscurity. The Da Vinci Code is such a book.It is poorly written with an agenda that is as transparent as the plot. As a screen play it may succeed depending, of course, on the quality of the production. Good casting could breath life into the one dimensional characters. Although I'm not sure what more Hollywood can do with yet another albino bad guy.

I noticed that Jacques Sauniere shares the same surname as the priest of Rennes-le-Chateau---not a coincidence, I'm sure. Brown has written an engrossing novel, but his style is more pulp than poetic, and the characters, for all their collective expertise, are a bit slow on the uptake.

Maybe the author should have read something more profoundly than the usual popular bogus. Especially the claims about Leonardo are twisted and they are also misleading the general reader, as a matter of fact, unfortunately we have a lot of self-proclaimed Da Vinci experts here in Turkey right now because of it. About the religious claims: In a society where the Christian faith and practice is not well known, this book made some interesting effect and now everyone awaits the much hyped Gibson's movie.

The proliferation of chapters is a cheap attempt to cover up the fact that the author isn't able to create a viable structure for the book, interweave elements of a plot or create complex characters.

I think by seeing the movie first, and then reading the novel afterwards makes the book much richer. I was impressed that the movie followed the novel pretty closely, with only minor changes. What makes this book so impressive is that it really makes you think about the concepts in the novel. It is clearly marketed as fiction, yet the Catholic Church seemed to treat this novel as heresy.As a novel it makes you really think about the possibilities in a plausible manner. Even the History Channel still replays the Da Vinci Code revealed special, which walks through the points made in a book. Isn't this the purpose of a really good book, to make the reader think about the story long after reading it?Now I'm eagerly awaiting the next movie from Dan Brown, Angels and Demons - and then I'll read the novel after seeing the movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Read.

I really wanted to like this book, but my intellectual integrity wouldn't let me. This is the most poorly researched book I have ever read. It is riddled with basic factual errors, geographical errors, art history fallacies, and historical inaccurances, not to mention the absurdities concerning Christianity. It would have been so simple to cross-reference a few ideas, check a date or two, pick up a map of Paris, verify claims about events...I can't think of any reason for this embarrasing mess of mis-information. I strongly advise readers lacking a background in the arts to balance this read with research of your own, or critiques of this book highlighting the countless errors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent story but shabby history","review":"Wow. I admit I actually enjoyed the story itself -- likable characters, lots of action, twists and turns.However, in retrospect, I did start to tire of all the plot twists. It's like Brown just wanted to keep shaking things up as if that was his entire goal of writing. It seems I see that more and more today -- that a book can't be suspenseful and linear, but has to just keep surprising us. Gives me whiplash, but it was a fun read.Bigger issue: the complete lack of historical accuracy for the underlying premises of the book was mind-numbing. I realize many readers would not even see this, but it's still disturbing, and for me it spoiled the book. It's really just an education tool promoting a modern twist on ancient Gnosticism and other trendy (in some circles) ideas packaged inside of a suspense novel. I say one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Miserable","review":"This book is miserable, poorly written, painful to read on multiple levels: science, cryptography, language, plot, characters, logic. As a friend put it, there are so many twists in the plot that the novel resembles a mix of Femme a la Resille and Drawing Hands."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cultural literacy thriller","review":"This book starts out with lots of superfluous description of people and places that never ties up or is relevant to the tale. The story takes quite a bit of time to get off the ground. The story line is textbook predictable. You know who the bad guy(s) are before they are introduced. As they say in the trade \\"it is the last person you would suspect.\\"Now for the positives. After a slow start the action finally starts to move. If you think it has holes that you could fly a jet through, maybe but if it did not you would have no story. One thing people enjoy in books is things they already know about.

Yes I know, Dan is laughing all the way to the bank and I understand how one can get rich hitting a cultural nerve, but in this case, the nerve is mass hysteria and cultural ignorance.

I almost always get burned doing this, and this purchase was no exception. A massive (and misleading) marketing campaign and relentless self-promotion are the only explanations for this book's success. Cloddishly plotted and populated with moronic caricatures instead of characters, this waste of paper routinely mixes spurious 'facts' with idiotic conspiracy theories while racing breathlessly--and with breathtaking dullness, not an easy task--to a senseless and contradictory conclusion. At first I was astounded that anyone could actually recommend this garbage, then I realized that movies like 'Dumb and Dumber' draw large crowds.There really should be a 'zero star' rating available for this kind of puerile nonsense."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Croc of Poop","review":"Dan Brown's historically inaccurate, lies, and shameless promotion are disgusting.This is just rehash of Gnostic Garbage that has as much to do with Christianity as the Easter Bunny does with the Crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus Christ.Please do not be led astray by this book or any other of the Gnostic garbage that seems to be everywhere these days.

I would have read more, but Brown's writing style is so inane and uncreative, I couldn't stop laughing.Admittedly, it is quite difficult to refrain from snickering at such [paraphrased] gems like: \\"He resembled Harrison Ford in a tweed jacket\\". Of the almost infinite possibilities in which one can describe a person, the author chose this actor's visage.In my humble opinion, the novel is about par with \\"See Spot Run\\" or an English reading primer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Liked the premise but...","review":"the actual story was predictible. The theories were interesting and somewhat thought provoking but the story itself was mediocre at best.

I am a fan of Da Vinci, and checked out the story for that reason, but Eco had the main idea first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good ideas but such poor writing!","review":"OK I finally gave into the hype and decided to read it. By the end of the first chapter it was obvious the writing had serious flaws. Clumsy sentences. Awkward writing. It is an interesting subject that is true. And these ancient historical conspiracies are facinating. But these are covered so much better in other books, several of which are mentioned in the \\"recommended instead of\\" section. I started reading a couple of them and the difference in the quality of the writing is quite striking. It is one thing to be a good researcher and another thing to be a good writer or novelist."},{"rating":"1","title":"the second-worst novel I have ever read","review":"This books is one of the worst-written things I have ever read. The characters are cardboard, the prose is turgid, and he writes dialogue like George Lucas. He also has this bad habit of ending every chapter with a fake \\"cliffhanger.\\" By the end of the book I was hoping something dire would happen to the main characters so the dratted thing would end already. Unfortunately, they live.I could have lived with the author's gross mischaracterization of church history and the nature of Christianity if he could have written his way out of a paper bag.The only reason I made myself finish this piece of tripe was to discuss it with people who were talking about it and have an informed opinion. Also, I had lots of free time.I advise you not to waste yours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Exasperating someone else wrote; excruciating would be a better word","review":"This book was given to us for Christmas or I wouldn't have read it. To satisfy any curiosity I had about something that gave the Pope such a hissy fit he encouraged Catholics to read it by banning it, I'd rather have seen the movie. Wading through all that clunky text was every bit as bad as I expected. But clunky writing wasn't enough for Dan Brown, who felt obliged to assault his readers with a lot of misinformation (such as that The Last Supper is a fresco when it's actually a painting). Rather than go into lengthy criticism of the book, I'm pointing readers to an in-depth one by linguist Geoffrey K Pullum. The URL is http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/000844.html and every point Mr Pullum makes is 100% valid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacks imagination","review":"I typically don't read books that have been hyped up by the general public. A few of my friends, however, suggested that I check it out. So I did. While I don't regret reading it, I would never recommend it to anyone. Brown pretty much lost me when he described the main character as a \\"bookish Harrison Ford\\" that is a professor at an ivy league university. This character is about to embark on a quest to find the Holy Grail... I saw that movie over 15 years ago... it's called \\"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.\\" The characters all lack depth, and the riddles were mindless (I solved the first one as soon as it was presented, and the second maybe a few pages before the characters did.) I'd never read another one of his books."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Da Vinci Code","review":"For all the rave reviews that I had heard prior to its release, The Da Vinci Code was really a mediocre mystery novel at best. The mystery was actually solvable for any reader who just put a little thought into it. The weaving of symbolic details and historical tidbits throughout the story would have been interesting had it been a little more in-depth...it was shallow at best. I would grade this as just an average book to read on vacation, but not one to be listed amongst the classics."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Da Vinci Nonsense","review":"The Da Vinci Code is a BRAINWASHING BOOK, BEWARE!!!! This author has a large lack of christian history and knowledge, as well as not having a hint of how is the Louvre Museum and the city of Paris. The author at least should have taken a tourist map of Paris to help his writing but this is not the case since he has created his own imaginary Paris and a godless novell. But of course, there is nothing much to spect from a fictional book that talks about controversial themes which makes it a bestseller. The author could have done a great work, but he missed the opportunity."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Da Vinci Disaster","review":"Interesting for the first 100 pages. After that, the plot quickly loses steam. I expected more theory and research, much in the way Graham Hancock writes in \\"Fingerprints of the Gods,\\" or \\"The sign and the Sea.\\"Here, there were absolutely no references to where Brown received his information. His theory is interesting, yet is merely an opinion. THe book contains interesting \\"side-notes\\" of academic worth, but even these are not sufficient to salvage the disaster that is the main plot.Though provoking, yet highly disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow and Cumbersome","review":"I had eagerly awaited the chance to read this book because of all the rave reviews I had heard about it. Unfortunately, the reality did not live up to the hype. While expecting a mystery thriller, what I got was mostly historical fiction.While the author seems to have done a lot of research into the history of the grail and secret societies, the mystery was poorly plotted and seemed to drag where it should be speeding along. Hot thriller? I'd say lukewarm at best. The first 150 pages were hard to get through, but I persevered. The story did pick up a little bit after that, but was so trite and predictable that I had it all figured out by page 200.What seems to fascinate everyone that reads the book is the \\"history\\" given- and some people actually seem to believe the premise given in the book to be real. (See other reviews.) However, this is a work of FICTION. There is just enough truth mixed in with the fiction to perhaps fool the masses, but any true Bible scholar knows better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read \\"Foucault's Pendulum\\", rather than this pap....","review":"If \\"Da Vinci Code\\" sounds interesting to you, you would be far better served by turning to Umberto Eco's \\"Foucault's Pendulum\\", which at least makes intellectual demands on the reader. It is indeed depressing when truly trivial books, as this one is, become best sellers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time","review":"As an occasional fan of the \\"thriller\\" genre and an avid reader, I was looking forward to reading this much-publicized book. I was severely disappointed. While some of the background information regarding early Christians and alternate gospels is interesting, it cannot begin to make up for the poorly paced and developed plot and the cardboard characters. Even by the standards of mystery and thriller writing (admittedly not as high as the standards for the literary novel), this novel is badly written. Such popular novelists as John Grisham, Stephen King and countless other mystery and thriller writers are much better writers than Dan Brown. It is a sad comment on the level of expectation of the reading public that so many readers consider this novel well-written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dan Browns body ...of work","review":"Mr. Brown is on a quest to defame the Catholic church. It seems to be his holy grail, so to speak. I suppose fact and thoughtful consideration would be too much of a stretch so he has resorted to attacks with little in the way of fact behind them that are meant to inspire paranoia. From the popularity of this book it would appear that much of the public is eating it up. It is oh so fashionable to pile on the Catholic church right now.Why? Even though that nasty business with the Crusades is far behind them, the church has much \\"splainin\\" to do with those mounting molestation charges.Mr. Brown has produced a flimsy, mediocre, opportunist, and mercenary novel. He is a genius in the same way that Madonna is a genius.The new-age definition for genius: Anyone who can sniff out a trend, exploit and capitalize on it with little regard for truth, artistic value, or the repercussions of their actions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two stars for good spelling","review":"You don't need another review, do you? You just want to find out how I could give this fabulous book 2 stars. It has nothing to do with religion. I don't care about that. This book is stodgy and formulaic: every big, crashing, \\"surprise\\" is as predictable as the sunrise. I really did not look at the 5-star reviews: I wish I could get past lack of writing talent and let my imagination flower as do those of the people who loved this book. More power to 'em."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Interesting Subject","review":"I really enjoyed this book because it honestly put my mind at work.The book is about a different religion other than Christianity. The plot is ok, but the main purpose of this book is to give people, everyday common folk such as me a view of other religions that have been in existence for many years and that were thought to be banished once Christianity become the official religion.Since reading this book I have been reading numerous books on religion and how Christianity become the powerhouse it is today.Fundamentalists will have a problem with this book as they take the bible literally and cannot picture any other God besides the one that is written in the bible (or some who think God actually wrote the bible).If you have an open mind and a hunger to learn you will enjoy what this book is all about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Story But......","review":"I loved the premise of the book. Secret soieties, clues hidden in world famous paintings, and some of the best-kept secrets of the world. This book is absolutely phenomenal and I would recommend it to all my friends. It is no wonder that it has stayed on the bestseller list.The only thing that I can find at fault with this book is the ending. It leaves the reader with the sense of, \\"Wait, what just happened?\\"Other than that, I think this book is one of the best books of its time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Quest","review":"I read this book in four days, it was an easy read. The story was interest, it makes me think differently about the Catholic church, and the values that I grew up with being Catholic. I would recommend this to anyone who questions the Catholic church and their beliefs. My only critizm of the book was too much detail, but that is probably my complaint about most books."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the year's best !","review":"What a Christmas for thrillers! I received Michael West's awesome novel \\"The Wide Game\\" (which I read in a day!) and this incredible thriller (also read in one day)!There's been a killing in the Louvre and the race is on to discover the truth behind an ancient secret, a secret hidden away since the time of Christ. West makes your heart race as you turn each page, but Brown takes it a step further to make your brain race as well. This is powerful work that will have you thinking long after you are done! I can't recommend it more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book I read in 2003","review":"Maybe the characters are a little flat and last quarter lacks the strength of the rest of the book; but, if for no other reason than this book got me to look at \\"The Last Supper\\" it was worth it.Yet, it was better than just that. I looked forward to each reading and forced myself to put it down each night. I don't think about religion and art much, so it was a bit of a catalyst for me. A perfect book, no; one I'd recommend to all my friends, absolutely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Madman","review":"What a piece of anti-Catholic psycho-babble junk. The author attempts to fuse feminism and mysticism with a conspiracy run by the Vatican. My wife gave it to me for Father's Day and I worked my way through it hoping something interesting would happen. My sister then gave it to me for my birthday and I refused it. The writing is terrible. If this is what the popular novel has come to it is another sign that the apocalypse is upon us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame and Disappointing","review":"I have never been so diasppointed with a book. Dan Brown basically takes a few religious theories (that have been around for quite a while and aren't obscure at all) and intertwines them with a lame plot. Don't waste your time reading this book. The fact that so many people like it and find it so earthshattering is only a sad testament to how pathetic, limited, and closed minded we have become."},{"rating":"1","title":"For the ignorant...","review":"If you study any religious history or art history you would knowthis book is aimed at convincing only the ignorant they are reading great religious insights.If you want to read a critisism on Christianity then read Neitzsche, so even if you beleive in Christianity youhave read an inteligent critisism not a totally rediculousaccount of Christianity and art."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dan Brown is no Umberto Eco","review":"... The DaVinci Code rehashes a clever idea - but that's about all it has going for it. The characters are two-dimensional at best: the villain played by religious zealot albino, the angry French cop named \\"Fache\\" with a gaze that 'scorches the earth as he walks', the protagonist with little more to him than his description as \\"Harrison Ford in tweed\\". The plot is predictable from the first chapter, the suspense non-existent, the dialog tedious and pedantic. ... It's certainly not going to threaten any religious establishments. This book was borderline painful to read. Don't be fooled - at least read the first chapter before you buy it. You'll be able to tell in the first ten pages if it's for you or not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Accurate? Well...","review":"Although the premise is intriguing, author Brown's prologue statement that, with few stated exceptions, all facts are accurate is somewhat misleading.I think that Brown's idea of \\"accuracy\\" is somewhat similar to the way Oliver Stone treated \\"history\\" in his film \\"J.F.K.\\"If the reader is less interested in complete accuracy than an interesting story, this is a fine book. The characters are one-dimensional and, at times, the writing seems workmanlike. Nevertheless, the premise keeps the fires of this story stoked until the very last pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dan Brown and Oliver Stone","review":"Dan Brown is to Da Vinci what Oliver Stone is to John Kennedy's assassination, i.e., a purveyor of pure fiction for the sake of self enrichment. As for the suggestion of a reviewer to read Beauseigneur's Christ Clone Trilogy in ADDITION to Da Vinci, I say read Christ Clone INSTEAD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dan Brown needs to get a thesaurus--Doesn't live up to the hype.","review":"I respect that fact the Dan Brown must have done research in order to write this book. He just doesn't seem to have that much of an imaginative vocabulary. I got tired of seeing the use of the same words and phases over and over. The book just doesn't live up to the hype, I don't understand the fuss over it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap, crap, crappity crap, crap","review":"Ok, two stars for ideas and use of actual historical artifacts. However, in terms of being a good book, nothing. I hated having to wade through the 400-or-so pages of \\"writing\\" to get the scrapping of a good idea. I know 4th grader who write better. This book was/is popular only because of stupid religious fanatics and lazy readers who think that, if they get through 10 chapter in one sitting, it's a good read. It's crap. One of the few cases in which I would recommend the movie over the book, and that's not saying much. Read \\"Marathon Man,\\" more thrilling and much more satisfying."},{"rating":"1","title":"A laugh a minute","review":"For an author who takes himself so dreadfully seriously, Brown unintentionally succeeds in writing one of the year's best comedies. Brown regurgitates various discounted historical theories in an incredibly amateur way, throwing misused words and tired cliches into a formulaic Scooby-Doo plotline. Each chapter ends with a cliffhanger in which Brown strategically witholds information from the reader - information that the characters already know - in order to manufacture a feeling of suspense.In addition, the prose is excessively flowery:\\"As Langdon stood up, Fache walked over to the spotlight and turned it off. The gallery plunged into sudden darkness. Momentarily blinded, Langdon felt a rising uncertainty. Fache's silhouette appeared, illuminated in bright purple. He approached carrying a portable light source which shrouded him in a violet haze.\\"I literally laughed out loud at that last sentence. And, of course, a silhouette is not a silhouette if it is illuminated, but I digress."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Don't Get How People Could Like This Book","review":"This is one of the stupidist books I have ever come across. I have no idea why people raved about it. It has nothing to do with true Christianity or what Jesus is all about. I am a Christian and I consider it blasphemous--to suggest that Jesus had a wife and link his purity to such practices of cult sex is nauseating. This book has nothing to do with what true Christianity is all about--it's not about symbols and dark secrets. It's about light and hope and a love that cannot be manipulated. I don't think Dan Brown really understands Christianity. There are many better ways to spend the precious moments of your life than to waste it on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Probably the expectations were too high. The book came with rave reviews as being an intelligent religious thriller. It's probably intelligent, if you are seven years old. It starts off pretty well but then it is downhill all the way. Gaping holes in the plot, puerile puzzles, twists and cliches dampen any enthusiasm you may have. The characters are boring. Brown's enthusiasm in explaining concepts like the golden ratio is like that of a child who's just got a new toy and can't wait to show it off. While Brown insists on referring to his male characters by their last names, why he prefers to use the name Sophie and not Nevue is puzzling. All in all, you'd be better off re-reading Foucault's Pendulum."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compulsive Reading!","review":"A quick summer read, a suspense-filled thriller, an educational tool and a mind-bending experience. The DA VINCI CODE has it all. The only problem with this book is that eventually it ends, and you're left having to research some of the more fascinating topics you've read on your own, rather than having them laid-out before you using Brown's masterful words. Also recommended: THE LOSERS' CLUB by Richard Perez"},{"rating":"1","title":"bad bad bad","review":"I expected this book to be enjoyable light reading, and light reading it was. The iconography was sort of interesting, but could not overcome the implausible plot twists and the completely stupid revelation at the end. Oh yeah, and the protagonists hook up. Who woulda thunk it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very entertaining, but also superficial and manipulative","review":"The book was written to be turned into a movie and make the author a gizzilionaire. Did I have fun reading it? YES. It is fast paced, pseudo smart if you want to read something dumb and quite entertaining. Do I believe everything it says? No, definitely not all of it; it does put forward over due plausible arguments and hypotheses. But there are better authorities and more intelligent discussions. Do I recommend it? If you like to be entertained, definitely. It is like Eye of the needle, but it upsets the religious right! :-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a boring book","review":"Dan Brown seemed to be on every bestseller list in the world so I decided to find out what was so great about his books. I read The Da Vinci Code and I surely don't know why so many people want to read this boring book. The thin plot is spread through pages and pages of copy/page like information out of \\"more than you ever wanted to know about ... \\" pamphlets. I could skip a good deal of the book and still know what happened.A good thriller is so tightly written that one doesn't want to miss a word. Dan Brown should read Frances Fyfield to find out about good thriller writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Swallowing Poison","review":"I generally use the Da Vinci code as a litmus test to weed out intelligent folk from the masses.

It boogles the mind that Brown stands behind the material as factual when there is direct evidence that story was a hoax. If you do any real background research, you'll find out quickly that the Priory of Scion was an organization created by 3 Frenchmen in the 1950's. The individuals who pulled this prank freely admit they did this as a joke and never expected it to go so far. Enter Dan Brown, a second class writer who falls for a previously disclosed hoax. I cannot believe that so many people (mainly Americans) bought right in to an openly fabricated story. On top of the story being completely fictional, the writing style is dreadful. Do yourself a favor and read something by a legitimate writer, you'll be better entertained."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"If you haven't read this book yet, what are you waiting for! I am very glad I read the book prior to seeing the movie. The book goes into so much more detail than the movie did. I found myself on the edge of my seat! I just couldn't put the book down! I bought the hardcover illustrated edition which I really liked. Even though Dan Brown went into great detail about the various sites, paintings, etc, it was really nice to see exactly he was describing there on the same page. I highly recommend this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"thriller lite","review":"On the whole, I thought it was pretty disappointing. Yes it had some (many - too many) close calls, fast chases, with dozens of stereotypical cliches fighting for room on the page. There was some imaginative connect-the-dots stream-of-consciousness plot development which was interesting for minutes at a time.My overall impression was that this was a starter mystery thriller for people who have never read a mystery thriller before. The heavily religious trappings probably lured in a whole group of people who were exposed for the first time to this kind novel. Hopefully it'll be a beginning for them, and they'll move on to the *good* authors."},{"rating":"1","title":"World Best seller????","review":"It is difficult for me to imagine how this book ever became a world renown best-seller.

Enjoy the book for what is it - a fascinating murder mystery in a unique setting that includes both fact and fiction.

But the adventure aspect of it gets a little old in the second half of the story, and I thought it ended in a wimper.When it comes to the theology aspects of the story, I prefer to side with the Apostle Paul's version of Christ, over Leonardo DaVinci (assuming Dan Brown is accurately characterizing DaVinci and others)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still Thinking about it--weeks later!!","review":"This is the best book I've read since Angela's Ashes.

However, it is extraordinarily badly written with some very cliched characterisation - upper-class villainous Brit - how very Hollywood! A green eyed red haired heroine - how often has she been done? Some good editing, preferably from a non-American would have been helpful. I'm sure no Frenchman would regard the Eiffel tower as the symbol of France - Marianne fulfills that role. And since when has anyone English said 'I'm truly sorry for your loss'. Lastly, scholarly English librarians simply would not indulge in tactless banter with an esteemed American researcher over the wisdom of knighting Rudi Giuliani. Was Dan Brown trying to make a post 9/11 point? Buy this book for its silly frenetic plot and intriguing artistic insights but don't expect great literature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeps you on your toes","review":"The Da Vinci Code by Dan Brown was one of three books I bought at one time. I am not typically a mystery fan and what I really enjoyed bout Brown's book is that it is not a \\"typcial\\" mystery. It's really great. I read it at the same time as I read My Fractured Life by Rikki Lee Travolta and despite being two different genres, there were a lot of similarities. It's a sign of great authors, crossing typical genre barriers. Da Vinci is more than a mystery; Fractured is more than a Hollywood story. I truly enjoyed both because they refused to be cornered into a genre. Both kept me guessing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly designed","review":"The Da Vinci Code is a fascinating book, but the illustrated edition is a bit of a travesty. Black text, white paper, Roman serif font, justified text: this edition does not evoke the imaginative world of Dan Brown. It is essentially the same as the black and white edition, with a few color pictures added here and there.A far more satisfying illustrated edition would have evoked the manuscripts of the era of which Brown writes. The illustrations and designs could have invited us into Brown's mind and touched us emotionally.The mere fact that the publisher produced an illustrated edition is part of a growing body of evidence that the public wants beautifully designed books. The current number one best selling book is America: the Book, printed in full color, and the number one Bible of 2003, Revolve, was also printed in full color.Valerie Kirschenbaumauthor of Goodbye Gutenberg: How a Bronx Teacher Defied 500 Years of Tradition and Launched an Astonishing Renaissance"},{"rating":"1","title":"best book you ever read??","review":"I suppose if you have read 2 books in your life, one was the Da Vinci Code and the other one was, I dunno, let's say Nancy Drew and the Hidden Decoder Ring, well then I guess DVC might be the best book that you have ever read.Sorry to sound so condescending, but Dan Brown started it. The Da Vinci Code is juvenile level writing.

How many times in one book can you interrupt the revelation of an important piece of information for the sake of \\"suspense\\"? It got routine and boring after a while. Also, the characters were flat - you never really got to know who they were, but then again, I never really cared, either."},{"rating":"1","title":"talk about your \\"holey grail\\"","review":"There are major holes in Brown's grail conspiracy and don't even get me started on the plot of this amateurish novel. It reads like a novelization of a screenplay.So why all of the enthusiasm? It plays to the bigot in all of us. Bravo Mr. Brown you have managed to bring out the very worst element in human nature and make a buck while you are at it. I suppose now racism, antisemitism, sexism can all be considered fair game for mercenary writers everywhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful writing style, painfully dense characters","review":"Could Dan Brown use more adjectives? I thought I would throw the book across the room if he used \\"famous\\" one more time. His writing style read more like a freshman college student's first attempt at creative writing than an author published several times over.The only intriguing part of the novel was the historical description of the Holy Grail mystery. The \\"suspense\\" part of the book was so transparent, I was many steps beyond the purportedly brilliant scholars every inch of the way. I found this book very difficult to continue to read, but was forced to only because it was a selection for our book club. I wouldn't read another of his books."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing and insightful book","review":"This book was a page turner from moment one. It is filled with so many factual, and interesting information that it really gets you thinking. I had to look up the painting of the first supper and really look at it.

I can't remember when I last read such awful prose. If you can stomache sentences like the following -\\"Everyone in the reception area gasped in wonderment at the sight of the half-naked albino offering the bleeding clergyman\\" - then be my guest. You have been warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dense and disappointing","review":"There's far too much math, codes and cryptology, art history, and religious history in this book, and far too little thriller. The writing is pedestrian, and the characterization is nil. That said, the premise is very intriguing -- but unfortunately the first review, above, gives away the big secret! So you lose that suspense -- you already know what they're going to find out. So I'm mixed about this novel. The author is clearly smart, and it's original, but it doesn't really live up to the hype."},{"rating":"1","title":"An exercise in gnostic religion","review":"As far as good reading, I found this book slow and loaded with bad history. I've read enough historical fiction to have a comparision and I also have read enough ancient chruch and and ancient history to know that the claims are weak if not laughable.Beyond the obvious what Dan Brown's book really is, is an introduction to semi-gnostic paganism vieled in Christian languague and history to give it a facade of respectablility.

The author's vast knowledge of religion and art history certainly lend to the suspense and makes The Da Vinci Code stand out from other books in this genre. Have an art history book on hand when you read it - and maybe a bible and the Internet, too. Have fun!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Stupidest Book I've Ever Read","review":"It's one thing to write blasphemous trash. But couldn't the author have gotten his history straight during the four years he claims to have researched the book? Dan Brown made up the story of a Pope who ran around emasculating statues. There is no record of any such event. Okay, it's a work of fiction, but what's the point of libeling a good man?In his acknowledgements, Brown refers to his mother, not his father, as his \\"role model.\\" His protagonist, Robert Langdon, is an equally manly \\"man.\\"This is the stupidest book by the stupidest author alive unless he's written something even stupider. I have no interest in finding out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would make a much better Hollywood movie","review":"I didn't see the movie, but this book is written and begs to be turned into a Hollywood blockbluster. Don't expect to read a great piece of literature here. It's entertaining in a cheesy way. Characters are like cartoon characters - they don't seem like real people.If you are looking for a \\"light\\" read perhaps on your next vacation then you probably will not be disappointed. It is fast paced fluff if that is what you're looking for. It has little educational value. If you just want to keep up with pop culture (which is why I forced myself to read it) then consider watching the movie - it will take less time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Entertainment","review":"It is a page-tuner and an entertaining book. I like it. It's only a novel; people take it too seriously.If you want to hang onto the intrigue of the book, don't read \\"Holy Blood & Holy Grail\\". If you want to ruin it, then read it. \\"Holy Blood & Holy Grail\\" has an opposite effect on me than its intended purpose. Not only it did not convince me, it drove me way off due to its many flaws in reasoning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Influence away from God","review":"This book is full of falsehoods. Anyone who has read the Bible knows that. Jesus did not marry. He was without any sin. I believe that this novel--even though it is fiction to an extent--is influencing the readers against God. That is something this nation cannot afford. If we turn from God, who will save us when we are in danger of falling?I would not recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down!","review":"The reputation of this novel to steal your attention is well deserved. What a thriller although it may well upset some who believe it to be blasphemous."},{"rating":"1","title":"All hype, no filler","review":"This book is absolutely atrocious. Disregarding all the historical inaccuracies and pretending it is simply a fiction novel, (a novel idea, right?) the characters in this book are boring and stereotypical, the puzzles are less than intriguing, and the writing style could best be described as \\"a submission for 9th grade creative writing class.\\"I literally hated this book and everything about it. The only reason it has done so well is because people can't learn to leave well-enough alone. If the Catholic Church had said to themselves, \\"This book sucks, let's ignore it\\" then Dan Brown would still be languishing in obscurity. But that's beside the point I suppose. Anyway, if you haven't read this (and you are certainly in the minority) don't waste your time. Go read something worthwhile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Punishingly stupid","review":"Dan Brown is essentially a very poor man's Michael Crichton, attempting to spin a breezy adventure story from some stock characters and a scientific/historical what-if scenario. All of the \\"scholarship\\" in \\"The DaVinci Code\\" is made up out of whole cloth, yet Brown misleadingly presents a lot of it as established fact in a pathetic attempt to inflate his own importance. The book's ideas have been called challenging and controversial; childish and laughable is more like it. But that might be forgivable if he had created an exciting story out of it. Too bad this book reads like the script for the cheesiest, most boring and predictable made-for-TV action movie of all time. Brown's smoke-and-mirrors history may have made this book super-popular, but the emporer has no clothes. Avoid at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"The fires of scandal caught on to Sony batteries","review":"Brown wrote the stump, Sony filmed the fiasco, fiery Sony batteries have to be recalled like Hell... Where's the connection?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Major Let-Down","review":"All I can say after this reading is...BLAH! I am truly shocked that SO many people liked this book. Maybe it's because so many had never heard of any of the concepts Brown introduces. I think he's one of those know it all sort of people who has a definite agenda to push. For this guy, it's goddess worship. Read any interview of him regarding this novel and you will know the truth of my words.If you must read it, please don't waste your money- borrow it from your public library."},{"rating":"1","title":"DaVinci Code, What has Brown done for you lately?","review":"It seems as though there are no middle of the road reviews on Dan Brown's DaVinci's Code. Either they are wildly euthusiastic or a complete pan. The story's premise has an interesting hook that grabs almost anyone (Jesus was married to Mary Magdalene) but, delivers it with such lameness that the reader becomes annoyed. Not even the fast facts nor the historical trivia can keep you from noticing the all too convenient discoveries and formula type writing. For example the multiple uses of the second look at any situation yielding much more information than the first. I would imagine this is to create suspense or intrique. It accomplishes nothing when used twenty times in the book. We end up wishing the main characters would purchase a pair of dime store bifocals to see what is patently obvious to the reader. All in all I was left on completion of the book with the feeling of how good it could have been."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-rated and poorly written","review":"The DaVinci Code has a compelling premise but an uninspired delivery. I wonder why fans of this book don't realize how poorly written it is.Dan Brown has the same problem as his counterparts on the opposite side of the religious spectrum who write the Left Behind series -- lazy writing. Brown's characters have nothing memorable to offer. The villains are simply implausible, (a common enough problem in many current thrillers) and the violence is graphic and contrived. There are too many overtly clever riddles, the time line is ridiculous and Brown's descriptions lack impact of any kind.I do admit that I found Brown's biblical arguments interesting, which is really the only reason to read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"If You Read \\"Angels And Demons\\", Skip This One.","review":"I won't even go into the historical or theological inaccuracies of this hack piece of work. What I will tell you is that this \\"novel\\" is his previous work, \\"Angels And Demons\\", just with different character names.The beginning involves the murder of a prominent intellectual figure by a secret society. The book's main character, Robert Langdon, a Harvard Sybologist (semioticist?) is yet again brought in to assist on the esoteric clues left behind.We have Langdon yet again thrown in with a female character who is related to the murder victim. He has to deal once more with thick-headed law officials possessing no imagination. Once more there is a race against time...Reading this book was a bad case of deja vu!Mr. Brown, please think of a different plot and more complex characters for your next novel. Also (most importantly), do better research if you're going to continue doing these so-called \\"religious/conspiro\\" thrillers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable, and the \\"research\\" at times is laughable","review":"OK, let's see, I figured out the identity of the Teacher fairly quickly, solved all the riddles almost immediately (except in cases where key information was withheld), I knew the 10 digit account number well before the characters found it, realized immediately where the grail was, who sophia was, etc.The history of the grail was pretty pathetic. Umberto Eco's Foucault's Pendulum covered much of the same ground much more creditably and didn't rely on as absurd of a conspiracy to make it all come together. The crediting, for example, of the biblical canon to Constantine was rather laughable, as anyone who has studied the history of the biblical canon would agree.If you thought this was a good book, do yourself a favor. Get Foucault's Pendulum and read the story done right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cypher This","review":"What a disappointment. Brown's story starts out well enough, a murder in a museum, a secret religious society and couple of relatively attractive characters thrown together in a break-neck paced plot. So what went wrong? Just about everything. By the end of this book I found myself screaming - Get on with it!!! What's the point of so many cryptic references - it felt like I was working my way through a puzzle book. Brown tries so hard to impress us with the \\"mystery\\" of the Holy Grail and his pseudo-religious plotline that he forgets to tell the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is literature?","review":"I'm not impressed at all. This is mediocre suspense writing at best. The constant and often totally unbelievable cryptographic meanings hidden in paintings, poems, and architecture became very tiresome and, after 500 pages, it seemed the author had gone off the deep end, 'round the bend, and to the funny farm...and he never looked back. I wish I'd just seen the movie; it reportedly sucked too, but it would've saved me time. It gets two stars only because he successfully hoodwinked the American public."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grail Quest Eventually Grates","review":"This story began with great promise. It appeared to be a non-stop type of novel. About midway, however, it became clear that the author had a personal agenda to pitch. When the plot ultimately degraded into a \\"car chase\\" I actually put it away for a month or so. I finally finished reading the book this morning, and the ending is clearly designed for a B-Rated Hollywood film (Hmmm, maybe Richard Gere could play the lead role.) This book went from great to a grating disappointment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oops--I believed all the hype!","review":"Well, I finally gave in and read this book for one of my book clubs, and was extremely disappointed.

At the time I Just thought my professor was jealous because he is also a writer though not as well known. Once I read The Da Vinci Code, I realized he was right. Dan Brown has a very simplistic style of writing. I did like the fact that he kept his chapters fairly short, but the way he goes back and forth between characters and point of view is tiresome after a while. As for the plot, it started out alright, but towards the end it just got so predictable. I knew exactly how Brown was going to end it and who play what role in the outcome. It was an okay read but I don't think it lives up to the hype."},{"rating":"1","title":"So cliche","review":"I read this book over the summer and seriously laughed all the way through.

If you think of your life after you join your beloved ones high, up with the Gentle Fella, then read the Bible and just beware of this book. Shame on the author! Though he did one great thing - all the people of all beliefs are united, and they are united against this blasphemy!

Not only is information concerning da Vinci's art inaccurate from an art historical standpoint, as confirmed by the Times, but the book's vicious attacks on Opus Dei are so far removed from reality as to make the book libelous. The author can't get simple unrelated facts straight either-- Robert Hanson never had a \\"much publicized trial,\\" there was in fact no trial at all, he simply plead guilty. There is no space here for the countless egregious errors in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"This goes for a great book?","review":"I know that the world is still somewhat obsessed with this book, and I I guess I can understand why. It's a lot of fun, I will admit, and Dan Brown certainly did his homework, authentic or not, on some awesome bits of history and religion. This provides a super-fun mystery--hey, who doesn't appreciate a super-fun mystery with lots of fast-paced action?However, so totally overrated! I think so much of the hype came from the supposedly controversial nature. You know what? Make up your own minds and stop letting fiction decide your beliefs for you!It is definitely a fun read, but the characters are ridiculous, cliche, and flat, as well as the relationships."},{"rating":"2","title":"Conspiracy fans take note","review":"I just recently saw \\"The Adoration of the Magi\\" in the Uffizi in Florence, so this book really resonates for me. It makes me want to go back and take a fresh look at Botticelli's art, at the Mona Lisa, medieval architecture, and the Bible. I rarely put much credence in elaborately constructed conspiracies, but there is much to fascinate in this novel. The only people I've ever known who were Masons, Rosicrucians, members of various Catholic subcultures, and so forth always struck me as supremely silly people with too much time on their hands. Maybe I ought to take a closer look at them too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Da Vinci Code","review":"The story was much better the first time it was written by an author named Lewis Perdue under the title of Daughter of God.Do yourself a favor and get the original."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only a little bit of scholarship is a dangerous thing!","review":"Brown did enough homework to fool the average reader, but reader beware! The premise of this book regarding a vast conspiracy of the church to cover up the true identity of the holy grail is so far-fetched that fiction doesn't even begin to describe this literary work. It would be one thing if Brown didn't claim that the descriptions of art and religious history were all true. This tale is far-fetched, predictable and sells out to a reductionistic view of history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Story based on poor scholarship","review":"Brown relies on the theories presented in the book Holy Blood Holy Grail, a work of of very shoddy scholarship. It makes huge leaps in logic and ignores many of it's cited sources. The Gnostic Gospel of Thomas actually presents Jesus as a male chauvist not someone who repsects the \\"sacred feminine.\\" In it he says women will only enter heaven when they \\"become like men.\\" It is interesting to note that the UC at Berkely (not exactly a pro-Christian institution) has a course on recognizing bad logic, and Holy Blood (Brown's basis for this novel)is required reading. Check out the university website and see for yourself. There are also many mistakes related to Leonardo and his works; a big one being the portrayal in the novel of the Madonna of the Rocks being on canvas (it was painted on wood). None of this would matter if Brown had not claimed to have researched his facts in order to write this story."},{"rating":"1","title":"High hopes ... but disappointed","review":"I had high hopes when I started this book. Being a scientist I was intrigued by the symbology, numbers, codes, etc. But I have to say I was sadly disappointed as the book progressed. Not only are the heroines in this book exceptionally BRILLIANT (they can solve complex puzzles in a matter of seconds which many could not solve over millenniums), they are incredibly lucky ... always getting out of impossible situations perfectly. The book was shallow, predictable and too neat. Everything fell into place within a of matter pages - where is the suspense in that? Give me some depth.One positive ... a good book for a coast to coast plane ride or a beach vacation."},{"rating":"1","title":"DaVinci Hype","review":"I bought this book based on the NY Times ecstatic review. It certainly did not live up to the hype. The most interesting parts were those giving the \\"historical\\" background to the grail legend. The rest was substandard suspense fare--one contrived cliff-hanger after another, written in some of the most amateurish prose I have ever read in a published novel. The characters are cartoonish, and the plot is so transparently mechanical you can see the gears turning as the author cranks up yet another improbable twist. The final revelations are of the type that give you a sinking feeling in your stomach. Botton line: this is a purely plot-driven book with interesting arcane religious lore thrown in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not offensive, but not good fiction either","review":"I finally caved in to the hype and read this book. I wasn't expecting richly developed characters or elegant writing or intricately woven themes. But I did think there would at least be an intriguing plot and some suspense. Instead, what I found was a ridiculous plot, paper thin characters, bland writing, and not much suspense. And, suspense was supposed to be the strong point. Honestly, I thought the ending to this book was foreshadowed pretty heavily.As far as the controversy goes, this is fiction. The piece of nonfiction that provided most of the background is widely regarded as hogwash by scholars. So, I think those who are offended are making a mountain out of a mole hill.I know a lot of people just want a mindless read and don't want a book that will make them think. If that is the case, you may enjoy the book. However, I still think there are better works of suspense out there if you look for them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inaccurate, plastic characters, & pregnant with intolerance","review":"This book is slander, Calumny and Detraction all rolled up in one.

That's how I feel about \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" and Dan Brown's similar \\"Angels and Demons.\\" These books are parallel in so many ways that it is almost ridiculous: an \\"expert\\" gets murdered in a bizarre, cruel fashion; the beautiful daughter of the \\"expert\\" searches for the killer by hooking up with a Harvard professor; there is much religious symbolism; there is a cruel, unstoppable assassin who takes orders from a cruel, all-knowing unidentified director; there are challenging puzzles for the protagonaist to solve (in \\"Da Vinci\\" at least the reader gets to play along); there is cliffhanger after improbable cliffhanger; etc.; etc.; etc.However, all this is not to say that both books are not great reads, wildly entertaining, and frankly, very interesting, in their revelations about the Holy Grail and the Knights Templar(\\"Da Vinci\\") and the Illuminati (\\"Angels\\"). I recommend both books, but you really only have to read one"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst piece of fabrication","review":"This book by Dan Brown has clearly got to be the most atrocious jumble of fabrications and bias against Christianity I've ever read. I despised having to give it a quality rating (for its worth) of even 1, seeing as there no rating for 0. First of all, Dan Brown claims that there is a secret society, named the Priory of Sion, which he also claims was led by well-known people like Da Vinci, Newton, and Victor Hugo. Except that what Dan Brown really did was mix a bunch of famous names together into a secret society that they were not a part of. The horrible fabrications of fact made me lose my respect for it and more than once I was fuming with with the blatantly twistedness of the information."},{"rating":"1","title":"this book is not base on the Bible","review":"This book is very confusing and not base on the bible, I think it is just some people who don;t really understand the Bible and have nothing to do so they just write books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Writing to the Detriment of Society","review":"The Da Vinci Code along with Angels and Demons were written very well I thought.

I have read them both but many with little faith or knowledge seem to be treating them as fact instead fiction sprinkled with a few facts which is what they are. Since societal evolution is so important I cannot recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anti-Catholic Propaganda","review":"If you consider yourself a practicing Catholic this book should not be on your read list. An author with an axe to grind against the Church uses this fictional story to push a feminist, modernist, anti-clerical agenda.

Still, the story of the Murder at the Louvre, the mystery of secret sects, the Vatican, Da Vinci and so on is intriging and I found that in spite of the literary and historical medocrity of it all, I could not stop turning the pages.

The christian faith has nothing to fear from this sort of sensationalastic endeavor, but I wanted to warn any new christians about this book. It is not a christian book! Those who think this book is good-natured fun are mistaken. Re-writing history is serious no matter what kind of history you're talking about, fiction or not.

And while the author claims much of this book is based on fact, much of it is really only based on theories. As the book is catagorized as fiction, I have no problem with a book based on theory.

It has action, and has some surprising educational information. However, if you read it, you shouldn't actually go to the places these people went and expect to find some kind of treasure.

The ideas may not be totally new, but they are presented in a gripping and fascinating manner.

In order to make it appeal to the masses, it will be necessary to tone down the obvious anti-Catholic and anti-Christian agenda which drives the silly plot.Dan Brown's \\"research\\" which has been exposed as little more than of the urban legend variety, will be quickly dismissed by legitimate scholars. I suppose that could create the desired buzz, but I predict that the movie will be received much like Martin Scorcese's \\"Last Temptation of Christ,\\" a movie that had a much more compelling story-line, but was not exactly a blockbuster.May I suggest a few options as a title for the movie:\\"Raider's of Intelligence,\\" \\"Ron Howard and the Movie of Doom,\\" or \\"Dan Brown and His Disceptive Crusade.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"The Da Vinci Hoax.","review":"Here in Brazil, I went to a house of one of my friends and I tried to read this trash-book.Being so bad, I never finished this trash-book.I don't know if this is a romance, a pseudo-historic, an anti-catholic bigotry.I realize that this a ridiculous, absurd and bigoted book.There's so many historical absurds, in this book, that I can't number all of then, in a single chapter of it.The real title for this book must be \\"The Da Vinci Hoax\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't believe the hype","review":"... I found this book contrived, the suspense artificially manufactured, with fake cliffhangers every couple of pages. I found the inevitable revelation was something I figured out right around page 50, so no big surprise, and I had to slog through a lot of bad writing and reams of factoids (some of them wrong, by the way). It's like the author thinks he'll snow us with Too Much Information. Plus a lot of the information was irrelevant mind game stuff, like the Fibonacci numbers and all that. Why he had to go pick on Opus Dei as a villain I don't know -- I hold no brief for them, but they're just not cartoon bad guys like he makes them out to be. And it makes no sense that the victim whose death starts out the book would put his granddaughter on this endless scavenger hunt -- that was what really felt contrived.

If you like suspense, secret societies, or conspiracy theories, then this is a book is worth reading.Before I ever read any of Dan Browns novels, I always had heard them to be predictable, over the top, taboo monstroseties. (the reason I say taboo is because my family is Roman Catholic and to them, to say Jesus was married, with children was, well, preposterous.) But once I read Angels And Demons, I knew I had to finish the series. The writing styles Brown expressed made visualizing the novel easy. the story line, I admit, is a little hard to follow at the beginning, although once you're a few chapters in you wont be able to put the book down. you can't help but to appreciate the attention to detail portrayed in this masterpiece.

I read the book, out of boredom, I am a reader it is what I do, I read anything and everything. The only thing this book is good for is a door stop. The writing was bland, dry, and the story line predicatable. He took certain \\"facts\\" threw it in a bag mixed it all around and poofy, you have before you \\"The Davinci Code.\\" It was so awful I had to run to look at an Agatha Christie, at David Eddings, anything to erase what I had just read. My advice, do not read it, just pick up another book, any book, and not one written by him. I am still wondering how he, a terrible writer, got published. The publishing industry, thus far, has shown they have lowered thier standards as of late!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Audiobook!","review":"I bought this audiobook because I had heard so much hype about the book and the controversy. I have two small children so I didn't have time to sit and read it but got to listen to it during my commute to and from work. I have to say, there were some parts that made my knuckles turn white on the steering wheel because it was pretty intense. And, a couple of times I had to sit in my car before going into work just because I had to find out what happened next. I enjoyed the story, knowing that it is just a story. Just my two cents."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Recommended","review":"I love mysteries and this book kept my attention to a point. However, the author presented many religious theories as facts (I think the research was lacking). The more I read, it became apparent that this novel was an attack on the Catholic Church as well as traditional Christianity. I found this troubling since some readers will view his 'theories' as the Gospel truth. I wonder about the author's background - I kept feeling as though a bad experience with the Catholic Church was the basis for this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"An attack to history","review":"This is a fiction book that tries to position itself as well-documented, when indeed lots of things are simply invented. Moreover, it attacks the Catholic Church and the figure of Christ telling lies that try to appear as truths to the simple and undocumented mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Light weight fare","review":"Never buy a book with the word Code in the title. That is one message that can be derived from a perusal of this book. But perusal is perhaps too strong. The book does not require careful reading to reveal that it is built on rather flimsy intellectual foundations, and that the writing is very awkward. There are some interesting asides pertaining to historic survivals, and to the origin of words, but for the reader who loves the crafting of words, richness of style, this book is a vast disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"To begin with, there are no lulls in this book. It is perfectly paced and does so with great effect. After the first 50 pages I felt that I knew what was going to happen but I was entirely wrong. I had purposefully stayed away from news stories about this book so that I would encounter it fresh and unbiased. The result is that its the best novel Ive read in the past few years. It covers the most coveted and revered stories from our childhood, when we are taught about Jesus and the New Testament and all that it involves. I was guessing at many times in the book and, a few times, I guessed right. For the most part, however, I was wrong or had no idea and finding the answers with the characters was like being along for a grand adventure. Well written, constructed and paced, it has solid characters, and a thrilling storyline. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"As a moderate Christian, I was looking forward to a wonderful read describing mysteries and codes beyond my dreams. I finished the book, just barely. The prose was poor and the surprises were all predictable. Reading dry texts on the Holy Grail are far more satisfying. I hope that the marriage described could have happened to intensify and both deify and humanize, Christ. This book was only one list after another of dry information with the characters saying \\"Oh\\". I would not recommend the book but other books on the same topic."},{"rating":"1","title":"After all the hype - disappointment","review":"After hearing and reading about this book for a year, I finally borrowed a copy and read it. All I can say is I'm disappointed. While it began with an interesting premise, the writing was so mediocre that I finished it only so I could discuss the book with a friend who recommended it. It struck me as just an \\"airplane\\" novel - one you pick up at the airport because you're just looking for something quick and easy to pass the time. It's not even close to serious literature. I'm also scared to death there are people out there who actually believe the story. But I suppose that's all you can expect at a time when bashing the Christian Church has become an art form."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful Pap! actually 0.5 of a star...","review":"Poor storytelling that copies/plagerizes everything from Raiders of the Lost Ark to Heat just not as well and certainly with no disguise.Not sure if catholic bashing is a sport yet but Brown certainly pushed the envelope. Very predictable and very corny - great possibilities but never got off the ground. The characters are horrible stereoypical that I would be suprised if this makes it to a B movie at best. A dis-service to the material for sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yeck....","review":"This is a definite page turner. One which left a bad taste in my mouth. A horrible, predictable plot, shallow characterization and star crossed hints of romance that detract from the plot.The only reason this deserves two stars is because of the way it presents an age old myth, the holy grail, in a different light that the public rarely sees. Now, let's remember, this book is fiction. I'm sure Brown took liberties to make his research fit into an idea that had amazing potential. If you're interested in the grail story, ditch this book and read some of the nonfiction books out there on the topic.For those who are trashing this on the basis of their religion, something to watch out for lest it destroy your faith........ what is your faith without challenges? Nothing.If you're a Christian with blinders on, maybe you should read it, if for nothing more than the challenge it will present to you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made to be a Movie","review":"I was expecting an intriguing look at the history of the Catholic Church and it's representation in art. What I found was a \\"Tom Clancy\\" novel with predictable characters. If you are looking for a page-turning murder mystery, that will make a popular movie - this is it. If you are looking for something deeper and thought provoking you will need to look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"My best read book of the year","review":"Dan Brown's research into Catholicism, architecture, art history and DaVinci is apparent and impressive in this addictive piece of work. Mr. Brown's manner of writing is such that you find yourself engrossed in the story, thinking alongside the protagonist as he reveals little known facts about the aforementioned areas of study. This is a provocative book, challenging the reader to question formed beliefs and even do self-study into many of the revelations with which Dan Brown blesses us regarding history. Coupled with the intense nature of the information is a fun and puzzle-solving storyline that makes the book extremely difficult to put down. Almost all questions are answered in the end and leaves you wanting to read it again; but perhaps more entertaining - to discuss with fellow readers the topics and facts presented herein. I highly recommend this book and for a bit more disturbing, yet equally enjoyable read, try Dan Brown's earlier work: Angels and Demons!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhat Engaging","review":"I think the core problem is that once you figure out what the puzzle is, you lose interest. It's not a very captivating object of mystery for most people. And the repetition of everything--the endless puzzles, chases, clues, villain/hero determinations. Yawn. Best part was the first 30 pages. Last few pages were hardly an ample reward for enduring this long, twisted, predictable tale. Quel surpris! The Sophie's entire family REALLY didn't die in a car accident? What moron couldn't have foreseen that? Get out of here? Sophie, the gorgeous code expert, and Robert, the warm-hearted, lonely, academic live happily ever after?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Much Ado About Nothing","review":"After much hype and many people telling me what a deep and interesting book this is, I was ready for a wonderful read. Instead I found a silly mystery that could be solved by my cat, insipid and vapid chacter development and a title some editor came up with to sell the book. Don't even bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"The research is terrible - there is no truth in this book","review":"The research for this book is terrible - it is all based on total rubbish so far as any understanding of Christianity is concerned. No historian, whether atheist, Catholic or Protestant, or simply agnostic, would give this book the time of day so far as factual research is concerned. Yes, if you want a science fiction thriller, like Raiders of the Lost Ark, this kind of nonesense is fine, but don't believe a word of it as fact"},{"rating":"1","title":"Da Vinci Disappointment","review":"Does overrated mean anything? I actually paid retail for this much hyped book only to discover a poorly researched tome that bashed the Catholic Church (I am not a Catholic) as well as Christianity in general. If feminist goddess religion is your bag, you might like it, but don't count on its historical accuracy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsatisifying Ending, Insulting, Unbelivable Characters","review":"On the plus side, the book started out interesting. In an Indiana Jones style, I was pulled into the interesting puzzles the characters had to solve under great time constraints. Then, the book transformed into a platform for the author to rage an attack against Christianity which seemed unfounded and insulting to my personal beliefs. Finally, I got the impression that the author had to 'finish' up. The ending was confusing and unsatisfying. Characters actions were no longer believable. Finally, the evidence regarding the lie of christianity that was to be reveled at the 'end' of the quest was never shown. This left me feeling cheated. I can't believe people actually thought this book was good. I feel ripped off that I bought it and actually spent time reading this trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I'll keep this short, as I already wasted too much time reading the book. I admit I read this hoping that there was something unique about it. Sadly disappointing in its predictability. Anytime the sleeve notes say something like \\"wickedly clever\\" or \\"a must read\\", run, run far away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give me a break","review":"This book started out with a bang: a thriller of a first chapter. I had such high hopes. But the further I read, the more disgusted I became. The plot and the theology became more and more sensational and outrageous. Dan Brown certainly has a right to express his views on church history and theology, but as a conservative Christian, I personally found it offensive. I would imagine most Catholics would take offense at the corrupt and negative characterization of the Church. I went away from the book with a sick feeling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mr. Brown writes like he has ADD","review":"A short, choppy \\"thriller,\\" written for people with short attention spans, deserves no place on the bestseller list.

He says that all references to the past are true. But, as they say in Italy: If it's not true, it surely is well invented.Robert Langdon and Sophie Neveu try to do what countless savants over the centuries tried in vain: Find the Holy Grail. The Vatican gets involved and, of course, Opus Dei. Jacques Sauniere, curator of the Louvre, is murdered early on. Apparently he was the grand marshal of the Priory of Sion, and they know where the Grail is. Robert and Sophie progress from anagram to double entendre riddles, on and on for over 400 pages.The red herring going through it all is Mary Magdalene and the cult of the Sacred Feminine. But, after a while, you do get tired of fabulous and saintly Mary M. and all the feminism. And the ending of this very large book is rather silly."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Da Vinci Code","review":"Fun reading, addictive fiction (though the prose and style leave much to be desired), if it were not for Brown's claim that all facts, rituals, etc are \\"accurate\\". Oh my! Umberto Eco has done way better in entertaining the reader while being historically accurate at the same time. Brown smuggles crackpot history for facts, along the worse Hollywood style. So be it... I do not recommed this book to anyone interested in learning rather than being entertained."},{"rating":"1","title":"ha ha ha","review":"The fact that this book is so popular is because it is so infantile and general that it appeals to the very general public. It's a successful heresy in paper though, because the general public seems to easily accept such follies presented in a novel. Such an untruth as the idea that Christ was married to Mary Magdalene is laughable. This is a novel by a foolish anti-Catholic upstart.Only fools can be swayed by lies in mystery novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dear dear, no!","review":"This is such a dull book, really, but lots of people bought it! It is great undigested pieces of information downloaded from Google and pasted together with rubbish cliche characters!

It is a sad comment on Canada that I have seen so many people reading it in public these last years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Properties of the Fibonacci numbers are CORRECT.","review":"Just enjoy this erudite journey (although at last the journey seems to be an itinerary and somewhat a waste of time, alas.)

And since it is a fiction, never mind unavoidable occurence of inaccuracies and exaggerations.However, being a mathematician, at least I confirm that those properties of the Fibonacci numbers mentioned in the book are CORRECT."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Pleasant Time-Waster","review":"The Da Vinci code is, as they say, \\"a good read.\\" That's about the best that can be said of it.

A \\"good read,\\" but not great literature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hallelujah, a bit formulaic, but well worth it in surprises.","review":"In DA VINCI CODE Dan Brown brings back Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon from ANGELS AND DEMONS. Like his earlier outing, DA VINCI is a page-turner that is hard to put down, full of plot twists at a breakneck speed as the search for the Holy Grail becomes a race to stay alive. DA VINCI is teaming with interesting trivia that makes it worth a second read.Also recommend: MURDER IN KEY WEST, by Freeman and COCKPIT CONFESSIONS OF AN AIRLINE PILOT, by Keshner... both brilliant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Embarrassing","review":"While reading it I kept thinking, 'the good stuff has to start soon'.

Pointless though denouncements may be in the face of this book's popularity, I thought it was awful; shoddy religious history, overdone narrative devices, and stock characters in the service of a story that comes to a weak and displaced conclusion that seems to have dropped out of the sky into the final chapter. Everyone loved it, I know. Not me. The illustrations were the only pleasurable part of the experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written Prose","review":"What a dissapointment.

Just toss the Davinci Code into your magazine rack along with your Pottery Barn Catalogue."},{"rating":"1","title":"If only I could give 0 stars!","review":"After reading Brown's gripping novel, Angels & Demons, I expected The Da Vinci Code to be an exciting page turner. Unfortunately, I didn't expect that the novel would have essentially the same plot as its predecessor, making it completely predictable. The books even begin the same way: man gets murdered, Langdon is called in, and some beautiful woman turns up who is related to the victim, attracted to Langdon, and wants to help him solve the crime. Please, does he think he's the next James Bond? True, Brown weaves in many interesting tidbits of information, but that didn't make reading this book worth my time. Out of the two, I'd say Angels and Demons was the better read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea, lousy book","review":"There's no \\"there\\" there. From the subtle-as-a-sledgehammer character names (and characters) to the contrived cliffhangers ending every short-attention-span chapter, this was a book designed, its convoluted conspiracy theories notwithstanding, for someone looking for something to do while waiting for an airplane or the laundry, and wishing to seem intellectual while doing so.

Really, the whole thing sounds like the Hardy Boys and the Keystone Copts, or Abbott and Costello Meet a Big Dumb Albino.As for the historical accuracy, who cares? The book is achingly dull and predictable. Try Eco or Perez-Reverte if you want to experience a more literary thrill ride.

I would suggest that in order to qualify for such an accusation the book would have to achieve some level of credibility. It does not. Not to put too fine a point on it, but the book is just plain dumb. Indeed it is moronic, puesdo-history, pop culture crapola.If you thought the half-time show during the superbowl had artistic value, this low-level junk might appeal to you. Indeed, I believe that the intellectual vaccuum that is the Da Vinci Code, could actually make you dumber having read it. Especially if you are gullible enough to buy into it. Regrettably it seems many readers are.Dan Brown is a hack and worse dishonest. Unfortunately it remains possible to make lots of money feeding junk food to the suckers amongst us. Wake up people. Just say no to the Oreo, Big Mac, revisionist history pushing fiends. Yes, wake up and smell the clean fresh aroma of nourishment for the body, soul and spirit. Seek the truth and you will find it."},{"rating":"1","title":"fake history and grade b writing","review":"As with others, I found the lack of research appalling. From Brown's assertions about the council of Nicaea, to his dates for the gnostic gospels, to his factiods about Constantine--this novel is rife with both errors and willful replacement of fact with fantasy.Further, the writing style, grammer and syntax left me feeling like I was reading a high school newspaper.If Brown wants to join the ranks of Umberto Eco, he'll have to work a lot harder the next time around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trash history, mediocre writing and a good guessing game","review":"I read all of it because Mr. Brown clearly knows how to tell a suspenseful story. His vocabulary and grammar lead thoughtful readers to conclude that he doesn't write especially well, and some editor might have improved this book's tedious composition. His ill-spun history of early Christianity is ludicrous. If fiction of this sort aspires to be credible in some way beyond the story itself -- and Mr. Brown clearly believes his does -- then we must conclude that this novel is not credible. It's especially galling, in this tale about recovering feminine wisdom, that its principal woman character becomes a cypher for knowledgeable men. Was it beyond the reach of Mr. Brown's imagination for the protagonist to have been a woman? Let's hope that his next book shows more craft, better research and a smidgen of insight into the nature of his own story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievable","review":"This book was an easy read, thankfully, or I would have given up. It so is full of such nonsense presented as \\"researched, documented, historical fact\\" that it was really hard to stomach. The anti-Catholic bias of this nonsense reaches ridiculous proportions. I mean, come on: for the last five centuries we have been taught that the Catholic Church was evil precisely because it had PERPETUATED goddess worship in the form of the cult of Mary and the saints. Now we are supposed to believe that the Catholic Church is evil for exactly the opposite reason, that it SUPPRESSED goddess worship? I guess any stick will do, when the game at hand is Catholic-bashing. But the most disturbing thing about all this is the book's popularity! Thanks to Dan Brown, psychiatrists in North America can look forward to to treating yet another generation of \\"the Catholics are out to get me\\" paranoid delusionals."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a potboiler!","review":"I read this based on many recommendations. As long as you don't expect anything of higher quality than a typical waiting-at-the-airport book, go for it. But don't count on it for anything else.

Funny, another setting, another genre, but has anyone who read this book read Black Madonna (Shadowrun, No 20) by Carl Sargent, Marc Gascoigne? Not the same book I'll be the first to admit, but funny how you have a book that is not about Da Vinci, but is set with a backdrop about his code... A little too similar for my comfort, I would love to know if Dan Brown ever read Black Madonna? But I don't think I'd trust his answer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Murr on 'The Da Vinci Code'","review":"The 'historical research' on which this nonsense is based could have been done by anyone with half an hour to spare and a good internet connection. In spite of the note at the beginning making claims to historical precision, the book is full of descriptive errors and historical inaccuracy. For example, the secret society described in the novel, the Priory of Sion, was in fact a complete hoax which was invented in the late 1950s by the famous confidence trickster Pierre Plantard, and not dating from 1099 as Brown wants us to believe.

You can almost see the movie as you read this thriller.Dan Brown has successfully arbitraged a lot of research about the Holy Grail and Mary Magdelene and the Knights Templar with the general public's lack of awareness of all that research into a cosmic whodunit.Along the way, you learn about Fibonacci Numbers, The Codex Leiscester, church and art history and mythology.If you want to know more about all the issues the plot deals with, buy \\"The Templar Revelation\\", by Picknett and Prince, at the same time(published in 1998, the first chapter is entitled \\"The Secret Code of Leaonardo DaVinci\\"!).

Like, I don't understand why Sophie would be so upset at her grandfather that she wouldn't speak to him for 10 years. What she saw wasn't even that big of a deal! That just doesn't make sense. But of course, Mr. Brown wants you to \\"ooh\\" and \\"ahh\\" at the Biblical \\"facts.\\" I think that the story itself is incredibly lame, do Langdon and Sophie really have to spark a romance at the end?!

I must have read a different book. The \\"Code\\" I read was filled with interesting facts and allegations re the Catholic Church but the plotting was so weak it was embarrassing. In fact the plot was so poorly done, I couldn't help comparing it to the The Celestine Prophecy which is a truly awful book (much worse than \\"Code\\") that was a great commercial success.

Sometimes you may be lost when several new characters are introduced but they all have in some way an effect on the story.

The know-all, do-all Sophie and the her partner Robert Langdon are our to find the Holy Grail.

If you are a Christian, Catholic or Protestant either one, this is not the book for you. Blasphemy disguised as intellectualism. What's so sad about it is that people who haven't studied the Bible and its history will believe the fables therein. My main question after reading the novel is, if Christ was merely a normal man, not divine, not God's Son, then why would his bloodline be of Royal Lineage? Makes no sense whatsoever.

I had often heard similar rumors about their bizarre religous beliefs and this book confirms many of them. The DaVinci Code is carefully researched and the author has taken the time to include specific facts and details, which makes it all the more fascinating, e.g. the history of the tarot cards and astrology. I learned so much while being fully entertained. This was my first book that I've read by this author and I plan to read his other books as soon as possible.

This is the last time I fall for the media hype....I heard this book recommended on NPR I think, so I was truly shocked when it turned out to be sloppy rather than a well crafted conspiracy tale.

There are so many hints at things to come; the reader is left hanging just too many times. There are too many long explanations of historical events, theories, art.

Some reviewers complain about the concocted history that underpins the plot, while others try to justify it as \\"hey, it's fiction, whatever he wants to put in is okay.\\" Sorry, but The Da Vinci Code doesn't even make it as a competent story.As for the book's research, it's too pathetic to be an \\"indictment\\" of Christianity.

Luckily, the used bookstore will take it on a trade-in - only about 100 pages used.The book reads like 'Robert Ludlum meets Judith Krantz meets Dean Koontz', not a happy combination.

As far as thriller plots go, it's mediocre and rather farfetched. The characters are two-dimensional. The writing style is not the least bit creative or literary. The accounts of religious and art history are spurious. The puzzles and word games provide entertaining diversions, but they don't outweigh the book's other deficiencies. In straddling several genres, the book has apparently attracted a broad readership. (The religious controversy it stirred up didn't hurt either.) But I doubt that many have walked away thrilled.For a monastic literary mystery, try The Name of the Rose. For simple excitement, go for something like Michael Crichton or Harry Potter. But don't bother with this."},{"rating":"1","title":"buyer beware","review":"Alexander Pope once said \\"a little learning can be a dangerous thing.\\" How true that is. Like others, including Oliver Stone, Brown has taken a few interesting bits of historical information mixed with some out-right fabrication and attempted to form a conspiracy of sorts, involving the Catholic Church and among others: Constantine, Mary Magdalene, Victor Hugo, Leonardo da Vinci and even Walt Disney.The trouble, of course, with this kind of fast and loose investigation in which the presumption that because A follows b then b must have caused a, is that it more often than not leads to mistaken conclusions.Ah, but this is a work of fiction, you say. That does not seem to be the message that Mr. Brown is spreading as he markets his novel. I suppose that the belief that this nonsensical pulp could be based on reality is essential to sales. So let that old caveat \\"buyer beware\\" continue to be your warning."},{"rating":"1","title":"conspiracy du jour","review":"Did you know that Lincoln's secretarys name was Kennedy and that Kennedy's secretarys name was Lincoln?

Absolutely nothing.Dan Brown attempts to make something out of nothing here by stringing together coincidence, half-baked \\"theories\\" and outright fabrication. I'm sure in his clever, mercenary hands the Lincoln/Kennedy co-winky-dink could have our constitution and democratic process hanging by a thread.The writing is woefully mediocre, the characters are cartoonish, one dimensional and not very bright.

Many have observed that Brown obviously steals from the research of HOLY BLOOD HOLY GRAIL. However, I have yet to see anyone state that the bulk of Brown's sex goddess theology (including gothic arch \\"vaginas\\") comes straight off the pages of THE TEMPLAR REVELATION by Lynn Picknett and Clive Prince. Read these two books, and you'll see that Brown's so-called \\"research\\" took perhaps all of two weeks to compile. Everything in Da Vinci Code is somewhere in these two books. He is neither original, nor is he a good writer. Baigent, Leigh, Lincoln, Picknett, and Prince, in my opinion, have grounds to bring a plagiarism suit against Brown. I hope they do.

It is an acceptable mystery that moves along although some of the dialog is amateurish or maybe just aimed at the poorly educated reader. There is quite a bit of repetition so that at points in the novel where I would normally have read very carefully I was able to quickly breeze through because I knew the same idea would be repeated several times in the next few pages.The symbolism uses such loose associations that it is difficult to believe if not downright scary that people buy into it so thoroughly. Finally as only a wedding, funeral, and holiday churchgoer the ideas about the early days of Christianity were of little interest. When the movie is released, I will be sitting at home reading something more thought provoking."},{"rating":"2","title":"A brilliant idea behind a good thriller","review":"First of all I would recommend to buy the Illustrated Edition. The illustrations inside give a new dimension to the book. Dan Brown's easy-going descriptive language and illustrations made me feel like I have visited and seen all the places with my own eyes. I am not a huge fan of thrillers, but this one is brilliant, although I enjoyed more a totally new point of view on Christianity and Jesus - the ultimate mystery, than the action of the thriller. I have also discovered many interesting facts about Da Vinci and other people and places that I was not aware of.The book is a good treat for both, mystery addicts and thrillers lovers as well"},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining","review":"This is a great book that is worth reading. The whole concept regarding DaVinci is very intriguing and you do not run cross many dull moments in the story. The whole ordeal makes you wonder and think about what may have happened.

Ordinarily, the fact that a writer attributes eye-colour or an expressive gaze to a silhouette would not bode well for the reader. However, in fairness to the author, I really don't think that the typical reader of this truly remarkable work is likely to know what a silhouette is, let alone notice or care. For the rest of us, the joy is in discovering just how deliciously badly written it can get. Which is 'very'.If you liked reading The Da Vinci Code, you might want to rent *Plan 9 from Outer Space*. *The Creature from Planet X* was pretty good, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ae Educational Read!","review":"I have finally bought and read (in 2 days!) The Da Vinci Code and I am glad I did.When released here in Australia, it created a storm of controversy.

Dan Brown sure has written a successful book, hasn't he? Best seller for many weeks. This book is eye candy. Discerning readers among you, you know what I mean. I read it in a day.But don't kid yourself. This book isn't researched, or in any way accurate in the details. It's a plot spun, interestingly enough, around little kernels of sketchy 'information'. Just FORGET about Constantine's role in the canonization of Scripture! Dan Brown should be ashamed of himself for suggesting he's done good research. Now if you want to read a better source for all of this, I suggest books like Holy Blood, Holy Grail or The Woman with the Alabaster Jar, or better, The Feminine Face of God."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Agree with the Pans","review":"I was pleased to see that many readers had the same reaction to the Da Vinci Code as I.

I'm afraid it just got too much of a stretch that the 'bad guys' were always just half a step behind the 'good guys' no matter how many fantastic escapes they pulled. It felt more like \\"The Perils of Pauline\\" written by a theological think tank.A nice try, but there are too many unlikely twists and a plot hole large enough to drive a semi through."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Da Vinci Code","review":"The Da Vinci Code is an eminently readable book that is a tapestry of conspiracy theories arranged to create a mega-conspiracy theory. While many of the theories are based upon half-truths, they are tied together in such a way to make the conspiracies seem plausible. Brown presents this book as based on fact; in reality it is based on theory - and in many cases these theories are flimsy. However, flimsy theories, when presented with confidence, are often the most entertaining theories. Basically, this book is an effective escape from reality by an author with an anti-religion agenda - take the \\"facts\\" with a grain of salt. The Da Vinci Code is action packed and filled with surprising revelations. It's a quick and easy to follow read. The chapters are brief and dramatic for those with short attention spans, and the overall package ties together well for a quick, interesting and exciting read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Any book I really like has to have a great start that gets me in to the book, an interesting story, and then I'm hooked.

I agree, it was a shocker, only because I was shocked that I had figured the whole thing out by the middle of the book. I felt the plot sophomoric. I found the history interesting and the interpretations fun, but in the long run I would not recommend the book to anyone who likes a good mystery that is tough to figure out, cuz this ain't it!

I was excited to read it, but that came to a grueling end as I trudged through Brown's \\"research.\\" My college freshman English professor would of marked down my paper with such flimsy research. It took me all of two minutes to find on the internet that the sect Opus Dei does not even have monks. One of the main characters of the book could not even exist, so much for Dan's research. I also would question that five million women were killed as witches in the Middle Ages. My research could only find that maybe 15,000 died, while sad, not close to the 5,000,000 stated in the book. As for the story of Mary Magdalene and Jesus' marriage, that has been around for years and is nothing new, as most of the reading public seems to believe.

While Brown may have a lot to say about the Catholic church he has little to say about his characters.This novel seems mostly like an easy way out - Brown can get his beliefs and theories into general circulation without citing sources or offering proof by putting them into a popular novel. Brown proves to be a poor historian and novelist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too unbelievable a plot","review":"One of the pleasures of reading fiction is the ability to suspend reality for awhile. Within that context, however, the plot needs to be believable. For example, in science fiction, the author will lay out most of the 'rules of the universe' early on, for example, 'takes place 10 or 100 or 500 years in the future', 'government is now galaxy-wide', etc., etc. The basic premise in THIS book is that a number of people can keep a deep secret for 2000 years, and that NONE of those folks would be confronted with a motivation to break ranks (successfully, anyway). He also mis-states a fair amount of history: one example, overstating the number of gospels that were floating around before the Council of Nicea.Sadly, I think the real motivation behind this book is simply anti-Christian, and more specifically, Vatican-bashing. I suppose if it's subtle enough, people will get sucked into it, but frankly, the plot was just too stupid for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junkfood for fools","review":"Unfortunately average reader's ignorance proves again and again that garbage sells, thanks to untiring efforts of ignorant and greedy literary agents/parasites and semi-educated editors/con-artists of large publishing houses, who cannot distinguish between literature and Spiderman.Has it ever occured to anyone that Jesus is a fictive invention, and a poor one at that?

Great job by Dan Brown."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Wish the Book Were More Respectful of Christianity","review":"Overall, I enjoyed this book but I was uncomfortable reading it when it became particularly critical and dismissive of Christian beliefs. I think the author could have accomplished the same goal of creating a compelling \\"villain\\" if he had just focused on the extreme forms of Christianity, such as Opus Dei, without so contemptuously dismissing most fundamental Christian beliefs (especially in the character of Teabing).

It appears to have made many waves and since I am interested in the history of Religion I thought it would make an interesting read. Far from it.The characters are flat and one-dimension and the whole book is based on the so-called 'secrets' Brown reveals. Without the information on the history of the church (though their accuracy is debateable) the fact that the storyline is completely lacking would have been blaringly obvious. But even so, he obviously trusts that all his readers are as dense and uniformed on the subject matter as his character Sophie. Rather, I found myself laughing out loud every time it took Langdon and Leigh forever to figure out a 'riddle' I, the layman, had solved within seconds. Not to mention that the 'revolutionary' ideas portrayed by Brown are hardly new.

And I'm not judging it by high-brow standards. Mr. Brown simply does not write as well as some of his contemporaries within the same genre.Mr. Brown does, however, have a finely-tuned ear. An ear that is able to pick up on the desire for people to re-write history to jibe with current sociological trends. This is fictional religious history for the \\"girls kick ass!\\" crowd. I suspect that Mr. Brown, in all honesty, wrote this book with more of an eye towards the \\"almighty dollar\\" than the \\"sacred feminine.\\"In which case, this book is a resounding success.

The unbelieveable plot twists and vain attempts at maintaining some minimal level of credibility strain Mr. Brown's slight talents to the breaking point. Venal characters, unsympathetic and sometimes ludicrous, leave us totally uncaring of their fates about half way through the novel.Brown executes his craft at a breathtakingly amateurish level and insults our collective intelligences throughout the book. Such a novel preys on the ignorant and easily persuaded to promote a blatantly anti-religious message. That the book is boring is just one insult added to the rest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Historically Incorrect","review":"This book leads readers to believe that it has historical truth in it, for the most part it doesn't.

Pulp fiction novels and paperback romances have significantly more substance and style. Written to be made into a movie, this book suffers from \\"public education\\" command of the language, poor character development and bulk beyond the climax that seems to satisfy contractual obligations rather than contribute to the plot.

It was his answer to, \\"HOW MUCH OF THIS NOVEL IS BASED ON FACT?,\\" which really disappointed me. The bulk of his response was, \\"The paintings, locations, historical documents, and organizations described in the novel all exist.\\" Thriller or not, this book is passed off as being historically accurate and full of facts (which has been been commented on by numerous reviewers here and elsewhere). I expect a lot more information regarding his sources and research when he has unlimited space on the net (I didn't notice a bibliography in the back of the book either).I would probably enjoy this book as a mystery, but the way he presents this book seems devious and unethical which is why I chose not to read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"An absolute scream","review":"This book is a hoot from start to finish.

I bought copies for friends so they could laugh at it. That anybody would ever take it seriously never occurred to me. To write something like this, you have to take egregious liberties with historical facts, and have utter disregard for the reputations of people living and dead. A laughable story. That it would be so widely successful never occurred to me. Dan Brown, enjoy it while it lasts. Any time an author scores like this, the rest of us have to be happy for you!

The writing has an irritating, smug tone and exceptionally grating tongue-in-cheek dialogue. This author's prose is reminiscent of, and has all the sophistication of the narration from Ed Wood's movies.Any real mystery or intrigue in the book is coincidental, inherent in the subject matter but missing from the story. The author wraps an absurd plot in sophomoric characters and childish puzzles.

But I suppose it'll be just a matter of months before a major TV network makes it a \\"movie of the week.\\" Not very original at all but B-O-R-I-N-G."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dan Brown's crimes","review":"I will be brief, for there are plenty of reviews which you can read here that I completely agree with.This is an extraordinarily bad book, for any number of reasons you may imagine. It is, quite possibly, one of the worst books I have ever read. The writing is so simple, bad, awkward, and cliched, it is (quite literally) painful to read it. After I did, I felt like I needed a shower.I prefer not to think that it was a great bestseller, and what that means for today's culture and people's level of general literacy. And I also prefer to forget that it was recommended to me by some people I otherwise respect.Do yourself a favour: stay away from this book. Just about any other book would do much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dan Brown has mastered the art of page-turning stories!","review":"A dead body in the Louvre leads to a chase through France and England, moving from one clue to the next. The DaVinci Code will leave you questioning how you look at art and history as it plunges you into a world of secret societies and secret agendas. A fantastic read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Formulaic and predictable","review":"A quarter of the way through I realized why this book is such a page-turner. Brown uses a tried-and-true formula for keeping the readers going, even when the story lapses into incredible implausibility. Develop a series of mysteries within a bigger mystery and keep the reader interested by making every chapter a cliff-hanger. One mystery solved leads to another mystery to be solved. Etc., etc., etc. Now that seeing how it's done by a master I'm going to write a similar novel, make a million bucks, and retire. Unlike Mr. Brown, however, I won't bother writing more than one bestseller. I'm not greedy. I figure one good bilkering of America's dumbed-down readers is enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely Worth Buying","review":"I was loaned this book by a friend and I am now buying it so that I can lend it to my friends and relatives. It is definitely worth it. Not being a big fan of murder mysteries, I was apprehensive about reading this book when it was recommended to me. But since I was assured it also crossed genres into historical fiction (my true love) I decided to give it a try. I was hooked within the first 10 pages. The romanticized descriptions of the Louvre and other museums/landmarks made me want to give Paris another chance after having had a bad experience there a few summers ago. The story is fascinating, the well-researched history is intriguing, the pace is energizing, and the characters are stereotypical but adorable nonetheless. Buy it or borrow it ... it is a great read."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is TERRIBLE","review":"Please don't waste your time with this book. It's just so lame. The characters are barely there--names on a page. The plot is lamer than lame. Embarrassing. Horrifying to see how many people like this book.Read the Name of the Rose if you want to read about Christianity in a fun way. Read anything but this book. The codes are not that hard to figure out except for one that involves another language.The book is totally pseudo-intellectual. I don't understand why people think it's good. Really baffling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book....front to back","review":"I usually bore easily when it comes to reading novels, but Dan Brown's \\"DaVinci Code\\" kept me intrigued from beginning to end. His attention to detail was amazing. I was in France a few years ago and found his descriptions of the Lourve Museum painstakingly accurate. Each plot twist made me want to finish the book even faster to see how it would end. I hope to see Brown write more novels involving the symbologist Robert Langdon. I just bought Brown's earlier novel \\"Angels and Demons\\", hoping his earlier works are on par with \\"The DaVinci Code\\". It was an excellent book....Highly recommended"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best!!!","review":"I loved this book and can't say enough.

The mingling of some fact with a lot of fiction will leave most with more questions than answers, or worse the belief that much of what Brown passes off as legitimate undisputed theology is actually the truth. If you're still interested in reading it, the good news is that you can do it in an evening or two and move onto something better!PS I completely agree with the reviewer who complained about the publisher's review spoiler; many reader reviewers do this as well and I, too, think Amazon should effect a policy against this practice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly puerile premise","review":"Didn't like this book at all.

Furthermore, the entire premise is implausible as the key element of the mystery, the \\"Priory of Sion\\" and its guardianship of the Holy Grail has been proven to be a complete hoax. Mr. Brown's biblical scholarship is shoddy, his analyses of the artworks of Leonardo are facile and, of course, he provides no motive for the secret, which has been kept for so long, to be kept.

The book itself is quite large so if you enjoy bringing books with you on your travels, this one is quite difficult to lug around. The chapters are very short which makes for an easy read for just about anyone. I love a book that can take one meaning and flip it around to have another meaning that comes out of nowhere.

The book would have had more credibility if it was based in something that was historically plausible.

You could retire and write some good stuff.Fortunately most respectable writers have more integrity than Mr. Brown and would not stoop to this level. The writing is junk. The controversy is junk history.

The plot was interesting and the few tidbits about symbols kept me reading a bit further, but this book really fell flat in all other areas. The characters are two dimensional with no real depth, most of the information about what the symbols stood for is flat out wrong, and it seemed that the main driving force behind the novel was the notion the Jesus and Mary were married and had a child.Now, I wouldn't mind reading a book that theorized about a wedded Jesus, but this one certainly isn't it. I personally don't believe it happened, but I have heard some valid points for it happening and none of it appear in this book. Sensationalism aside, this book isn't worth the time and there are much better written works out there that are far more rewarding."},{"rating":"2","title":"How could anyone give this less than 5 stars?","review":"I realize that some critics have accused the Da Vinci code of being full of cliches and predictable characters, but give me a break! This isn't high-brow literary fiction. It's an un-put-downable suspense/thriller with added perks like intelligent protagonists, intriguing historical details, and thought-provoking what-ifs.

I found it horrible; I had to make myself finish it.Basically, the leaps of logic made in the book are far out and unrealistic. I found the book to also be very anti-Catholic, and, being a Catholic, I found much of the text to be offensive and inaccurate. Anyone with a basic knowledge of Christian and Catholic history can punch holes through the plot so large that it becomes worthless to continue reading.This is not an accurate book or a historical expose as many believe it to be; it is at best a poor fictional story.

Mr Brown writes for an immature teenage audience. The cast are poor caricatures in a badly directed play without a real plot. The scenes are pure fantasy and I just get the feeling that Dan Brown is writing to order. He may well have talent (he can fill the pages) but I won't believe it is beyond the mundane, publisher prompted airport level, until he can write something with the detail and depth of Frederick Forsyth, say. Forsyth is no master either but I think his writing comes from experience and the heart rather than overdone research and editorial interference.I read the first couple of chapters and couldn't wait to put it down. The plot was weak, the writing poor and the detail pompous and overblown."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cultural literacy thriller","review":"This book starts out with lots of superfluous description of people and places that never ties up or is relevant to the tale.

As they say in the trade \\"it is the last person you would suspect.\\"Now for the positives. After a slow start the action finally starts to move. If you think it has holes that you could fly a jet through, maybe but if it did not you would have no story. One thing people enjoy in books is things they already know about.

This book is enlightening on two main points, the role of the \\"Illuminati\\" in art history, and the deep distaste Mr. Brown has for the Catholic Church. Despite the bone he has to pick with \\"Rome\\" the book is very interesting, and even though it is a popular murder mystery, it does not descend into rank sentimentality. Overall, an excellent read."},{"rating":"1","title":"The book is a 4-star if you stop reading before the end","review":"Dan Brown just does not know when to stop - he is too clever by half. A surprise ending is great; two more surprises that undo the previous surprise(s) gets annoying. Mr. Brown has a genius for making what could be a fairly dry/academic topic very exciting and (to a point) plausible. He brings the reader along for a great ride - up to a point - and then, as he has done in all of his books, he goes beyond the point of credulity and crashes. It is a shame. I have read three of his books. He is a fine writer but (or at least could be), but until he has learned to stop trying to prove how clever he is and put his pencil down he will continue to be like the painter who paints a masterpiece, but lacking the wisdom of knowing when to stop, keeps painting and makes a second-rate mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Da Vinci Code","review":"I found this book to be deceptive, pandering to our incessant search for moral loopholes. The author has taken old myths and repackaged them for a reading public that has very little experience with history.

It's fiction, a good read for a weekend of nights-at-home.I tip my hat to Dan Brown for creating a well told story from historical and theological ideas existing in the real world: the Priory of Scion, Da Vinci's curiously ingenious creations, the many churches along with their storied histories, the violent past of Christianity, and Opus Dei to name a few.Please relax and enjoy it. Ignore the controversy.

Something to tickle the imagination, get the brain working a bit, in directions perhaps it does not normally go.But he's really not a very good writer of fiction.I read this, all the while thinking that the interesting ideas, in the hands of a competent writer of thrillers, would have really given me a greater pay-off.His action is not very compelling, there are far too many cliff hangers, and his characters are largely uninteresting or simply not believable.As a thriller, Da Vinci Code is not very...thrilling.I certainly had no problem putting the book down each night, which is just not the case when I'm immersed in a well-written thriller.I could post the same review for his other books, they're all of same quality, writing-wise, but find this behavior cheesy in others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trite and formulaic","review":"There's very little else to say about this book. It would have been a 2 or 3 star book - but it lost one star for the relentless (dare we say inane?) press that proclaims this book as some messianic roadmap through history. It's an easy airplane read for when you want to kill some time (and maybe a few brain cells) but aren't looking for anything of particular import."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I read Angels&Demons which I loved. Went out 3 days later to buy this book, and was very disappointed. It was a decent read, but fell short of its potential. It was a good plot, but very underdeveloped. Angels&Demons seemed to flow and the story seemed riveting from page to page. The DaVinci Code had its good points. However there were times when the author seemed to drag the story on. Buy it at discounted price if you want to read it, but it is not worth the full price of a hardcover book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money","review":"This is NOT an \\"intelligent and lucid thriller.\\" The materail about the Grail Myth is okay, the symbolic interpretaitions of famous works of art and lit are okay, but after that, the book is just plain dull. The characters are flat, cardboard figures. The plot is a maze of coincidences and last second, farfetched solutions to unbelievable problems, as though the author is just making things up as he goes along. The writing plods forward. I believed the hype. You'd think I was old enough to know better."},{"rating":"1","title":"rip-off","review":"there is not much to say about this book except that it is a total rip-off of \\"the book of light\\" by Michelle Simons. The davinci code uses the exact same premise of the book of light, exept it is written in the style of a 3 year old, it makes sense why it appeals to so many. If you read other low star reviews it explains my reasoning. I do not hae the time to tell you why."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scooby Doo Ending","review":"Secret societies, albino monks, murder, mystery... what more could I have asked for? I should have asked for more! The background or pseudo-history of secret societies and hidden religions was very facinating. The writing style was horrible, though. As each chapter passed, I found the formula of *answer a question* then *find a clue* then *ask another question* then *turn to the next chapter* tiring. I doubt this entire escapade took only a day and a half! And the Scooby Doo ending to boot!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Research, Poor Writer","review":"On occasion this story was good, but after the author used the same technique to cheat the audience repeatedly just to keep some suspense going, I started to get bored.It is also interesting to note that every extra (disposable) character in the same scene has the exact same reaction as all the others. I didn't realize there were still so many sheep bleating overseas.If you want a good story and don't mind the author's poor writing skills, this is a decent attempt. I must admit I was amazed when I realized Dan Brown had been published before - I thought the mistakes he made were because he was a beginner!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It could have been a contender","review":"If only it didn't go to seed at the end.

Yes, thank goodness for Eco."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't Put It Down","review":"I don't usually get into suspense/mystery thrillers, which made my discovery of this novel that much more of a pleasant surprise.

Extremely thought-provoking and highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is Dan Brown a pen name for Danielle Steele?","review":"I bought the book for a good vacation read, but have read more eloquent prose in trashy romance novels. Do this to see if this book is more than a travel pamphlet for Europe. Go to Chapter 3, read the first paragraph out loud. I was so disappointed. The plot is also very transparent. I was not moved to read any of his other books if this is the sort of mush he serves his readers. Did anyone else realize AT ONCE that the 'language' was actually English written backward?

I think they secretly feared that the \\"fascinating esoterica of history\\"-- as, I believe, the above review put it -- was true.But not to fear. This book is neither \\"fascinating\\" nor historical.

The scholarship and the characters who are supposedly scholars lack all credibility; this wouldn't matter if as fiction it still made a good story, but it is so lame. It's like a mishmash of a lot of thriller movies, but lacking any character of its own. I am totally puzzled why so many people recommend this book. They must not read much.

There are much better books on this subject out there. Holy Blood, Holy Grail for one. Whether any of the ideas presented in these works are true is a subject for another debate.

What are people thinking? The writing is no better than average and the aspersions about the Templar's, Mary Magdalene, the Holy Grail etc. etc. ad nauseum, are ridiculous.Yes, Mary is an important figure in early Christianity. At one level, she WAS a disciple and may have been an apostle. It is even conceivable that she and Jesus were married. It is also conceivable that she was married to one of Jesus' other apostles. There is no way to know. Beyond that there is only wild, pointless speculation.This book is aimed at gullible fish and, judging from the hype, Brown hooked them all too eaily.

The development of a relationship between two of the main characters seemed forced and a bit shallow, to be honest - and this was my only real disappointment with it. The overal story was fascinating and intellectually thrilling, although it has left me with the need to dig further to find out how much was fact and how much was fiction!

Wow. I was disappointed. The story itself is provoking and brings up some interesting points, but overall it is a cheaply written thriller.There are much better, more interesting thrillers by Michael Crichton and the likes. Overall I would compare this book to a cheap action flick, one that causes you to laugh at the shear audacity of many of the scenes, laughing, pointing and saying \\"Hey! That could never happen!\\"In conclusion, if you like books you probably won't like this one. If you prefer reality TV then you will love this book. Blah."},{"rating":"1","title":"awful!","review":"There is very little to be said in favour of this novel: it is a rehash job with a bad plot added to it, it is badly written, it lacks research (and provides lots of false information) and contains no characterization. Why on earth was this a bestseller? And why are all the main characters so useless at getting the clues?Anyone can point out the factual errors, but which young French Parisian woman would ever utter the following: \\"You're kidding, right? We're going to visit a knight?\\"What a waste of money! I can only hope it kept a few ignorant Americans amused on their cruises - or that it encourages them to visit the Temple Church (based on the Church of the Sepulchre in Jerusalem, which I suppose is pagan inspired, too ...), etc., etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Illustrations are important.","review":"I loved, loved, loved this book. I thought the plot was wonderful, I cared about the characters & best of all I learned about things I never knew.Mostly I'm writing this to let others know that if you are going to buy this book, you might as well get this illustrated edition.

I read it without stopping. It was a real page turner! I found it fascinating, and the plot was fun and suspenseful...and yet it was all laced with historical fact and theories. It was almost just like a fun history lesson. I think it was worth buying, and it's okay that other people think differently...but personally, it was a wonderful book. In fact, I bought a second copy for a friend's birthday."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Read!","review":"Dan Brown has done a wonderful job with this book.

Mr. Brown has made an attempt to popularize some very stale and discounted conspiracy drivel in a creaky, formulaic throw-away mystery.I can see other authors trying to capitalize on The Code's success by resurrecting Lincoln, JFK and even Bermuda triangle conspiracy ideas that have received some past interest in print.I am not a Catholic, but I think that Mr. Brown owes the church an apology. The irony here is that Brown uses deception to make some kind of case about what he believes are the lies of the church. His agenda is obvious in the tedious preaching of the unbelievably one dimensional characters.The least he could do is donate some of the profits to a Catholic charity, maybe the Mother Teresa foundation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pitiful pop-culture trash","review":"I was looking forward to reading this book because a friend told me that the book was about cryptography, symbols, and religion. I was disappointed by all three aspects. The shoddy recycling of religious urban myths is bad enough .... And the low-brow treatment of crytography was annoying too: mirror-writing and crossword-type puzzles is about as sophisticated as it gets. But at least, after 450 pages, the author could at least given the novel a satisfying conclusion. The author leads us to the brink of something satisying but leaves us hanging at the end. This is the worst book I have read in a long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who wrote this stuff?","review":"It is amazing to me that this book is a number one best seller. I guess I shouldn't be surprised, when murderers of the language like Tom Clancy and John Grisham can be at the top of the list. The writing in this book is TERRIBLE. Although the intellectual puzzles posed are interesting, it is completely implausible that characters under such stress, lack of sleep, etc. could suddenly have the solutions to these puzzles dawn on them. In addition, the plot has more deus ex machina moments than the entire history of Greek theater. Very disappointing, and not even a good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"debunking the Da Vinci Code","review":"If you want to read something that appears to debunk Christianity, you might enjoy this book.It is, however, utter nonsense. Surely there are real facts that some enterprising writer could employ to fly in the face of the Roman Catholic Church and Christianity. Or does it matter? What fun! What sport! to undermine the faith of millions. Count me in!Brown has used easily disproved \\"facts\\" to create a harmful mystery novel here. Harmful because he has presented his \\"facts\\" as the truth. Which they are not.I am not a Catholic, I don't even meet the definition of a Christian. I am a believer in the truth, so If you do choose to read this book, I suggest that you do a google search for \\"debunking the Da Vinci Code\\" when you are finished with it. If you CAN finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anti-Catholic Bigotry","review":"This book is just another turgid attempt to foist anti-Catholic bigotry on the unsuspecting. It makes blatent errors about Catholicism that could have been solved just by looking in the catechism. I don't know any members of Opus Dei who are assassins. It smacks of how the Jesuits were portrayed in the 19th century. Amazing how anti-Catholic ignorance transcends time. No other religion gets treated this way or there would be cries of foul. Even non-Catholics will be offended by this book. Don't give the bigots your money. Buy something worthwile to read instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a letdown!!!","review":"After all the hype, what a waste!I thought the story was very lacking.

I did not care one bit for the two main protagonists. I didnt care if they lived or died since they had absolutely no back story in this book. The only character i enjoyed was Silas who seemed to be a poor ignorant man mislead by zealots. He would have been better served as an atheist who went to S&M; shows to get his blood running.On the plus side, this book was a fast paced read and i was very curious as to what the holy grail was going to turn out to be. However, after the whole holy grail thing was explained i found myself going, 'huh?' and 'are you kidding me?'Good read for a high schooler.

My excuse for starting it is that it was a hot topic at the time I read it (2004); my excuse for finishing it (and this is the shameful part, and the only reason I gave it 2 stars) is that it was a decent thriller, in a mindless sort of way--the literary equivalent of Die Hard 2, 3, 4, ...

Its a quick and easy read because the chapters are very short and virtually every one ends in a cliffhanger. In between cliffhangers the characters stand around explaining things to each other with long verbal dissertations about feminine symbolism. The ideas presented are old conspiracy-theory stuff, which is ok in itself, but I think the author reaches too far into the unbelievable (Disney? The Vatican is broke?) The Big Secret is not a new idea, either. The ending of this book is particularly silly. I only gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because it inspired me to learn something about the Council of Nicea on my own - certainly a very important event in history, but not accurately portrayed in this novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Finished book.

What a waste of paper! The characters were mediocre, the plot line drolled on and on, and the conclusion was anticlimatic with just plain silliness. It is obvious that this author has been scorned by the church, and this nonsensical and disconnected book is his revenge. I mean really, the French all upset about some kind of religious sex act? Like they even care about strange religious tendencies. As far as the Jesus/Mary line, just because the author wishes it to be true, doesn't make it so.

Yet for some reason it is politically correct to accuse the Catholic church of just about anything.I am not a Catholic, I am a Mormon, and I am very disheartened by the favor this junk seems to be enjoying with the public. It is accepted that authors can use creative liscense in works of fiction, but Mr. Brown should be ashamed of himself for his assertion that the information he bases this silly premise on is factual.Yes, I have read it.

I have, however, read quite a bit about the claims it makes. The reason for the one star is that Mr. Brown CLAIMS the assertion on the first page of the book merely means that the mentioned documents exist. Except, of course, on those days when Mr. Brown CLAIMS the documents prove the outrageous assertions outlined in the book.I was reading the Bible last night and came across 2 Peter Chapter 2. It states that people are susceptible to people like Mr. Brown, someone with no credentials in theology and someone who has clearly amassed a forture through his false teaching, because they are \\"unstable\\". In Biblical lingo, this means they don't know the Word of God, they haven't spent time in the Word. What a shame for them, and for America. I pray for revival almost every night.

The writing is simplistic the characters as thin as paper and the plot forced and I believe absurd came to mind once or twice.Facts or not this should be a kid's book. I kind of chuckle when I read reviews like \\"Will change your outlook on life\\" whoa, get a grip people, reality is calling.Should you read it?

It introduces to an English reader Europe's bestselling critic of the Vatican's distortion of Jesus' life, Eugen Drewermann. (Paperback now available at amazon.com). Drewermann was silenced in the 1990s at the behest of the man who last year became Pope Benedict XVI: former Cardinal Ratzinger.The book also points the way to a reintegration of the sacred feminine into Christianity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Average","review":"Dan Brown had some interesting historical insight on the brotherhoods and of Da Vinci's life. However, the story is very predictable, especially after all the attention it has received.

She does a much better job in concocting a story line that keeps you on your toes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Comical History/Fairly Interesting Fiction","review":"As a fan of Brown, I was sad to see his cult-like comments about this book in which he proclaims himself the new expert on 2,000 years of history. His grasp of this history is closer to a senior high school student, and was more than a little unusual. I know any author needs to fall in love with the topic, but this one was over the top. Nice fiction effort. I look forward to his future books. I hope he can just drop this X-file level story-line and move on. He is so creative with fiction, that I would appeal that he not quit this area of giftedness for amateur history class."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written, poor research","review":"This is a work that I wouldn't recommend to anyone with any historical knowledge. There are so many problems with the story that it is distracting. The idea of a sacred feminine, as a woman myself, is redundant. I am disappointed in the need to build a myth that deifies women as a gender. The idea of doing so is pointless, when it is the nature of human beings, based on the algorithms in the brain interacting with the environment that are the problem. Nothing new here--just a jumble of myths and \\"entertainment\\" that bore the reader to no end.I think the standards that are needed to produce a best seller have dropped quite a bit. Double Day did the world no favor with its inaccuracies. As such every reader should ask for its money back. People should sue them since they have made the claim everything is true."},{"rating":"1","title":"pass","review":"What is all the fuss about? At best this novel is a mindless page turning thriller. I admit the preface is intriguing, but the writing was so rudimentary I found myself wishing it was in comic book form...then at least I'd have a better description of the characters.I probably wouldn't have such a problem with this book had it not been masqueraded as 'the novel of the century' or 'the best book ever'.The only thing this novel left me wanting to do was tally the amount of times Mr. Brown used the word 'aura' and compare it to the amount of times he used the word 'the'...admit it, you're curious too."},{"rating":"1","title":"I tried!

I tried, I really tried to like the Da Vinci Code, but I could not finish it.It has a great story line, and Mr. Brown could have created great twists and turns with it--but he ran out of gas. His style included a big twist (like a murder) in the story--then for twenty pages, the characters would talk about it. Another big twist; and another twenty pages of discussion.That, and the fact he took true facts, tweaked them considerably, and then presented them to the reader as fact.I would have even liked if the book if it had been well written, but it was not. Run on sentences, changes of person and numerous other discretions of writing made for a very choppy read.I really tried to like this book, but could not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not an original work","review":"Brown's *The Da Vinci Code* mixes the holy-grail story with shallow, web-based research on symbolism, iconology, paganism, early Christianity, and historical tidbits of certain historically significant places in London and Paris. His structure is choppy, and he seems to lift his prose from other sources. Consider the following excerpt from his book (p. 395):\\"Westminster Abbey is considered neither cathedral nor parish church. It bears the classification of royal peculiar, subject only to the sovereign.\\"[...]\\"Neither a cathedral nor a parish church, Westminster Abbey is a 'royal peculiar' under the jurisdiction of a Dean and Chapter, subject only to the Sovereign.\\"One can only guess how many other such examples pervade the book.

Who said books can't be a bit fantastic and out-there? but Brown is a really terrible writer. The DV Code is totally forced, concocted, and cheesey. And have you tried any of the other books this clown had written? Digital Fortress was again, a nice little (predictable) story, but Holy S### was the writing weak. So in the end if you want to be entertained, I bet the movie will be worth 10 bucks, but the read?

However, I would advise you not to buy the audio version. I don't know if it was the idea of the director or the narrator, but the the story is narrated in an unconvincing fake French accent (in dialogue). It gets worse when the male narrator continues to narrate the central female character in his best female French accent.

The Romans, Herod, and the high priest are corrupt, and Judas figures Jesus would make a perfect political leader -- except that's not at all what Jesus is trying to do.

There's an unpleasant sting to the violins at higher volume.Abbado has never considered Brahms a composer of conflict or inner struggle, thus missing a great deal of what makes him great, but the Serenade #1 is a thoroughly uncomplicated, optimistic work, so Abbado's approach works. My attention wandered a bit--everything was sweet and genial to a fault--and DG stingily put only this 49 min. piece on the CD.

I'm quite satisfied with the M162. It serves its purpose and I wanted more cushions for around the house. The cushion is 16\\" x 13\\" x 3\\" down to 1.5\\" (wedge). The outer covering is a navy washable cotton/polyester blend. I noticed that the quality of this covering isn't as great as the much older Astar cushion I own. But, it's okay. At least I don't feel like I'm slipping around in my chair.The regular, M162, cushion does compress down a bit. I weigh approx. 105 pounds so this might be an issue for someone weighing much more.

Not an over-sized load, but u-locks are kind of heavy. So I just left the zipper zipped up to the middle of the bag. Just recently, the zippers have begun to detach from the bag at the seems.

For Football and other spectator sports, 8X40 with very wide angle is the perfect bino size. Weather proof is a definite plus.

I offered up my Carhartts for him to wear. We went to the dinner at a very nice Country Club and no one there could have realized otherwise that the Carhartts are dungarees that I wear to work in. In fact, I was wearing the same style dungaree (different color) today walking around downtown Knoxville, TN.

Possibly other places as well depending on what color you get.Needless to say, I am greatly disappointed this fact.

I wear them because they're the hardest-wearing, most comfortable work pants for the money, very close to the gold standard (Duluth Trading Company edges them out on quality by half a notch, but their stuff costs more.)Not only do the pants last longer than the GAP and Dockers pants, they also meet most peoples' contemporary standards of casual attire, and don't look out of place with a polo or Oxford shirt. Once broken-in, they're quite comfortable, with a loose but not baggy cut that can fit over a pair of long johns without chafing in cold weather. They've made jeans obsolete in my wardrobe, being tougher and much better-looking street clothes.

Despite that, on your person they closely resemble the disgusting look of those Jnco pants that were popular in the 90s. Even in my extra wide internal metatarsal boots they appear strangely oversized. I had no intent of buying these for appearances, but rather for work.Unfortunately I ordered these while out of the country for work, by the time I came home to try them on the return window had passed.

At least until I get them stained or nicked up I can wear them in the office (where I am more and more as I get promoted out of real work) and they look like casual dress pants well enough, but more comfortable to me. I like jeans (and these pants) to fit a little loose in the thigh/leg and these do that. They are workman pants, so squatting / turning, etc. is comfortable hence the loose fit.

However, Carhart has now outsourced production to other countries. Last year, i ordered 5 pair in various colors. Every pair - identical size 34 x 30 - were cut differently. One pair, tight in waist and too long, another too wide in waist and too short, another correct waist but wrong length, etc. The green were made in Nicaragua, the brown in Mexico, etc, and the sizes seemed to vary by country of origin. So, extremely poor quality control. I ordered 2 pair this year, and had the same issue. So, unless you can go into a store and try them on, better get something else or be prepared to send them back and try to guess what size will arrive.

From what I understand,it was around this time(1973)that Ian Gillan and Ritchie Blackmore were at wit's end amongst each other,and it shows. The only track that stands out is \\"WOMAN FROM TOKYO\\". Songwriting has never been the strong suit of DP and this album as a whole obviously makes that clear if some of the other albums(however awesome they might have been)didnt quite glare it otherwise. If you need an example just check out \\"MARY LONG\\"(definitly their worst song!) Any track that opens with :\\"Mary Long is a hypocrite\\" and then has to spend the next lyric flatly defining what that means...well just listen to the song and that will sum up the inanity of this very disappointing album.

Who prefer music that seems to have been generated by a voice machine - \\"perfect\\" in every manner but for a gospel CD is ENTIRELY soul-less?Weird."},{"rating":"1","title":"not high quality","review":"this is a non expensive personal player. my son stopped using it because the earphone plug failed to work after two months. camera is of a very low quality, they do not even look like a one MP."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY Slippery....","review":"The gauge is fine, but should you sweat the lightest bit, you loose all control over the pick.

It sounded like it would be an enjoyable read. A nymphomaniac attacking a hospital patient, a black cat, a witch. The best part about this book was the blurb on the back cover. The rest was pretty boring.The story started out with a lot of promise, it contained humour, mystery, suspense, all the elements needed for a great novel ride. This soon fizzled out and I had to push the book to the finish line. I am not certain what happened, Ms Proulx had all the elements and got off to such a great start, but she seemed to not know where to take it. The characters weren't thatinteresting and the ending was too predictable.If I had it to do over again, I would not waste any time on this book, there are too many good ones out there.

I've never understood why it has never gotten the recognition it deserves.I bought my first vinyl copy at the Univ of Buffalo record co-op in '74 or '75, and bought at least a dozen more for friends who had never heard of it. I made tape copies for others. I have never bought/made this many copies of any other album, before or since. I wore out my vinyl copy playing it, and still have my replacement copy. I had long since given up ever seeing this on CD, but the recent celebrations of Pete's 90th inspired me to look again and discover it's available.The previous reviews sum up the album pretty well. I'll just add one comment. Even the early 70's lyrics hold up well today. For example, this line from \\"Get Up and Go\\" reminds me of a recent administration: \\"Though nations are warring and Nixon is vexed, I'll still stick around to see what happens next.\\"In summary: if you like Americana/folk music at all, buy this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dream Fulfilled","review":"I read this book,recommended by my son, several years ago and every reading reveals new details.

I obviously did not pay close enough attention. For two sponge (which weigh little) to be shipped from FL to NY it cost $19.99. What a joke? It was not over night or express it was flat rate shipping and they charged that much. WHAT A RIP OFF.

The sponge has also lost some elasticity. It doesn't bounce back as nicely as new when squeezed.- After 6 months, it starts to disintegrate and needs replacement."},{"rating":"2","title":"my first, but not my last","review":"I got my shipment much fast then I expected.

However, from the moment I began reading this book, I found myself doubting the legitimacy of a lot of the author's findings. Perhaps because of my training as a historian I was disappointed in the end notes--what should have been extensive notes about where the author was getting these excerpts from letters, other facts, etc., was not there. Like other reviewers, I found the author to contradict himself frequently. It was a fun read for the summer, but has no real historical merit."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good book!","review":"If you are just starting to study Queen Victoria or royal history in general, this is a good book to read.

The author writes in such a way to pique the reader's interest without seeming at all stuffy, the way some biographies are. He goes into geat detail of the lives of Victoria's daughters while weaving all the history of the period into the drama. We don't just get Victoria's daugthers but the entire history of the time as well. It is way, way intersting. I am going to look into buying more of Packard's books now that I have read this one.

We thought it would be perfect focusing not on the physical pregnancy/birth aspect of things, but instead on the fact that children are given to their parents by God. This was our mistake, as the book mainly focuses on the pregnancy and subsequent delivery for the little bear.While the book is a cute story and a nice read for small children to answer the question of \\"where did I come from?\\" physically, it would be totally inappropriate for an adoptive parent to read it to his or her child.

A couple standout tracks, mainly \\"There Goes the Fear\\" and \\"Pounding\\" strike you as instant classics from the first moments .... Also of note, I remember seeing the video for There Goes the Fear - pretty cool visual effects, and imagery - unique just like the music. Definitely a worthwhile purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"This album is a total disappointment. I had thought of Doves as everything Coldplay could be but wasn't. Unfortunately, this album is nothing more than Coldplay all over again. Just weak, uninspiring, pop music, mass produced and made for radio. It has no appeal. It's the kind of music you'll hear in the background in a department store, the kind of music that couldn't possibly offend anyone or make them think. While some fans see this as good song writing or good instrumentality, I don't agree at all that going for mass appeal is a step in the right direction.Thankfully, the third album, Some Cities, brought back the mood of Lost Souls. I have not yet listened to Lost Sides, as I have yet to get the taste of Last Broadcast out of my mouth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply dull","review":"Dull and uninspiring, listening to this CD I couldn't see what distinguished the Doves from the other insipid sound-a-like bands that plague the modern music scene. If you like The White Stripes, Franz Ferdinand, Arctic Monkeys, The Killers then be grateful that they've saved rock music from boring dross like this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not original","review":"they just sound like coldplay all over again. do we really need another coldplay band? they seem talented enough to defy this genre, so i'm wondering why they haven't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great follow-up album!!","review":"I would say that this album is better than their first. It's filled with very beautiful haunting songs, that have a brighter feel than their first album. Well worth the money!!!."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Stuff","review":"One of the biggest criticisms I tend to hear about this album from people who are familier with the band is that it's so much \\"happier\\" than the first- haha they made it big and got money and now write happy songs haha.Lord save me from cynics and whiners! The bottom line is that this album is just as stunningly good as \\"Lost Souls\\" was. Doves simply know how to make ridiculously great music. This is music you feel on a much deeper level than the vast majority of music out there these days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bad","review":"I agree with Paul Scofield, whoever he is. This doesn't measure up to their first album and that's a shame. The songwriting is inconsistent, the tunes are hard to distinguish from each other, and there are WAY too many technical tricks played with the vocals, and some of the synth noises reek of Emerson Lake and Palmer. Egad. Lyrics-wise, nothing comes close to being as heart-rending as, say, \\"Valley\\" from their 1st record. Did Doves make it too big too quickly? Guys...get depressed all over again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Doves do it good","review":"I was in a record shop buying a Coldplay CD recently and the clerk said if I was into Coldplay I should check out The Doves so I bought this CD. After a few listens, I've come to really like it, although I can't say it's as good as Coldplay. In terms of style, I would say the two bands are cut from the same cloth but I have to give Coldplay the edge when it comes to songwriting and vocals. Nevertheless, this is a fine record in it's own right and certainly worth buying. I'm curious to see how The Doves evolve, because they seem to me a band on the verge of something truly great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent album","review":"I have been a fan for a few years and this album surpassed even my expectations.

Of all the great new bands coming from the U.K., the Doves are by far one of the strongest. With just enough hints of dreamy distortion, lush orchestration and catchy hooks, this is an album that is just exceptionally crafted. Even when a couple of the tracks are a bit far reaching, you can't help but give them an \\"A\\" for effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"beautiful, reflective and contagious","review":"doves are a band that thrive on creating an atmosphere, forcing the listener in, to come sit on their couch, have a beer and reflect on their past while considering their future, if the listener desires. their music, this album in particular, is built on building. they start with finger-tapping rhythms, add fluid guitars, electronic pulses, appreciation for the stone roses, and it all overflows with waves of jimi goodwin's voice. not a beautiful voice, but nearly always affecting. subtle cadences, gentle rising and falling, and memorable choruses, which, if you are anything like me, put you in a mood to belt out and feel good."},{"rating":"2","title":"coming in clear","review":"This disc has been in constant rotation since it came out.

The most blatant example:Bobe-mayse is not derived from a story your grandmother told you, and you are free to use the word in her presence. It comes from a 16-th century translation into Yiddish by Elja Levita of the Italian romance \\"Bovo d'Antona\\" published under the name of \\"Bobe-bukh\\".I am tempted to send the book back to Amazon for a $ 10 refund, even if I have to pay for return shipmen!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It is absolutely wrong to misteach.","review":"It is wrong to pretend to know a subject and to write a book based upon ignorance.

Every page has at least one glaring error and some pages have six, seven, eight and more mistakes; mistranslations, incorrect transliterations and most dangerous of all, information which is absolutely incorrect. I have this book and I seethe each time I open it. This is nothing less than another death blow to a rich language and a beautiful culture which has suffered enough from without and has now also been attacked from within.

BL goes to the well again with book four.This time, Harry Keogh has lost his ability to use the Mobius continuum. Faethor Ferenczy's other son, Janos has arisen to give Harry grief. It's the same Wamphyri story all over again. It even reads as though Lumley is tired of the formula.With so much going for the series, its difficult to understand why BL doesn't break new ground with Keogh and the E-Branch. There are so many directions he could go that have nothing to do with vampires. With everything Ferenczy, the series has become too incestuous to continue reading.Can't recommend this one. This is the low point in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"HE'S DONE IT AGAIN!","review":"Brian Lumley NEVER disapoints. Without fail another winner.

Hum....come to think of it, I've read this somewhere else before? Oh yeah, it's the exact same premise as H.P. Lovecraft's \\"The Case Of Charles Dexter Ward\\" from 1941. If Lovecraft was still around he might even hire a copyright lawyer for this one. I strongly recommend anyone who has read this book to seek out Lovecraft's story; I even \\"more\\" strongly recommend reading Lovecraft first.Anyway, despite the fact Lumley converted Lovecraft's tale into one of his \\"Necroscope\\" novels, I'll forgive him for the unoriginal idea, because this maybe one of the best books of the series. The read is easy and very fast paced. Character development as always is excellent. There is \\"plenty o' mean & evil\\" throughout.Definitely read the Lovecraft story though...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark,Savage,Beastily Brutal,To Die For","review":"This book #4 of Necroscope is by far one of the best in the series of necroscope novels.

This book was a fast read for me (someone who's not an avid reader).I blew through this novel. It was gluded to my hand. Anybody who likes thrill rides and horror movies is going to love this book.

This was their first album, I believe (and best). No one sounds like them and no one ever will. Great thrash with a Christian message (even though I don't care about that) and a great roughly-melodic sound. I love the title track, Unity, Shadow of Death (the best). All songs are great though.Check out Sanity Obscure, their second album, which was more creative and diverse, but perhaps less melodic overall, and not as technical (if thrash can be considered technical.Great buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thrash at its Best","review":"This album is one of the best thrash metal albums I have ever heard amongst both Christian and secular artists. It is a five star album in this genre, not of albums in general. The crunching guitars and quick timing changes are on a standard that few other bands ever acheive, let alone on a rookie release. They're talent only gets better in their next two releases, but they also lose some of the raw crunch of Extraction from Mortality.

I don't believe in book-burning, but if I did, I'd start with this one just so no one else has to suffer through it. Boring; doesn't deliver what the synopsis promises. It's NOT a murder mystery in the literal sense. There's a reason why some authors are never heard from again. I can't believe this one got this tripe published in the first place.

It only teaches a couple of moves. Each move is taught in English then is repeated almost word for word in Spanish. After you watch them teach a simple move over & over in one language you do not want to watch the moves repeated over & over in other language. It soon got very boring. I do not think much of the skill of the teachers either. There are better Salsa instructional videos being sold on Amazon.

I paid [money] at [my local home-improvement store], but I have never used it at job site because of too many mistakes. I thought after many years they had changed a lot in technology.

Then the Misfits cover of Last Caress recorded for the Misfits tribute album is on here witch is excellent. and for the most part the whole first disc is really good. the second disc is a different story there all songs of them just f*cking up,the average song is like 45 seconds. i think there funny but they could of done with it hence the 4 star rating. but overall this is worth the 17 dollars."},{"rating":"2","title":"It totally makes sense to me","review":"Alot of people have critized Nofx for putting out an album of B-sides/compilation/2 cool ep's.

Keep rock'n it old dudes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheap bunch of quality NOFX outtakes","review":"Despite a few annoying songs that you will always be skipping past, the majority of the songs on the 1-CD priced 2-CD set are great. The highlights of this album include the only unreleased song, Pimps and Hookers, a cover called Electricity, and the great 2000 single Pods and Gods, as well as the Surfer EP, which is about as long as the first part of The Decline.

If you own one one the more recent books about the Me262 there is a chance that you develop a strong deja-vu feeling looking through this one. On the other hand, if you already own several of the classics about the Me262, you get the same feeling reading one of those 300+ pages blockbuster about this plane as well.My advise: there are worse things you can buy about second world war aviation than the Schiffer Military History series, and having a complete set of schiffer books is quite a collection to have. Compared to the brand-new reference bibles about the Me262 it is quite affordable too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"Well I was excited by the cover of this book, I like books about ships and sailing but when I read this book I was very disappointed.

Like many fantasy writers he paints fantastic scenery and invokes images both powerfully sublime and frightfully horrible. Yet the characters are flat, the dialogue is tedious, the story is slow, and there is no real cohesion to the mythic structure of the story. What Zelazny turns out is a generic fantasy story that never reaches deep enough into the human heart to resonate with those who don't exclusively enjoy fantasy. He also uses a strange sort of 1970's style detective lingo when writing dialogue which seems completely out of place in this story. Also, as is unfortunately common in fantasy, some disturbing misogynistic undertones churn throughout this story.

It has reasonably sized extensions at the bottom to set your foot on and a comfortable hand grip. The pump action is smooth. It took me about 15 pumps to inflate a mountain bike tire from 40 to 70 pounds, which seems reasonable to me. The top mounted air gauge is fairly easy to read and has a moveable marker to show your target inflation level. Construction seems solid. I use it on \\"regular\\" (bike or auto tire) style valves.

I did not even use it all that much. It looks impressive but the quality is actually very poor. You have to pump like crazy to build up enough air pressure to pump something up and the valve is 100% plastic and wears out with a small amount of usage. If you plan to buy a new pump every year this is the one to buy. If you want one that will last - keep looking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Description of product is a lie","review":"Worst purchase ever...don't believe the description of the pump having a presta/schrader head. I got this product in the mail and tried to find the presta head and found that there was just an adapter for presta/schrader valves hidden in the handle. For the life of me I could not get the adapter and the pump to attach with a tight seal on my presta valve tire. It is made out of cheap plastic and probably will never work with a presta valve."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Bycle Pump","review":"I have bikes with both presta valve and schrader valves.

The tire pressure gage is not accurate (I received 3 of these pumps - and sent them all back), off by as much as 20 psi. The pump sent was rated at 120 psi, not 160. It did not have a dual head as shown and described online.In short, it is about the same as the $7 pumps one can get in a local store, not very good"},{"rating":"1","title":"very very cheap","review":"this is no gold mine. sure it costs very little.. but its mostly junk.if you're filling up a child's bike tire to 40-60 psi a few times a year, fine, i guess it'll work.anything over 80 psi is nearly impossible as the handle begins to bend significantly..hose is short.guage is inaccurate.seriously, only buy this if you're perfectly fine with a VERY low quality pump."},{"rating":"2","title":"Practical and Affordable","review":"Very simple design that fits many bikes.

It then went back to the angle the arms were opened to. Not being able to get the unit to do anything but read the angles by the arms, I decided to send it back for a refund.

Yeah it is accurate, but do I need to know a right angle is not an exact 90*? Maybe it is 89.4*. And if it is, you cannot set your typical miter saw to cut that minus .4* accurately enough anyway. So your cut will not be exactly the same as the angle the Bosch Miter Finder displays on the screen. Finding the angles or stairway spindles and handrails can be done just as easy with an inexpensive angle finder or a scrap piece of wood, pencil and level. Don't get me wrong, it's a beautiful tool. But if I would have kept it, it would have sat in my tool box most of the time. If you do enough trim work, you'll rely more on your site and experience rather than a tool that gives you the exact angle of a cut to the fraction or decimal which cannot be achieved on most saws."},{"rating":"2","title":"Use of digital angle finder for crown moulding","review":"For years I've been wanting to install crown moulding but was afraid to attept it due to unusual angles throughout my house.

Yes, this is the story of Smithy's \\"quest\\" across America on his bicycle; but it is equally his sister Bethany's sad and haunting story as well.

I seldom leave a book once I start it, even if I don't like it that much, but this was just impossible. After a painful 158 pages, I just decided that Mr McLarty was not doing it for me. Maybe the fact that the new Wally Lamb was waiting on my bedside table helped me in making my decision ....

There wasn't a sentence longer than 5 words.Second, the storyline of Smithy and Norma is so contrived, manipulated, and predictable that I knew how this book was going to end the moment we met Norma.

This is from a reader who plows through two to four in one week. In itself, Memory of Running would have been a terrific read---loved Smithy!---but, to my delight, I was able to take a long overdue stroll down Memory Lane through this gem. In the sixties I lived in Riverside--which is a small section of Smithy's East Providence. Boy, could I relate!!! As a matter of fact, I grew up on the \\"plat\\", a stone's throw from the A&W Root Beer stand, where Smithy longs to flee the night of his prom. I, too, was constantly in Asquino's--Ron, did you know it's no longer there??? What a landmark that was. Love to know if the author grew up in East Providence---must have--everything was right on.

And, now that PCOS is being researched and treated with more respect, our knowledge base on the subject is changing almost daily. The information contained in this book will soon be out of date.

While this book may be a good introduction for someone who has just been diagnosed, I felt that it was not useful for me personally. It basically tells you to lose weight, reduce stress, exercise, as well as try new-agey things like acupuncture, aromatherapy, herbal remedies, etc. I was hoping for a more traditional medical take on PCOS, which I felt was lacking. I have most of the symptoms of PCOS including obesity, acne, loss of hair, excess \\"male pattern\\" hair growth, high insulin, no periods, infertility, and mood swings. Taking some St. John's Wort, eating organic foods, drinking filtered water, and smelling a pretty candle (all things the author suggests) isn't going to address the severity of my problem. If your PCOS isn't severe, and if you are into homeopathic remedies, this book might be helpful to you. It was not helpful to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a good source for infertility information","review":"If you are looking for information on medical treatments and want to go beyond \\"the pill\\" this is not the book for you.

Its emphasis on diet, herbal, lifestyle, homeopathic and vitamin therapy sadly ignores the endocrine issues underlying PCOS. To really understand PCOS and treatment options, buy Dr. Sam Thatcher's book, \\"PCOS, The Hidden Epidemic.\\" It is equally compassionate and enormously superior in the quality of information on the causes and treatment options for PCOS.

Capt. Coconut is kinda neat, flamenco, psychedelic Hendrix. However the rest is marred by Alan Douglas's poor decision to re-record the backing musicians.

This is just a bad attempt to get that last dollar from you. He does'nt know what we as Hendrix fans want, he just wants to pad he pockets. These are just ruff drafts that he had someone eles try to give it some flavor-you can't even try to conceive of what Hendrix really had in mind. Randy who? What people who'nt do for money.

It's a grotesque release only surpassed by Midnight Lightning in lack of musical integrity. I hope all fans of this garbage wake up one day and find Hendrix's real music, and realize why no fan of Hendrix's art rates this piece of turd as worth anything more than the trash can. Go and search out the original pre-Douglasized tracks, they are all a bit longer, a bit unstructured, but have got something this sterile release completely lacks - soul and feeling.

Where do I start? Well I was at a point in my life where I thought that nothing would ever go right. I only bought the books because I love to read and I currently didn't have any new books. When I first opened the books and found out they were about GOD I wanted to not read them at all. Being that I hate to waste money I gave them a shot. By the end of the first book I couldn't wait to get to the next one. It took me 3 days to read all four books and today I have a new outlook at life. By reading these books I have found that no matter what the struggle GOD can solve all pains. This author is a true inspiration and I hope that you will enjoy her books as much as I have.

She reminds me of the shallow, self-serving, sheltered, suburban women in the church I grew up in. It is so obvious that she has used the tragedy of her husband's death to gain fame for herself. It took everything in me to finish the remaining chapters after the plane crash when she is describing all of her public appearances and using Christianity as an excuse to put herself in the spotlight. Lisa Beamer was just an average person who happened to lose her husband in a very sad, but extraordinary way. Like some of the other people who have mentioned this, I too would like to know why Todd Beamer's face is not on the cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY!","review":"Self-serving and poorly written trash.

I have found the stories of quiet courage displayed by many of the survivors, family of victims, and others suffering loss on 9/11 more inspirational than this book. It is simply not that remarkable in terms of inspiration or literary worth. I have read stories in the newspapers that affected me more. There is a grieving widow who is paying for surgery for children. There is another who is raising money for teens. Neither one has their photo plastered on the front of a book cover. I got the very uneasy feeling from the book that the author wrote it to prolong her fame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Light and Trite","review":"Young JFK Junior saluting his dad's funeral procession - touching. A photo of a young sailor standing in awe as the Arizona explodes - unforgettable. Let's Roll - clich��d and trite. Lisa Beamer qualifies as a bereaved widow and little else. The predictable narrative is devoid of insight and full of stock phrases. The incessant Christian theme is beat into the reader to the point of exhaustion. While others quietly mourn their loss, the nation is force-fed the new national brand of grief - Lisa Beamer. Pass the private label."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lisa Beamer is Couragious","review":"I thought this book showed how it was to live with the pain of losing someone u loved so much!!

Whether or not the passengers of Flight 93 brought the plane down themselves, their bravery and legacy will not be diminished. However, the government is not releasing the cockpit voice recording. Also the Pentagon will not confirm nor deny that Flight 93 was shot down. Eyewitness accounts in PA state tht the plane fell to the ground in several pieces and in flames. You be the judge. Until this is proven true, I cannot accept it as truth."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is one brave woman","review":"I don't know how anyone could write some of the things I have read here. I just read a few chapters of this book at work- I work in a library. I can't believe the courage and strength this woman has. She probably knew that in this hate-filled world there would be people that would insult and make fun of her, but she told her husband's story anyway. She is not whining or begging for your sympathy, she just tells the story in a clear, straightforward style that one has to admire. I hope she makes as much money as she can- she deserves it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is she really this shallow?","review":"Is Lisa Beamer really as shallow and sermonizing as this book portrays? Since I don't know her personally, I can't answer that question, but if you'd like to think of her as an appropriate icon of 9-11 grief, you should probably avoid this book. Full of predictable clich��s and \`trust-in-Jesus' slogans, \\"Let's Roll\\" fits into the junk-food category of \\"literature\\": a lot of empty calories with little depth or insight. Unless you're satisfied by a plateful of platitudes - and can stomach a lot of force-fed evangelizing-- look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT my bible thumping cup of tea...","review":"This book was not at all what it was marketed as, nor was it what I expected. In my opinion, the frequent references to God, numerous bible passages, and the author's clear assumption that GOD is the only way to achieve hope distracted from what would otherwise be a heart breaking story of hope, leaving the reader to take what they may from her experiences and her husband's legacy . As a reader who admires Mrs. Beamer I was anxious to read this book, but quickly found its religious overtones to be alienating and at times, even preachy.Hers is a truly remarkable story and I admire her strength and composure in telling it and I am grateful that her faith has seen her and her family through the unimaginable.I had hoped that the \\"moral\\" of the book would be more along the lines of accept the path ahead of you rather than accept GOD and only GOD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh great. Let's capitalize on our tragedy, shall we?","review":"This book is one more example of the shameless commercialization of grief that became popular in this country after 9/11. In another generation, Lisa Beamer would have borne her grief with some dignity. Now she feels the need to shove her whole relationship and life down our throats and by the way, give us some gratuitous Christian testimony on the side. \\"Let's roll\\" is an overused, overhyped phrase. The fact that this woman goes on speaking tours to exhibit her grief makes me sick. Making a bestseller out of tragedy just shows that even a horrible event like 9/11 in this day and age can turn into a big bankroll for somebody. Gone are the days when people bore up under grief and soldiered on...now we have to make everything public. Here's an idea: take the money you would have spent on this book and donate it to a charity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't Put It Down","review":"One of the best-written books I've read in a long time. Fascinating stories and great insights into Lisa and Todd's lives and the events surrounding 9-11. When you put yourself in her shoes you can see how you can really make a difference with your life. I can see why this book is a bestseller."},{"rating":"1","title":"roll over","review":"Anytime tragedy surrounds a country, any written material that delves on that tragedy is always touching. \\"Let's Roll\\" gives us a peek into what may have happened during Flight 93. But after all that is said and done, what truly happened on that flight remains a speculation. True, this book gives us a glimpse of the person Todd Beamer was (and his life with Lisa), but in the end, the book does not offer much other than what was already reported by the media. The whole book could have easily been condensed into a 5-page magazine article. How much could you write about an incident that lasted 10 minutes? And though others may gush over this book, I suppose the timing of its release (a few days before the first anniversary of Sept. 11) contributed more to people's emotion than did the actual text."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring Literature at Its Best!","review":"God bless you, Lisa! Thank you so much for sharing your inspirational story with us. The book was so intriguing and well written that I could not put it down. Many times it brought tears to my eyes and a lump in my throat. If anyone cares to learn more about a real hero - as well as a widow of exemplary faith - this book is MUST reading. How appropriate now as we approach the anniversary of the September 11 tragedy. Thanks to Lisa I can view it with a different perspective."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much of a religious tract","review":"Undoubtedly, Todd Beamer deserves all of the accolades for being such a hero on the 9-11 flight that was forced down in Pennsylvania. And, our hearts go out to Lisa Beamer and his family who did nothing to deserve such a horror at the hands of the terroists.That said, this book is a disppointment. The coverage of the horrible events themselves and the follow up activites of Ms. Beamer are quite informative and make for good reading. However, the first 160 pages, or so, going over the lives and experiences of the Beamers prior to 9-11 are kind of like filler so the book will have enough pages. But, the alienating thing for me was Ms. Beamer's turning the book into too much of a Christian tract. I wouldhave enjoyed the book more if she had refrained from so much \\"witnessing\\" and stayed with the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look at me, I'm media girl","review":"I can't get enough of the lights camera and action.

No serious thought, no interesting insights. A McBook for those who like their simplistic platitudes laced with ham-handed Christian proselytization.If Lisa Beamer is not a Bible-thumper without an original thought in her head, she sure did a great impersonation of one.About the only good thing I can say about \\"Let's Roll\\" is that it's as short as its title.Unfortunately, it's about as thoughtful as the title too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book I've ever read. Period.","review":"This was an absolutely fantastic book. It shows the true courage of Lisa Beamer, but not only that, it also shows truly what an amazing woman she is, and what wonders God has woven in her life. She has faith like few people I know, and if everyone in America were like her, we would have no issues. I am still amazed at what God can do in anybody's lifetime. It also shows that no matter how hard you try, you can never be sure of anything much, or even anything at all, without Jesus in the picture.Well written, and hilarious at some moments, definitely worth the Prime membership, or the 8 bucks. Anything else you'd like to know look for in other reviews. I think I've written all I need to. Somehow, get this book.Once again, thank you for choosing to read this review, and I hope you weren't wasting time. Eleven out of Ten star book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Heartwarming","review":"For those of you looking for a commentary on political events, this book is not for you. For those of you who want to be upset because she is \\"capitalizing\\" on tragedy, please note that all profits go to a non-profit organization (the Todd Beamer Foundation)... I would be as disturbed as anyone else if this money was going right to her.This book is NOT (and is not meant to be)an intellectual exercise. (This is why I did not give the book all 5 stars) HOWEVER, you can make it a spiritual experience if you wish to, and the book really moved me. It made me think about my own relationship with God and the choices I have made, and the way I have been going about things, and the way I have been looking at things. This book has helped to give me me faith in life, and in God, and in His plan for me. Thanks, Lisa, for writing such an inspiring book. I enjoyed reading about your faith, your family, and your hope.

He could have made a run for the head while other people wrestled with the terrorists! It doesn't really matter, does it? The proceeds from this book (and Lisa's public appearances and media interviews, etc.) will all go to help her children go to college, right?BONUS: It's been revealed recently that it was the terrorists who CHOSE to crash the plane into that field because the passengers were pestering them. Nobody actually overpowered the terrorists or took control of the airplane. Not even for a moment. Todd could have been cowering in a corner for all we know. So much for this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring!!","review":"I didn't know much about Todd & Lisa Beamer before I read this book. It was recommended to me by a friend, who said that Lisa's faith was \\"inspiring\\". Based on that, I bought this book, and I feel so fortunate to have had a chance to look into the lives of these wonderful people.The thing I love the most about the book, is that Lisa doesn't pretend that Todd was perfect in life, however she tells so eloquently how he tried to correct his wrongs, and how her family overcame obstacles such as the death of her beloved father, and Todd's excruciating work schedule.The book WAS inspiring, and their faith leaves me wanting to become more faithful myself. What a wonderful, beautiful read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Shame on you who question Lisa's motives!","review":"Anyone who sees this book as a vehicle for Lisa to hoist herself up on a pedestal misses the point of the book. She makes it perfectly clear from whom all her strength is given. God is given the credit for preparing her and sustaining her through this tragedy. She is candid with her weaknesses and clings to Him for her strength. She also makes a point to name every passenger who was on that plane; and she gives other key people credit for their part in the fight against the hijackers. I admire her for choosing hope instead of hopelessness, victory instead of defeat, love instead of hate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Let's Roll a Must Read!","review":"Lisa Beamer has emerged as yet another hero of September 11. She gives details of her husband's last flight and his life. Though she doesn't get caught up in the \\"woe is me\\" attitude (which she forgiveably could), she allows us to see a much bigger picture than even September 11. She has astonished me with the way she has conducted herself on various interviews and the book is no exception. Probably the part of the book that stands out the most is when she was 8 months pregnant and decided to tackle the yard work which was in neglect since Todd's death. God helped her in a real way that day when she was feeling overwhelmed. It's interesting reading from an exceptional woman. God bless you Lisa and your family.

The intent of the movie is not to persuade people to become Christians, but rather the intent of the movie is to report about the events that took place in the land of Israel at the time of Jesus' ministry up to his death and resurrection. It had an accurate portrayal of the attitudes of how the unbelieving world looks at Jesus. The image of Christ Jesus nude on the cross was very vague and to me didn't show explicit nudity.On the contrary it showed the side for the Nazarene and why people were willing to believe in Him as \\"Messiah.\\" It made you feel like you were in an actual News Room. Although the movie was alittle too lengthy it still held my interest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inappropriate and Disrespectful","review":"I did not approve of this DVD at all.

The silicone ring seems like a good idea, but it is not rigid enough to keep the grinds out, whether coarse, fine, or as the mfr suggests, medium. The first few and last few sips will have you spitting grinds.The design is flawed, don't buy this one. Look for something with a metal spring type gasket."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brews the BEST coffee!","review":"This cup doesn't lie when it states \\"Give up bad coffee for good\\"!

I purchased one in Target and plan to order several more for myself and friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Recommended","review":"As stated in other posts the thin silicone \\"gasket\\" (doesn't seal and therefore not an actual gasket) lets grounds past even when the plunger is depressed slowly. Clearly they didn't test this product before releasing it to market. I have two other French presses from Bodum and absolutely love them. I was excited to use this to make a cup or two at a time at work but I'm returning this mostly useless product in favor of an actual French press."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great concept, bad execution","review":"I was very excited to get this at the price, but as the saying goes, you get what you pay for. The concept of this was perfect for the office since I prefer French pressed coffee. However, the problem with this device is that the rubber ring does not make contact with the glass at the top. This causes grounds to be left in your coffee. Not sure why they made the glass slightly larger at the top. I wouldn't buy it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Plastic & Tapered Inside","review":"Like many other reviewers, I usually ended up with coffee grounds in my mouth.The mug is tapered on the inside, which defies logic. It doesn't help that the plastic on the edge of the filter is very flimsy. Had I kept it, I doubt it would have lasted more than a few months of everyday use.The insulation was nice, and I sometimes used this as a travel mug for coffee made in other presses, so I give it two stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"Don't bother with this one. The tapered sides allow a lot of grounds to get by. Also my mug cracked from the heat (I think) and liquid leaks to the inside from both inside and out. Not worth the money. Lasted only 2 weeks..."},{"rating":"1","title":"really disappointed","review":"I love bodum, but these are awful. I bought four to give as gifts. One was broken right from the start. the other three the filter comes off the plunger because it is next to impossible to pull the plunger back up once it is \\"snapped into place\\". Unscrewing the lid thus unscrews the filter. They're also just cheap.They're all going back and I'll get something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Travel french press","review":"I like the look and feel of the cup, it makes great coffee. I have had a little problem with grounds escaping into my drink when the plunger is near the top (the cup seems a little tapered and the plunger doesn't seal as tight at the top as it does at the lower half) I wish the plunger where a bit longer, there is always 2 swallows of coffee that can't be drank."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Product","review":"Nice useful product... works as indicated.

After a week at home with it, I'll not trust it to field use.Most of the other negative reviews point to the same issues I'm having with my \\"travel press\\". It doesn't filter properly. It allows grounds past the silicon seal. I've tried every technique I can think of and I still get chewy coffee. I'm thinking if the seal was just a bit thicker and stiffer the mug would work. Bodum tried to save a few pennies and failed on the execution. I wrote to Bodum almost a week ago and still no response. Well, at least I've got an OK coffee mug.EDIT 01 September. The week before I originally wrote this review, I wrote to Bodum informing them of the problem and asking for a response and solution. In the three weeks since, I have not heard back so much as an automated \\"thank you for your comments\\". Customer service is everything in my opinion. I'll go elsewhere when I see the Bodum name in future."},{"rating":"1","title":"save your money","review":"even though it was only $5 i wish i had saved my money. it's the worst french press mug i have ever tried to use. i'd give it less than one star if i could."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible and STUCK","review":"We did not even get one good cup of coffee out of this thing!

Not a bad deal can make enough coffee for just me on my way into work. However after I get to work I poor out all the coffee into another mug, clean out the Bo-dumb and then repress the coffee to help get out most of the chunks. This mug leaves chunks of coffee no matter what. I do not use fine grinds, I only use a french press at home. This thing is terrible its such a hassle to use. The rubber around the press just does not catch the grinds.This will go on a camping trip with my boyfriend for a quick fix to make coffee, they wont mind chunky coffee in a pinch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good in theory; less so in practice","review":"I had this mug for a few months before it cracked and the double-lined wall filled with water. Sadly, it is now landfill.The two major weaknesses of this product--hit upon by almost all reviewers--are: 1) the plastic lip on the press lets grounds pass through, leaving bits in your coffee, and 2) it cracks easily. Granted, I tend to be rough on my travel-ware (the gym-home-school-work circuit has really done a number on my SIGG bottle), but this mug died even without any trauma.Both problems would be solved if the mug was double-walled glass, which would both solve the cracking problem (unless you dropped it) and would allow for a metal mesh lip around the press--just like the other, non-travel Bodum products... which work fine.Good idea in theory; less than successful in practice."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like grounds in your coffee","review":"this thing is horrible.

I use it daily and am always able to produce a stellar cup of coffee."},{"rating":"1","title":"Subpar product from bodum","review":"This press is inferior to other bodum french presses. The silicon seal along the plunger is not tight enough to seal against grounds slipping past, regardless of the size of your grind. Also, as other users have observed, mine cracked after a few uses and I've never put it in the dishwasher.I do not suggest buying this product unless you like gritty coffee."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I have owned two of these, the first for about 2 years, the second for about 6 months. The plastic cracks, on my second one after just about 3 months. I'll be looking for another alternative. They have redesigned the plunger part of it so it lets almost no grounds through, and the coffee is good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grounds Separation Inadequate","review":"The sizing and design of the screen edge seal is woefully inadequate. I tried to return but it was outside the window. This system would strain out popcorn (popped) but has no chance of separating grounds from entering your mouth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not digging it.","review":"I got this for loose tea, and I have to say there was really nothing to recommend it. As other reviewers have mentioned, it was cheaply made. The press mechanism didn't go down smoothly, and came apart in pieces on the first use.As for using it for tea, the mechanism traps the tea leaves at the bottom where they remain soaking into the cup. This means that it both continues to steep into the water well after the tea is ready, and that the tea leaves cannot be reused.Clearly I should have read the reviews, and understood the way the product worked better before ordering."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Crappy","review":"While I love french press coffee and am a fan of Bodum products, they always tend to be on the fragile side. The outside plastic on this travel press cracked within the first two weeks of using it. The material is less than what one would call \\"sturdy\\" and the press routinely lets stray grounds through even though I've been following the manufacturer's suggestions and using coarse coffee.Great in theory, much less so in execution."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad for a Bodum, doesn't filter the grounds","review":"Used Bodum's for years and love them, they are usually the best, this is like a cheap knock-off. I broke my glass 12-oz press, this looked like it would be a good replacement, but it's poorly made. Bodum replaced their usual 3-piece screen filter system in this press with a 1-piece plastic-frame filter with a silicone \\"seal\\" around it, coffee grounds slip right past it. It's junk. I would not buy this again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Filter does not work at all","review":"As the happy owner of two other Bodum coffee presses, I expected an effective product. The most important function of a coffee press is to separate the grounds from the drink. This coffee press completely failed in that function.Both on medium grind coffee grounds and loose Chinese tea, the press allowed a significant amount of material to pass.For example, 1 mm thick tea branches floated up past the silicone sides.The basic problem is poor design: despite good quality plastics and metal stem, the silicone border is not rigid enough and not large enough to grip the cylinder wall. I do NOT see any material defects in the cup -- it just works poorly.However, the top lid is quite sturdy and comfortable. Useful as an overpriced hot drink mug for cocoa or milk."},{"rating":"2","title":"No more Barney Miller coffee at work","review":"The coffee club at work is hit or miss, but mostly miss for my tastes. I'm not a coffee expert, but it has to be more than brown water. This let's me make a nice strong cup of coffee. I would give it 5 stars if it had a strainer to keep out the chunks at the very end of the cup. I have made many cups it it's still going strong."},{"rating":"1","title":"a few design flaws","review":"Im an avid loose tea drinker and occasionally will have coffee so I figured this would be perfect as a travelling mug, for the most part it is nice, but its insullating properties seem to be kinda poor, in a 15 minute drive to work my drink becomes cool, ive had other travel mugs that kept my beverage hot for at least an hour. Another thing i dont like is how the plunger doesnt go down all the way, i would have like the plunger to be made in such a manner that it compresses the leaves or grinds to the bottom and not have them just trapped but able to \\"swim\\" freely. the filter is fine, if you push it slowly and evenly it does a good job of not letting anything get by."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok if you enjoy a mouthful of grounds...","review":"I liked the whole idea of being able to make and drink my coffee out of the same thing, but it just doesn't work. The plunger seems really cheap and allowed at least 25% of the grounds to pass through leaving you with (for lack of a better description) \\"chunky\\" coffee. I would not recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Made my mornings!","review":"I had this for a little over a year, until it was tragically left behind at concert in the park. I absolutely loved it and will be buying another to replace the first. Before you do anything you need to know to use the proper grind. I cannot stress this enough. I have yet to find a grocery store that doesn't have one of those big commercial grinders. You just get the whole beans, and put them through the grinder on the coarsest setting (it usually just says \\"Coarse\\"). I like this because it's a bit fresher than pre-ground, and a home grinder just is not as accurate or as even a consistency. Also, doing it this way you can mix flavors, or make your own breakfast blend, etc. I keep a bag of coarse ground coffee at my desk at work, and I can refill it in with the hot water tap on the water cooler. Easier and much better tasting than using the old coffee maker in the break room."},{"rating":"1","title":"Faulty seal","review":"Within 3 months of purchase liquid built up inside the walls of the mug. I had always washed it by hand as suggested by the manufacturer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only if you enjoy grounds in your coffee","review":"This cup uses a good quality fine mesh screen but due to the tapered design of the cup the engineers had to add a silicone rim to the screen. It doesn't work!. Even when using large ground coffee you can watch the grounds slip by as you push down the plunger. I've read the directions and experimented using different techniques but nothing works. I see other press cups that don't use a taper cup and I'll try that one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost perfect press coffee","review":"I enjoy press coffee whenever i can so i bought this press for when i'm on the go and don't want to pay amazingly high prices for coffee when i'm out. While this press is convenient and easy to take apart and wash, the silicone/rubber skirt that is supposed to keep the grounds from coming up doesn't work as well as the metal mesh that is used in larger presses. I tend to get a thin layer of course grounds even if i ever so slowly push the plunger down. I hope to try out more similar products but for now this one will do. It also works well for tea! Just make sure you clean it well after each use or your tea will taste like coffee."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the effort","review":"I travel often and enjoy making my own coffee instead of relying on the coffee and coffee makers supplied in many hotel guest rooms, so I was looking for a plastic press I could easily pack and not worry about breakage.Sadly, this press doesn't live up to the normal Bodum quality. The seal on the plunger doesn't seal well at all, and you end up with a mouthful of grounds in the bottom of your cup. I ended up carrying a small sieve and filters with me to filter out the grounds, which really made it too much trouble to make a cup of coffee in the mornings. Thankfully the lovely agents of the TSA alleviated the problem for me on this last trip as they rearranged all the items I had packed in my suitcase, dislodging the press from its safe, cushioned location and it arrived broken into pieces."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea, until it broke.","review":"I purchased this exactly a year ago and have used it on a few trips. I was on a cross-country trip last week and used the unit for about the tenth time. It broke. As I pushed the plunger down I heard a crack. I now have coffee in between the inner and outer shells of the mug. Sadly, I will throw this away and purchase a better-quality unit for my travels. Nothing is better than having a good cuppa while on the road, and nothing was worse than that crack I heard, making this unit useless.I have two Bodum glass presses at home that I use several times a day; they continue to perform yeoman service."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bodum should be ashamed..","review":"I've used Bodum French press pots for years. When I saw this, I thought it would be the perfect camping alternative to a barely functional stovetop percolator that we use.Wrong! The cup part is excellent, holding liquids hot for a long period without burning your hand. BUT, the filter mechanism is terrible. Even a child would see that the silicon ring that is supposed to keep the grounds below the filter would not work. It is far too soft and pliable to do anything at all. The result - no matter how slow you press or how careful you are, this is 'cowboy coffee' - each sip is an unpleasant mouthful of grounds.I'd return this piece of junk in a heartbeat except that I got it on super-saver shipping and the shipping would eat up the value of the return. So, I ordered a $4 Melitta travel coffee maker that hopefully will fit on top of this nice cup! Maybe between the two of them, I can get one decent product.As a longtime Bodum fan, I'd have to advise you NOT to order this item."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moisturing and tanning lotion","review":"The Dove Energy Glow actually works! It tans while moisturing. Unlike the self-tanning lotion, there's none of the specific chemical tanning smell. It actually smells good like a regular lotion. I've used it for almost 2 weeks now and you can definitely tell a difference--skin's a shade darker. Of course, you won't get as dark as you would with a regular self-tanner but you also don't get that orangy shade and uneven discoloration if you don't apply it evenly. I definitely recommend this lotion for those who wants discrete tan without the skin damaging UV rays."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I tried this because the other reviews were favorable and wanted to try something less \\"smelly\\" than the Jergens product which I had used before.

Pallas continues to evolve its sound while still including all of their trademarks that fans have come to expect. The music is all solid here and the vocals strong. The lyrics once again get a bit preachy in spots, as the band once again covers a myriad of political and world topics, but overall they are well written and convey the band's message.

I have not enjoyed two back to back books so thoroughly nor devoured them so quickly. It is as close to time travel as I have ever encountered in a book and it has even invaded my dreams. Characters continue to be developed and myths shattered. I have always been told Saratoga enticed the French to formalize an alliance but it was in fact Franklin's diplomatic intrigue. Greene sheds the \\"Quaker general\\" description and takes on a personality that is appealing and surprising. Young Lafayette is endearing and Washington reassumes the mythic proportions he held in my youth but now I know why.

Even though it is technically classified as a novel, it is accurately presented history. Mr. Shaara obviously did a lot of research for this book, and presented the historical events accurately, as well as presenting dialogue in such a way that it was totally believable. The main participants in the Revolutionary War were presented not as gods, but as truly great and courageous men and women. He also presented the details of battles, troop movements, condition of troops, and maps of battle locations in such a way that the reader is completely captivated and a vicarious participant in the events.

When she opened the package, the comforter cover was very wrinkled, so she ironed it and placed it over her comforter. It wrinkled badly within minutes. When I tried to return it for this reason, I was told it could not be returned because it had been ironed and was not \\"factory folded\\". The item had only been out of the package for a short time (less than an hour) and had been immediately repackaged as it was quickly clear that there were major problems with wrinkling. Apparently, anyone who orders this item needs to be certain that they are willing to keep it as it is almost impossible to return. So... don't order if you're planning on taking it out of the package before you decide whether to keep it or not! I will not be ordering from this company again."},{"rating":"1","title":"great color, scratchy cotton","review":"I had been looking for twin duvets in this color for a while and was excited to finally find these. The color did not disappoint. And a twin comforter fits quite easily into the opening.The downsides are: (1) it emerges from the dryer very wrinkly, and (2) the cotton is quite rough and scratchy! If I had been able to feel the cotton beforehand I would not have bought this duvet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre","review":"I thought this would be a great deal for the price, but cover was incredibly wrinkled upon washing and had no duvet ties to secure it.

The narrative progresses with the robustness of a full river, the grace of a swallow-tailed kite, and the breathless precision of tight-rope walker. As an English professor I can attest to the accuracy of the descriptions of academic life, but the satirical perspective is by necessity limiting. The eloquence and the beauty of great literature are themes nowhere to be found in this book (which itself is great literature). Also if satire it is (and the humor is indeed rollicking)I wish it expressed more scorn for the penetration of the market into academia. But perhaps the book was written too early for that. I was particularly moved by the evident love, resistant to satire, between the narrator and his wife, Lily. I must also say that the book hits you in the stomach, which, as Kafka would probably agree, is the sign of a good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely funny if you get the inside jokes","review":"Everyone who has spent some time with academics will find this book hilarious. The jokes are 100% on target, and Russo is one of the greatest story tellers alive."},{"rating":"2","title":"RICHARD RUSSO'S STRAIGHT MAN BY JOHN CHUCKMAN","review":"This has to be one of the funniest books ever written.Russo brilliantly sends up the pretensions and foibles of the staff and administration of the English Department at a small Pennsylvania university. It's one of those truly dismal, mediocre places, rarely mentioned in the same breath as America's world-class institutions, but which abound across the country.About the first third of this book is almost non-stop laughter. The pace slows for a while, but picks up again. Near the end Russo gives us one of the funniest scenes ever written. I wouldn't want to reveal any of it to spoil your enjoyment.The book is a departure for Russo, most of whose novels are reworkings of another theme, his childhood relationship with his very unusual father. Russo's effort along these lines reached its highest achievement in the modern masterpiece, \\"Nobody's Fool.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Irreverent look at life in a small college town !","review":"Great characters, especially the protagonist. A fun look at life in academia. Unfortunately, an all to quick read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful.","review":"I came to Straight Man through Amazon by way of Moo and Risk Pool. The latter was disappointing at the time, but maybe I wasn't in the mood. The comparisons with Moo are unfortunate, because both are wonderful books, Moo, I think, being Smiley's best, and in literature one book doesn't necessarily have to \\"win.\\"Having said that, Straight Man is the book I've been waiting for this year. After reading three \\"10's\\" last year (The Shipping News, The Englishman's Boy, A Fine Balance), this year had been disappointing up to now, but Straight Man fixed that. Russo is like Richard Ford with a sense of humour, and Straight Man could have given Independence Day a run for the Pullitzer. Don't misunderstand, I loved it, too.A tangent."},{"rating":"2","title":"A rollicking good read","review":"It's been awhile since I read a book so funny, so poignant, and so hard to put down! Russo skewers academic life, but gives the impression of someone who has truly been there, unlike Jane Smiley's Moo. Smiley is a good caricaturist and an excellent observer, but Russo knows that our institutions of higher learning are full of real people whose foibles need not be exaggerated to be farcical. I recommend this great story to anyone with a sense of humor, and if you've ever taught at the college level, you simply must read this academic satire. It's so much more than a conventional mid-life crisis story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Wonderful and Fun","review":"Each novel I read by this man I say is my favorite. So this one is the most recent and is now my favorite. I love the character development; this book actually had me laughing out loud toward the end. The people developed by Russo are people I'd like to meet. There is always just enough future unknown to keep me reading and really wanting to know what happens next to these folks. The main character, as always, is a likeable guy with complex parent, woman, and friend issues. Fantastic read. Just keep on writing, and I'll just keep on reading!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite Russo novel","review":"I recently read \\"Empire Falls\\" and loved it and then began reading the author's other titles. I have liked each book and would recommend them all with 5 stars but \\"Straight Man\\" is my absolute favorite. At times I would just laugh out loud and other times feel so sad for Hank. My sister and I share books and she agrees this is also her favorite. Am looking forward to his newest book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant fun","review":"Very funny, but still a serious novel. I loved it. It made me order more of his work, so I guess that says it all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny and Heart warming","review":"This is straight up one of the funniest books I've read. The situations in which the main character finds himself might ring false to anyone NOT in academe, but for anyone who has ever taught in a rural Small Liberal Arts College (SLAC), it is wonderful! The character is flawed, as usual, in Richard Russo's books, making him loveable, yet stubborn and frustrating to read about. Yet he is so well meaning that one can't help but love him.I couldn't help but love him. Maybe it's because I recognized him in the characters I see on campus every day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Russo Shines","review":"Mr. Russo continues to rise on my personal list of favorite authors. This is the story of William Henry (Hank) Devereaux, Jr a middle aged acting chairman of a college english department. Hank is having a midlife crisis. He is afraid (or excited) that his wife may be having an affair, his daughters marriage is falling apart, he's lusting after several women, he was stabbed in the nose by an irate co-worker, he may get people fired or be fired by the university and, oh yeah, he can't seem to pee. As always with Russo this is character driven, not plot driven, novel. It is set over a week time period when Hank's world delightfully unravels. Mr. Russo makes me laugh out loud. This is a fine piece of work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funniest Book","review":"Hands down, the funniest book I've ever read. It's touching, frustrating, and poignant. I even related to this character, and I'm a 35 year-old woman.Read it, you won't regret it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A few mild smiles, chuckle at the end. Glad Im not in Acade","review":"Sad that the talented characters in this academic setting do so little with their lives. There are more laughs in any sitcom. The final page gave me my biggest smile. All professors should spend at least ten years in real life. Their sense of humor saves them but amuses me little."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get it.","review":"I must be missing something. I found this story about an ordinary college english teacher to be quite dull. Not funny at all, in fact I found Hank to be one of the most irritating characters of any book I've ever read, I think maybe he was supposed to be that way but why would anyone want to read about it!? Nothing happens in the week or so that this book takes place in his life at least nothing to write an entire novel about. My advice would be to skip it, there are so many other good books out there!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great reviews! Cool cover! What a bore!","review":"Are all Russo's best pals in the book review business? The jacket and a couple of pages reading in the shop made me think I'd found something worthwhile. Funny? A couple of laughs here and there. The characters? All charmless bores. Bah!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This stinks! Another customer thinks this is a waste of time","review":"I think Richard Russo should leave the humor to Woody Allen or David Sedaris. The characters in this book where stiff like cardboard cut-outs. I never felt a thing for any of them. When humor is attempted with a group of stuff shirts it takes finesse and a certain amount of sophisticated humor. Mr. Russo does not have it with this book. I loved all his novels and I do believe he is one of the greatest writers of our time. I wish he would have left this book on his desk or collecting dust on the shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"A stinker by Russo","review":"\\"Straight Man\\" ranks as one of the worst novels I've read. It is a masterpice of prolixity, filled with boring episodes and chapters that do nothing to advance the plot. And nothing is resolved at the end; our miserable hero simply rides off into the sunset. One wonders if Russo had an editor. If he did, the editor ought to seek another line of work."},{"rating":"2","title":"hilarious and touching","review":"This is one of the most enjoyable books I've ever read. My first exposure to the book came when a friend was reading it while on vacation and kept pausing to read me particularly funny parts. Russo captures the quirks of academia and expands them to make them hilarious. At the same time, his characters are human and touching. I was sad to leave this world when I finished the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can this book really be that good?","review":"As a college professor in a small, but certainly not \\"backwater\\", academic institution there is no way that Russo's latest book can be as funny, as cynical, as unbelieveable, and as \\"Marx Brothersesque\\" as the real thing...then again...this is Russo and if book reviews are to have any value what others have said leads me to believe that \\"STRAIGHT MAN\\" may just be the guide to the comic set-up called higher education"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious","review":"Russo is a magnificent story teller and has once again crafted a book that is impossible to put down. The book is written entirely from the point of view of William Henry Devereaux Jr, a middle aged, small town professor. He takes nothing in life seriously and enjoys making the people around him squirm. Hank's sarcastic commentary regarding his dysfunctional family and coworkers coupled with the embarrassing situations he manages to get himself into kept me laughing through the entire book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic novel","review":"This book was so great. Highly recommended if you're from PA, or involved in academics...but I think any reader could enjoy this book. I've been reading Paul Auster these days, and the change from Auster to Russo was very welcome. This book was so easy to read -- very funny, as many have commented -- and yet there was plenty to think about while reading. This book reminded me of a time when I was younger and just got to drink one glass of milk each day (after being a milk lover). I remember just sipping the glass, taking it slowly to enjoy it. Soon after beginning this book, I kept trying to stop myself from reading it too fast, wanting to make it last as long as possible. It was great to the very end, and many thanks to Richard Russo for writing such an excellent book. It was a good friend for the last 2 weeks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Russo's the Man","review":"There is something about Russo's writing that really pulls you into a character. They are so developed that they feel realistic and there is a yearning either to learn more or to be able to meet them. Hank is the character of interest in this fun book. You have a feeling that he is going off the deep end, but at the same time you understand perfectly why he is acting the way he is. His many issues and corners that he puts himself in cause hilarious moments that give you a sorry feeling for this guy just trying to survive. You will wish that you had Hank's ability to let things just slide off without a worry. Russo's writing style fits me well."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a fun novel!!!","review":"This is the first novel I've read by Richard Russo, but it definitely won't be the last. He is an extremely talented writer. The fact that he is also tremendously funny is just an added bonus. This book was just entertaining from beginning to end. The characters were real and endearing. The relationships, both heartbreaking and frustrating. \\"Lucky Hank\\" is a complicated man with a lot of issues to deal with: staffing shake-ups, extramarital-temptations, budget woes, health scares... Not unlike a large percentage of the population. Russo is able to tackled them all beautifully and humorously...Definitely a reader to follow!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Library favorite!","review":"I'm the director of a small public Library and I have recommended this book to many patrons who were looking for a humorous book. They've all come back and told me how much they enjoyed this book, and have now gone back to read the author's earlier works. Seems to me that this is the book of the year"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Marvelous Book","review":"This is one of the most entertaining novels I have read in a long time; several passages had me laughing out loud. It's a wonderful story about a man who tries to keep his sanity in a world of people who take things much too seriously. Be sure to check out Russo's other books as well; they are all great."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you love a good story.....","review":"This is the first book I've read by Richard Russo and I intend to read the others! He's an amazing storyteller in the truest sense. The main character is so offbeat, you actually believe he's real (even after the book is done)! Those in academia will especially enjoy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Straight Man","review":"Not a terrible book, but whoever used the word \\"uproarious\\" in the review I read needs to look up the word in a dictionary."},{"rating":"1","title":"No better the second time.","review":"I HAD to re-read this, to give my favorite author the benefit of the doubt. Alas ...There seems to be an obligatory urge of every author, whose day job is teaching at a university, to relate all those madcap highjinx perpetrated by the wild-and-crazy guys who inhabit acadamia. What comes glaringly across to readers is the recollection that their hopes for a college experience worthy of the name was trampled by the unimaginative, petty hacks who hold forth in the hallowed reaches of higher education. Read Jon Hassler's \\"Rookery Blues\\" for the same depressing jog of your hopefully-buried-forever memories. I didn't care a whit for any character in this book. And this from the man who could bring me to tears with \\"Nobody's Fool\\" and \\"The Risk Pool\\". Richard, I hope you've gotten it out of your system."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is comedy supposed to be this run-of-the-mill?","review":"Bought this novel after recommendation upon recommendation. A part of academe myself (English Department, no less) I was looking forward to this. However, I found the humor safe and predictable; I found the characters a little too surface. I really didn't care about any of them, they were all too humdrum.I did, however, think the very ending was excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetically Unfunny","review":"As he lay dying, a famous old actor is reputed to have said \\"Death is easy ... comedy is hard.\\" With this in mind, I should be kinder to Richard Russo whose new novel, STRAIGHT MAN is pathetically unfunny. The setting for the story is a college campus in Pennsylvania; its main character a smart-ass professor of English who is such a malcontent he belittles everyone he encounters with his juvenile pranks and witless remarks. I'd read that the book was laugh-out-loud funny. It is not. Irritating might be a better description"},{"rating":"1","title":"Straight Man","review":"I like the way Richard Russo writes. However, I got tired of hearing all about the English Department. We read it for our Book Club and no one really enjoyed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun read!","review":"This is probably about the 10th copy of this novel I've purchased. I lend it to friends, and they lend it, and it always ends up disappearing among colleagues. It's a witty academic novel that reminds us that our departments aren't the only dysfunctional ones. I guess that's why nobody can resist passing it on to someone else to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good laugh I've recommended often","review":"I laughed out loud at this book so many times I had to stop reading it on the train! I enjoyed this slightly more than his book 'Nobody's Fool' but both characters were humorous, cantankerous and imaginative. Devereaux's acerbic wit and the trip through his fears and problems was very entertaining. His love of his wife was charming, his fears for his children was realistic and the trepidation at seeing his father were all believable to me.I have both recommended and given this book repeatedly which I believe to be high praise. After reading some of these reviews, I can only guess that the reviewers take life a bit too seriously--lighten up and laugh a little..."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent quick read","review":"I laughed out loud when I read portions of this book. I agree with the critique that the story is reminiscent of John Irving's work. The story line really flows and it is difficult to put down. I read this in a couple sittings and made time out of a busy schedule to finish it. When I say it is a \\"quick\\" read, I don't mean to suggest that the novel is \\"fluff.\\" Its just that I was so caught up with the story from its beginning, that I had to finish it immediately. I look forward to read Russo's other work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow starter that picked up steam.","review":"I think Russo is one of the most talented living writers. This is my third Russo book in the last month and I just purchased two more. Straight Man took me a little while to warm up to, but once I did I couldn't put it down. It's about academics, so it's understandable that the characters are not supposed to be instantly likable and have to grow on you. It's one of the few books that made me laugh out loud...and that's rare."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad, but recycles ground covered by Smiley and Hassler.","review":"This book has generated comparisons with Jane Smiley's \\"Moo.\\" But it reminded me more of Jon Hassler's novels about academic life, \\"Rookery Blues\\" and \\"The Dean's List.\\" While fairly satisfying, Russo's style and tone left me wanting. If you enjoyed \\"Straight Man\\" but want something even more insightful, funny and poignant, try Hassler."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything a good novel ought to be....","review":"In this tale of a bemused mid-life male academic, Russo makes us smile, touches our emotions, and keeps us turning pages. Most of the detail about life, love, and jealousies on a college campus rings true, if a little over the top, helping make this a welcome addition to the academic-satire fiction bookshelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"A goose a day....","review":"William Henry Devereaux, Jr., is the reluctant; some would say undisciplined chairman of a small university's smaller English Department. Hank has taken to talking to his dog (Occam's Razor) about softball. Particularly how the move from his \\"Zen\\" position in left field to first base has left him spiritually damaged. Hank has an incongruous sense of humor, towards most people, including himself. Exhibiting a whimsical attitude in the face of out-and-out raving lunacy no longer shocks his wife but I promise you, it'll scandalize and amuse the reader. Read this book. You'll love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliantly funny","review":"Richard Russo is one of the finest authors alive. The joy of his writing is that it is so beautifully crafted you never get the sense that he's \\"Writing.\\" While \\"Empire Falls\\" and \\"Nobody's Fool\\" may be considered his masterpieces, \\"Straight Man\\" is the funniest book I've ever read. Laugh out loud funny. And like his other books, it is full of richly developed characters that always ring true."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kingsley Amis Meets John Irving","review":"This very funny campus novel is the best I've read in the genre since some of David Lodge's early stuff. And even then, this comes close to matching Lodge. Russo captures his protagonist's voice perfectly: William Devereaux Jr. emerges as an endearing pain-in-the-ass, a wisecracker who always goes too far, but not without charm and humility.The story mostly revolves around Devereaux's mid-life crisis, which comes as the mediocre English department he chairs is under financial crunch. All the themes are there: sins of the father, fidelity in the face of temptation, importance of friendship (and enemies), worrying over the choices one's children make, and the work/home dialectic, to name but a few."},{"rating":"1","title":"You have to be a man to read this...","review":"I'm a 35 year old woman, not at all a feminist, but the women in this book are ALL sexist portrayals. Only Meg and Rachel seem to be real, the rest are bitc*y and/or skanky. He does nothing to shed a positive light onto women, and it has a very good \\"men good, women bad\\" light. Even by having one professor, a man, who is quite a feminist displays this obvious sexist attitude.With that being said, if you are a man or work in the education system, you may get some enjoyment out of it. For me, after 130 pages, I'm calling it a day."},{"rating":"2","title":"cute thoughts about academia","review":"Not a great story but if you know people who work in 'academia' you will get a kick out of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Russo is gold any time he puts pen to paper.","review":"Russo has an amazing take on life, and the command of English to take you on his journey.

My husband and I almost felt this way when we read this book. His experience with kidney stones and my experience on the faculty of a high school English department made us both identify totally with the main character and laugh out loud at the absurdity of his life spiraling downward dizzily and hilariously. The pleasure of the catharsis we both experienced in being able to laugh at ourselves vicariously was complete. I had no idea that English department politics are so ridiculous universally! Well, if you have to get older and face embarrassing health problems and loss of power and status, it's great to be able to laugh at them as these problems are portrayed by a genius of comedy."},{"rating":"1","title":"there's no information about what this is!! :-(","review":"There are three volumes of Israeli original Yiddish casts.

It sat on my shelf until I was bored one day. I read this book and it has changed my way of thinking. It's not an Afro-centric book, but it does challenge the way most Christians in America think. It's a scholarly book, but it's not overwhelming. A point that stood out for me was the fact that Adam was made of the dust, soil, or dirt (whatever your translation) of the ground. Dust, soil, and dirt are all full of color. It can be brown, red, black, etc. but I've never seen it as white. There are no assumptions that everyone in the Bible is black, but it does make valid points that many of the people were people of color. McKissic doesn't just throw it out there and state claims.

This group has about as much their own sound as a dog its own apartment. And \\"sounding\\" like Steely Dan isn't as much a crime as \\"recreating the sound of\\" Steely Dan, which it seems that this group has done to a tee. I disagree with the notion that this music could make an old blues man cry. I do, however, believe that this cd could make Donald Fagen and Walter Becker cry, and then cause them to take litigative action against Larry Carlton for copyright infringement.

To correct the installation would cost me another 3 hours, so I simply returned the item. It may be a good heatsink for a new system building, but not for others. May be not even for a new system building, because everytime you replace the heatsink, you have to uninstall&reinstall the motherboard. I would rather take a ZALMAN 9500A 92mm or ZALMAN CNPS9700 for socket 775."},{"rating":"2","title":"Questions that you will find in a Test","review":"Just, It is a book with a bunch of questions and answers.

I don't think Melzer intended his novel to be a comedy but to me it read like one. I had the feeling that I was reading a spoof of a political thriller. The plot quickly gave way to one chase scene and narrow escape after another with the bad guy always knowing exactly where the good guys would go next.

It's full of mystery and intrigue set in Washington, DC amid the political world. Harris and Viv are very complex yet likeable characters. Yet I constantly found myself rereading in order to follow what was happening. It's full of action and I had trouble keeping track of who threw the punches and where they landed. Maybe that's just me wanting a story that was more subdued. The tension stayed at a fever pitch through the entire 400 plus pages. Stories with that much pressure wear me out.

Zero plot,zero action,zero thrills. It started out with an interesting premise, but after 50 pages it all was downhill from there.

Some of the details are interesting though, such as the description of joint appropriations committee work. These details almost redeem the book. But in the end, this thing drags, and drags. The protagonist does way too many insultingly idiotic things, starting with drafting a 17 year old into his cause. As another reviewer wrote, at least they didn't go romantic. Maybe the abridged audio version works?It's not so bad you'll want your money back, but I'd only read another Brad Meltzer novel if I were stuck in an airport and someone handed it to me. Meltzer's research and sporadically original plot show that he has promise; perhaps a new editor would help?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Meltzer's First Failure","review":"(Beware: plot disclosure). Brad Meltzer is obviously a very smart guy, a former lawyer-turned writer. His books have that \\"insider\\" flare that really grabs the reader, at least in his first books. But now he's managed to commit a cardinal sin of novelists: killing off his narrator. In addition, THE ZERO GAME is little more than one big chase sequence, in and out of Washington. He gives very brief glimpses of Congress, and they're fun, but unfortunately they are not enough to sustain the novel. I'll look forward eagerly to Brad Meltzer's next novel, but sadly, this one just doesn't work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good (Great if you like long, long chase scenes)","review":"I agree with the reader review that says that Meltzer has good story ideas and sloppy execution. This book, though, was very satsifying and has a great twist very early on (once you get there, you'll know). I loved the early twist as well a later twist, but a lot of it in between is filled with chase scenes and 'what is going on' moments. Meltzer likes to rely on funny characters (like in The Millionaires) but chooses many unrealistic scenes where the main characters should be dead (especially if being chased by a killing machine. I liked this book, though, even with its flaws and felt I learned things about the government (even if some of it is pretty hardcore fiction). To those who are sceptical about what really goes on behind the doors in D.C., I think that anything is possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worthy of Meltzer","review":"I have really enjoyed other books by this author but this is beyond stupid!

The worst read I have had in years!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Whatta Waste","review":"I agree with reviewer Estee Beck. Meltzer never once grabsthe reader's attention and it seems like the author hasveered away from his past novels and is now aiming for ayounger generation, therefore, the inane dialouge betweenHarris and Viv. I never once caught on to what the gamewas about, not till the very end, by which time I wasexhausted by the lengthy chase sequences. I found it highlyimplausible how everything falls into place for the victimsof the chase.

The music is uniformly excellent and the lyrics are funny and quirky, even more so to my ear than on his other albums. Overall it sounds like a tight ensemble playing some really jazzy grooves.

She says that she approves of the death penalty after a fair trial yet contradicts herself by saying that we have no right to kill another person despite the severity of their crimes. Greta appears to be at a psychological crossroads. She either doesn't know quite what she believes or she is trying to cater to everyone by being \\"middle of the road\\". She seems lost in the realm of controversy. Issues like current events and the law would have made for better reading, but her ideas on these lean toward the left (as seen on her show), and this would contradict her negative feelings about labels. With more passion, relevant topics and clarity, the book would have really soared."},{"rating":"2","title":"miles","review":"Most anything by Miles Stanford should be read by believers.

They seem to be able to speak for themselves and not jump when the record company says so. The album features hits like If Ya Getting Down, Dont Wanna Let You Go and the two UK number ones We Will Rock You and Keep On Movin. The album also contains loads of extra tracks and live tracks proving that five can sing live. My favourite song on the album is Battlestar and i recommend that everyone should have a listen to that track even if they dont buy the album"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good followup","review":"I only liked one song \\"Serious.\\" The rest of the album is just complete album filler to me. The absence of Max Martin on this album is painfully obvious here. Not that Max should be the main one for them, but he was a major part of their edgy debut from 1998. The other producers and writers for this one created songs that seem unfocused, uneven, and sometimes forgettable songs here. There not a lot of the funk that dominated the debut. And rival groups Backstreet Boys and NSYNC put out better albums than this limp album. While I give Five effort, this album just failed to excite me in 2000 the way that their '98 debut did."},{"rating":"1","title":"five will not rock u","review":"yeah but DESTINYS CHILD CAN ! yeah five stinks i hate them. but destinys child can! well they dont sing rock. i mean their new single jumpin jumpin is da bomb! here are some lyrics. ladies leave your men at home the club is full of bawlers and the pack is full grown. and all you fellas leave your girl with her friends cause its 11:30 and the club is jumpin jumpin yes true you got a girl yes true you got a man but the party aint gonna stop so lets make it hot (hot) last week couldnt find your man he was chillin with his homies........ and so on it is a great song to get ya groove on. plus the video is Phat! if your thinking oh that person is jelous or five does rock, get a life.

This is an art deck for me.When I use it for reading, maybe because of the different images, which reminded me with a exotic feeling I am not familiar with, I feel very strange indeed. The reading often gives a very exotic, distance feeling to me.I like tarot deck with black borders. They give me a focused concentration on the pictures, and I often notice things I havnt notice before during readings. And the atmosphere will be more serious. Osho Zen and Russian Tarot of St Petersburg are all good. This is the main reason I bought this deck.I guess I am not suitable to use this deck. I wish I could have bought the book.

The one I found has no manual, and is just a retailer. I had little trouble adding music or photos, and the sound and picture quality are fine, but it won't play the photos once I get them in there, and, with only one tiny joystick to control all functions, it is very difficult to figure out.

One has only evil in mind, the other love. Arielle's choice will either save her and let her mother's wandering soul find peace, or doom them both.** Though fascinating concepts are presented, altering the familiar paradigm somewhat, there is relatively little plot here.

Jensen uses Latin and German expressions without translation. He makes citations and references without explaining them. I have a bachelors and will have my M.Div within two months, but this book was still tough, tough reading for me.But after much struggle, I think I got most of his points. And I didn't like them. Jensen puts God out there, and to a great extent, unknowable. I think that Augustine had it right when he said that theology was faith seeking understanding. Jensen does not seek to understand God so that we can be closer to him, he puts another barrier between us and God. This is a dry academic discussion about God that is utterly removed from the one who came to Earth to save us all.

The other books by Jerry and Esther Hicks are sequels to this edition and contain elaborative information on the teachings in this book. This book easily presents to the reader a philosophy of the creation of personal experience. Like in the Seth books by Jane Roberts, the non-physical entities repeat to us the message that we are the creators of our own life-experiences, through the constant application of the laws of the universe consciously or by default. A new beginning presents us with a practical guide on the way of creating our life-experiences consciously and deliberately the way we want.

While not as emotional or fiery as \\"Rumours,\\" this remains my favorite FM album because it is so non commercial. As much as I love FM, I've grown tired of \\"Don't Stop\\" and \\"Dreams.\\" Nothing on \\"Tusk\\" sounds so contrived. Lindsey Buckingham does go a little wild, but his \\"Walk a Thin Line\\" is a great ballad. Christine McVie is superb on \\"Over and Over,\\" \\"Never Make Me Cry,\\" and \\"Never Forget.\\" That leaves Stevie Nicks. I've always claimed that she hit her creative peak between 1979 - 1981, and her songs on \\"Tusk\\" are among her best. \\"Storms\\" shows her vunerability while \\"Angel\\" is upbeat and should have been released as a single. But the best is \\"Sara,\\" on which Stevie spends over six minutes anguishing about a love she can never have atop soaring vocals. It is, simply, as classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album so why all the complaining","review":"I'm only sixteen but have come to love Fleetwood Mac. After picking up the self-titled album and rumors and then reading reviews on this album, I thought I was going to get some radically different and unfullfilling album compared to rumours. I actually thought that while this album wasn't as consistent in theme, was much more pleasant to listen to and has gotten much more listening time than rumours. The lyrics are just as good if not better, and All three song writers seemed to have matured a great deal especially Stevie Nicks who is awsome in Sara. If was around back in '79 I would have jumped for joy when this album came out not balked at it like many people did."},{"rating":"2","title":"soft-rock superstars' white album","review":"the strangest ridiculously popular album ever recorded. i went through a major fleetwood mac phase last month (thankfully restricted to the three masterpieces, the self-titled record, rumors and this one). lindsey buckingham's influence is strong here, and not only does it give the band a MUCH needed dose of weirdness and an element of surprise, it also predicts the course of buckingham's rewarding solo career. all in all, i think i like this fleetwood mac album the best--and \\"the ledge\\" is undoubtedly my favorite song--but it's hard to beat the sheer hit-power perfection of rumors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tusk Rocks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"My most favirote Fleetwood Mac album is probably Tusk.

Its not that experimental actually. This is real music. The members of Fleetwood Mac, mainly Christine McVie, Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks, have an immense amount of unfathomable musicianship. The song \\"Beautiful Child\\" is absolutely beautiful. Lindey always plays such a good guitar on the Fleetwood Mac albums. Nothing really compares to his guitar solo on \\"Go Your Own Way\\". Tusk is amazing just like all their albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best Albums of the '70s","review":"Fleetwood Mac was one bright spot in the otherwise bleak musical landscape of the late 1970s. \\"Tusk\\" was one reason why. It may not have the radio hits of \\"Fleetwood Mac\\" and \\"Rumours,\\" but this double-LP is equally packed with great hooks, beautiful pop melodies, strong playing, and Lindsay Buckingham's unique genius. \\"Tusk,\\" in short, is every bit as essential as its two classic predecessors."},{"rating":"2","title":"How Do You Follow Up Rumours?","review":"You don't, obviously. Buckingham steals the show with a highly experimental album for its time. Released as two LPs originally, I was perplexed when it first came out but glad they were taking chances. Reportedly, a lot of these songs were even more powerful live (What Makes You Think You're The One, Not That Funny, etc). They should put the full version of Sara on this now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't buy this until they have a full length Sara.","review":"A great album ruined by the hacked version of the best Fleetwood Mac song ever, Sara.

Boring and indifferent. This music is not rock because it doesn't rock. It is not dance music because it cannot be danced to. Lindsey B. may be a great guitar player but his songs are boring. Christine McVie may be a great vocalist, but her range is limited and she's boring. Stevie can neither sing nor play guitar and her pretensious witchiness is boring. Mick Fleetwood and John McVie keep a rhythm which is consistent, predictable, and boring. This record is also humorless. The charm has worn off. Thank God the '70's are over!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Still good after all these years!","review":"Christine and Stevie set a softness to the album and Lyndsey belts out the beats - great for guys and girls!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD is really good, no matter what they say.","review":"I am a huge Fleetwood Mac fan, with an emphasis on Stevie. Generally, if you read other reviews of Tusk you will find people don't really like it. \\"It strays too much from their roots\\" they say. While this may be sort of almost true, as a Real FM fan, I can say this album maintains their original integrity while at the same time adding a different flare. The only reason this gets a 4 star instead of a 5, is that some of Fleetwood Mac's other stuff is better, such as the White Album, or even Say You Will."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unhappy customer","review":"\\"Sara,\\" the best song on the album, was EDITED!!

This Recording In My Opinion Is Perfect Audio-Wise. The Highs are High, And The Lows are Low.

This was the band left alone to get creative and bold. And they did. A number of outstanding songs are contained on Tusk, including the title track, Angel, Sara, Walk A Thin Line, among others.But the best cuts are Over and Over, Brown Eyes, and Honey Hi. These three gentle moody songs possess some of the most beautiful vocal arrangements I have ever heard. Harmonically haunting and perfectly recorded. Christine McVie's angelic voice blends magically with Buckingham's and Nicks'.If only for these three gems, Tusk is worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"a newly won over fan","review":"This deluxe reissue of this disc has won FM a young new fan. You're listening to some truly inspired musicians, which the liner notes compare to the Beatles White Album with every right.

Each songwriter brings something else to the table which added up to something greater than the sum of its parts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sounds awesome","review":"WAs a little disappointed that the long-rumored 12 minute version of SARA isn't included.

Fleetwood Mac's ambitions eventually collapsed in a heap of on-ice extravaganzas and creative bankruptcy. A good sound quality isn't substitute for a serious lack of memorable songs and melodies. Besides \\"Sara\\" and the densely percussive, experimental title track, there's nothing rewarding here. I once had the chance to buy this album at absolutely low price, and even then I didn't want it. What about all these simple, half-way developed tracks? If any other band had released this album, nobody would have noticed. If I could, I'd give this disc a 1 1/2-star.They would hit ground again with \\"Mirage\\" and all their solo projects."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rhetorical Question","review":"This book is poorly written: it is unbalanced in its coverage of content, it is so skeletal in style that it is hard to read, most of the anecdotal \\"context\\" consists of the usual suspects without any value added.

The cartoon characters in this dvd don't move. What I mean is, every 5 to 10 seconds, the picture frame changes (freeze frame). It's like looking at a comic book with English captions typed at the bottom (since the audio for this DVD is Japanese).This DVD has a second 30 min story. The second story is called \\"Special Counseling.\\" it also is a freeze frame movie with English subtitles. Both movies look like they were made with around a 100 different pictures each. Even some of the pictures are not poorly drawn.I consider these types of movies to be very cheesy. Since there was no prior critiques on this movie, I took a gamble and purchased this DVD for it's cute sexy cover; boy was I taken. At least I purchased the DVD for around $5. Shortly after viewing this DVD, it went into the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Grisham departure","review":"This is the second departure from legal/corporate thrillers I have read from John Grisham. Skipping Christmas I loved. Bleachers on the other hand is a realatively good book, but I expect more than just good from John Grisham."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING","review":"Aside from being boring, this story has been done many times before: athletic hero does semi-well, returns home to be confronted by characters from the past, the coach he hates turns out to have good qualitites after all, yada, yada, yada. Reminded me of Pat Conroy's \\"real-life experience\\" book, but was not nearly as interesting. John, give this up and go back to \\"dance with the one that brung ya\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was he thinking?","review":"I am a BIG Grisham fan, however what was he thinking? This book drones on and on with no real story. I was VERY dissapointed and since it is so short, I suggest everyone read it AT the bookstore if you want to try it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good solid story telling","review":"This isn't about corrupt judges, idealistic lawyers or dumb juries. It's not even about high school football.It's about middle America. It's about the thousands of towns and communities across this nation that are held together by Friday nite football games, Fall BBQs, and deep lasting friendships that transcend high school rivalries, big city careers, moral missteps, and lost glory. It's about how we live and die by the vision of ourselves, our place in the greater scheme of things, even though this vision may seem trivial from the distance of time. For without vision, we indeed perish.I picked up the book and finished it in two hours. It grabbed me from the opening paragraph and never let go till the end. Grisham's use of the language was effective, satisfying, palatable. Reminds me of a robust old vine cabernet I once enjoyed. It's a *very* good book and a great read for the Fall season."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Disappointed...","review":"This is without a doubt the most awful Grisham has ever written. Not only is it sloppy and poorly executed, it is immoral in its treatment of people of objects and an unborn that is merely an inconvenience that cost $300 to dispose of."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grisham at his worst","review":"This is the worst book (Grisham or not) I have ever read. It has no conflict, no plot, no twist, nothing. Save your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"chick lit football?","review":"I am an avid sports fan and I love football, but sorry, I didn't enjoy this book one bit. I kept waiting for the Grisham who writes compelling dramas (The Broker, King Of Torts) to pop out, but realized midway through it wasn't gonna happen. As someone else here summarized - \\"it's chick lit about guys who played high school football\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame!","review":"I can't even believe that this is a Grisham novel. The story was soo lame. Could've been written by an 8th grader. Totally \\"contrived\\", ridiculously stereotypical characters. As mentioned by other reviewers, the story went nowhere. Quick read, thankful that I didn't waste more time on this. Other reviews were quite critical as well, but gave it 3 or 4 stars....don't know why?? This novel is pure fluff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bleachers is a true disappointment","review":"The novel is full of lengthy descriptions without significance. I can simply skip several paragraphs without missing anything. The novel is without any suspense or thrill whatsover, in fact it has no plot at all. Bleachers is only about a reunion of old friends who shared the same past as football players of Messina Spartans. Although reading this novel is simply a waste of time, but this novel is not necessarily what Grisham is about. Had it been not written by the author of great novels such as Time to Kill, The Firm, Pelican Brief and the Chambers, I think Bleachers won't deserve publishing."},{"rating":"1","title":"SKIPPING BLEACHERS","review":"I like football and a good football story--I watch PLAYMAKERS--- but I didn't like this book even a little. It was way too JUNCTION BOYS and soooo cliche. The characters were obvious and predictable carcatures that had no dimension. I didn't even like the charater names. I mean did he search the tool shed to come up with \\"Coach Rake.\\" And \\"Neely\\" is the name of a pill popping prissy girl in VALLEY OF THE DOLLS. There was no drama and this plot never unfolded, it just dragged along from the beginning to the end in straight narrow line. But he's Grisham, so I'll give him another chance...BTW--- Thanx for the tip on AROUND ELVIS it was awesome."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bleachers failed to entertain me..","review":"As much as I love John Grisham, I can honestly say that Bleachers was one of the most boring books that I've struggled through to complete. Rehashing old football games is not my idea of entertaining. Pages and pages of reenactment of some faded out, high school football players was so boring. Mr. Grisham, stick with what you do best. They say, \\"if it works, don't fix it.\\"RL Myers"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Junction Boys Revisited","review":"Come on Grisham! You can write better than this! The plot line is simply this: a bunch of guys sit around reminiscing about their high school football days waiting to attend the funeral of their coach. Then, we go to Coach's funeral. Is that all there is? 'fraid so......."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not his best","review":"Definitely not Grisham's best effort. I kept waiting for the point. I found the story boring; it went on and on with the same tendency to overstate without saying much of anything. I enjoyed Painted House but would recommend passing on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"sadly, not Grisham's best","review":"Though this book was able to hold my interest, it lacked the flair and genius of John Grisham's other works. If you are a fan of his work, as I am, this is one of the only works that may be better picked up at the library for a quick read. Unlike The Testament or A Time to Kill, it won't keep coming back off the shelf to enjoy again and again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Far from original","review":"The old high school football hero returns to his hometown when he finds out his old coach is dying. Bitter over a lost career and a mysterious anger at this dying man, he renews old acquaintances and runs into his old girlfriend who he betrayed. Wasn't this a movie of the week from Hallmark or any after school special? Filled with stereotypical characters and maudlin scenes, (How about the player being escorted to the field from prison? That's a great one!) BLEACHERS is so lacking in originality that it is a s familiar as old slipper and just about as interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"YAWN.......","review":"Having played high school football made this book almost tolerable. The book is just so much pointless repetition that there is really nothing worthwhile to be said about it. I wished I would have read something else as the \\"pay off\\" I kept hoping for never materialized."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Time, Read the Flap","review":"This is basically how I felt about this book. I have enjoyed Grishams many other novels. I did, however, prepare myself that Grisham was attempting an out of character attempt at a sappy reminicient novel. You can read the flap summary and figure out what the outcome of the book will be.I figured out the \\"big secret\\" of the championship game, in the first few chapters. No twists, no suprises as normally is a Grisham trait.I finished the book quite quickly. I think you can safely say that no movie will be made from this novel!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Well written, but poor story-line. We've heard it before -- young kids who hate their too-driven coach, until they realize upon his death that the coach wanted the best for them. This story-line shows no imagination on Grisham's part.To the thought that this book is about a teacher/adult who inspires kids, if that's what's it's intended to be, it falls miserably short."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHEN WILL COURT BE IN SESSION AGAIN?","review":"Frankly Bleachers left flat, tired and uninterested, kind of like watching a high school football game where the opponent is trouncing your team and the only sensation left is the hardness of the bleachers.I wonder what Grisham is up to? Where are the legal dramas that made him a keeper and a best seller? I can only hope that court will be in session again soon and that Grisham will leave these non-legal dramas to other authors more fitted to the genre.Douglas McAllister"},{"rating":"2","title":"Those golden memories.....","review":"Grisham's \\"Bleachers\\" struck a chord with me. I found myself thinking back to the carefree days of high school and my football team. When I finished the book, I immediately ordrered two copies; one for a former teammate and one for my high school football coach. If you played high school sports, especially football, you must read \\"Bleachers\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst novels by a name writer I've read...","review":"Absolutely awful. Trite, boring, plotless, predictable, and sloppy-sentimental."},{"rating":"2","title":"a sportsfan must read","review":"I too have read the other reviews of this book and I was shocked. First of all, how could anything John Grisham composes be boring? Anyone who has ever played sports, or been part of a team will find this book opens a gateway to the past. The book is a short easy read, but provokes memories that are unique to each person. It made me reflect how much coaches and sports teach us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty bad stuff","review":"Boring plot. Not sure where he wanted to go with this one. Some of the material seems stolen from Friday Night Lights.I'm a huge football fan, and I found myself dying to be done with this book.Poor work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Grisham","review":"When I was 18 I enjoyed reading Grisham with all the legal stuff. After that he published 'A Painted House', not a courtroom thriller and I enjoyed that too. He wrote that book so beautifully and he has proved his worth on serious literature.With Bleashers, he sucks. Can he just get rid of all the overly imaginative numbers? Like they got paid millions for playing collage football and millions people coming to the finals, having a friend with thousands of stores in US alone and hundreds of collage offer him place bacause he excels in football. I rather stick to 'A Painted House'"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not His Best Work","review":"I am a women & I like football. I even played women's football in school. However I think the book spent too much time on how the game was played instead of on the characters themself. The worst part of it was the big boom that I was waiting for to explain why he got upset was wasted on me. I was waiting for something more ump then what happened. It just did not do it for me this time.I love John Grishms books but lately....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable and Weak","review":"As I've not read Grisham before, I picked this book up at the library to give him a try. From what I know of him, I sense that this is not him at his best; it is a diversion from his usual thriller/mystery approach.Regardless, this book seemed quite amateur in terms of its plot and outcome. I kept waiting for something 'big' to happen; whatever it was that Neely had to deal with. I kept wondering 'What is the conflict between he and Coach Rake'? I won't give it away, but I was terribly disappointed with what the pages revealed; it wasn't really anything at all. A lot of lead up to a dissapointing climax. I also didn't find the 'emotional' scenes the least bit emotional or riveting.Better luck next time with Grisham. Guess I'll have to try one of his classics."},{"rating":"1","title":"At least it was kinda about football","review":"I suppose alot of men, like me, really wanted to read this book. It's Grisham. It's football. How could it be bad? Well it is. It's actually rather boring. A story simply doesn't work unless the reader feels some kind of emotion for the main character. Whatever that emotion may be. In this case, I simply didn't care what became of Neely Crenshaw. His story never moved me to sympathy and, as he grew more pathetic throughout the book, by the end I was just glad it was over. Short of one chapter in the middle where a group of former players sit around remembering the big championship game, this book is very dry."},{"rating":"1","title":"High school athletes reminiscing... No thank you.","review":"I read this quite a while ago, but I'm using previous notes to create this review. First let me say, this is not the genre I generally read. I don't know why I picked this one up. Or why I finished it.There isn't a plot to speak of. Basically it's several high school jocks drinking in the bleachers and reminiscing about their much-despised football coach. They've all returned for his upcoming death and funeral. Their conversations lead the reader through the past and things are learned about the characters, but to what end? I couldn't connect with these people or find any desire to care about their stories. I found this book dull.Again, this is not the type of book I typically read, so it had little chance to score well with me. To be fair, please check other reviews of people who read within this genre. I've read other John Grisham's that were great. This one, not my cup o' joe."},{"rating":"1","title":"plotless","review":"A disappointment. I kept on reading waiting for a plot that never appeared.

I have read other John Grisham novels and he will always be one of my favorite storytellers. However, this one didn't do much for me. Good thing I'm a big sports fan and love football. If you don't know football, you should kindly put this book down. Wouldn't put this one into a John Grisham Gift Box Set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good concept bad execution","review":"Generall I love Grisham's work.But this book seemed 'rushed' to get it out i guess is the only way to put it.Way too much 'game' fillers, and you could tell the ending by the first 40 pages.The revalation, was not that thrilling, expected but not the way it happened.A football buff would enjoy this book than just the average reader, and they would only enjoy it because of the 'game' fillers."},{"rating":"2","title":"impossibly good","review":"I hate football, still John Grisham penned a book about football that intrigued me from beginning to end.

I was very satisfied with it overall. Despite being a quick read (less than 200 pages ) it has characters that are detailed very well and a great main plot. The only blemish is that it might have been too quick of a read. With it being written so well I really couldn't out it down and finished it in less than 3 days. I would reccomend this book to anyone who has ever played organized football at a high school level or higher. But you don't have to have been involved in sport to enjoy Grisham's great style. I also recently enjoyed two other books, though they were totally different from this one.

The story idea was good. The characters started off interesting but Grisham did not develop them. By the end of the book I did not care about any of them.

I listed while driving on a long road trip, with nothing else to listen to, so I persisted, thinking the story must get to the point. The exploration of a former highschool athlete who doesn't make the big time could have been well done within the length of a real short story.

With a bounch of men visiting their past, it is all a buch of what-ifs. I found it annoying and boring. It wasn't a very happy book either. You thought maybe at the end of the book they would resolve their past problems and get on with their lives. Not very likely. Messina, the all-about football town, is somewhat pathetic. I am pretty sure they would do anything if wootball was outranked by nother sport.I would not recommend this book.

When this book came on shelves, I really was hesitant in purchasing it because it seemed kinda weird for an author who is known for his attorney related books. Well, I read this book and it was as good as the other books he wrote. It's really the kind of book like in his law books that gets the reader right in the drama and action of the plot.

I started to read it in class and I didn't want to put it down. It kept me thinking on what was going to happen. Or what happened. The book has a lot of life's lessons in it. How to deal with issues. Me being an athlete I understood what Neely went through. On how the coach doesn't do things to hurt you but does them to help you. It also says to live life to the fullest and do what you love and you won't have many regrets. That is exactly what coach rake did. He did what he wanted to do. That was coach football.

I read this after having it recommended to me by several coaches who work in my school. Typical. This book is written for those who read a book maybe once a year.

This time, however, he writes about pure football drama somewhat from his own experience as a high school football player(but not an all-american). It is just like Steven King writing human drama as shown in Different Seasons. It does not have so huge-scale plot as some of his voluminous novels such as A TIME TO Kill but the process of uncovering long-kept secret is really thrilling. As you read the scene of Neely Crenshaw's eurogy for Coach Rake you can never contain some tears.Verdict: Not a court drama as expected but heartfelt nice drama.Rating: 87 out of 100Recommended for every sports drama fans.Who will play Neely Crenshaw? My pick is Tom Cruise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what you expect.","review":"I have read every novel written by this Author.

Too bad that the novel faltered and died along with Coach Rake. Grisham had a lot of ways to go where he could have tied up loose ends and even brought in some lessons. Instead, the novel ends in cliche and angst.

Although seemingly a good premise for a story the author couldn't make it work. The characters (and there were a lot of them) were underdeveloped and not particularly believable. The story dragged especially as the players recounted past successes and failures. Grisham's novel was certainly no touchdown for this reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zzzzzzzzzzz","review":"What a bore! The story is about a dying football coach and the deathwatch that ensues. The coach was not a likable character - so the reader really didn't care one way or another if he died. In fact - I was hoping he would hurry up and die so that maybe the story would pick -up. It never picked up. Just alot of boring dialog between a bunch of ex football players. As for the main character, Neely Crenshaw - he was a loser. He never made it as a football star because of an injury in college but The author just seemed to make him a pity party. Poor Neely Crenshaw. Coulda, Woulda, Shoulda. Even his ex girlfriend (whom we were led to believe by the dj that there would be a reunion or something happily ever after) had no use for him. There really wasn't one likable character in this story. There was no plot, no action - really no point. The most ridiculous part of the story was when an ex-football player turned Prisoner was allowed to attend the funeral. Don't waste your time on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow But Pleasantly Realistic","review":"If you enjoy the plot twists and legal thrills that Grisham's books generally bring, this short novel might let you down. There is little adventure and no surprises in Bleachers, a look into a small sleepy Texas town that finds its identity in its football program. Though not Grishamesque, the book is well written and enjoyable to read. The small Texas town and the characters that live there are undeniably real and the image Grisham puts into the minds of the readers through is pen is very vivid. The football fan will enjoy the many pages of play-by-play of a football game communicated through a radio announcer. Not only a novel about football and small town politics, the author explores other themes such as the power of expectations, death, the importance of discipline in life, and the value of relationships."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I wasn't expecting a legal typical Grisham tale, but I thought it would have more substance than I found in this book.The all-american quarterback comes back to the small town along with all the other football players who had all played for the loved and hated coach as he is on his deathbed. Neely Crenshaw was not a lovable character since I really did not think he was well developed.This was a story of the players all reminiscing, but it was supposed to really be a story of self discovery for Crenshaw and show how he was finally able to wrap up that era of his life and move on. But, I felt like this book came up short. It just didn't have any magic or spark.I am a sports fan, not necessarily a football fan and I found the ten or so pages devoted to play-by-play and player commentary on a game to be a complete bore. It did not add anything to the story, in my opinion.Move on and try another football or Grisham book. You can skip this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Grisham Hit","review":"Great, great book! I would recommend it for any Grisham fan. A light read but still another great show of writing by Grisham. I am beginning to love his non legal books just as much as his trademark legal thrillers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"I am a Grisham and football fan but I had a really hard time finishing this one. There was a whole section where a championship football game was replayed for the readers in painful detail, by way of a radio announcer, that made me want to scream. In truth, I skipped most of that part and had no trouble keeping up with the story.What a disappointment! Save your time and energy and skip this one; trust me you won't be missing anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing to it","review":"I borrowed this as an ebook from the San Diego Public Library - I'm glad it was free because it was worth nothing - kept waiting for something to happen - nothing ever did. Maybe football fans would like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved this book . A very different subject for Grisham","review":"If you ever participated in High School Football, you can relate to this story. It's essentially a story of the effect a tough and successful coach had on his players and town. With no great plot or story line, many might find it boring. However I found Grisham's characters and story telling style to be quite engaging. I've enjoyed every one of Grisham's books,and this is no exception. I'm excited to see he is venturing out from his legal plot lines. A great vacation read."},{"rating":"2","title":"bleachers","review":"I have never been disappointed in a John Grisham book. I was a bit leery of this one because I am used to the lawyer type books that Grisham normally writes. Bleachers is nothing like those.Neely Crenshaw returns to his hometown along with the majority of other Spartan football players to await the death of their former coach. They gather on the bleachers reminiscing about their former football triumphs. Each player has a story about Coach Rake. There is a love/hate relationship that all of Rake's players had with him. Each of his \\"boys\\" remembers what a taskmaster Rake was on the practice field and how they hated him for his seeming coldness to them, but each of their lives has been defined by Coach Rake.Bleachers is a quick and satisfying read. It had a lot of football lingo that I didn't understand, but there was no misunderstanding the need for closure and forgiveness that Neely finally receives at the end of Coach Rake's life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bleachers","review":"I was very disapointed with this book. It did not come up to Grisham's standards which are usually 4 & 5 stars. It just did not hold my attention."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was a little disappointed in this book. I have read all of his books but this one I just kept wondering when it was going to get better."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT BOOK","review":"Bleachers is the best book I have read in quite some time. I am the guy who is 21 years old and hasn't really picked up a book since 4th grade. I decided I wanted to start reading to pass dead time and stimulate my brain a little. Looked at some books on the Barnes & Noble website to get a feel for what I would want to read and this was one of them. Found it at Goodwill for a buck! I started this book last night, finished it this morning. I loved it. If you have any football background, it will touch you. If not, you will wish you had. Gonna buy every John Grisham book I come across!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprisingly One-Dimensional","review":"When I picked up Bleachers, I was startled by how short it is--I've come to expect hundreds of densely packed pages from a Grisham novel. Like many of the reviewers, I think the book reads more like the outline of a novel. The characters are simplistic to the point of banality. The \\"mystery\\" at the heart of the story is not mysterious or even suspenseful. It was difficult to care about any of the characters, much less bother to keep them straight (half of them seemed to have been in jail at least once between high school and the present day which I guess makes them \\"colorful\\"). I was disappointed in the book and very glad that I borrowed it and didn't buy it. I'm hoping that the next Grisham book I read contains writing of his usual caliber."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bleachers","review":"Big story, little town. In the small football town of Messina, the most popular person in the town is very sick and is going to die soon. Former All-American and all-star quarterback, Neely Crenshaw, goes back to his hometown of Messina. Him and other former players of Coach Eddie Rake go to the football field and sit in the bleachers at night. They drink and talk about old memories of playing under Coach Rake. Through the days that he is there, he visits the town and some people hardly remember him. This book was a pretty fast read. It held my attention whenever I read it, and before I knew it, I was done it. This book is more of a boy book than it is a girl book. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading about a high schools success through the years, and also wants to hear about a coach that nobody liked playing under but once you graduater from high school, he is always going to stick with you.Austin ZelenakBlock 3"},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid","review":"Solid sports book.

But it's definitely designed for the sports fan.Also recommended:Playing For Pizza: A Novel"},{"rating":"1","title":"Grisham should stick to law....","review":"I love football & the idea of remembering \\"glory days\\" as one ages, so I thought I would enjoy this book. Unfortunately, this story did nothing for me. It was filled with dull dialogue that seemed to go nowhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"At least it's short!","review":"First, read the \\"Editorial Reviews\\" - you'll get the entire story.Reading it, I felt like Grisham didn't actually write it, but gave the outline to an underling. He even must have used a junior editor, because every instance of the word \\"coach\\" was capitalized; drove me crazy, since it appeared about foour times a page. I think the same thing occurred with \\"south\\" (only lowercase}, but I couldn't find it and I certainly wasn't going to re-read the book.Read it if you feel you must; it's not a bad story, just kind of pointless (other than the constant \\"Quitters can't be winners\\" allusion). I would have given it three stars but for the above-mentioned grammatical errors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful for those of us who KNOW A COACH LIKE COACH RAKE!!","review":"This was a great book. I think it should be given to coaches all over who think that they are doing justice to these kids they hold in their hands everyday at practice.I could totally relate to Neely the main character. I loved the plot and completely enjoy when Grisham does something OTHER than gripping court books , none of which I have read. I loved skipping christmas and each of these two books I find myself laughing out loud and reading in under two days.Quick, light read. I recommend to those who don't want a THICK plot that you have to follow real closely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Football Fans and Coaches!","review":"Grisham creates the story of Eddie Rake, a hard nosed, no-nonsense football coach, and the legacy he left behind in the football crazed town of Messina. Narrated from a former All-American, Neely Crenshaw, this novel deals with the impact, both negative and positive, that coaches can have on players. Crenshaw and the other players spent most of their young adult lives simultaneously fearing and adoring their coach. His death brings them together one last time to remember their \\"glory days\\" as Spartans.The novel is full of football flashbacks and high school regrets. I would recommend this book to an individual student who is interested in any athletics not just football. This book could be a great starting point for other Grisham novels and fits nicely into the Living in Fear theme."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bleachers","review":"Bleachers is one of my favorite fiction books. It is a great book that tells about former high-school football games that were plated by the Messina Spartans. This is a book that reminds all of those Messina Spartans how great they really were. After their great coach got fired from his job and got a life taking disease, the players and the fans gave up hope for the team. When all of the players went off when they grew up they always said they would never come back, 15 years since he had played on the field, 15 years since the all-american number 19 had played on the sacred turf, 15 years since all of the great memories. Sitting in the bleachers watching the lights come on, the former players are deciding if they should hate there old coach Eddie Rake that is dieing or if they love him.-Will Strickland"},{"rating":"2","title":"for everyone!!!","review":"Bleachers was one of the best books that I have read in a long time. It had everything from flashbacks to comedy to sadness to a love story. For example, with all the flashbacks all the players that played football at the high school would meet up at the bleachers every night and talk about their memories of when they used to play. If I had to recommend this book to a certain type of reader I would recommend it to everyone. That's how good of a book it was."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK","review":"BLEACHERS By John Grisham was not very good. So short. It talks about 4 days of a man's life. I could write a book just like it. All I would have to do is go to a football game and write down every play. People just go to a book store and read it there it will take 45 min.

In fact the best book out about a high school football team out right now is AROUND ELVIS by Thorne Peters, about the kids over at Elvis High School in Memphis winning big for the King. Grisham's cover of a high school football squad's melancholy reunion where they flashback, recriminate, and lament, is convoluted and dull. The old, \\"We hated the coach but we loved to play for him,\\" tale is corny and clich�� and was worn out by the Green Bay Packers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give me a break!","review":"I am not a fan of Grisham. The only reason I read this book was that it was the monthly selection in my book club. What this book did was confirm my belief that Grisham is an over-rated writer who can't develop a character or a story line if the fate of the world depended upon it. Give me a break.

This one was surprisingly boring, especially from such a well known author. Without playing high school football, or growing up in a small town, it gives some insight, but I found myself uninterested in any of the characters and completely empty and kind of releaved when I finished the book. Hey, at least it was short."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy it!","review":"BLEACHERS is the story of Nelly Crenshaw. Nelly was an All-American Quarterback for his highschool team in the late 80's. He's come back to the small town of Messina because his old coach, Ed Rake, is on his deathbed. Nelly heads to Rake Field where he used to play and is flooded with memories of his football days. He's joined by many of his old teammates who have moved on, for better or for worse, as well as former players who were coached under Rake. Rake had a long career coaching football and he made a huge impact on these men lives, as well as the entire town. The men gather on the bleachers to drink and reminisce about their football days and their current lives as they wait for Coach Rake to pass away. I completely enjoyed this book, although it's very different from the usual John Grisham fare. It's less about slick action and plot and more about the big question: the meaning of life.

It showed how important football is in most small towns, which might have been hard for some people to relate to. I think Grisham could have made the book much more exciting. He really didnt draw you into the situation as much as he should have with a book like this. I did think the end was good because he finally let Neely show some emotion.This would be a good book for someone who really likes football and other sports or someone who can relate to the trials that highschool athletes go through. Otherwise I wouldnt reccomend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed fan","review":"I thought this book was disappointing, at best. Have you ever seen the movie \\"Varsity Blues\\"? This book reminded me of this movie - a rather long and blown out version of it with a slightly different ending. If you don't have a overwhelming love for football, this book is a total bore.

I admit, maybe I am not the target audience for this as a female who grew up in an urban area and went to a high school with no football team. But frankly, I couldn't believe that 30-somethings would still be dwelling on their days playing high school football. I mean, it is really as if nothing happened to these people between the ages of 18 and 32. None of the characters were very interesting, and they were all two-dimensional stereotypes - the \\"good girl\\", the \\"hometown hero\\" etc. etc. I skipped through the rather lengthy section that was a play-by-play of a radio announcer describing a high school football game.

A departure from most books since Grisham's protagonist is never directly part of the dialogue...The story is told in vivid flashbacks of games never-forgotten, memories never out of reach and lessons that are kept for a lifetime through Coach Eddie Rake's players.

To his credit you do want to keep turning the pages for this one, and there are plenty of secrets that this book only unlocks towards the end.The biggest let-down for me was the way that you don't get to feel like you know any of the characters. There are plenty of them running through these pages, but they are all so one-dimensional that it's hard to believe any of their motivations. The book develops a of sentimentality that gets really hard to bear towards the end.It only takes about two hours to read, but honestly now that I've read it I wish I had spent those two hours readings something else- even a Grisham legal thriller would have been more rewarding!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Author's should never read there own novels","review":"Grisham reads the book himself in a monotone, so if you arebuying the audio version of this book, please save your money.Maybe the print version is better?"},{"rating":"2","title":"been there done that","review":"fantastic book..clearly defines many of the great lessonsone learns by being a part of any special team or program...for all those who have played team sports for a toughtaskmaster you will appreciate grishams ability toquantify the lessons we take with us into later lifefrom those experiences..with the exception of a few pagesit is a great book for young adults to read and learn from..i thoroughly recommend it.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not his typical book!","review":"I was expecting a typical John Grisham.

In the time that they are there, they meet in the bleachers at the field that used to play at and tell old stories. This book is an easy read, it's interesting and it's not slow. The Author keeps the story fresh and the plot never dies out. From an athlete prospective the book is even better because the way he tells the story if you have ever played a sport, you can picture every thing and connect to the book and the characters. The way the story is told as a look back on when he played high school football is a interesting way to write."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Bleachers - Review by Mario Baldassarrini","review":"This book is very boring - quite a disappointment in respect of the typical books by John Grisham"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, Disappointing and Uninteresting","review":"This doesn't even qualify as a novella; rather a short story that John Grisham dug out of his spider-web-covered \\"maybe\\" pile and sold to the publisher, who published this book on the sheer strength of the name \\"John Grisham\\" alone.

There have been some quite recent studies of this, but it certainly was not at the forefront when this novel was written. Overall, this is a very depressing read. The author falls into the old \\"war ain't worth it\\" thing, as if duh, we don't know that already, but he is a good story teller and certainly gives us points to ponder here. Some of the author's symbolism is rather difficult to follow, but this is a rather minor problem. All in all, as I said, this is an interesting read. I probably would not actually buy it, but it is well worth checking out from the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"LEAK, LEAK, LEAK","review":"About one year after owning this iron it leaked - lots of water!! After ironing three items the iron started leaking so bad that I had to bring it to the sink. If I tipped it sideways (left or right) it was worse! Also - very difficult to clean the sole plate.

I used to do semi-professional freestyle skateboarding, and I had a synchronized routine set to Marble Station, the lovely, floating, masterpiece of this record.

After being totally satisfied listening to Guilty, Wired, Hi-Fi, or even Wolf (which took me a dozen listens to be able to stand the Cd and now it's a descent filler), this album sounds like a bunch of meaningless(that's putting it politely)songs written by a 12 year old and sung by Hugh.

Thank you Hugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"They hit a sophmore slump","review":"The Roches' second album \\"Nurds\\" is a huge slip from the perfection of their debut \\"The Roches\\" and their return to that same successful Robert Fripp produced formula with \\"Keep on Doing\\". The songs are decent but this doesn't compare with the Fripp produced works.However, \\"One Season\\" is among their finest songs and is the highlight of the album. This song takes the three highly discernable singing voices, establishes them in a pretty harmony, seperates them into a difficult to listen to, purposely out of tune chorus and then brings them back together. \\"My sick mind\\" is also a good song with each sisters' voice establishing their own identity.After all, to listen to the Roches is to be force-fed the completely different voices of Maggy, Terre and Suzzy Roche."},{"rating":"2","title":"the constructed past: a guide to experimental archaeology","review":"This is a very clearly presented book covering any aspect of modern experimental archaeology that one might expect.

Each topic is organized with subtitles in an easy-to-find manner. A great deal of information is given on the history of dreams, which was the reason I decided to buy the book in the first place; I'm currently doing a report on the history of dreams throughout varied cultures, and this is one of the better resources I've been able to find on it. Not only does the author trace the history of dreams, but he also deals with dream theories in the 20th century, early and contemporary research with dreams, dreams of famous people, how dreams vary throughout the life span, lucid and spiritual dreams, nightmares and night terrors...the list goes on. If you're looking for a good resource on dreams instead of a generic dream interpretation book, this is one to check into."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"I am surprized that I am the first person to review this book. It is an excellent book to learn about the dreams. Dreams are no longer meaningless hallucinations for me that happen when I am confused or feel cold at night.

There are some songs on here that don't make any sense at all--for instance, it has \\"Life in Mono\\" by Mono--that song came out ages ago; what is it doing on a 2002 compilation?

The background vocals which accompanied that sound was Patti Austin, Diva Gray, Jocelyn Brown, Tom Bahler and Jim Gilstrap.

With the infamous 1979 Disco Crash, many R&B artists were struggling on the charts but not George Benson. 1980 saw him release GIVE ME THE NIGHT and the title track became a Top 3 Billboard Pop smash. The song is as great today as it ever was and the rest of the album delivers the goods as well. LOVE TIMES LOVE and ON BROADWAY are both great songs(and became hits in their own right)while MIDNIGHT LOVE AFFAIR, LOVE DANCE and TURN OUT THE LAMPLIGHT are all great slices of R&B that are as smooth and sexy today as they were over 30 years ago.

The songs are all so different in mood and tempo that it plays more like a complilation than a stand-alone project. \\"Moody's Mood\\" stands out as my favorite side here. This is the only R&B/Pop flavored LP of Benson's that I own, since I'm more a fan of his jazz offerings, i.e. \\"Good King Bad,\\" \\"White Rabbit,\\" etc. However, this is a treasure that will always be close at hand."},{"rating":"2","title":"You Go George!!!","review":"Two classic Benson hits \\"Love X Love\\" and the unforgetabletitle song anchor this seamless album that also includes abeautifully jazzy cover of \\"Moody's Mood\\" and a stellar versionHeatwave's \\"Star Of A Story\\".Now Benson also contributes thegrooving instrumental \\"Off Broadway\\" that producer Quincy Jonessmooths over with that famous R&B/pop sheen he became famous for during this era.From beginning to end a fabulouslyentertaining album that's grooving,jazzy and funky all thesame time.Worth more then your two cents!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Crawford should have won the Oscar for this one!","review":"A nurse's obsession for a womanizing-heel nearly ruins her life and the lives of those around her. This dark, disturbing drama was the FATAL ATTRACTION of the 1940's, and while Crawford doesn't boil any bunnies, she's no less terrifying. In fact, I would venture to say that this is Crawford's finest hour. Her character is on the screen for most of the film's two hours, and she's believable and effective every moment. As much as I loved her in MILDRED PIERCE, I must say that Crawford should have won the Best Actress Oscar for this one. Crawford said in a later interview:\\"I worked harder on POSSESSED than any film I made\\", and it shows. POSSESSED features the glamorous star's richest, most powerful performance to date. A must, but don't confuse this film with the similarly titled 1931 movie which also stars Joan Crawford."},{"rating":"2","title":"A reminder of how good the silver screen can be","review":"I had to sit and really watch this one, as its quality will tolerate no less. And as I did so, it became a pleasure. A sophisticated story, superb acting, plots and subplots, use of flashback, and believable settings -- all combined to take me along with the characters and keep me focused on the events as they developed. I never knew Joan Crawford or her career before now, but I know when I'm in the presence of brilliant, polished performance, and can easily and enjoyably contrast it with the dumbed down crapola that Hollywood has repeatedly dished out in recent years. See this film as a treat when you're in the mood for real entertainment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Djamileh- a forgotten treasure","review":"This is one of only 2 recordings of this opera. The other - Mercier/Todorovitch/Maurette/Le Roux, is more recent (1999)) but not as good. The piece contains some of Bizets most lyrical music and it is conducted by Gardelli with sensitivity and pace. Popp's creamy soprano gives the title role the warmth required for the opera's only really sympathetic character and Bonisolli tackles the demanding role of Haroun with assurance. LaFont's Splendiano is much better than LeRoux's, which makes too many demands on the latter's baritone. It is really a tenor role. the only pity is that this recording omits much of thte spoken dialogue making the story difficult to follow at times"},{"rating":"2","title":"The price was around $5 ea. close to Spring...","review":"...by Thanksgiving it was around $9 ea.

Colin Davis gives very expansive yet intensely charged reading of the choral version of 1812 overture with Boston SO and Tanglewood Festival Chorus. Recorded in very wide dynamic range, the finale with canon and bells is overwhelmmingly powerful. R&J Overture is equally powerful and deeply moving, with beautiful singing tone in string part and glorious brass. Eugen Onegin Polonaise is superbly played by Orchestra of Covent Garden. My only complaint is, playing time is too short! They should have included Francesca da Rimini or Tempest."},{"rating":"1","title":"No good pockets","review":"I bought this case together with Nikin 5900 digcam. The case looks good and compact.

(Some of Van's long songs work, others not so much)>Here's an interesting footnote about Santa Fe/Beautiful Obsession that I've never seen anyone point out:BOB SEGER was OBVIOUSLY listening to the song and a few years later swiped the \\"Let The Cowboy Ride\\" vocal refrain to graft onto the closing moments of \\"Against The Wind\\".

The band is not his normal band, and comes off sounding like a cold group of session performers, with obligatory this and obligatory that.Many of the songs are padded with nonsense syllable refrains (dum diddy ah diddy ah diddy ah ah... etc).None of these songs make it into greatest hits packages, and I don't recall hearing him do any of them live.

I think this book of gorgeous narrative poems is testimony that often, there is no 'simple answer' or 'person to blame' in a relationship that has failed. It is also testimony to Hughes's undying, colossal love for his former wife, however he may have wrecked it in their youth. It is a beautiful and moving read, particularly if you have read some background material beforehand. All his subtle references take on a much deeper meaning when one knows the details behind them, and the details according to Sylvia. The poetry is lush and shimmers with a sincere, burning love for a troubled woman who left us much too soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterpiece","review":"I have to admit that morbid curiosity drove me to buy this book. I was fascinated with learning more about a man who lost two wives to suicide. And, being an English major in the US, I read A LOT of Plath but was never exposed to Hughes' work. I think there is a prejudice against him, especially by female poets/scholars.But, this quickly became my favorite collection of poetry. Hughes uses Plath's own mythology to eulogize her--her father obsession, her suicide attempts. But he also weaves the familiar into it--her attempt at making rag rugs and at domesticity in general. Any married person can understand his imagery and his heartbreak. Of course, my favorite is Dreamers, when Ted realizes he loves another woman. She seems as exotic to him as his marriage seems dull."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book does not need a review","review":"This book does not need a review.

No doubt about it.I don't understand all of the continued antipathy toward Hughes by the Plath mob. Whatever his faults as a husband, Plath had suffered from depression for many years and had attempted suicide at least once. Regarding his destruction of some of Plath's writing, I would have burned the whole lot of it if it meant protecting my children. He made sure that Ariel was published, and for that, we should be grateful."},{"rating":"1","title":"A hoax...","review":"Yes, there are some great lines - a master like Hughes probably couldn't help himself. But I have to agree with Katha Pollit: the sum of the whole adds up for me as a podium from which to cast self-serving stone after self-serving stone. My most immediate impression is that Hughes has woven the more infamous threads of Plath's poetry with threads of her journals and biographies to create the cloth of a relationship to \\"love\\" and \\"ephiphany\\" that is somewhat akin to the emperor's new clothes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love after death","review":"I have never really believed that love ends after death and this collection of poems proves my point.

There are a few good poems in this volume, but so much of it is just special pleading. Hughes presents himself in a deterministic narrative in which he figures as someone caught in the overpowering \\"Daddy\\" myth. In other words, he is doomed from the beginning. As an excuse for his behavior, this does not convince. And why he did not see that such excuses diminished him and made him the \\"little man\\" Plath rejected is surprising. BIRTHDAY LETTERS does not include a poem that has come to light only recently--a poem in which Hughes acknowledges he was sleeping with another woman in the early morning hours when Plath killed herself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book shows how personal expreriences effect poetry","review":"I cried when I started to read \\"Birthday Letters\\" by Ted Hughes.

Through his painful and traumatic experiences expressed in his powerful and evocative language, great insight into the human mind was revealed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shameful","review":"I have studied the life of Sylvia Plath, the unfortunate ex-wife of Ted Hughes, and I find it shameful that after so many years, and after personally censuring so much of Sylvia's writings, writings that might have shed light upon his contribution to her suicide, that he could profit so on \\"tributes\\" to her work. It was not only his affair with his secretary, who likewise killed herself, but his egocentric dominance over her life and even upon the subject matter of her poetry. When she was \\"free\\" of her marriage, her true genius emerged, albeit along with her final desperate act. I do not criticize his poetry per se, though I always felt he must have felt a bit inferior to his wife, I simply think Sylvia deserves the respect of Ted Hughes silence."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Tribute to a Great Method","review":"I have been a fan of Classical Pilates' work for a couple of years, and feel it is important to communicate the importance of their DVDs. Many years ago I found the Pilates method, yet I did not start studying with a classically trained instructor from the New York School. Then, one fine day, someone suggested going to an instructor who actually studied with Joseph Pilates. I was so impressed that I told all my friends about my new instructor.It made all the difference learning real Pilates, instead of the many knock-off variations that are available. Anyway, my instructor suggested getting Classical Pilates DVDs. It is thrilling to see the amazing movements of the entire Pilates method.

I didn't like the way the DVD was set up for a workout and didn't like the instructions that were given."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Cool DVD","review":"I am an exercise enthusiast who loves cross training: swimming, running, biking, tennis, and skiing. I started Pilates about a year ago and it helped every other activity I enjoy. So I bought about five Pilates DVDs from Amazon. Well, I should have gotten Classical Pilates first!These people show what a good challenge Pilates can be, and the verbal instruction is intensely insightful; it's not just someone telling you what to do. The master instructor describes what you should be feeling and thinking about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware and read the Negative Reviews!","review":"The positive reviews for this DVD prompted me to buy it. I should have read more of the One Star (or negative) reviews. This is definitely more of an educational tape than a work-out tape. The intructors talk a lot, show you the technique, then perform the technique, but do not do many repetitions or sets. I tried it out once and it is now sitting in it's case."},{"rating":"1","title":"very short","review":"very disappointed. I thought it was a complete work out. It is very short. The video just shows a couple of basic positions for each of the levels. Looking again at the title now, it is exactly what the title says \\"Technique\\". I could have read a book for this and saved some money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Things Come In Small Packages","review":"I'm in high school and have read lots of magazines about Pilates. I tried a class at the gym, but I wanted to do some video 'research.' After reading a lot of reviews, I bought this one. This DVD is fairly low budget when it comes to the sets and atmosphere, but it's definitely traditional and I get a really good workout. Since I play basketball and swim on the team, I'm used to many hours of practice. This video is real and the people who made it are real. You can tell the demonstrators are professional athletes. They show Pilates and describe Pilates in a way that you can learn it right from the beginning, and do it right to the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Pilates","review":"The description says it is for all levels, but it's targeted towards the Advanced Pilates participant. The transitions are fast, as is the workout itself. I am a certified Pilates instructor, and Pilates is supposed to be about performing each excerise with prescision and perfection; the speed of the program does not allow for it. Each workout is only 15 minutes, so if you are looking for a program that you can just pop in and do, this program is not for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really a practice dvd...","review":"This isn't really a dvd you can practise along to. It's clearly made by real Pilates enthusiasts who know their stuff, but I don't really understand why they produced a dvd; surely most people buy such items to use for home practice? Yet this one doesn't seem to be designed for that at all. It's more like a demonstration or reminder of the sequences. Consequently, I can't help thinking the information contained in it might be better in book form. I appreciate that do do Pilates properly you need to go to a class as the presenters say, but if they don't believe that one can practice at home through dvd, then I really fail to see why this one was made. There is no real instruction and no time is allowed for the viewer to shift position. I have tried to practise along with it, and it's just about possible but not easy or fun, more like a chore. Disappointing. I might check out that 'For Dummies' dvd that some of the other reviewers were talking about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth owning","review":"Beautifully demonstrated dvd, exercises demonstrated with clear precision and skill by all performers. Any pilates teacher can learn from this dvd and should own it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's The Real Thing","review":"This DVD is the real thing. It's the only video that shows the complete and historically accurate workouts of Joseph Pilates. After being taught Pilates on the West Coast and in England, I was happy to find this DVD because it's made by people who studied and worked where Joseph Pilates had his studio: New York City. Go to the source. After finding this DVD, I started taking lessons from a teacher who taught authentic Pilates because it's more real, it's more difficult, and it's more attractive to watch. The Pilates method is definitely challenging, and I'm glad this no-hype no-frills video helps carry me forward to make progress every day. Other DVDs left my behind flabbly and my abdominals half-way strong. This video helps get me toned and as fit as a fiddle. It compliments my Pilates lessons very well."},{"rating":"1","title":"for pros only","review":"I've been taking Pilates classes for about 6 months and keep looking for a good video... careful, interesting, not overly easy or impossibly difficult. This isn't it. I think it is really designed for people who are at an expert level."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Of The Best Pilates DVDs Out There","review":"I've done most of the popular Pilates DVDs out there. Windsor...too slow and not challenging enough. Stott...challenging and a GREAT workout, but slow and boring. This DVD is definitely meant for those who understand Pilates and how your body is supposed to work with it. It is a fast paced workout, but its very effective if you are doing it correctly. If I need a really quick workout, the Intermediate workout is about 15 minutes long and it is sooooo beneficial. I end up more sweaty at the end of the 15 min then if I went for a 45 min walk. So the DVD is great but you do have to be familiar with the fundamentals of Pilates techniques. I recommend it for any Pilates lover!"},{"rating":"2","title":"best in the market!","review":"I have been doing Pilates since 1983 and have been teaching it since 1989. this video (DVD) and the whole Classical Pilates series is the best out there, by far!!! it shows traditional Pilates, with great demos and very detailed sequences. from basics to super advanced. it is not a follow along video, but a must have to anyone seriously interested in Pilates."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Hand's Down","review":"This isn't a DVD, it's an investment in yourself. You can't bet better than the Classical series, I own all 4 and hear more are coming! Can't wait! Buy it and love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Beginners Who Want to Exercise Along With the DVD","review":"I was really excited about this DVD, because it earned a communication award, and I thought that meant that it would explain each exercise in detail. But it doesn't AT ALL. It seemed more like a DVD for teachers of pilates, rather than students.I don't even think this DVD is designed to use while you are actually doing the exercises. It shows each exercise once or twice, but there is very little instruction, and they use words like \\"powerhouse\\" without explaining what that is, or reminding you what it should feel like. AND they go really fast.I don't recommend this to anyone who is a beginner or who hasn't had one-on-one instruction. I've used other instructional DVDs that have been much more helpful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Damaged DVD - Amazon will not accept return or exchange","review":"We ordered this DVD on the advice of a friend who enjoyed the DVD. Finally, after 3 months, we stopped procrastinating and decided to use the DVD. Upon opening the DVD case and removing the DVD, we noticed a formidable dent on the back of the disc. We were under the impression that the DVD might not even work in a player. Sure enough, our DVD player imeadiately ejected the DVD without even actually starting. We tried to exchange the item, but it was beyond the small return time frame (30 days). Amazon's \\"Customer Service\\" simply gave us the run-around after a approximately 1 hour conversation. We recommend opening and at least testing items ordered from Amazon or other sellers to avoid this hassle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!","review":"I wasn't hoping for anything high intensity or overly cheesy, but this is not for me. When I do my DVD's I even turn the sound off on my laptop while I workout and watch my DVR, but even that can't save this one. I have used it once, and it has sat in my DVD pile since. I guess I didn't get too far into it, but I didn't find any unique moves that made me want to come back to it. I prefer the 10 minute solutions pilates workouts so much more. They are basic too, but enough excitement to at least not put me to sleep during my workout. I went right back to those after this one. So much for mixing up my routine."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Mistake to Buy","review":"I bought this DVD being so excited about continuing my Pilates Path. Dont buy this DVD. The moves are not varied, its boring, and its fast. I am already planning on returing it- and i got it 6 hours ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed. I would have given it 0 stars, but...","review":"the star rater wouldn't let me. I was looking forward to this new DVD and seeing what Pilates was all about. I put the DVD in the player and chose the Basic section just to see what the routines were like. I was TRULY disappointed to find that at least 5 minutes of the section was all this \\"talking\\" (blab, blab, blab). No pilates routines whatsoever. I got so sick of the yapping that I just took the DVD out and put it back in its case. I'll never buy this series again. What a waste of hard-earned money."},{"rating":"1","title":"I have difficulty in playing the DVD!!!","review":"I have ordered this DVD a fey days ago, and I recieved it!However, I couldn't play it until now. I had tried some DVD players which could play VOB DVD files, but in vain.I wonder the way to play it on PC, or whether the DVD disc itself has some error!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Changed My Life","review":"I just wrote a reivew of another Classical Pilates'DVD \\"The Complete Magic Circle Mat Series & Reformer Mat Workout\\" because I have been having a lot of fun with both of these fine instructional videos. The magic circle workouts build upon this DVD in very instructive and enjoyable ways. It's challenging to add the magic circle to each exercise, and I feel the proper muscles working so deeply. I believe these DVDs help keep me on the right track as far as studying the RIGHT KIND OF PILATES. Because, as I understand, Classical Pilates shows how Joseph Pilates originally practiced his method, and how he taught his students. This gives me confidence that I'm doing the right exercises in the right ways. I feel so much better because I do the mat workouts 3-4 times each week. My body has become more slender, and I have much better energy than before I started using these DVDs as home instruction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic","review":"There are so many new pilates plus blends of fitness DVDs available now. I sometimes get caught up in the hunger to get the latest but I always go back to the classics.This is great because it is many levels, though I do feel you should have some experience as a beginner. I am an experienced exerciser and really have to concentrate to make the exercise feel how it is meant to.I do think, if you are serious about pilates you should take a couple live classes to be sure you are doing it right.Then get this one. It is among the best of the pilates DVDs available."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"I bought this DVD and the Shiva Rea yoga Shakti DVD together. This one sucked. If you are looking for a really great workout with almost the same teqnique, buy Shiva Rea yoga Shakti. It has a matrix on the DVD that lets you create your own personlized workout. I saw results from that after two weeks. This Classical pilates DVD is too short, too fast, bad intruction, and boring. I wish I had known. now I'm stuck with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like I've Said Before","review":"Love this series! You get all the exercises from the beginning of the creation of Pilates to the most recent. Love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the inexperienced","review":"I was very excited to order this DVD to further my Pilates Body. I am a bit disappointed. There are little or no instructions on how to do the actual excersize. The whole basis of Pilates Is the the entire positioning of every part of your body including your breathing during each movement. This DVD lacked that. I am fortunate to have taking Pilates before, but for some one just starting out, or has only had a few classes, AVOID THIS DVD. There are some much better DVDs out there for the beginner or even intermediate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much hype","review":"Before I committed to a class, I bought this DVD with the hopes of experiencing true pilates. Unfortunately, the beginner and modified beginner 'routines' were just a few minutes long, with no real workout. The real workout comes with the advanced section, which has no options for the novice. The moves were expertly executed, but there was too much talking. And, the word 'powerhouse' started getting on my nerves."},{"rating":"1","title":"zzzzzzzz","review":"Extremely boring ~ almost sterile ~ basic instructional dvd. I do believe you would get a better workout watching paint dry. But only if you were the one that did the painting."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL video and sound quality","review":"The video quality is bad (kind home-made video) plus I can hardly hear what the instructor says."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low Quality recording","review":"I had to turn my TV up all the way in order to hear this DVD at regular volume, it felt sterile, and was not very informative about the Pilates technique. Over all I felt like I was watching some person's basement recording of Pilates. It may be a good workout, but I'll never know."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the Initiated","review":"This is a great video for someone who has had Pilates lessons. The tempo was fast and the details of the positions/postures are not always well explained. It is a great video to work along with if you had at least a few months of private Pilates instructions, preferably from a Guild certified instructor. I have had 7 months of private Pilates instructions (two times a week) and had trouble following the intermediate exercises (I certainly did not venture into the advanced and superadvanced portions). I use this video only to supplement my private lessons and I found it to be a very helpful reminder of certain postures and certain details of some exercises. I would not recommend this to a person who has never had PRIVATE Pilates instruction."},{"rating":"1","title":"This not good for beginners","review":"I am new to Pilates, and having taken a basic course I thought this would help me to develop the classical Pilates method at home. I was wrong. I bought this DVD in the belief that the modified basic and basic exercises would produce a refresher of how to breathe with the excercises and how to maintain the powerhouse correctly and then develop the technique further. After all, correct breathing and maintaining the powerhouse is supposed to be the basis of good Pilates. But there is no instruction or mention of these including how to count the reps. So anyone who is completely new to Pilates and wants to learn the basics will not be aware of these crucial aspects of Pilates, in turn developing a bad technique and not benefiting from the workout. I would strongly recommend to anyone thinking of buying this DVD that they go to an introduction course first to learn the basics under full instruction."},{"rating":"2","title":"With my whole heart","review":"I have been working out faithfully with Classical Pilates Complete Mat Workout Series since July. As a matter of fact, I prefer it so much that I have not even watched any of my other Pilates tapes from the time when I received this workout series. I recommend this product whole-heartedly. Since I have been doing Pilates for the last two years, my body has become much more flexible and toned and I have so much more energy. My boyfriend tells me that I look better now, at 40, than I did when we met 20 years ago!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Documenting The Real Thing","review":"This DVD is an unapologetic documentary of Joseph Pilates' original mat workout series with superb demonstration of exercises, and expert verbal instruction by Bob Liekens. The workouts move quickly without stopping so that your heart gets pumping and your muscles start working. This is precisely the point: The Pilates method is supposed to be vigorous as you gain familiarity with the exercises. Learning Pilates is sort of like learning a language. You start slowly at first then you pick up the pace then interact with your new 'movement vocabulary.'If you want a slower workout, the \\"modified basic\\" routine on this DVD gives you the basics. I recommend this video without reservation, yet you should always try to take Pilates lessons from a certified instructor, so you can glean the full benefits from the method, from this DVD, or from any other DVD.Classical Pilates has the best example of Pilates done well. This DVD shows the full range of exercise levels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected...disappointed","review":"I ordered this DVD because I read the reviews and I thought it would give me a nice step by step guide to pilates and it would allow me to advance to the intermediate/advanced levels (without having to buy another DVD). Well I played this thing once and I was very disappointed. It's more like a documentary into pilates. The moves were done to fast and I definitely do not recommend this DVD to beginner or anyone interested in doing pilates. The DVD is also 75mins long which made me suspicious because how can a DVD with 4 levels be only 75mins long. Each segment is about 10mins long...nothing challenging and to use this everyday would be to repeat the same boring moves for 5-10mins daily.Waste of time and money...get another DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast and straightforward","review":"The segments are fast, but easy to follow. It feels a bit short (can you really get a workout in 7-12 minutes???) but the exercises are challenging. Overall an enjoyable and straightforward video with no frills."},{"rating":"2","title":"True Pilates","review":"Top Pilates instructors demonstrate the classic Pilates method. This is top notch Pilates and will inspire even advanced Pilates students. An excellent narration follows the instructors as they go through beginning to super advanced moves. And I thought I was doing Pilates! This DVD takes it to a whole new level and has re-inspired my own Pilates study. Good for all levels but best if you have some prior Pilates experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exercise for a Lifetime","review":"I've been doing Pilates for many years and take some lessons when I can. There aren't many teachers near where I live. The upshot is I take Pilates mat classes and learn from videos. Someone told me to get this DVD because it shows the right way to practice with the right exercises. I enjoy this video because the people are strong and flexible and they are really intelligent. I have gown with this video because they show every level from modified basic - advanced and super advanced! I've bought other videos that are the same price but they only show a single workout. Classical Pilates does a very good job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good For Me & My Knee","review":"After rehabilitation for my bad knee, my physical therapist told me to buy this video. I struggled with my knee that was injured in football a long time ago. I tried to work around it, but other parts of my body compensated too much: my other knee started hurting, my back started hurting, my hip started hurting. I bought this video and took some Pilates lessons at the physical therapy office. I feel better already. This is good stuff and I recommend it to my friends. Whoever made this video is serious. There's no fluff. Just good, honest and challenging workouts to help your whole body."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT what I expected","review":"I just re-sold this dvd and I say good riddance! When I first viewed the dvd, I thought each segment was just a preview and then they were going to go back and go through a class. All of a sudden, they were in a boring discussion group and it was over. So disappointing. No instruction, just coaching with quick, minimal reps. It's also a pain to have to go through the dvd to find the segment that you wanted for just a few minutes of pilates. With a lot of filler in the beginning of useless information and a ... disucssion at the end, the actual pilates time in the middle is minimal. As a pilates and yoga instructor, I was extremely disappointed. Don't waste your money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent but Start with Easier DVD","review":"As a guy who is embarassed doing pilates this is an excellent video because it is no nonsense, time efficient, and effective. There are no smiling and enthusiastic aerobic chicks trying to pep me up just a scary German saying this like \\"this is not easy.\\" It is very effective, I am better shape than in years and find sports and all physical activities to be quite enhanced.Finally, do not start Pilates with this video because you will fail. There is no instruction and it is very fast. Begin with Pilates for Dummies, do that for 6-12 months. Then come to this after reading up on Pilates, etc. Then you will find this video accessible, a step up, and very challenging."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super workout","review":"As it is my first and only pilates DVD, I have to say it is a great program. My abs were completely gone after I had my daughter 6 months ago. I gradually moved up from basic to intermediate workout in 1 month. Although I still can't do some movements as good as before having the baby, the fast result courages me a lot. If you can only spare 10 to 15 minutes everyday, try this one--effective and time saving."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect intro to Pilates","review":"I've been doing this DVD on-and-off for years. I think it is the most perfect introduction to the Pilates technique that there is. It is not intimidating in the least, and there is a level for everyone depending on the level of fitness and flexibility.I did the Beginner section for about 3 months, then I moved up and now I am on Intermediate. I feel like a complete goddess when I've finished the 20-minute workout. The 20 minutes goes by in a flash, too, so don't be intimidated. It's wonderful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was completely new to Pilates when I tried this DVD. I didn't know what to expect but had read very good reviews of it from other Amazon customers. I was very disappointed that I spent the $25.00. The audio on this DVD is very poor. I had to turn the volume up very high, and there was a good deal of static. The beginner sections are not a very good follow-along workout. They don't go into much detail on how to perform the moves correctly, and the workout is less than five minutes, although they tell you to do it for 10 minutes. I got bored and frustrated before I advanced to the more difficult sections. It sure does work your abs, though!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad instructions and very short workouts","review":"I agree with the reviewer who said this is more like a Documentary than an instructional DVD. The segments are very short, being only around 10 minutes long and minimal instructions are given. I guess this DVD would be good if the user is looking to bring new ideas to the gym but defiantly not for a home workout. I'm highly disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointed","review":"I am a BASI certified Pilates instructor and like to do other's workouts at home. I found this video extremely disappointing- there is no warmup or even a suggestion thereof (very bad), the workouts are very short and way too fast-paced. Even if it were used as a cardio pilates workout, it's simply not long enough to get any cardio benefit and doing it so quickly defeats several of the important fundaments of Pilates. Also instructions are very limited, you have no idea when to switch sides. To top it off the scenery is low budget at best and the narrator's accent is irritating and distracting. That may be being too picky but sorry- it's just poor all the way around. I absloutely would swear all those rave reviews came from the producers because I can't possibly see how that many people can be that satisfied with this- don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perfect for Advanced Dancing Students","review":"Excellent for advanced dancing students. It is difficult to do all the exercise with the instructor because it is too fast, but have all the standard pilates exercises. If you prefer to follow the instructor's direction, I would recommend \\"The Method Pilates - Precision Toning and Sculpting\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"no instruction at all","review":"this is not a good dvd at all unless you are a professional pilates person, and then why would you need a dvd? it gives absolutely not instruction and goes so quickly, it's unbelievable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waist constricts and size much different than the cotton","review":"Was a waste of money buying these.

All I can say is, where has Mr. Woodrell been all my life?OK, OK, Tomato Red's ending out-and-out sucked. Very disappointing, maybe how a high-schooler would have ended the book (with no offense meant toward high schoolers).But everything until then - it was like reading the lyrics to an album of country ballad classics. Ozarks-Shakespearian. Beautiful, beautiful twists of words to paint culture, characters, thought processes.And I loved Tomato's mom, Bev, though the brother and sister held their own, as well, along with our protagonist.I may have to visit West Plains, MO, to see if I can find ol' Venus Holler just to check it all out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for everyone","review":"As other reviewers have said, Daniel Woodrell has a way with words, especially when writing about the Ozarks. His Winter's Bone is receiving much deserved attention because of the terrific movie made from it. (If you haven't seen it, it's available on DVD and from Netflix. Powerful adaptation and performance have gained many awards and 4 Oscar nominations.) But where WB has a heroine you can root for and a hopeful ending, Tomato Red is all about losers who will never have a happy ending. It's definitely worth reading but remember, you have been warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Witty writing, stupid subject matter, and silly ending","review":"TOMATO RED is a little wittier than WINTER'S BONE, and equally depressing. As a lifelong MO resident I'm sure these characters exist in some form, but they would in any city or state. Poor MO, the left and right coasts probably think there's nothing good in fly-over land. I didn't appreciate the smuttiness, although, I know, that's life, but it could have been handled obliquely. I don't know what the fascination is with a window or microscope into the hopeless lives of people in general. Do we learn anything about the characters? No. It's sinful human nature acting like human nature. We can all imagine or experience it. If writing has a purpose there should be some redeeming quality to it, at least an ending without such a loose end...it was like falling off a cliff. I'm sure there are grand pubas of literature who fawn over this stuff, but it was probably a waste of my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Such a fuss about the author's \\"ear\\"","review":"I was disappointed with this book.

Maybe I'm really stupid (after reading some of the 5-star reviews) but I found no message in the story and there was no resolution of anything that happened in the book.

Pete Rock and other guests make it a habit to screw the songs up by giving shoutouts during each song. I'm guessing because each part they talk over has already been looped before in a hip-hop song.

Her little brother's an incorrigible brat, making it difficult to maintain any sympathy for him and his plight. The storyline is contrived and confusing.

His love for Psalms and the reality of its content further illuminates the power behind the emotion, the praise, and the faith of Israel's musicians and priests. Peterson writes with such a great command of language (both English and Hebrew) that his writing can leave you wondering if you caught what he is saying. It reminded me of reading a CS Lewis book. I always feel like I'm missing the nuances of what he is saying but am awed at how he puts it into words.This is a tremendous book if you want to begin to read the Psalms with the passion of King David and want to infuse your spiritual life with a more complete understanding of who God is and how we communicate with Him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought provoking, Intellectual, Sensitive","review":"I very much enjoyed reading this book.

The sound is dark, mysterious, melancholy, enigmatic. Through earphones you can easily hear the strings of the piano sounding under Arrau's touch. The andantes of 570 and 576 have a hovering quality because of the unusual keys in which the sonatas were written. K 540, the adagio that Alfred Einstein called Mozart's \\"Most tragic\\" piano work, is unforgettable. It is seventeen minutes long, but it doesn't feel long. Every time I listen to it I think, \\"this is the best piece of music I own.\\"Lovers of standard Mozart performers like Uchida, Pires, Schiff, de Larrocha, Ashkenazy, Barnenboim, Perahia, would be shocked by the seriousness of this disc.

I suppose this is the type of book one writes when one really doesn't have anything to say on a topic.Sort-of based on the happenings surrounding the Black Death, this book doesn't ever come to any conclusions about the material presented - either original or in support of others'.

The book never seems to get to the point and the stories along the way are far from captivating or enlightening."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Written","review":"This is my first review on Amazon. Like many of the previous reviewers, I found this book poorly edited and the transitions left me circling back to understand what the author wished to convey. I have a molecular biology background and bought the book with the hope that Cantor would actually develop the life and struggles of civilization post-plague. He appears to be more interested in the world of politics and religion at the time of the plague."},{"rating":"1","title":"A puzzling disappointment","review":"I have always enjoyed Norman Cantor's books. They have been well-written and reliable references. This one, however, is rambling, repetitive, and appears not to have been edited or proofread. The publisher should have saved the author from this debacle. It's easy to pick out specific problems: blaming Jewish mysticism for antisemitism and assuming credibility for Francis Crick's daffy spores from space theory, for example, but the book as whole is more worrying. The reader, at least this one, wants to urge the author to take things easy for a while and hire a good copy editor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Thin Gruel!","review":"This book was a major disappointment. Prof. Cantor has an excellent reputation as a medievalist, and I had long hoped he would turn his energies to the plague. But what we have here is a very disappointing and poorly written book.

The rest of it is inexplicable. On one hand, the attempts at humor are hard to square with the seriousness of the situations that these people faced. On the other hand, the attempts at humor are also primarily at the expense of Christ, Christianity, Christians, and conservatives. (How the author could possibly know Margaret Thatcher's thoughts about the 14th and 15th centuries is hard to figure, for instance.) About midway through, I got tired of the snideness and threw the book away. It was clearly going to be the same tired remarks over and over again, even though there were bits of interesting history buried under them. My recommendation: Do not buy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hardly Literature","review":"This book is possibly the worst piece of literature I have ever read. One might assume from all of the credentials that Cantor claims in the front of his book, that it might be at least somewhat decent. Frankly, however, this book is a piece of junk. Not only is the book extremely boring to read, but it skims over the important parts and focuses on the minor details, and theories that most scientists discard as rubbish. If you are considering purchasing this book, I strongly urgue you to reconsider."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"The book is written in a rather condescending tone that assumes that the reader has a grade 2 reading level and a total lack of short-term memory (sentences are repeated pages apart). Facts of total irrelevance are thrown at the reader. There are multiple mistakes when it comes to detail. The author must have been paid per word -- the redundance cannot be explained otherwise. It's impossible to actually learn anything and if you do, chances are it's wrong. Theories are presented as fact. In one passage a quote from a scientific article relating to fleas' digestive tract appears -- it's completely out of context as it's implications on the spread of an epidemic are left to one's imagination (if there are any). It's all filler with no substance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap history","review":"I have to agree with the other (negative) reviews of this book. I was highly disappointed with the complete and utter lack of scholarship within the book, the numerous factual mistakes, and in particular, Cantor's axe-grinding against the undemocratic actions of 14th century monarchs. This is not the place for Professor Cantor to wax lyrical about our enlightened democracy, or to opine about the British monarchy of today as symptomatic of the degraded, arrogant culture of Europe in general. If he wanted to write a book about such things, publish it as an opinion piece, not falsely wrapped as a historical study."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfocused at Best","review":"This book was an EXTREMELY difficult read. The author is prone to erratic, often unrelated tangents, which read like an exercise in free association. At times I felt like someone had taken passages from the reading comprehension section of the GRE and just thrown them together in a book without any overall reason. The worst was the section on the Jews. Whatever his feelings may be about the Jews, there is no need to trace their circumstances up to and including WWII in a book about the Black Death! He took what could have been an interesting chapter and mutilated it by losing any semblance of focus. In the book's defense there are some interesting bits of trivia in this dung heap, but unless you are a bit of a masochist I can't recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The plague came from outer space!","review":"If you make it to the end of this badly written, unedited and politically biased book, you'll discover that the author discounts legitimate research in favor of wild theories like the plague came from outer space.The author inserts blanket statements throughout that demonstrate a disturbing lack of comprehension of the medieval period.He writes: \\"Fourteenth century people lacked the moral categories that could transcend traditional political and social roles. They lacked a critical value system that judged rulers by consequences and not the formal categories in which their behavior was structured.\\" Huh? Ever heard of the Magna Carta, written in 1215?A far better book is The Great Mortality, by John Kelly.Don't waste your time with this one. I'm recycling mine.

It does contain quite a lot of information, yes, but it's organized so poorly and written in such awkward prose that its impact is severely diminished. I was particularly annoyed that a medievalist of such reputation didn't do a little more research on the \\"Ring around a rosy\\" rhyme, but confidently states the old myth about its origins as fact. ....In short,I'd say that you're much better off rereading Tuchman than buying this book, unless you collect interesting jacket art."},{"rating":"1","title":"May the plague take it!","review":"The author obviously knows his subject, and the book contains many fascinating tidbits. But the writing style and editing is so poor that much of the book's value is lost in the jumble. The first several chapters read like college course lecture notes strung together. The last several chapters include repetitions which should have been edited out. The efforts to explain family relationships and inheritances are convoluted and could have been stated more clearly with a little effort. Some of the claims Cantor makes about the results of the plague are far-fetched, and his supporting evidence does not bear them out. He also makes some very broad generalizations, such as claiming that nobility in the 14th century never thought deeply even though they read philosophical works and supported the arts. Surely there were a few thoughtful nobles! In all, a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad, bad, bad...","review":"When the assignment to read this book was given, I thought that I would be getting a good excuse to read an interesting book. Yet again I was disappointed by the judgement of my history teacher. Not only did this book juggle far too many topics at one time in each unorganized chapter, but it also read as if the writer didn't have a rudimentary grasp of the English language. The fact that a fifteen-year-old could find mistakes in this that an editor missed is pretty disheartening. One that particularly bothered me: \\"...eastablish the syncronous core truth but it could come close enough to qualm[sic] fears that faith and reason...\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"This book is marred by endless digressions and what I can only call blather. The narrative jumps back and forth in time. The reader is treated to discussions ranging from St. Augustine's misogyny to the partition of Poland in the 1790s. In one of these digresssions the author exposes his ignorance of the origin of Jewish surnames and unfortunetly perpetuates the myth that officers at Ellis Island gave immigrants their surnames. The most interesting parts of this book are the too few descriptions of what happened to several family fortunes as a result of the plague and bad legal manueverings. The most valuable part is the annotated bibliography which I will use to find a more worthwhile book on the Black Plague."},{"rating":"1","title":"The only book I ever returned","review":"Really, I bought this book in Logan airport and promptly returned in that same day.

This one richly deserves being sent back to the publisher for revision."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Politically Correct Broadside","review":"If Mr. Cantor is not a Communist, the Communist Party is being cheated out of some dues. Mr. Cantor seems more interested in denigrating the upper class of English medieval society than in recounting the impact of the plague. He even faults the peasants and students for not advancing the Peasants' Revolt to a 'Leninist or Maoist denouement.\\" But worse than his constant political heckling (his remarks lack the persuasiveness of propaganda), is his casual use of baseless charges. His undocumented allegation that the 13th century English gentry engaged in '...the widespread practice of female infanticide\\" is simply mud that doesn't stick."},{"rating":"1","title":"left wing history","review":"Cantor has a nice prose style and writes here on a fascinating subject, an era whose effects are undoubtedly still being felt.However there is a constant undercurrent of left wing philosophy throughout the entire book, at least to the approximate halfway point which is where I gave up. Cantor actually uses phrases such as \\"communist workers' paradise,\\" which he apparently hoped the serfs of the middle ages would have attained. He even, strangely, finds time to disparage Margaret Thatcher, which lets you know pretty clearly that the black plague may not be the real point of this book.Quite frankly, I see the ugly little tome as a disguised attempt to push socialism. I am therefore somewhat resentful at having paid money for something other than what I thought I was buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"publish or perish","review":"This book bears the telltale signs of a work written under the academic duress known as \\"publish or perish\\". The author is a professor of medieval history and the book suffers all the rambling, roaming, and lack of focus of a dull history lecture. The author goes off on speculative and unscholarly tangents on the level of Von Daniken's \\"Chariots of the Gods\\". This type of activity is protected by tenure, but a dutiful editor should protect the public from this type of writing. The last chapter is the most irritating. Like a professor who has only 5 minutes left in which to finish his lecture, the author throws his unfinished thoughts into a final, short chapter. He had met his quota of pages and simply stopped writing. I wonder what kind of a mark the good professor would give this work if submitted by one of his students?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting Subject, pedantic writing","review":"This was a very interesting and timely subject, unfortunately, the writing didn't hold up to the level of interest.

The sarcastic, cynical, and disturbing writing style is bad enough, but the mocking cruelness, and the numerous inaccuracies involved in trying to portray these families is unforgivable.

With only ten chapters and roughly 220 pages, this book can be a useful work for the study of the Black Death due to its use of secondary researches and bibliography. However, it seems to be a bit unreadable and rather a subjective written.While I was intrigued with his use of secondary sources and his discussion in \\"Knowing About the Black Death\\" section, I was rather put off or confused by his writing style throughout this book, and I was not quite sure what conclusion(s) he was relating to the readers.While the author made some interesting points throughout the book, I was getting the impression that he wrote this book in a hurry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok History, Bad Science","review":"Cantor's book, while an extremely interesting for its historical insights, (for instance, how the Plague may have spured the Renaissance) falls short in the area of science. He seems to have little grasp of vector-borne diseases and cycles of infection. He throws in irrelevant scientific references with little idea of their real value.I would recommend this book to people wanting a greater understanding of the historical and social impact that the Black Death made, but I would not recommend this book to someone wanting to understand infectious disease transmission or the nature of the plague in particular."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"I read about this book in the Chronicle of Higher Education and was eager to read it. My anticipation unfortunately made the letdown all the worse.While there is interesting information in the book, I finished it without any clear sense for Cantor's argument; that is, I wasn't sure what his point was. The book seemed more a cobbled-together pile of information than a coherent story.Anyone treading this path has a hard act to follow; Tuchman's A Distant Mirror is still the supreme popular work on the period.

It is disjointed and repetitive."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Plague on This Tendentious and Sloppy Book","review":"Characterized by poor grammar, excessive repetition, tendentious swipes at modern politicians he dislikes, conflicting equivalences of modern and mediaeval currency, and chaotic organization, Cantor's book appears to be a slap-dash compilation of lecture notes."},{"rating":"1","title":"If this book was edited, somebody needs to be fired.","review":"There are so many more well written books about the Black Plague. This one stinks. Any editor worth his salt would have slashed through Cantor's extraneous, anachronistic, distracting and banal comments. Save your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Best Medical Historian","review":"The book itself is not bad when it gets to more of the social history after the plague. However, the medical history part is a little shoddy, with the author misusing terms, referencing some questionable obscure sources to make his point, and making some assumptions that should not be made. As a source of medical history I could never in good conscious recommend this book, as its not a very accurate depiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where oh where was the editor?","review":"The book was a somewhat enjoyable read, but I think the unedited version must have gone to the printers. I thought perhaps that a high school student wrote this so poor was the writing / grammar. NYTimes Bestseller - well, people will buy anything.I found the editorializing comments towards religious people of the time to be condescending and distracting."},{"rating":"1","title":"A huge disappointment","review":"Given Cantor's reputation I expected far more than this slim volume delivers. Cantor seems to have used the book as a dumping ground for oddments and leftovers. There is little organization, and to describe his writing style as \\"breezy\\" is an understatement. In addition, Cantor so immerses the book in hyper-political correctness and makes his bias against the aristocracy so obvious that I soon began to wonder how his obvious prejudices may have influenced his choice of facts. I finally gave up in disgust two-thirds of the way through the book and simply skimmed the rest.This is the first book I've bought in a long time that will not find a place on my shelves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at all what I expected","review":"This was quite a disappointing book. The one positive aspect of the book: there is plenty of information on the social, cultural, economic, religious, and intellectual climate of the 14th century. Unfortunately, the information is hopelessly scattered throughout the book without much organizing principle at all. It's a sloppy stream-of-conscious collection. 1) his conclusions are scattered pell-mell thoughout the text, 2) there is no logical procession of his argument, 3) his bias is very apparent in certain passages (especially when discussing the nobility), 4) in his infinte pedantry, he sticks in random pieces of information that have absolutely no bearing whatsoever on the argument he is making (that is, to the degree he is making a clear argument at all), and 5) details of the plague are often mentioned in passing. The book is a decent collection of random facts - not much else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing, Misleading","review":"Cantor's discussion of the origins and impact of the plague is, at best, cursory. This book reads more like a series of case studies of medieval persons - an archbishop, a wealthy family, a princess. The case studies have the common thread of persons dying of the plague. However, Cantor uses this as a pretext to discuss - in colorful detail - the lives, achievements and ideologies of these persons. For example, I found the discussion about Aristotlean and Thomist logic distracting and irrelevant to the plague. This is a readable introduction to medieval England (the case studies are predominantly English), but certainly not an enlightening discussion of the plague phenomenon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Medieval-like writing","review":"Dr. Cantor is a medievalist, and writes in the style of his subjects: very rambling, with a tendency to ramify tediously so he can talk at length about what he finds interesting, whether or not it is relevant. Some good information, some mistakes even a non-scholar reader like me could spot. Not a lot about the plague. Some peculiar theories. What seems to me a misapplication of 20th-century terminology to 14th-century groups (for instance, what sounds like raiders or harriers, he calls terrorists)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting","review":"The book rambles a bit, but it does a good job of explaining the profound and lasting impact of the Plague on Europe."},{"rating":"1","title":"One cent books don't happen","review":"This is the second time I have ordered a one cent book form a seller on Amazon and the second time they have said they shipped the book and it never arrived. To be fair, my cent and the postage were refunded both times. But I have to start all over again looking for my book and it just isn't worth the aggravation. I am disappointed as all my other dealings with Amazon have been exemplary and I have been very satisfied. By the way, the actual book is great. You will be surprised how the black plague affected the following centuries. Get it somewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disease, politics, economics, & demography","review":"Smoothly written and presented, Cantor's book looks at the demographics, economics, and politics that were affected by the great plague epidemic. He gives both a close up view of how the plague touched individuals and a broader view of how the disease impacted the entire continent. I found his focus mostly on Britain a little narrow but I actually enjoyed the lack of embedded footnotes and references--there are plenty of those books for the ones who want them. Cantor does an admirable job of keeping a morbid topic interesting and he connects the dots of many 13th and 14th century historical figures in ways that I had not been aware of. For those who enjoy his perspectives I recommend McNeil's book on the impact of disease on worldwide history"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cantor makes History interesting","review":"Norman Cantor who wrote only a few books before passing away a few years ago, provides a sound examination of the Black Death in a consolidated work. Unless the reader has a PhD in this area of history, a lot of times it can be hard to decipher. Cantor wrote this book and his other works for everyone with an understanding of history but not with the prerequisite of a Phd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really about the Plague","review":"The author spends very little time discussing the actual plague, but instead focuses on life before, during and after the plague in Northern Europe. This is ok, but not what I expected. He also has the nasty habit of presenting his opinions as facts and not even backing them up with relevant references. It gets old fast."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"I was very disappointed by this book. I had high hopes based on some reviews I read elsewhere. What some describe as a readable style I found to be very annoying. There are constant tangents and digressions along with weirdly out of place references and descriptions (He describes Princess Joan as a 'top-drawer white girl). There are many anecdotes in the work that I found interesting but the constant bouncing around killed it. Reading sections of this book is like driving over literary speed bumps.I would recommend instead of this book Barbara Tuchman's 'A distant Mirror'"},{"rating":"1","title":"Desultory and Disappointing","review":"Cantor's treatment of the economic, political and social dislocations effected by The Plague is fragmentary bordering on incoherent. The narrative lurches from largely unoriginal generalizations about epidemiology to financial microhistories of individual families to a vague summary of the state of Medieval medicine--all interesting in their own right but undeveloped and unintegrated by the author. Lazily written and seemingly unedited, the book could be cut to perhaps half its length. Cantor appends a good bibliography: I would urge interested readers to skip him and go directly to his sources."},{"rating":"1","title":"UGH.","review":"An absolutely terrible book. Not a single footnote, crude and painful attempts at humor, off-the-wall theories (the bubonic plague actually came from space?), and an attempt at making the Black Death relevant to today's society all fall flat. If you want a decent study of the Black Death, steer clear. If you want to see how not to write popular history, pick this up and learn."},{"rating":"1","title":"In the Wake of the Plague","review":"This was a very disappointing book. Anything of historical interest is overshadowed by the fact that it is so poorly written, with the most cumbersome sentence structure and appallingly bad grammar. Cantor fails to show any back-up or scholarly research to justify his sweeping statements on history, e.g., he describes the Battle of Agincourt as \\"an easy win\\". He glibly calls John Lackland, a \\"manic-depressive\\", King Henry II, a \\"stud\\", and Princess Joan, \\"a top-drawer white girl\\" and \\"a product of Caucasian mastery\\". His erroneous definition of the word \\"chivalry\\", along with all his other quirky inaccuracies led me to such exasperation I had to put the book down half-way through. I recommend Daniel Defoe's \\"Journal of the Plague Year\\" for anyone interested in this subject. Don't waste your time on \\"In the Wake of the Plage\\". It is neither entertaining nor historically accurate. In fact, it seems to be either the work of an academic quack or a prankster."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfocussed and irrational","review":"Rather than attempting to present a well developed history of the plague in medieval Europe, Prof. Cantor chooses to discuss the evolution of the pestilence in terms of its cultural, economic and scientific ramifications. This is a worthy goal but, in Prof. Cantor's hands, one which offers no revelations. The very few interesting and valuable insights this book provides are easily obscured by irrelevant (though sometimes interesting) tangents, sloppy reasoning, unjustified conclusions, meaningless theological and cultural gibberish and, surprising for one of Prof. Cantor's scholarship, serious factual errors. None is more egregious than his casual observation that vast amounts of extraterrestial bacteria and viruses fall to the earth from outer space.Although short, this work is still far too long. Avoid it like, well, you know."},{"rating":"1","title":"How disappointing!","review":"A great title, promising an intellectually enriching flight home... All the more disappointing, because professor Cantor is obviously widely knowledgeable on this subject. Yet his rambling writing (if you loose track as you are reading, don't bother going back, the same thing will be repeated within a few paragraphs); the poor editing; the obvious mistakes, and the less obvious ones pointed out by other reviewers; all make for a book that does not fulfill its promise by far."},{"rating":"1","title":"Make Up Your Facts as You Go Along, Why Don't You?","review":"Yes. This is strewn with errors like a mine-field is with mines. Fortunately, the errors are easier to spot and less lethal.Yes. The prose style is rambling, chatty and almost unreadable. Did he derive his style from instant messenger postings?I contribute nothing by hammering the poor man when he is down, even if deservedly so.I just wanted to second the motion, which is a few screens back if you use the default \\"newest first\\" sort, by Andrea Loughry that anyone interested in this topic would be well served to read The Doomsday Book by Connie Willis. That suggested itself to me while reading (I mean \\"slogging through\\") Norman's little book and what to my wondering eyes should appear but Ms. Loughry's review making the same point. Among other treasured ideas I derived from Ms. Willis' book was that the Plague contributed to The Reformation. Please go buy it now."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Plague on this Book","review":"Yes, the reviews are right: this book is a shocker. Wild speculation, repetition, endless miles of digression, and a pitiless, parochial morality are all there in spades. And I bet it gets even worse after Chapter 3. I am writing this only to get the average rating back down where it rightfully belongs.I weep for the trees that gave their bark for my copy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak","review":"This is not a very good book.Rather than being about the \`wake of the plague', most of the book rambles all over the place and in particular addresses the period before the plague struck Europe. Only the last, smallest, chapter specifically deals with events after the 1348-50 plague.The author makes frequent personal judgements on events and persons of the period and injects his own views, some of which are unpleasant, into the narrative.One would do better to read McNeill, Horrox, Cohn, Kelly, or Oldstone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really about the Plague","review":"This book portends to be a history of 'the black death,' but reads more like a general history of mid 14th century England. It does offer some interesting arguments about the causes of the plague, but glosses over primary sources for those arguments. Overall I found myself racing to get through the book and move on to my next title."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some interesting info","review":"There is interesting info in this book. Some well-told stories. But it seems like the first or second of what should have been four or five drafts. The ending is bizarre. He does not seem to have had an editor. He says things more than once, sometimes on the same page. Not a well-constructed book. Curiously, he says this about other authors in his useful bibliography. I have no desire to read another book by this author. If I was using this book for research, it would not be very easy to find info in this book, although it does have an index."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very unprofessional piece of work!","review":"I was excited to start in on this book, as it was a gift from my son and I love history. About a chapter into to it I realized the author was definitely not subjective in his writing. There are strong anti-royalty, anti-wealthy, anti-organized religion (ie.very anti-Catholic) rantings and sarcastic remarks, which I found extremely unacademic, and the content was repetitous and jumbled. Because of this unprofessionalism I seriously began to doubt the author's information and theories which otherwise would have been extremely thought provoking. A \\"D\\" grade at best!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaves much to be desired","review":"Poorly written and superficial, this book does not deliver on the praise advertised on its cover. Interesting nuggets of information abound, but appear haphazard and disconnected from any structured argument. Trite commentaries are partnered with sobering topics which weakens the book's credibility, such as this quote about a historical account of family tensions in the peasantry: \\"There was wife abuse and there was \`a wicked wife who will not be corrected; her husband flees from her in fear of her tongue.' Many times growing up in Manitoba [Canada] I noticed shriveled-up, bitter women like that - and they had a lot to be bitter about.\\" Please."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Ring Around the Rosie\\" Is Not History","review":"I've been surprised by the good reviews this book has received. I picked it up on impulse, but once I began reading, I was almost immediately disappointed. On page 5, the reader is treated to the old chestnut about \\"Ring Around the Rosie\\" being some sort of race-memory of the Black Death. The silliness reaches a peak when Cantor brings on Fred Hoyle's fruitcake hypothesis that pandemics are caused by viruses from outer space. And in between-- If Margaret Thatcher were not a public figure, that \\"joke\\" of Cantor's about her would probably be actionable.One last thing: If you're going to read this more than once, keep a pencil by your side on the first read-through. Cantor doesn't seem to know what commas are for, but there's no reason for you to suffer through his undifferentiated writing more than once."},{"rating":"1","title":"this book sucked","review":"What a horrible writer, after plugging through to page 60 (out of 200) there were less then two pages describing the plague, and 58 giving an account of the British Aristocracy. Sources (very few) were cited in a very disorganized way. Writing style put me to sleep, which is about all this book is good for.

From here Rod Stewart headed rapidly downhill. This album is of significance only in that it documents this slide. An alternate title for it for aspiring musicians: \\"Don't Try This At Home.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Better Than You Think","review":"Blondes Have More Fun is the album that is easily the most critically reviled of all of Rod Stewart's albums and is a target of alot his fans. People call it Rod Stewart selling out to disco music and to a degree they're right. \\"Da Ya Think I'm Sexy?\\" is pure disco and in 1979 disco was king. The song was a number one hit and a platinum seller. The thing people overlook is that \\"Da Ya Think I'm Sexy?\\" is the only disco song on the album and while the rest of it isn't vintage Rod Stewart music, it's not bad. In fact there are some songs like \\"The Best Of My Life\\", \\"Ain't Love A Bitch\\" & \\"Scarred & Scared\\" that are high quality. Also, if you take \\"Da Ya Think I'm Sexy?\\" for what it is, it is a catchy piece of music. If you're looking for Every Picture Tells A Story, you won't find it here, but with Blondes Have More Fun, you get a solid, workman like effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Rod's best","review":"I have almost every Rod album ever released and I feel that this album is one of his most listenable albums ever. You can pretty much press play from beginning and listen to the very end of this CD and not get bored. How many times can you say that about ANY album these days? Not too many times.From the hedonistic, party music of \\"Do You Think I'm Sexy\\", \\"Dirty Weekend\\", and \\"Blondes Have More Fun\\", to the honesty and humor of \\"Ain't Love A Bitch\\", \\"Is That The Thanks I Get\\", and \\"Attractive Female Wanted, to the the warmth of \\"The Best Days Of My Life\\" and pain of \\"Scarred and Scared\\", \\"Standing In The Shadows Of Love\\", and \\"Last Summer\\" (this song ain't as nice as you think despite of its Carribean vacation-like atmosphere) , this album is a masterpiece!This one is definitely one of Rod's best albums!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Record, Buy It!!!","review":"I'm only 24 years old, but the first album I remember listening to over and over as a small kid was this one. Even today, I still have to pop this in my cd player from time to time. It is a great album and, in my opinion, Rod's last album before he suffered from all the sappy ballads he did in the 80's. This album shocases Rod's hard edge such as Dirty Weekend (which, thankfully, I didn't pick up on most of the dirty lyrics as a kid, the title track, but also had alot of softer, well written songs such as Ain't Love A B**ch, and Happiest Days of my Life. A great album overall."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Worry About One Disco Song......the rest was the best!","review":"I think the music portrayed the time perfectly, for the year it was released.

In the last CD Caroline talks about the first two positions on the wheel, then asks the audience something to the effect, do I have to go any further with you people, and then stops. She is assuming that everyone has the book Sacred Contracts, which I do. The reason I got the CD was because I found that casting the wheel on my own was confusing.

It's really awful! As others have commented in previous reviews, the delivery of the workshop is such that it's difficult to follow without physically being in the room. The presenter frequently speaks to audience members who are inaudible. She also often seems to be referring to slides that the listener obviously can't see. (\\"here, here, and this\\") You get the sense that you are missing a lot of the content. But after a while you don't care. Much of the material consists of rambling personal stories that take a very long time to arrive at some sort of tedious point. Finally, her tone is surprisingly confrontational and decidedly unfriendly. She comes across as testy, judgmental, dismissive, and just plain cranky.

La Ronna is a good source for this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jojoba wonders","review":"Love this product. Use it for hair and skin. Great carrier oil, great mixed with rosemary, eucalyptus etc. Always good service from Amazon and its affiliates."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Oil but very expensive for daily use","review":"Try coconut oil instead it is even naturally better smelling, and has the strange effect of healing acne. Who would have thought an oil could clear acne?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not organic anymore.","review":"I have been ordering this product for the past couple of years, and this last shipment noticed that the smell has become very oily. It is obviously not organic anymore. I order non-organic jojoba oil as well, and it smells exactly like it. I have filed a formal complaint with Amazon to investigate this matter. DO NOT buy this product if you think you'll be getting organic jojoba oil."},{"rating":"1","title":"it might work...","review":"I wish I could have smelled this before I bought it. It smelled a little nutty or coffee. It might have worked well but I couldn't get past the smell"},{"rating":"1","title":"This brand is not expeller pressed, i.e. not cold pressed)","review":"I love, love, LOVE jojoba oil and was excited to see the low price of the Desert Essence brand. But it's not expeller pressed, i.e. not cold pressed, so chemicals are used to extract the oil. I returned this one and bought the NOW brand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't expect a miracle","review":"Use this oil to complement a beauty routine already set in place, such as drinking enough water and cleansing the skin. I started using this oil when I was drinking 8 glasses of water a day, and thought it made my skin look lovely. Recently I stopped hydrating myself properly and this oil does what it's supposed to do - it moisturizes but doesn't replenish if your skin is already dry. I don't have acne, so I can't tell whether it does \\"miracles\\" on acne. I haven't tried it on the scalp either, but I'm sure it will do good things. Overall, I will buy it again. I prefer this over the ridiculously expensive creams, those containers packed with god-knows-what!"},{"rating":"2","title":"okay i guess","review":"i been using if for a couple weeks on my face and hair. havent seen too big of a differnce yet, but i do know it doesnt make my skin break out so that is a plus."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jojoba oil - good amount for the money","review":"First off- I love the non greasy feel. I mix it with peppermint oil to soften my feet. They smell nice too! Never to early to start getting your heels & toes ready for sandals- I am glad I started now because I think it's a good product but doesn't work as fast as I'd like. It is a wonderful eye makeup remover."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bottle doesn't leak!","review":"I am currently using Jojoba Oil for acne and for dry hair and skin. I live in a very dry climate but have hormonal acne that I am dealing with. This is the second brand that I have tried and the bottle is so much better. It doesn't leak or 'spit' oil out when it is opened. I have found that I do notice a difference with using it on my face and definitely in my hair but I am also using Maca root for acne and can't say if the jojoba alone would help with the problem. In saying that, my hair is amazing and that is the only thing that I have changed in the routine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good night moisturizer","review":"I have been using this since May and love it. I am 48, acne prone, and very sensitive skin. I was using a much more expensive bedtime moisturizer, but it burned when I applied it. The jojoba is very soothing to the skin, reduces redness, and my acne is not bothered by it. I would only use it at bedtime, though, because it does have an oily residue. There is a bit of a smokey smell which I understand is normal with pure unrefined jojoba oil.Mine bottle looks exactly like the one on the web page - Dessert Essence brand name, and stamped with USDA Organic. I noticed that when I write my review, the picture that shows on the upper right corner is different. It sounds as if you have to be careful about suppliers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was so excited to try this oil because of all the rave reviews. However, the disappointment began from the moment I opened the packaging- the bottle was damaged and wasn't sealed properly. I tried smoothing some oil into my hands, and noticed a repugnant smell- I had no idea it had an odor. For something that is supposed to be organic and plant based, I expected something a little more natural-smelling; this oil smells.. like cooking grease or something.I'm rather disappointed. Guess the search for the perfect essential oil continues!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Recommend!","review":"Scentless, light, and smooth. This 'oil' is actually a liquid wax ester that has served as a replacement for whale oil in cosmetics because of it's very close similarity to sebum (your own natural body oil). It can be used on skin or hair, and is a very powerful and ideal moisturizer that can be combined with as little as 2 or 1 drops to your soap and moisturizers. Can also be used with sugar to create a very gentle, skin-softening exfoliator.I recommend this to anyone in search of a great moisturizer. My order came fast, they made sure to tape the cap of the bottle and placed it into a ziploc which was then placed into a box with biodegradable packing peanuts and my order-receipt. Would order from them again."},{"rating":"2","title":"cleared my blackheads","review":"First of all, my skin type is oily in the T-zones. I had large blackheads and whiteheads on my nose which made my pores stand out even more. Although the size of your pores are genetic and not much can be done about it, the jojoba oil has made the blackheads and whiteheads smaller in less than a week of applying once in the morning and once before bed. I seriously can't believe it works so well.I feel like the jojoba oil is absorbing into my skin fairly well but if I touch or rub my nose, I can feel the oil. Strangely, the jojoba doesn't make my face all shiny. It's odorless and a little amount goes far. I will continue to use it because it works!You can buy this same product at Whole Foods (for the same price). There was another brand that was selling for double because it was certified organic. I might invest in that one in the future now that I know it works for my skin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oily Skin- Be Careful!","review":"With so many glowing reviews, I thought I would give this a try. I have very acne prone oily skin. Oh. My. God. In just three days of use, my skin has gotten 100 times worse than it has been in a long time. I am downright embarrassed to leave the house. Be careful if you have naturally bad skin- I can't stress this enough. Sometimes, natural products just don't work for serious problem skin."},{"rating":"2","title":"great","review":"I purchased this oil conveniently form my local Whole Foods market- it works great and is worth the price given the fact that it is organic- works great as a hair treatment."},{"rating":"2","title":"natural, gentle alternative for eye makeup remover","review":"sounds like some people have received \\"expired\\" products....it needs to be fresh, and it does stagnate.For me it is the BEST EYE MAKEUP REMOVER EVER!!!!!!!!!! I never want to use the chemical crap again. This does the job better than mineral oil...and it's a natural substance rather than a petroleum (yes, same as gasoline!) derivative.I have acne...STILL at 49, so I am going to try it on my face and see what happens. I will add it to lotions, with essential oils. BIG FAN here!"},{"rating":"2","title":"pefect for skin!!","review":"I use this on my skin every time I wash my face.

The color looks much darker than the old bottle I had.Third, half of the bottle had spilled out in the package.So for actual fresh Dessert Essence Jojoba Oil I give it five stars as it is awesome on skin and hair like nothing else. A few drops and you have smooth soft hair and skin.However, unfortunately, what I got here isn't the same as what I can get at the store.This seems to be old and rancid and I would have liked the photo to match what I got."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hair treatment","review":"I comb this into my hair about 2 hours before my shower, it has brought it back to life. Love knowing it's organic and a single ingredient. Honestly it's cheap and has made my hair fabulously alive. Does wonders for your skins also.Love this product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fraud","review":"This is Not Organic and was suppose to be removed by Amazon as false advertising. This oil is awesome but lets face it, if you really want organic you have to pay for it...if it's too good to be true it probably isn't, and in this case it is not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alligator skin miracle!","review":"My husband has severe dry skin on his legs. Medication from the dermatologist didn't even work; he tried everything over the counter as well. For many years, he has lived with this extremely itchy condition. I saw an episode of Dr. Oz where he said jojoba oil would work miracles with dry skin and decided to give it a try. Within three days of applying this oil after bathing, my husbands legs looked like newborn skin. The look of alligator skin had disappeared, and there was no more itching! I am reordering this product today. He ran out and within a couple of days, his legs have reverted to the condition. This is a wonderful product and I would recommend this to anyone who has dry skin. It simply relieved what we've spent 28 years trying to cure. And, I might add, lots of money buying creams, lotions, etc which didn't work!"},{"rating":"2","title":"beautiful glow","review":"About 8 months back. I had really bad breakouts and due to stress I started getting some lines on my forehead. I decided then to stop using cosmetics and started using Jajoba oil and coconut oil. I use Jajoba oil on my face and you just need 2 drops and it spreads well without making your face greasy. After 3 months of using people started complimenting for the glow on my face. I love my Jajoba oil. Once 4 ounce bottle had lasted me 8 months. I use cocunt oil right after a shower as a body misturizer. That had also helped me a lot as well. So for me going natural has worked...."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME","review":"I use this to clean and moisturize my face, and as a leave in treatment for my hair. I will repurchase. This is a very light oil."},{"rating":"2","title":"Desert Essence Organic Jojoba Oil","review":"I have spent so much money looking for a lotion that could moisturize my skin without making it break out. Well, I never found a lotion but I did find this oil. This oil works wonders for your skin, hair and face. All you need is to apply a couple drops on your face after you shower and mix in some with your regular body lotion and your set! I've been using this for about a week now (night and day) and have yet to break out. My skin (face and body) is super sensitive to the point where I can't uses creams or my pores will clog in literally less than an hour. This oil seeps into my skin leaving it smoother than any other lotions I've ever tried."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible Product","review":"This is one of those life-saving type products you cannot live without. I use it as a facial moisturizer. I also use it on my hands which are sometimes dry from chemicals at work. The only problem is you really cant use this product on your face in the day because you'll look to shiny. But apply it every night for sure. It keeps the skin moisturized and it also really cures acne and blemishes.Don't be alarmed by the seemingly high price. All you need is a few drops per application. The stuff lasts forever."},{"rating":"1","title":"hard to manage","review":"Made for people with small hands, large bathroom counters, and desire to get soaked.

Also, of course, both years my mon had already sent the older issue to go under the tree.

The recipes are very much a step up from what you get in the family magazines (Good Housekeeping, Sunset, etc.) without being so elaborate that you are not motivated to try them as is sometimes the case with some of the dedicated food magazines. And, the helpful hints are actually helpful! Another appreciation is that the magazine is limited in the number of recipes per month. I find that helps provide some focus.I do feel obliged to let you know that you will receive a noticeable amount of mail from their mailing list.

The White Stripes make a point of playing raw original rock influenced by blues and even country while paying homage to the great rock of the past. Joss Stone emasculated the song, and twisted it into another cookie cutter Mariah Carey rip off to whine to. How many different sounds can we get out of her lungs and call it crooning...Wow, maybe if she played any of the music herself I could at least respect that, but like all R&B and rappers alike, that's just too much work. Steal it, that's the easy way out."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is real good stuff","review":"I heard Joss Stone's song on a famous music television and since then, my cd player's been tired of playing it again and again. Those of you who like nu-soul will love this cd. The beat is tremendous,Joss's voice is amazing, it makes you fell like dancing, put on some nice 70's like clothes, and head up to Studio 54. I don't have anything else to say but buy this cd, you won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A much stronger voice than Jack's.","review":"Joss' cover of Jack Whyte's tune is superior to the original in every way. A stronger voice, a funkier arrangement and a better (more subtle) guitarist in Little Beaver. This was one of the highlights of the Soul Sessions, a cd filled with highlights. The White Stripes' original sounds bland and predictable next to Joss.Looking forward to her upcoming disc of originals."},{"rating":"1","title":"Craptacular Cover","review":"Her cover of the White Stripes \\"Fell in Love with a Girl\\" is unnecessary and awful, to be kind.

The process here was to start with a good song (\\"Fell in love with a girl\\" by the White Stripes), remove all redeeming qualities, and then slather a mind-numbingly thick layer of homogenized faux-soul over the top of it all. The singer has talent, but her singing style and pronunciations are bizarrely affected, as if someone required her to sing and receive a root canal in-studio at the same time.Very, very embarrassing for all concerned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is it just me?","review":"I pose just 3 questions:1.

It takes them through the trencheds in WW2. They travel to many different places to find out what happened to there freind's brother.I think that overall this book is one of the most boring books that I have ever read. I would not advise it to anyone looking for a good mystery book. I give it a one star rating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good to the almost-last drop","review":"Laurie King is too good a writer to have given us such a perfunctory ending. This is--to my thinking--the best book of the series, with wonderfully developed characters and a carefully researched context that engages the reader from beginning to almost-end. It felt as if Ms. King was herself deeply involved in her own story until she suddenly gave it all up to a quick, formulaic tying together of loose ends. Zip. Done, and done quickly with little artistry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disjusted","review":"Laurie King has written another book about....well, it's hard to know what this book IS about. Much time is spent on uninteresting genealogical speculation and travelogues and nearly no time on the Holmes/Russell releationship, the only reason why I was reading this book in the first place.In fact, it is not clear why Holmes is included in this volume at all. He has little to do. As usual in this sort of pastiche, he receives a knock upon the head that removes him from the action for the greater part of the story. Some of King's other character descriptions are risible-- yet none of them come to life at any time. At times it would seem that her glimpse of life in the '20s' on an aristocratic estate comes more from movies than from actual research.This is a tired pastiche. Read a PG Wodehouse story instead if you want to know about aristocrats in the '20s'. I won't be wasting my time on any other books in this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Worth the Read Even if Not the Best in the Series","review":"While there isn't much of a mystery here - and there are no plot twists - the writing is amazing. King's phrasing is beautifully done and a delight to read. More than once, she made me smile and even laugh at loud so perfect is her cadence.If you haven't read the rest of the series, don't start with this outing rather start with \\"The Beekeeper's Apprentice,\\" the first in this series. You'll be hooked and will soon find yourself searching for a copy of \\"Justice Hall.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Married Mary","review":"I enjoyed Ms. King's latest Mary Russell book, although I think Mary herself is becoming boring.

What happened?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Justice Hall","review":"It was good being reacquainted with the characters.

Basically, this book is a continuation of a series but where I bought it, it didn't state that. Basically, Ali (a distant freind) shows up at there door and faints due to his terrible injuries he received when in a mob. They then follow him back to the middle east where they find he has a lot of problems to solve with the royalty of his family and has to find his brother, Mahmoud. They do a long search for him and get to go through the trenches of WWII and many other places and finally find him. This was a very disapointing ending and a disapointing book. I give it a 1 Star rating and don't advise it to anyone wanting to read a good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enticing","review":"Having read other books by Laurie King I was looking forward to this one.

The control of melodic line, lift, chordal technique, brilliance in ornamentation and fioriture - all of them are at the service of Chopin's conception, but come together with a sound that can only have been made by Rubinstein. Perhaps most moving is the first ballade; the grandeur of the main E major theme has never been brought out so compellingly, and the closing Gm section is nothing short of demonic. I've listened to this recording well over a thousand times, and have explored every other commercially-available recording of the ballades. Nothing quite compares. If I had only one piano record, perhaps even only one record of any kind, to choose for the proverbial desert island, this one would be it."},{"rating":"2","title":"10 stars !","review":"Chopin's Ballades, Scherzoes and 19 Nocturnes are the pinnacle of classical piano.

These two generations are very different with very different cultural identities and attitudes. Of course, Christianity is going to have a slightly different culture, but to be honest Christianity tends to react to culture instead of paving a new culture.The emerging movement is a non-movement, in that emergents do not agree to on one set of definitions or have a leader to represent them.

I was only a few minues into assembly when I realized there was no way the rack was going to sit level. I had joined just 4 pieces and could not set what I had put together flat on the floor. The problem is that the holes into which you pound the wooden connector pins were not evenly drilled. The main pieces are hexagonal and, in some cases the holes were centered on the flat surfaces of the hexagon, while in other cases they were near the angled edge. I decided to take what I had assembled apart and send it back before I got too far and couldn't put back in the bax.

The doll head is nice and attractive, but it's really more of an ornament to look at, since the doll can't be moved. It has no joints (well, the head turns from side to side and the arms move a little to allow a girl to put on Polly's Nail Polish (Water). The head on the doll is adorable, and I wish that someone at Mattel would take the head and put it on a 15 inch tall body with movable joints and plenty of posing action.

Moreover, for 21 dolloars this edition is an absolute bargain. I have never seen a complete Virgil for such an astounding price.

It is very fast paced; therefore not allowing for proper stretching. I have Bryan Kest's Power Yoga Vol. 1-3 tapes and they are great. But this video does not stand up to the others. The music and look of the video aren't very enjoyable either."},{"rating":"1","title":"not bad","review":"I liked this program for the most part. My wife and I tried it and it was pretty good, but I gotta say, that once we were used to Mark Blanchard's Progressive Power Yoga, this was just average in comparison. I think Bryan has a decent style and invigorating practice...good for a sweat, but for the core workout and the mental space that I am used to going to, I did not find this to be the best ticket to the experience. He kept taking my attention away from the workout and that felt annoying. My wife did not have that experience, but she can even tune me out when she wants to...and she has been doing yoga much longer than I have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good","review":"I've watched Alias seince it came out.

I've gotten several of my friends to watch the show and am on a mission to keep this show on T.V for as long as possible. The first season should be released as soon as possible because for one I must have it and I am sure the shows popularity will grow as it did for 24 which is no where near as cool as Alias. This show has all the elements of greatness and needs to be a T.V must watch so lets put it on Dvd already."},{"rating":"2","title":"Saving the world one great outfit at a time","review":"What do you get when you combine a gifted writer frustrated with coming up with new teenage angst with an actress who had a small but pivotal role in the first season of his show? You get a hit show from J.J. Abrams featuring Jennifer Garner.It took me a bit to warm up to this show (being the hard-nosed Femme Nikita that I am), but after catching a marathon run of the first few episodes, I was hooked. Add to that the fact that one of the cast members is the excellent Victor Garber and another the magnificent Michael Vartan. Drama, action, exotic locations and actors who can act!Buy this DVD, but please watch the show as well on ABC. Even though Alias has legions of fans, new ones are always welcome. Ignore the rumors that state the show is too *difficult* or *involved* to watch without having seen every previous episode. The writing is quick, intelligent and often self-explanatory."},{"rating":"2","title":"great first season","review":"The first episode grabs you and keeps you hooked for the rest of the season. \\"Alias\\" was at times an uneven show, but the first season is action-packed and exciting and definitely worth watching!"},{"rating":"2","title":"ALIAS DVD WILL be in WIDESCREEN","review":"From TVTShowsOnDVD:ALIAS - Fullscreen or Widescreen? - 4:11 PM 4/02/2003Over the past week or so, DVD forums have been buzzing with the information that Alias will be released in fullscreen even though the show is broadcast in widescreen on ABC's HDTV feed. Not wanting to spread false information about the release, we contacted someone at Buena Vista Home Entertainment and asked what the aspect ratio for the release would be.

I had to go out and buy the second and third season. It is crazy, I work full time and have a two year old but I am completely addicted!!!!I agree with the reviewer that said that it is like a long drawn out movie.

I can like over the top cliff hanging tv series with a little extra cheese on top, but I actually found myself gritting my teeth or fast forwarding through dragging reflective pop emo song montages that occur more than once in each episode. I learned after 3 or so episodes that the formulaic script writing is akin to law and order's 4th spin off. (normal grad student life scenes>extreme double secret agent missions>near capture> too love or not to love my dad; repeat. There are too many gaping holes in the story for me to overlook and I have no problem suspending disbelief when artistically led that way.

I quit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Watch!","review":"If you're not watching this show, start watching it immediately. JJ Abrahms is utterly brilliant in his ability to bring a show together.

When I ordered this, I couldn't figure out why the price was so low. The packaging is much smaller and simpler, with all discs inside of a case barely larger than a standard DVD case. They are arranged in a similar fashion to some of the Full House DVD's, where the discs lay on top of each other, slightly overlapping. I believe the first season of House does this as well.So, if you don't really care about having extensive packaging such as the 24 box sets, you can't go wrong with this for the price. The show is wonderful, and I'm glad that I'll be able to add them all to my collection at this price. (Also posted this review for season 2, since the packaging is identical.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Please put Alias on DVD","review":"Alias is one of the best new shows on the tube.

I now have half of season 2 on VHS and all of season 1 and am in the process of addicting as many people as possible with my VHS tapes. But they are getting worn out! We need the DVD's! THis is a wonderful show that many people are comparing to 24 and La Femme Nikita. But it has much more than both of those shows. It has more characterization than 24 and has a greater scope of vision than La Femme Nikita, with more hope and twists, and surprises than any other show on air. With great actors and actresses such as Victor Garber, Jennifer Garber, Lena Olin (this season), Ron Rifkin, Kevin Weisman, and I can just go on. In essence, this show will grab you, wrench your heart, then throw you in the deep end of a mystery.

The girl is as smooth as a robot in her role as a spy. There is zero chemistry between the characters. Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's with the lame formatting?","review":"It is a cool show, and the emotional tension between Sidney and Vaugh along with Sidney's countermissions made season 1 the best so far. It does have a pretty cool style of its own (obviously borrowing from La Femme Nikita--film and TV, Run Lola Run--ok maybe just the red hair used in the first [Alias] episode, Buffy, etc.) which would grant it 3 to 4 stars, but, having watched it in HD most of the time, I must say to not even doing a widescreen transfer is rather pathetic (even Smallville will have that, and 24, which is not broadcast in HD gives the full widescreen picture too), you've got to hope they at least include the Dolby Digital soundtrack. A rental, but, certianly not to buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh no..after all this wait!","review":"Online announcements of this long-awaited and eagerly anticipated set seem to be in agreement that we are going to get a full screen only transfer.I believe the series was filmed in HD and here in the UK terrestrial showings have been in widescreen which adds so much to the SKY satellite showings. It's a great improvement to see them W/S and there's no excuse for a lazy 4:3 transfer.I will NOT be purchasing this set if it does indeed appear fullscreen. I'll wait and see if there's enough fan anger so that they change their plans and produce it W/S or if the R2 (UK) release is W/S.What a disappointment after all this wait :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"no hi-def transfer...boo!","review":"I read that this won't be formatted for widescreen, and will be put into a full frame mode, despite being broadcast in widescreen on ABC.

The very first episode was amazing, the characters are strong, the situations are complex and interesting and the fighting is great (though if I see one more person rebound from a sharp kick to the head, those kicks hurt, you wouldn't just bounce back!)However 12 episodes in, and she is just a bit too perfect for me. All those languages, all those skills, and she's never killed anyone... I like some of the more outre scenarios, but I am not as gripped as I had hoped I would be.

But now, my wife and I can watch one tense, dramatic, action-packed episode after another....What fun.I have heard that Season 3 is really extraordinary - can't wait.This series is well done, fraught with peril and suspense. How long can our gal maintain the perilous tightrope of being a double agent? How long can SD6 survive? Is the CIA and her Dad really on top of all of this?We are now waiting for the next episode to arrive from Netflix. Too bad I have to work next week."},{"rating":"2","title":"ALIAS is the best television show EVER made so far","review":"Alias is in my opinion, the best television show ever made so far. I usually don't have the time to write these comments, but I had to make an exception when I found out that ALIAS is not available on DVD as yet... It is smart, exciting, innovative, riveting and action packed while not being too over-the-top and unrealistic. I (and many of my friends) would LOVE to see a DVD collection made with cool extras, behind the scenes footage, commentary from J.J. Abrams. I would definitely buy one for myself and some for gifts. If the DVD was created to a similar innovative standard as the show, it would sell hundreds of thousands of copies world-wide. J.J.

Great story line! There are a few cheesy parts, but no more cheesy than any of the 007 movies. If you just let her be an unbelievably great secret agent who rarely gets hurt, you'll love the adventures this show takes you on."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the most consistent seasons I've seen","review":"I started watching the show regularly during the 3rd season. By then the show was more inconsistent but it still was good enough for me to go back and watch past seasons. The 1st season is the best by far. There is a sense of fun even among the tragedy that Syndey faces. The character of Will worked better when he was an outsider on the verge of finding out the truth. Too bad they couldn't sustain that intensity and Will was forced out of the show. Anyway there aren't many shows like Alias now so the dvd set will keep you entertained."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Cliff Hanger of a Series","review":"First, a personal note. I HATE commercial TV. I resent mindless adverising interrupting a good story, so 90% of what I watch is movies on DVD. So my younger son kept telling me how great this series was, and I kept telling him, \\"Yeah, Yeah, yeah!\\", when I realized that for my very intelligent son to be high on a program, it HAD to be good.Then he tells me that season one is on DVD, and I see a \\"win-win\\" situation. And it is!!All of the praise that other reviewers pile on this series is justified. EVERYTHING, from script quality to acting to special effects is just first rate. Even the price is good, considering that it contains 6 DVDs, each with 4 separate episodes.So I recommed it without reservations, except that season two is even better ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impossibly good television","review":"Alias is an amazing labyrinth of a television show: overwrought, spellbinding, stunning, moving, engaging, puzzling, impenetrable, and, oh yeah, human. Sydney Bristow is easy to root for, but for me it's her father Jack Bristow that is somehow the heart of the story: so damaged, so interior, so pressured, it's a wonderful pleasure just to watch Garber's masterfully understated performance. His impassive, nearly blank facade hides deep emotion: hurt, fear, and love for his daughter. Even Arvin Sloane, a truly evil, sometimes creepy, man, is consumed by love for his dying wife. And Sydney, well, she's the star and deservedly: gorgeous, bright, perfect for the role. Wonderful stuff. This is better than most movies because of the sheer amount of time available in a television season to develop plotlines, characters, ideas. Whatever you pay for this set isn't enough. Amazing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good potential, but wasted","review":"The show is certainly exciting, but there are so many inconsistencies in it (plot, characters, etc), so many mistakes, etc. that it really spoils the enjoyment. Some of the plots only work because they assume total stupidity on the parts of people (that otherwise are supposed to be smart) that watching becomes frustrating and annoying. The series would have worked much better if someone had taken the trouble of doing some reality-testing on it (nothing too complex, but would a security-conscious company keep its security codes the same for more than 8 years?!) - such things keep happening. Good raw material, but wasted because of a lack of attention to detail. There are many far better shows available."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why waste your tme...?","review":"I like JG (though not in this) and the acting is good overall, production values the same but just tired story lines and too many holes.

The main one is the hideous wigs she dons for just about every mission. The colors and styles are just SO atrocious. Aren't spies most effective when they are able to fly under the radar? Next? Jennifer Garners exaggerated posture. She throws her shoulders so far back when she walks, that I keep expecting her to tip over!! These things just take me completely out of the action."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok, but lacks something","review":"I started watching this show since it was on latenight TV and I've been trying to appreciate it - but with no luck. Something about this show is not quite right. The \\"feel\\" of the show is too disjointed and the characters are incredibly bland and lacking in any personality. The lead (Jennifer Garner) has no real redeeming features and lacks any believability in her role. I also feel that the direction of this show is poor - the haphazard away the camera moves to the time shifting of scenes is ludicrous and creates a sense of frustration for the viewer. I know many viewers here enjoy this show but I feel it's nowhere near as good as quality shows like Millennium and certain X-files seasons (3 & 4 mainly)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Langue anglaise seulement","review":"Je regarde la s��rie au canal Z et ce, en franais depuis 1 an ...

Jennifer Garner, while attractive, has the emotional depth of a cabbage and the interaction between characters was non-existent. Where LFN was dark, edgy and full of questions, Alias was warm and fluffy, concerning itself with making Sydney look good every episode.

The subplots were filler and the drama didn't gel. ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"ASTOUNDINGLY AWFUL!!!","review":"This has got to be one of the most cliche shows I've ever seen. The plot has been done before and Alias makes a mockery of this once extraordinary plot. Jennifer Garner is a very blase actress. She speaks in a monotone and her acting techniques seem very forced. Not to mention the fact that she's too plain-looking to even be starring as a lead in any show. She belongs in character roles, or better yet off the acting stage completely. Her movements are very robotic, forced, and unprofessional. This was once an interesting and provocative plot, but has now been butchered and virtually destroyed by the Alias cast and crew.

The show about the beautiful undercover agent Sidney Bristow will be appreciated by both fans of action (because of the great special effects) drama (it packs an emotional wallop) and suspense (the cliffhangers will keep you watching this 6-DVD set hours past your bedtime).The story revolves around the young secret agent who works for a covert branch of the CIA called SD-6 and is about to have her world turned upside down when she finds out secrets about the people she works for, her past and her estranged father. One of the main reasons this show works flawlessly is its actors. Jennifer Garner is unbelievably convincing and good in the role of Sidney, Victor Garber (a Broadway Tony nominee) plays her father most credibly and there is even an episode dedicated to Mr. Quentin Tarantino! All in all, a great show with amazing plot twists, cliff-hangers and all your usual and unusual spy stuff!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Addictive","review":"I only got into Alias in season 2.

As a newcomer to Tapestry, it provided me with a solid foundation of the underpinings of the framework. The explanations, at times, go into so much detail that it occasionally becomes difficult to see the forest for the trees. But if you're truly interested in how things work, you'll appreciate the detail.

For instance, OGNL is havily used by tapestry, but the author does not even bother to spend a little time explaining how it's been used by tapestry. I was left with a lot more questions on tapestry after reading this book. This book only serves as an introduction to tapestry and lacks full coverage. If you buy this book, you will have to spend a lot of time researching the net to find answers to basic question that (I think) should have been addressed by the book.

The author does a great job of hiding most documentation from the website so that the only realistic way to use his open source framework is to buy his book. He keeps the forums from being useful by changing the api with each release of tapestry. Even minor version changes aren't always compatible. Its the same with the books. I tried following along with this book using the \\"stable\\" 4.xx release of tapestry and I had to give up the book. I think this book was written for version 3, and version 5 is totally different."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very dense and clear","review":"I am learning Tapestry to use it in a project. True the learning curve is high, but with this book you not only learned how to use Tapestry but also the why's and how's behind its design. Chapter 7 (under the hood) and 10 (Implementing a sample application) are particularly good. In all a very dense and clear book suitable for intermediate to advanced readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ant Script of Book Samples overwrites Tomcat server.xml","review":"The build script from the downloaded samples would carelessly overwrite your tomcat server.xml file.According to the comments found in the build.xml file of the \\"examples\\" app it was intended to \\"Copy into place a patched version of server.xml that doesn't contain special configuration for the /examples webapp context\\".The code author seems to be unaware of the need to preserve changes that people have made to their own copies of server.xml files. And I don't understand why the code author had to use the context name \\"examples\\" to introduce such unncessary complication for people who just casually download the samples to try out.So the deployment screwed up my tomcat server and overwrote many modifications I made in my server.xml file for various purposes such as enabling SSL.The book content is overall good. So I still give it 4 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what we needed!","review":"We bought this book hoping to get both some useful specific ideas and general good perspective on decorating our new home.

Well done!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stunning grasp of the obvious","review":"This book displays a stunning grasp of the obvious. Beyond its plans for some not very interesting do-it-yourself projects, it offers little--trite advice like \\"Spending time alone with yourself is an important feature of reflection\\" accompanied by an unsatisfying collection of photos. Books like The Japanese House, Simply Zen, and Japanese Style do a much better job of presenting the Zen aesthetic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay but not great","review":"The book seems marginal and the photos are very disappointing as far as samples and examples of how to incorporate a more zen design in ones home.

Some are going on 5 years + and the batteries have never been changed. The range and clarity are AWESOME. They are simple to use. Three times they've been completely submerged in water and after drying have worked like new.If you get the 6 unit multi charger just make sure to get Radio Shack's \\"Precision Electronics Cleaner\\" and clean the base and walkie contacts occasionally.Weakest link are the earpieces which work for only about 2 years, maybe more.Only bad thing about the walkies is a lag of about one second after you push the talk button so the first second of a transmission is always cut off. Solution is to just hold the button for one second and then talk.March 2012: About 4 of my 12 walkies are now 6 1/2 years old and still going strong!

The chargers do not connect well to the walkie talkie. After months of use it is hard to get a good connection when we put the walkie in the charger. We either get a blinking red light, orange light or green light instead of a solid red light which causes the machine to discharge. We also have found that they wear out with less then six months of usage. Two years ago we purchased 7 of them and in February of this year we purchased 4 more. Now we only have six that operate out of the 12 and we are starting to have trouble with some of the remaining ones. We also find that some of them do not last for more then an eight hour period after six months and they are suppose to last 12 hours.

It seems to be a good introductory book to this subject. Six months after I listened to the audiobook, I am still using some of the techniques described by the author. There is also some good background information concerning general health and keeping the brain fed and \\"exercised\\".In reference to the comments by other reviewers concerning redundancy, I don't remember getting the impression of too much repetition when I listened to it. In fact, I remember that repetition is a key to memorization. (Maybe the author was repetitive on purpose!)I would recommend this book to anyone looking to improve their memory skills, or anyone interested in learning a bit about how memory works in the brain, and how to make it work a bit better."},{"rating":"1","title":"it is a very simple book","review":"I was quite disappointed with this book. i thought there are some trick or technique to improve memory. but in fact it is more about common sense stuff. which i already know. and you wonder where the author does his research about the knowledge he gathers.anyway. i gather if his advice is eat well, be active. then why bother reading this book ?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A truly Christian movie","review":"This motion picture is a wonderful testimony to God and his faithfulness, though circumstances are thin and sometimes misunderstood. The bad guys get punished (yes so I am giving away some of the end) and real life is portrayed, there is none of the fake Hollywood stuff incorporated. All in all it is an excellent film, holds true to Christian values, there is none of the language, sex, or violence associated with today's media. I would recommend this film!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing...","review":"Was hoping to find a nice Christian movie to watch with my husband...I picked the wrong one.

Even if you don't follow the chant lines (they're there if you want to use them, but you don't have to of course), the accent marks make it easy to to place the emphasis on the proper words and enjoy the pace of the chant. A truly wonderful addition to your private or communal prayers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs special ring","review":"I was personally disappointed with the book, mainly because it requires a special ring to perform most exercises. It didn't mention where you may purchase one either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disco George","review":"The photo on the inside cover of George wearing a disco leisure suit is amusing. But what the heck--it was the late '70s and the height of disco. That's not to say this album is anything like disco, even though there's a smattering of disco beat here and there. Regardless, this album has some great tunes. Many of the best tracks follow George's formula of stating the theme or his own interpretation of a popular tune and then launching into a masterful jam solo before coming back to the main theme. Most of my favorites are the instrumentals, especially \\"Livin' Inside Your Love,\\" \\"Nassau Day,\\" \\"Soulful Strut,\\" \\"Prelude to Fall,\\" and more. On the other hand, \\"Love Ballad\\" and \\"A Change is Gonna Come\\" are great vocal performances by George. This album was a good follow up to \\"Breezin',\\" even if not in the same \\"classic\\" category as \\"Breezin'\\" (the disco suit ruined the chance of gaining that honor). Then again, there's a bit more material on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like Benson, this is a classic","review":"This was originally released as a two album set. This is the last of what I consider the \\"old\\" Benson, much in the genre of \\"Breezin'\\". Especially notable is his rendition of \\"Unchained Melody\\". Although I do enjoy his forays into more of a popular music style, this is among his best efforts. A must have for any serious jazz collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely dry book","review":"This book makes the Mojave look positively flush with water. Mr. Wasserstein addresses a fascinating topic--mergers and acquistions--with all the passion of a mortician.Why the five stars? Mr. Wasserstein also happens to be a brilliant attorney, and have a remarkably substantive body of knowledge about innumerable large acquistions that have occurred over the past thirty years. Indeed, in his bibliography, he writes: \\"Much of the contemporary factual material in this book is drawn from memory.\\" That is an especially impressive statement, given that the book weighs in at over 900 pages.Read the book if only to be impressed at the mind of such a man.Interesting side note: Mr. Wasserstein's sister is a Pulitzer-prize-winning playwright, Wendy Wasserstein. Her plays evince a passion utterly lacking in _Big Deal_."},{"rating":"2","title":"Effective summary of high profile M&A activity and history","review":"The author has an awesome task in summarizing dynamics and history of M&A Activity. Books can be (and have) written on indiudual deals. As a result this book serves more like a compendium of M&A activity and its history with a few insights into the back door drama and mechanics employed in high profile M&A's. Although a touch on the dry side, it gives a flavor of some of the intricacies involved in some of the high profile M&A deals. Interesting reading and doesn't have to be read from start to finish i.e you can skip around to deals that pique your interest."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Veritable Bible for Bankers","review":"You will see this book and wonder how'll you finish an 800 pager like it in a reasonable ammount of time.No worry -- this Bible of M&A; is an engaging, informative read that will go by faster than you ever imagined.I find myself recommending this book at least 3 or 4 X a year for people who want an overview of M&A; in the late 20th century.Instead of just spilling a bunch of historical data on the reader, Wasserstein dissects deals and tells us why things happened as they did.My favorite part: the disastrous Quaker/Snapple merger!Trust me, you'll love this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Resource for a Narrow Audience","review":"This book is not a resource offering new insights and techniques for professionals, or a fast-reading introduction for casual observers. Rather, Wasserstein provides a clear and interesting history of M&A for an audience with an interest strong enough to carry them through hundreds of pages. An excellent resource for young executives and students new to the game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Classroom Lecture","review":"In reading Big Deal by Bruce Wasserstein, I was hoping to get true inside information from someone who professes to be a big player in the merger and acquisitions market. The first two parts of the book, however, felt more like I was reading a text on the history of mergers in corporate America.Mr. Wasserstein does get around to discussing the strategy involved in doing a deal and also in defending against one in the third part. The impact of this is diluted though due to Mr. Wasserstein's use of glossary definitions to define the terms that he uses.The profiles throughout the book are a nice touch. Big Deal would have been more of a good read if it had focused more on these profile cases and people as opposed to the classroom lecture attitude that was adopted."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of time","review":"One insight, one idea, one well written story would have made this book worthwhile. Instead it was the biggest stinker I have ever read. Why did he write this? If you live in the world of business this book is a rehashing of ancient history. If you don't, this book isn't clear enough to explain anything.Skip this book. watch Traders on the lifetime network.

They are strong and withstand rough handling."},{"rating":"2","title":"James and Justification","review":"David Scaer does a superb job of describing the Christocentric character of the catholic epistle of St. James. He demonstrates that St. James is not a preacher of works-righteousness, or a creator of an 'epistle of straw', but a faithful witness of Christ's life, death, and resurrection, and a firm confessor of the doctrine of justification by grace, through faith, for Christ's sake, apart from the works of the law."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well written and organized, quite useful","review":"This sourcebook manages to contain not only a timeline of important events in history your players can screw up beyond recognizable states, but a list of various phenomena that can help them muddle in time, various ships, organizations, and other things.

An inspiring read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Samuel Abt is the best!","review":"I knew before I opened this book that I would like it as it is nothing more than a collection of many of his coverage articles over the years with the International Herald Tribune. I appreciate his candidness in sharing his early feelings on Bicycle Racing, and how his wife is responsible for getting him involved. That was a nudge that has given me years of pleasure reading his articles when they make it into The New York Times.

Power yoga isn't a simple physical exercise- and this is the way Brian sees it, or at least this is what his video presents. It's not all about building muscles in every single part of our body; if this is what yoga is then why don't we all work out at our local gym instead. Yoga is all about physical and above all spiritual equininity. In order to get in touch with our inner part and feelings yoga should be practiced in a relaxing place with an instructor who can make his students relax and LET GO, not tense throughout the practice! Brian Kert isn't a professional yogee, he is instead a common trainer for body building and working out with the only difference that he uses some yoga poses instead!!!!
