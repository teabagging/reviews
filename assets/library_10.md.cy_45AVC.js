I followed the directions on the bottle, which stated that I was to put the product on towel damp hair. They recommend that you use gloves, which they do not provide. The product splattered all over my bathroom and all over me. I finished the rinse as per the instructions, and attempted to dry my hair. The product made it extremely difficult to dry my hair, resulting in tangles and knots. Also, Fanci-full advertises that you can \\"try a new hair color for a day\\". Well, the color I ended up with was anything but black. It dyed my light brown hair a slightly darker brown, and gave me absolutely awful texture. I DO NOT recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice features but poor quality","review":"Even though the box clearly states that this 2.4Ghz phone is \\"802.11 Friendly\\", I seem to get interface on this phone anywhere in my home. This is the first 2.4Ghz phone that I've had this problem with. There is no option to switch channels (DSS). There is a constant buzz on the line.Another absolutely irritating thing is that fact that the dialpad is soo slow and will often miss a number when you dial it in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seems great--but...","review":"I was really pleased with the base/speaker phone when I purchased the original unit. Usually people cannot tell when I am on the handset or the base speakerphone because of the excellent sound quality. But the reason we purchased this unit was to be able to add additional handsets. The sound quality from the second handset is extremely poor. Moreover, sometimes when both handsets are in use that seems to cause both handsets to lose contact with the base and the call is lost.I don't want any special features on my phone, other than multiple handsets. This phone seems to have a lot of neat futures. If I had designed this, however, I would have dropped some of the features and designed a system which allows the person with whom you are talking to actually understand what you are saying. Maybe you need to buy a more expensive model to get that particular feature."},{"rating":"1","title":"I REALLY hate this phone","review":"I got it for my home office because I really needed a dual-keypad speakerphone. The instructions warn not to put it near electronic equipment and they weren't kidding! First of all, very few real perks to this phone. I like performing all my options from the base, and this simply isn't the phone for that. To use the speed dial, you HAVE TO use the handset speakerphone, which is horribly low in volume (and static-y next to my computer). The base speakerphone is not a whole lot better when it comes to clarity of sound. All things considered, I guess it's worth the $70, but I'm giving it to my teenager because she REALLY wants a speakerphone and won't know the difference. Boo-hiss for this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crappy Phone","review":"I had the phone for 2 weeks and it quit charging.

I thought maybe I just got a bad phone, so I took it back to the store and exchanged. Wouldn't you know, the next one did the same thing.There is also a constant low buzzing on the line, which I've never had on my other phones. Also, when you place a number in memory, it only saves to that particular handset, not to any others. My dad's 5.8 GHz Vtech saves the memory numbers to all the expandable handsets.If I had to do it again, I would not have bought this phone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Phone, nice features. Better than Seimens","review":"This is an above average phone systems with many features of phones twice as much $. It has good sound quality and an extended range feature that improves communications over larger distances than standard 2.4GHz phones. It performs much beter than the Seimens 2415&2400 system that it is replacing. I was actually quite surprised to see a high level of build quality and function in a VTech phone system this cheap. 5.8GHz is not worth the bump in price when this phone performs this well in the city."},{"rating":"1","title":"3 V-Tech phones and all were garbage!","review":"Third time is the charm. I have had 3 different models of VTech phones and all of them have died within a year - year and a half of purchase. I refuse to try replacing the battery as past experience has taught me this will not work. The first one was the 'expensive' model and I decreased from there so, regardless of the cost VTech is just garbage as far as I am concerned. Seems like modern technology is more about repeat purchase than good quality!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Big title, little content","review":"This is a fast read, but that's not a positive review for a book that is tackling a pretty heavy topic. It comes across as the writer's ramblings on his own path to starting his own business. He never actually guides you through any process that's going to lead to a greater awareness or understanding of your own at the end. He doesn't even explain his own process with enough detail to glean anything by observation. The hard part about what he describes is not going out a starting a business, but rather discovering what type of business is a good match for who you really are, what your talents are. He completely leaves that process of self-discovery a mystery, besides a passing reference to therapy. It was worth the hour I spent with it, just to get my mind thinking about some points he raises, but I would not suggest buying this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"silly fairy tale","review":"This book was ridiculous and was nothing but a silly fairy tale. Right from the start, the story lacked any shred of realism. For example, Princess Rowena (who is in London) receives a letter from Matthew asking her to meet him in Scotland. When she arrives there, she is told that Matthew has sent word that he had an accident in Sweden and has a broken leg. He \\"sends his deepest regrets that he cannot meet with you.\\"In 1662, in would have been impossible for the news of the accident to reach Scotland before the Princess' arrival. Only in a fairy tale would this be possible.In addition, the story has no historical significance. It was set in Scotland, in an old castle, in 1662. That's it, nothing else. Within the story there is no connection to anything historical. Also, the pirate and his crew are completely out of place in the old castle. I did not find this funny at all. I found it to be completely absurd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would have been better if labeled a fantasy","review":"This book is absurd. I found a few historical flaws in the little history it had in it. This book is one of the reasons romance will never be respected. It tries to be humorous where it is inappropriate. It is obvious she couldn't be bothered to do any historical research, and the hero was one dimensional and in no way seemed realistic. I am supposed to believe that gentle man was once a ruthless pirate? I don't think so. Now that I think of it, this book wouldn't work as a fantasy either because fantasy books have more depth than this shallow romance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vapid and depressing","review":"This whole thing and its predecessors are mighty depressing. Sometime in the 1960's short story writing slipped out of the hands of adults who had actually gone out in the world and held jobs and had families and thus had something to write about, and into the hands of graduate students. These workshop set pieces are dreadful and depressing and have little or nothing to do with the South, The exceptions -- Ellen Douglas stands out -- are too few and far between to make these books worthwhile. Stock up on Lewis Grizzard or Jeff Foxworthy instead and buy John Cheever's Collected Stories if you really want to see how it's done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grace-Based Parenting","review":"Wow! This is the book I wish I'd had many years ago, before I wore myself out with \\"formulas\\" for parenting. Mary DeMuth writes with authenticity and sensitivity. Whether you came from a family of origin of abuse and neglect, or simply don't want to repeat some of the milder dsyfunctions of your past, this book is a valuable resource on issues of faith, forgiveness, mentors, boundaries,and overcoming fears. Every parent who wants to blaze a new trail needs this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"not practical enough","review":"This book wasn't quite what I was looking for. I didn't grow up in a Christian home. So (since I didn't have a model during my own childhood) I wanted to know how to introduce my own kids to faith at home. I was really looking for more of a \\"how to\\" guide than this book provided. Plus, unlike the author's, my childhood was great! I grew up in a stable and supportive environment. The only thing lacking was exposure to Christianity. So, since I didn't come from a bad or dysfunctional home, I had a hard time relating to the author's own struggles. Plus, I am reluctant to discount many of the values I learned as a kid. Rather I was hoping for ways to add to them as a Christian. I didn't find enough \\"practical\\" advice in this Practical Guide. Maybe I was looking for more of a snapshot, or \\"day in the life of a christian family\\" kind of book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Title piqued your curiosity?","review":"If you are reading this review, you have been sucked in by the title, probably because you somehow relate. If so, then the topic is of huge significance to you. The book is solid, and the content reflects the title.Regardless of your background, if you have a Christian faith and desire to live out that faith with your children, then bring your highlighter and keep notes as you read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A gripping read full of wisdom and encouragement","review":"Mary E. Demuth weaves gripping stories with practical advice in this wise, encouraging and heartfelt book. Mary is a tremendous storyteller and boy does she have a story to tell. Instead of sitting high on a podium dispensing advice, Mary comes alongside the reader like a guide in the woods who knows how to hack her way through confusion with a machete. For anyone who has been wounded by imperfect parents, or any young parent who fears she or he may be too wounded to be anything but a bad example as mom or dad a themselves, I can't recommend this book highly enough. Mary is not afraid to be transparent, and it's that willingness to expose her weaknesses and hardwon lessons that she witnesses to the power of God in Jesus Christ. This is a powerful, beautifully-written book.Deborah Gyapongwww.deborahgyapong.com"},{"rating":"2","title":"For anyone with parents","review":"Building The Christian Family You Never Had is a must read for every couple contemplating having children, every parent who has children, and every adult who found life with their parents difficult or confusing. Not have the right role model can be frustrating--even confusing.

I am anxious for the next two installments to come out over the next two years. This would make a great TV series on the Sci-Fi Channel! I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Magic Time","review":"This book is initially exciting, perhaps buoyed by Hambly's writing skill. But it quickly becomes a sort of cut-rate, bad comic book cross between Stephen King's The Stand and Sean Stewart's Galveston. Something happens -- we don't get the intellectual satisfaction of learning exactly what -- in a top secret government research facility. Technology stops working, and some people metamorphose. Two foci of presumably destructive power appear -- a rather confusing plot point -- and our questing band of heroes must tackle the first one.There are too many characters for the modest length of the book, and most are not well drawn. The cliched imagery verges on the ridiculous. It really is a comic book -- one person appears to be changing into Catwoman. The plot is fast-moving but shallow and unbelievable. While the basic idea is an interesting one, the book never gets off the ground. It comes across as imitative, lacking themes of its own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Comments on \\"Magic Time\\"","review":"I am long time fan of Hambly, but cannot recommend this book. One of Hambly's great strengths is her character development skills. I feel that they were stifled here. The characters in this novel are at best two dimensional. Perhaps this is due to the fact that she was working with a writer whose credits mainly include television scripts.The pace of the book is choppy and lacks the detailed scenes and backdrops that are the hallmark of Hambly's work.Read any of Hambly's fantasy novels or any of the awesome Benjamin January series for a true representation of what Barbara Hambly is all about.Hopefully she will avoid any further work with her writing partner for \\"Magic Time\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"entertaining read","review":"I really enjoyed this book, but it had one problem -- it was too short! I loved the characters and the story itself made me laugh in parts. Mr. Zicree knows what he's doing when it comes to screenplays and this one seems made for the big screen. The problem stated above still stands however. The book ends with a vague ending. I suppose that it's setting up for the next book in the series.Pick it up!

It is very straightforward in telling you what you REALISTICALLY need to do (and pointing out the pitfalls that you can easily fall into) and making the process of starting out easy and doable. I've had my own freelance business now for a little over a year and I consistently refer to this book for the little questions that pop up now and then.His suggestion about approaching the difficult task of estimating-- never do it on the spot if you can avoid it-- and his consistent reminders that this fun and creative career choice is first and foremost a BUSINESS with the primary goal of generating income, have helped me tremendously."},{"rating":"1","title":"Remember How Bowerman REALLY Makes His Money","review":"I have read the book. I agree with the reviews posted here regarding Bowerman's advice on organizing your work, etc. However, few authors who write books such as this one care to substantiate the amount of money they made as freelancers *prior* to publishing a \\"how to\\" book. I know writers who have tried to cold-calling and other self promotional advice in this book, and they have categorically met with minimal success. I agree with the other reviewers here that mentoring and networking with existing professional connections will get a writer further than the cold-calling and marketing Bowerman suggests."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Listen to the Negative Drivel...","review":"I am a successful copywriter. I was successful even before I bought and read Peter's book. But I'm glad I bought it, and I'll read it again when time permits. I is VERY informative, and a superb buy for anyone new to the writing game.May I suggest that anyone saying that The Well-Fed Writer does not give a writer great information and provide a solid resource is probably not up to it. That's nothing to be ashamed of, because we're not all cut out to be writers, but it is a shame to knock an excellent book just because you're feeling bitter about the writing profession.If you need a handbook to get you started at freelance writing, then I highly recommend this, and its sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just OK","review":"Bowerman uses a light, easy-to-read style to outline the common sense actions all aspiring freelancers must undertake to \\"break in\\". He describes a business system, which is good. He tells how to take an organized approach, which is good. And he covers a lot, from netting clients to handling contracts to scheduling to sharpening your pencil. What I take great exception to, however, is a myth that Bowerman carelessly and willingly perpetuates: that the writer's life is easy.I understand why he does -- by making earning a living as a freelancer seem easy while providing a comprehensive guide to joining this carefree life, he sells books. But freelancing is not easy. It's hard, and demands determination, talent, and luck.Read Bowerman's book because it's a decent guide on how to become a freelancer. But don't get suckered by his proclaimed life of leisure. There is more to it than Bowerman either understands or acknowledges."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"This book is not the hype it was made out to be. First, it was mostly repetitive stories about how great Mr. Bowerman's life is. That's great for him but it gets old after the first 50 pages-- I was so bored reading this! There was a lot of \\"you can do it!\\" but not a whole lot of how to actually do it. Also, I thought he'd talk more about other types of freelance writing-- not just marketing writing.

A Gem for Free Lance Writers","review":"The Well-Fed Writer, by Peter BowermanWhen I received The Well-Fed Writer for review, I expected a dry read - but Bowerman is entertaining, informative, and unlike many other how-to gurus, he actually gives the reader detailed information about how to achieve every step towards success, from how to set prices to how the approach clients.

I recommend this book for anyone who is wanting the independence of being your own boss while fulfilling your dream to write for a living.And, there's more.

The book occasionally has a self-published tone to it. Some of the phrases and presentation seem awkward, which would have been iorned out in a thorough editing process.

Supposedly it's about making a living as a commercial writer, but after a couple chapters going on about how great the job is and how lucrative it will be (which began to sound like an infomercial), we get to the meat of it. What the book covers is freelance copywriting for ad and marketing agencies. That's fine if you're an advertising and marketing copywriter, but I'm not. I'm a technical writer, and I thought this would teach me how to work it into an independent gig. There is exactly ONE PAGE about technical writing, and it didn't give me any new information. I wound up resenting having to spend that much money for one page of retread info. The book should have been titled \\"How to be a Successful Marketing Copywriter.\\" That might have been fair. But as far as I'm concerned, it was a waste of money. I'm exactly where I was before I bought the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Commercial Freelancing---The Mystery Evaporates","review":"Having been involved in freelancing and publishing for a number of years, I found Bowerman's book refreshingly different from the rest of the writer's \\"how-to\\" genre. Bowerman's book was easily the best book I have ever read on the subject of commmercial freelancing. The book is extremely practical; Bowerman does an outstanding job of leading the reader from the basics of the industry, to getting started, and finally to managing the daily routines of running the business.

And though it's machine made, this bread is heavenly, especially a fresh, hot slice slathered with real butter. I've found that when sealed in a gallon-size ZipLoc bag, a loaf will stay fresh for 5 or 6 days -- but it rarely lasts that long because it's soooooo good for peanut butter & jelly sandwiches. Why \\"nearly\\" perfect? Well, gluten is the \\"glue\\" that holds bread together and, when there is none, bread tends to crumble -- true for all gluten-free breads. Pamela's ingredients, however, keep the bread moist, and crumbling to a minimum. For another taste treat, I'd also highly recommend Pamela's wheat-free pancake mix."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pamela's GF bread mix","review":"Fabulous product, hearty and tasty.

I'm not a fan of those bean flours and this bread was much better than the others I have tried. At last a really delicious bread mix that tastes like real bread.

I've made, plain, cheese and cinnaman in my breadmaker and have enjoyed them all. I do have to hold myself back from slicing off the first warm piece and loading it with butter. Other then that I have NO complaints."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great : (","review":"This GF bread mix was not my favorite. I prefer GF Pantry. Pamelas was really dense and tasted like bisquits not white bread. GF Pantry had all the attributes of white bread, unlike Pamelas, first it was actually white, it's fluffy and it tastes like white bread. So anyway I will be buying GF Pantry from here on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Bread","review":"My daughter ordered 6 packages of Pamela's Bread for my birthday this year. It makes the best loaf of bread I've had in 6 years. The texture is wonderful, the taste great. Great for sandwiches, toast or just plain bread and butter with your meal. I think the bread is so good that I would highly reccomend it to everyone. In fact, my husband who is not a celiac, loves it too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than store bought!","review":"We have tried several gluten free packaged bread and bread mixes. All the packaged breads taste like cardboard-this mix actually has the consistency of sandwich bread. We use it for sandwiches and to make garlic bread when we have gluten free spaghetti(brush melted butter with garlic powder on one side at a time and brown in a frying pan)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I made two loves in my Zoji, and they both came out flat and wet (moist). Blah! I even cut back the water 1/2 cup and still the same. I used the basic settings on my machine. I followed Zoji directions and then Pamela's on the second loaf. If anyone out there has a Zoji and thier bread is coming out great, please respond back. I would love to know your secrets. I have 4 more times to try, and if they do no turn out, I will not be purchasing the product again."},{"rating":"2","title":"My son with autism loves this bread! Thank you, thank you!","review":"My son with AUTISM has been on the GFCF diet for 9 yrs now (he's 11). He loves this bread and pretty much won't eat others! It's easy to make and bake (by hand - I do not have a bread machine). I use Soy milk. It bakes perfect every time :) Just follow the directions. Slice when it's cool and freeze. It makes great sandwich bread and toast. The Sweet Bread recipe on the package is good, too. I haven't yet tried the other recipes but am sure of their success and great taste and texture as well. What's even better is Amazon's great price on the case of six! You simply can't beat it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutley the best!","review":"This bread mix is the absolutley best replacement for wheat flour bread we have found. It smells yummy baking and the taste and consistancy makes a delicious sandwich. It also makes great french toast. This works great in a bread machine, which makes it super easy to make. Every other bread we tried, gluten and wheat free, was dry and tasteless. Give this one a try. I don't think you will have to keep looking for a great gluten and wheat free bread. You've found the best!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pamala's Amazing bread mix","review":"I love this stuff! It makes great bread in the bread maker and is great for someone like me that also can not have dairy, as none is required. I have also tried the pie crust recipe on the package and liked it even better than the wheat crusts I have tasted in the past."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth every star!","review":"We absolutely love this bread here. I've made it as written, in my bread machine and then I've also made it eggless (with homemade powdered egg replacer). Both times came out perfect! My 4yo who has severe acid reflux plus food allergies (both make him very selective about what he eats) could eat a whole loaf of this bread by himself. He loves it toasted, with fresh homemade salted butter. It costs $5 per bag at the local Kroger where I live."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Good Sandwich","review":"One of the things I've missed on the gluten free diet is a good sandwich. Now I can have one as often as I feel like making bread. And it's pretty easy with this delicious mix.Thanks, Amazon, for providing these great bargains on my favorite mixes.Blessings, Judy"},{"rating":"2","title":"down to earth music","review":"This is the kind of music that reaches the soul.

We had an older Panasonic cordless with an answering machine that has always had the shortest battery life, but when it finally got down to about 10 minutes of use, we had to get another one. We brought this one home, plugged it in, and it seemed like everything would be great, until I made a call. I could NOT hear the person on the other end at all, and I had the sound turned all the way up. I switched to another phone in the house and the call was clear. I had had problems hearing them before, so when the phone rang still plugged in, I answered, it was another person, and I could not hear them either. I'm not sure why people said the ringer wasn't so great, I could hear it loud and clear (and shocking because I'd never heard it before). Now we have to take it back and try to find something that will work. We never even got to try out the answering machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst vtech to date....","review":"I have no clue what they were thinking with this one, but it's really bad. The base has a ringer that you can turn off if you need to. If you don't, you can't hear the phone ringing. If you have kids, hide this from them up high. If it happens to fall in a couch, you won't hear the ringing or the page to find it. The battery dies very quickly. I've had mine for a few months, and the battery life is dreadful. It's dead in less than an hour off of the charger without talktime. I could replace the battery, but would rather replace the whole phone for all of the flaws instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad","review":"This phone has lots of &quot;noise&quot; and the answering system it bad. Generally not easy to set up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Massive amounts of Line interference","review":"The quality of this phone was horrible! I don't know if it was just the one phone I picked up, but there was INCREDIBLE interference for the answering party if I strayed more than eight feet from the base set. If I went into another room in the house, the static got worse. The strange thing is, the caller can't hear the static, but the person on the other end hears tons of static. At first I thought it was the location where I had the base set, so I tried plugging the phone into three different locations in the house and still had the same problem. I even tried it in a friend's apartment and had the same problem. Good thing I saved the receipt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!","review":"I'm glad I am not crazy - I see that others have had the same problem we have had with this phone - I cannot hear the person speaking. I usually have to switch to one of our AT&T; handsets to complete a conversation. Forget about anyone on a headset. In addition, for some reason this phone intefers with our wireless router more than the other 2.4g phones we have - had to turn it off to get wireless back.We did not use the answering machine because we already have one on the AT&T2255;, but what would it matter if you cannot hear the person speaking? Maybe the answerer is better - but my mom needed a new cordless answerer, and I wouldn't even give her this one because I would have felt bad for dumping it on her."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE WORST PHONE EVER!","review":"This is the worst cordless phone I have ever had!

Regardless of which channel I switched to, the volume (not a static issue) actually got worse. I was very disapointed because I always have liked V-Tech phones I have gotten in the past but this is not one I would recommend!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Answering machine sucks","review":"This has one of the worst answering machine voice qualities I've heard for awhile. It's weird that after all these years of digital answering machines, most companies still can't produce a decent quality one.Also, the phone silver lining scratches easily, and the directory interface is just as bad as other vtechs. NOT recommended for anything other than looks."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't hear you!","review":"I have been looking for a decent cordless with answering system for my home office. The instructions for volume control on the handset aren't very clear, so after messing around with a headset and so on I finally figured it out. The volume on the handset can be adjusted only when the phone is on with the arrow keys. I had the phone for over a week and was ready to return it before I had figured this out. The Answering system is easy to use, and remote access is a breeze."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't hear you!","review":"I have been looking for a decent cordless with answering system for my home office. The handset volume is abysmal, I have to turn everything in the house off and the fan on my notebook is louder than the person I am speaking with on the phone.

I called the company to see if they could tell me the problem but they told me it died but they will replace it if I send it back with proof of purchase and I will receive a new phone within 7-14 days of them receiving my phone and figuring out what if anything is wrong with it . So, I am now out of phone for about 3 weeks or I could never buy V-tech ever again and purchase a new one. Oh, and the reception once I went to the backyard was crappy.

The Asian Journal is a poignant and tireless encampment with one of the remarkable men of letters of the 20th century. Colored throughout with Merton's search for a place of greater solitude (his dissatisfaction on many levels with the cheese factory his beloved Gethsemani abbey had become being well known for some time before his death) -the redwoods of California, possibly Alaska- as the journal progresses one begins to feel in his words a kind of prescient kinship with his own accidental death, occurring in Bangkok before he had completed his Asian pilgrimage. Worthy appendices - the characteristic sweetness of his informal talk on monasticism given at Calcutta, and his lecture on Marxism and Monastic Perspectives with its prophetic last sentence \\"So I will disappear\\".

It definitely sound better than ANYTHING that is under $50 MSRP, but do not go overboard and compare it with the logitech Z640's. It would provide enough \\"boom\\" and clarity for mostly everyone's listening.

I waited to write a review until I had actually used the tongs for some time. These tongs are the perfect length (not for grilling) and have held up well. They are short enough to toss a salad and then serve. Great for tossing noodles in a sauce and then serving. I've used them to flip chicken, steak, rolls, you name it and they've held up well. They also have a tab on the end so if you want to lock them in place you could. The spring for keeping them open has held up well over a year. I've also washed on the top rack in the dishwasher and the teflon coating is as good as new.I can't find anything negative about these tongs, the price is well worth it.

But that was all I could handle of the stilted dialogue, ripped off-story lines, and most of all, gratuitous sexual crap thrown in for no good reason at all.Most sci-fi movies require some suspension of belief and a little, if not a great deal, of viewer sympathy with the actors and the director's budgets but sometimes its a little too much.My thought to you sci-fi fans is to pass this one up and to move on to more sophisticated, better made pictures."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rip off or derivative work?","review":"We (my friends and I) counted no less than 10 seperate movies this 'movie' ripped off. 3 of which in the first 3 minutes and 15 seconds.

Don't make me punch holes threw this sad plot by pointing out things like: alien bunkers made of concrete are on ice ball planets, written in english and have plywood doors. *sigh* Penance.

It talks about the routine that goes on there and also talks of some of the farms policies for the stallions, mares and employees. There is also a section in the middle which has black and white pictures of famous stallions like Secretariat, Man O' War, Princequillo, Nasrullah, Nearco, Northern Dancer, Nijinsky II, Bold Ruler, Buckpasser, Native Dancer, Mr. Prospector, Alydar, and more.

She is constantly changing, creating music unlike anything out there. And does it with a style and class that is amazingly consistent. Do not listen once and say same old Bjork. It is a big mistake with any of her albums. This one will grow on you and you will find sounds that are complex yet compelling and begging for your ears to hear all that is going on. Bjorks voice is as captivating as ever and the fact that she decides to work out in the new frontiers instead of being the next Diva that she obviously could be, makes listening to her music, for me, that much more interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"First Bjork disappointment","review":"Unlike a lot of the reviewers on here, I actually loved Medulla along with all of Bjork's other albums. This was truly my fist Bjork disappointment-- it has some bright spots, but they only manage a slight sparkle at that. It is most reminiscent of Homogenic, but it doesn't manage to maintain a collective mood the way that album did, nor do its songs resonate as strongly. This is unfortunately a weak showing for Bjork who was-- for me-- up until now, all wins and no losses. Wait, I actually didn't care for Drawing Restraint that much either...but that was a soundtrack and didn't count. But I did love Selmasongs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bjork makes another EP (4 great songs)","review":"I was hoping for better after Medulla & listening to the first 3 AMAZING songs from Volta made me think I was about to witness one of the best albums Bjork has ever crafted & then song #4 drops & its all downhill from there. Timbalands heavy-handed beats on \\"Innocence\\" doesnt make Bjork sound like she's bringing sexy back but instead like she's a bystander in her own song & things just get worse with the rest of the album sounding like elaborate B-sides. The only ray of hope after the first 3 songs is the Bjork meets Atari Teenage Riot \\"Declare Independence\\" if you like industrial music you'll adore this song.So whats a Bjork fan to do? Just take the 4 good songs from Volta, combine them with the 4 good songs from Medulla, throw them together on your mp3 player & what you have is a full-length Bjork album worthy of 5 stars or just rush out & buy the Coco Rosie album \\"Adventures of Ghosthorse & Stillborn\\"(Bjork used to make full-length albums this good once)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Can you spot a partner?","review":"Volta as all Bjorks works is full of surprises, most of them pleaseant ones for me. This is an album product of a very creative, talented, and free ARTist, Believe me! there is some art going on here, just have your headphones on, and play \\"Wanderlust\\", you will \\"feel\\" with I am talking about. That is pure perfection!Bjork has given us (or at least me) some of those songs that are chill to the bone-beautiful, almost unbearable to listen to, i.e. Unravel, Pagan Poetry, Vokuro, Desired Constallation. and in Volta you wil find some gems like those of previous albums. Definetelly, Bjork doesn't fit in any music genre and definetly NOT POP!! She is unique, and her music is art to be indulged in, an unpredictable feast to the ears!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mind-Frazzlingly Awful","review":"Bjork is a major talent in every respect. She has explored the boundaries of \\"dissonance\\" in the past, but always with a distinct method to her particularly brilliant madness.There is a fine line between \\"art for the sake of experimentation\\" and \\"art for the sake of sheer nonsense.\\"This album has crossed that line. Again, I adore this woman's talent, but this album is not only lazy and lifeless, it's DEAD."},{"rating":"2","title":"If it weren't divisive, it wouldn't be fantastic.","review":"I won't mince words in pretentious grasps for eloquence.But I will say this: Björk's knack for soaringly, wrenchingly playful and emotive vocals atop subtle, glacial backdrops only gets deeper.Her vision is as strongly refined as ever, with the \\"exotic\\" variety of players and instruments and intuitively stomping beats she has set up to float these songs upon.It's extremely exciting, never cheap, and consistently rewarding, revealing multifaceted intents and layers with repeated listening.If it seems \\"boring\\" at first, just wait until you really start to taste the textures of primal horns, volcanic beats, and eastern flutters.For everything to discover, it leaves you with something about which to wonder. If that's not meaningful art, then nothing is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bjork goes back to her roots","review":"I was close to giving up on BJork. I was a die-hard fan of her work untilVespertinebut Medulla and her latest movie soundtrack just turned off my interest: they were both TOO experimental for what I was willing to put up with -they almost became a musical torture of sorts.Enter \\"Volta\\" in 2007. Though Bjork is still considered a wacko by many (not that she's a typical artist by any stretch of the mind, but...) in this album, in spite of a handful of musical \\"departures\\", for the most part she goes back to her roots. There's a lot of material in here reminiscent of her sound back fromDebut,PostandHomogenictimes.While my favorite song is \\"Wanderlust\\" without a doubt, with upbeat tracks (\\"Earth Intruders\\") and quiet tracks (\\"Pneumonia\\" and \\"My Juvenile\\") across the album, for the first time in a while, consciously or not, Bjork doesn't seem to want to leave anybody out. For the first time in a while, I feel like listening to her music... again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I too used to be a big Björk fan. From Debut to Vespertine, she only got better. Vespertine was a real masterpiece. Volta is OK, Earth Invaders is a good song, but most of the other songs are just boring and, having other albums to listen to, why would I bother with this one? It's sad, although after Medulla I didn't expect much from Björk. I totally agree with the reviewer who wrote that this album is as annoying as its cover art."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost Perfect","review":"Not that Bjork needs a review from me or anyone else, but I want to say THANK you Bjork! GReat album, once again. A breath of fresh air.Fans old and new, buy this record!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Always Different","review":"I love Bjork's music overall, but I have always noticed something about it: It usually takes 3 listenings or so for me to really start enjoying it. Bjork is so very creative that each time she comes out with a new album, you never know what to expect! I bought this cd just yesterday and I have listened to it a few times now, and I can say this this is an awesome album! Timbaland produced two tracks and had a hand in a third, these are my favorite songs because his production adds a new sort of pop dimention, and her voice is so beautiful on those songs. I hope they do more together in the future. I found elements of Post and Homogenic, with a little bit of Vespertine on one of the songs as well. Overall, I recommend this album with 5 stars! Keep it up Bjork, you just keep pushing the envelope more every time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If You Can't Say Anything Nice...","review":"At this point in Bjork's career she owes an apology to the ones who bought this junk she calls Volta. Die hard fans will probably excuse her, but like the ones before me posting a review who love her as much as I do and rightly so dismissing this as a bore. This album has got to be one of the most sorriest \\"creation\\" from the otherwise brilliant Bjork catalogue. I do embrace change from an artist, but this time it is a fact she has used it to annoy anyone who is willing to listen to this album. Warning! do not let your kindergarten age child listen to Earth Intruders, it might leave him/her psychologically disturbed. I for one will retire the \\"new\\" Bjork and be content to listen to her former glories, which I highly regard as masterpieces. It is time to mourn the passing of greatness."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring and ugly","review":"and thats just the cover and overall look of the cd... what happened to her? she used to be an amazingly interesting and gifted musician, and now much of her stuff is so dead and uninspired. it feels like, rather than her own songs, she is beginning to write soundtracks for her husbands awful 'art' films, which are also unbeautiful and pretentious to the extreme."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate this album = (","review":"Bjork is one of my favorite artists, but Earth Intruders is the only good song on this album. When I first popped the CD in, I was really excited on hearing the first song, Earth Intruders, hoping the rest of the album would be similar, or at least in the same class.I agree with others who think this is artsie-fartsie crap. It's as if she's trying a little too hard to be essentric and not making the beautiful music she once did.Many of the songs are just disjointed noises. There is no melody and her singing doesn't flow with the music. Bjork, you're one of the few talented musicians out there, please get back to making music! This has been two very disappointing albums in a row from Bjork."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Experimenting","review":"I took a chance with this new CD after the experimental piece \\"Medulla\\" where the music was generated by humans making noises/beat boxes.Volta goes back to electronic beats somewhat like Debut/Post. Some of it is very interesting and original.But thats where the good ends. This CD has some interesting programming and sounds that pretty much repeat themselves. The brass band is hit or miss.The main problem with this album is that Bjork somewhat sings or talks over each song that makes it sound like she recorded herself to different music and just mixed it together. The vocals are too raw and don't play along with the music. I would listen get into the music and just wish she would shut up after a while.Where has the vocal integration gone from Vespertine and Post?This Bjork album has turned into is the electronic experimental version of a Jewel CD where the lyrics don't match up or make any sense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"I'm not going to leave a detailed review on Bjork's music. You can find that anywhere. But, I love it. :D"},{"rating":"2","title":"Volta","review":"Volta being Bjork's 7th studio album and 2007 release is a mix between electronica, experimental, alternative, synthpop and tribal. Bjork has never been a person that has shied away from experimenting with her sound and one can compare her with the likes of Einsturzende Neubauten. All the lyrics are in the booklet along very strange photographs of Bjork. Allmusic, The Guardian and The Observer all gave the album high marks in their reviews. 4/5."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost, but not quite","review":"I REALLY wanted to love this album. I absolutely adore \\"Vespertine,\\" and thought it was her most comprehensive album, flowing from one song to the next...a complete work. When \\"Medulla\\" totally disappointed, I still had high hopes for the next album - surely Bjork wouldn't release TWO clunkers in a row! In a nutshell, I had to try very hard to like \\"Volta\\"...and my efforts paid off - sort of. The first five tracks grew on me. In fact, the first five songs rock, but the rest of the album falters...too out there, not enough melody, and the song about the suicide bomber had lyrics that were WAY too obvious and strange to hear coming out of Bjork's beautiful mouth. All in all, I listen to the first five tracks and then rewind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn","review":"This is the most fundamentally boring thing Björk has ever recorded. I don't know what the sales figures were like for Medulla (which I loved), but they must have been pretty dire to have inspired such milquetoast pandering. I've listened to it about four times now and I still cannot remember a single song on it apart from \\"Earth Intruders,\\" and that's only because the lyrics are so embarrassingly bad that I find myself blushing while listening to it--even when alone. Granted her words have always been infused with a sort of language barrier inspired comedic naiveté, but this is just plainly awful. It gets an extra star only because she refrained from making references to reproductive fluids this time around (at least I think she did)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bjork's Volta CD review","review":"Maybe 2 good songs and the rest is only mediocre. Still not as good as her early stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY IT, GARBAGE","review":"Soooooo disappointing!I have no words to express it.I love everything she has done in the past, cherish and deeply love her music, consider her a Goddess.However this CD is an absolute trash.Wherever she is experimenting with, is OH, so not working.Her singing is flat and, no heart in it. She waisted Timbaland's talent!Do NOT BUY the CD, she should learn a lesson, get her touch back or go away.Sorry Bjork! What a waste."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good listen","review":"This is not my favourite Bjork album of all time, but it is well worth the purchase. It is a mix of high-energy and softer tracks, as I expected. The introduction of a male voice on a few tracks was unexpected (the last time was with Thom on Selmasongs, I think), and at first I didn't like it. His voice has grown on me, however, and now the tracks that feature him are some of my favourites on the album. The electronic wizardry on this album is lovely, and counterpoints the very organic sound of Bjork's captivating voice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"It's nice to see so many favorable reviews by Bjork fans for this. I've always been a huge Bjork fan, but Volta is just a major disappointment for me. It's just dreadful. Yes, she's an artist and she should continue to make the art that expresses herself. I've just lost interest. Over the last three CDs Bjork has done little more than her classic Bjork sing-song melody over increasingly boring backgrounds. The two duets with Antony on Volta are simply excruciating to sit through. For me, there's just nothing of interest here. I envy those fans who are able to roll with this one. Me...I just give up at this point."},{"rating":"1","title":":( :( :( :(","review":"Maybe my expectations were too high, but I am very disappointed in Volta. Actually, it would be more accurate to say I am utterly distraught and frustrated. It lacks the cohesive, sophistication of a more grown up Bjork that lie in Vespertine and Medulla. I found some of it to be disharmonius, repetitive, and/or relatively shallow lyrically. You might expect this to be a compilation of B Sides; some of it sounds like Selmasongs, other songs are remniscent of Post, and Homogenic even.BUT, the album art and photography of her inside is amazing and everything I would expect from Bjork, I absolutely love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm done with her now","review":"Another album with the same vocal riffs we've all heard before with little or no harmonic movement underneath. Björk's moxie has carried this formula with diminishing success for the past few albums, but I've had enough. To her credit, she always brings some new acoustic texture or idea to the mix, but in the end, her caterwauling against an unchanging tonal center is old, old, old.Björk is a talented vocalist, but it is a shame she has eschewed solid songwriting in favor of coasting on the same vocal acrobatics."},{"rating":"1","title":"No no no... I need more","review":"I need more something.. more of the spectacular that she used to bring with such force. I'm so very disappointed in this CD. I liked the first song, could force myself to listen to the second then I just wanted to cry through the rest of the recordings. I guess I am just not capable of enjoying her \\"artistry\\" anymore. Pity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Third Dud In A Row For Bjork","review":"Pretty sad. Her fist album that sounded as though she finally \\"woke up\\" and sang with a backbone again based on \\"Earth Intruders\\" and the album turns out to be a real poor effort. Probably the poorest effort in her entire career. Hopefully someday Bjork will come back with real material."},{"rating":"1","title":"dissapointing","review":"i use to be as big a bjork fan as anyone. if medulla showed serious signs of bjorks musical decline then volta is the final nail in the coffin. i think she should keep making music that expresses herself, but unfortunately i've lost all interest now. there is nothing here that grips me anymore. nothing that interests me or moves me whatsoever. that's fine if other people like this album, but sadly this is the last road for me and bjork. this is where i get off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mostly unlistenable","review":"Okay, I love Bjork and regard her as being a genius, etc. etc. But I've lived with this thing for awhile and just erased it from my playlist, all of it. Aside from a couple of songs that are dim echos of better work (\\"I See\\", \\"My Juvenile\\"), I find the rest of it down right unpleasant. Two CD's in a row doesn't mean she's finished, but it's apparent she's searching for something new rather than just repeating what she did so well . . . and so far failing badly. I can't fault her for trying, but I can't listen to this anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Tea I've Brewed","review":"I have tried many different brands of tea and this is the best.

If you buy this CD, you're a sucker."},{"rating":"1","title":"generally lame","review":"There are only about 2-3 good songs on the whole CD; - the terrific \\"How Bizarre\\", then a cool, upbeat version of Randy Neuman's \\"I love L.A\\", and maybe 1 other song that holds any interest. Most of the songs seem based on a similar sound, and some even sound to be at \\"slow speed\\". I think buying it used is the best way to go, so as to not be quite so disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bizarre","review":"I really wish \\"How Bizarre\\" had been released as a single, because it was the novelty one-hit fluke.

The overlaying premise aside, one cannot ignore subtle layers present.Training the cybernetic girls to become stoic assassins leaves their humanity behind. They become no more than conditioned animals, the notion reinforced during one episode in particular. After her beloved \\"handler\\" perishes, the agency decides to use one of the girls for experimentation, pushing her body beyond its limits in the name of technology/science. She, of course, feels no pain, but the audience is faced with a moral quandary: Outrage by the cold, indifferent treatment shown her, or apathetic acceptance in the name of advancement?This theme concerning how to interpret the girls (objects, animals, or humans?) may be viewed throughout the series, which overall is a terrific work of art. Everything from writing to animation deserves admiration -- truly an anime series worthy of any serious collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perversion","review":"For the love of all that is good, don't buy, watch, or support this in any way. Yes, the art is good. Yes it is stylish. But people are missing the point: this entire show is an excuse to show so-called \\"moe\\" relationships between adult men and prepubescent girls. That is the ONLY point of this series, and it is fairly emblematic of what is wrong with the anime and manga subculture. Just because there is no overt sex means nothing. It is guys \\"taking care of\\" little girls who spend all their time holding phallic symbols. It is sick."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hairrasing, First class Screaming","review":"Without causing arguments but Caliban is on even keel to Killswitch even more to my taste.

It was to be under warranty since I had only had it a week. Much to my suprise I recieved a bill for the repairs in two weeks time. The cost to repair $230 + shipping, which as you can see is nearly as much as a new camera. Im not going to pay Casio twice for the same camera, instead I will purchase another from a different brand. I would recommend to any one purchasing this camera to treat this baby like a newborn. Please do not buy it if you wish to take it parties, sporting events or any other place where it might bump into something."},{"rating":"1","title":"Indoor shots are mediocre","review":"I forgot when I purchased this camera in 2006 that high MegaPixel does not always equal quality photos. Outdoor with natural light the pics are just peachy. Indoor, they are grainy. Perhaps some of that is the LCD--but it is advertised as a \\"display that brings out the true brilliant quality of the pictures\\". So I have to believe that the issue is the camera itself.We've used it for years, but found ourselves using our cel phones instead, since they took better pictures in almost all cases.I realize that this is now \\"old technology,\\" but it certainly makes me think twice about purchasing Casio again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very informative.","review":"This a very informative book on pewter, of course.

There ARE some funny passages here (I know lots of people who have had the exact same reaction to Japanese cuisine as Barry), but they are few and far between. The general pattern of this book seems to be 1) point out something different from American culture, and then 2) reiterate that he considers it weird. Granted, trying to understand an alien culture is not exactly an easy thing to do, but I would expect some effort to be given to the subject.Usually, Barry shows a reasonable amount of insight into his topic (ex. \\"Dave Barry in Cyberspace\\"), but that insight does not appear to be present here...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"In this hastily written book Dave Barry sees Japan through the eyes of an American. And all he sees is everything that isn't American about Japan. His whole proposition is that what he does not understand is therefore silly, incompetent, wrong or fodder for ridicule. I found it a disappointing read. He skims the top of a rich and subtle culture and does not bother to go deeper than his initial and basic reactions to anything that he finds new and challenging. In the end, for anyone non-Japanese, everything about Japan is new and challenging and that's why we go there. Yes, I had a few laughs along the way. But in the end I was tired of Dave Barry's continual assumption that 'I am right. You are all wrong' attitude.

Still, he had a lot to poke fun at because, as he says, Japan is so FOREIGN. Where else could people take everything so seriously but be allowed to fart in public?As is typical of his syndicated column, Dave Barry manages to find humor in every situation, from food to the Japanese version of Disneyland. He was impressed by the efficiency of Japan, and the general safety of the country, but then he marvels at learning that Playboy magazines are hand-censored to remove all views of female genitals. Paradoxically, this is also a country of heavy drinking and karaoke.His one big fear was that the Japanese would begin to export humor with quality as outstanding as their cars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laughed so hard I cried","review":"This book is so honest, irreverent and hilarious.

Shortly after deplaning, he notices something impressive. No, not the architecture. He seems to be the tallest person in the area. He's tempted to get a basketball and carry it with him, but that temptation passes. With the same ready wit, he describes the experience of \\"mincing\\" in hotel slippers (shoes are forbidden), visiting pools of hot mud, trying to bridge the language barrier, searching for something vaguely edible, and realizing that the Japanese, as a people, have a long way to go before they achieve the same sophomoric heights of humor and aggressive nonconformity that Americans do so effortlessly - like Barry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely one of his best","review":"This book is very funny, particularly on the food incidents, which others have pointed out, but it has a surprising amount of sober observations, too, such as the fact that you can leave money on your hotel room dresser in Japan and it will still be there when you return.

Unlike Riverdance, which managed to stay true to the tradition while introducing new elements, Lord of the Dance wrenches all of its material out of context and forces it towards one goal; glorification of Michael Flatley. I remember well the reviews in the Irish Times when the spectacle first crawled out from under whatever rock it was born beneath, and I can't make a better comment about the music than their reviewer, who said something to the effect of \\"it sounds as if the composer's only familiarity with Irish traditional music came from listening to a couple of old Horselips and Clannad albums.\\" If you care anything at all about Irish music, don't buy this album.

I can just imagine how much fun the live show must have been if the dvd is any indication. The music is great, too, and it fits the hip hop feel of the rest of the movie.

It is bland and offputtingly low-key, no thanks to the ill-conceived concept of a collaboration with the gravelly-voiced Bennett.

I find Claire to be a vibrant, lively, provocative singer who takes wondrous musical risks. Her CDs are generally appealing. This is not one of them.I have to agree with many of the reviews of this CD on this site. I was quite upset that less than half of the tracks feature Claire and of these few tracks, she sings duets with someone whose voice does not work well with Claire's. Although the CD credits both parties, the album cover is deceiving. It is not a Claire Martin CD. I would have preferred to have downloaded only the tracks with Claire's vocals.

Nisargadatta makes many suggestions for a spiritual practice, which are highly practical and can be incorporated in daily life. Nisargadatta himself became Self Realized though a specific practice, and outlines exactly what others should do.The Appendices are a bit complicated - that does not matter as the main message is in Nisargadatta's words, which fills 95% of the book.Highly recommended and when you are finished read \\"I AM THAT\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Look no further!","review":"If you are ready this book is all you'll ever need, if not it will certainly plant the seeds of awakening.

This is the perfect follow up for Maharaj's classic, I Am That. But Please don't let your mind be put off by Nisargadatta's gritty approach. Because of the Guru's declining health, this book's tone does sound a bit harsh by ignoring common civilities and going straight to the core of truth. Yet that is exactly what we need to realize."},{"rating":"2","title":"Full Moon Dreams","review":"This is a good book.

Years ago, when the show premiered on Nick at Nite, I taped 40 episodes and while I watch them, it's sometimes irritating when you know that so much from the episodes has been deleted through the years.This new set allows fans of the show to see Redd Foxx in all of his glory.

Many of them use the machine for only part of the process and still require you to punch down, etc -- and, frankly, I got a machine so I wouldn't have to do that stuff! Nevertheless, there are some really good machine-only recipes, especially \\"Pepper-Parmesan Sourdough,\\" \\"Poppy Seed-Cranberry Bread,\\" which is great for brakfast, and \\"Garlic and Dried Tomato Bread,\\" which is perfect with homemade minestrone.

Even when the melody comes to the forefront, like on \\"Naked Rain,\\" the sound is intentionally muddled, giving the track a hazy feel. Still, the industrial feel isn't the only mood to the album: there's some funky breaks on \\"Down,\\" and \\"Ghost Train\\" has a smooth drive to it, which helps it stand out.

However I know Ellen's work since the beginning, and I must admit that I was used to hear a much greater (and more personal) work since her last Berlinette album. Although not beeing bad, this new album seems to reflect a kind of regression (or hesitation?): first track \\"Come\\" is quite cool, announcing the Ellen's touch we know (and love!), but it doesn't last: the rest of the album is a kind of Loveparade-era revival (some will have recognized reworks of some legendary trance tunes) or, worst, some again-and-again Electroclash beats à la Felix da Housecat... Ellen, where are you gone??.. That's why I gave Thrills only two stars..."},{"rating":"2","title":"ALL THE LATER HITS","review":"A superb collection of Bolan's later hits and some album tracks, but of course doesn't include his masterpieces like Hot Love and Get It On (Bang a Gong)from 1971. These 3-minute poprock tracks have lost none of their appeal and in retrospect, one can see that they might have had some influence on early punk. I don't think all of them were released as singles though: Dreamy Lady, Soul Of My Suit, Celebrate Summer & Dandy In The Underworld couldn't have been hits. My favourites here include the hypnotic Truck On (Tyke), I Love To Boogie and Laser Love, but they're all quite catchy if you like short, sharp pop songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"T.REX Greatest Hits 1972-77 A-Sides","review":"This CD is fabulous!!!

And one my first read I knew it was a book that would describe parts of my life. Without graphic sex scenes a world of prositution is unfolded for you that not only tells of love and loss but of the unique mindset needed. It also hits hard on the subject of family wich hammered this reader into incoprehension from similarities.I write this review to inform others that a film called \\" outcasts\\" based on this book was released form Tiawan in the mid 90's. Being the first film of this subject matter ever to come from Tiawan. The VHS tape is the ONLY movie from book that I believe outdid the original book. And has the added benifit of having a happy ending.Unfortunately I have not found a dvd release.Though I have found VHS here at amazon from time to time.Two decades later I still read Crystal Boys at least once a year.

That was before I knew what litchis were. I was engrossed by this book, and hungry for litchis which were so beautifully described, and I'd never tasted. Luckily, I came to California just after finishing the book, in litchi season. It is a beautifully told story, with vivid descriptions. I see other reviewers comment on how accurately it portrays real life, and how the translation affects things.

The pictures so far are wonderful and I am very pleased with them. I researched several different cameras and finally decided that if small was what I wanted then small was what I should get. Having been a photographer most of my life I have acquired many cameras but there has always been that shot I missed because I had not packed a camera somewhere on me. This one is small enough to put in my purse or pocket and keep with me.

But it does do a very complete job of providing an overview of how to design and construct cabinets. It is comprehensive and economical in its explanation of how to construct both face frame and frame less cabinets. The author provides you with his viewpoint. Others would have a different perspective. Nonetheless, I would highly recommend the book for those new to cabinet making and as a reference for more experienced woodworkers. It has many insights that are only gained through the experience of building lots of cabinets and I found those insights to be very helpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Expert cabinetmaker","review":"Bob Lang is an expert cabinetmaker and general woodworker with a great deal of experience in both. He is a Senior Editor at Popular Woodworking Magazine, which is, in my opinion, the best woodworking magazine available. His projects are featured regularly in that magazine.

Steve Carell does a wonderful job of serving his full range of acting skills - from the flatness of Dan in Real Life and Little Miss Sunshine to the liveliness and comedic shining of The Office and Date Night. Keira Knightley does a great job of balancing Carell as his equal, not support.

Yet, if you're lucky, there is still enough time to place pesky issues on a shelf and put the needs of another before yours so that a bit of light and joy is there to greet you.

This movie is more than a romantic comedy. Some moments are poignant drama, others will make you laugh, and some may even draw a tear. Its plot is simple enough, but leaves one to ponder what is most important in life.

I have only praise for the quality of this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seeking a Refund at the End of This Movie","review":"The premise had promise, the actors have talent, and the critics were upbeat. But boy, did this movie fall flat on its face. It's not a drama, because there was never any. It's not a comedy, because nothing funny ever happened. It was just a boring waste of a couple of hours of your time and the talents of some very good actors. Mostly, I blame the story. It was a meandering trail to nowhere, full of implausible twists, unnecessary holes, and side plots that lead to dead ends. Unlike many other Steve Carrell vehicles, it was not particularly charming or quirky, and it lacked the depth and realism that lends other similar movies a likable quality. The only possible explanation I can come up with is that the filmmaker is trying to use her medium to make a point about the human condition: that our time on earth has been a useless, pointless, poorly-contrived waste of time.

It is a subject that lots of people ask themselves, \\"what would I do if ........ \\". It certainly lived up to its expectations and it is rather suprising that it has not had a greater publicity but I would not be suprised if became a cult film."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun movie","review":"I Love Steve Carell no matter what he does.

Avoid this movie and watch one of his better ones pronto!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This shouldn't be categorized as a comedy.","review":"This shouldn't be categorized as a comedy. It is too dark. Maybe a dramedy? It seems the trailers are becoming more and more deceiving and you can't be certain what you will be watching. I thought the acting was fine but the content was not uplifting. I like to laugh or at least be amused when I see a comedy not depressed afterwards."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"ENJOYABLE, ENTERTAINING, AND FUNNY!\\"","review":"\\"Matilda\\" is an asteroid who is coming soon and it's predicted that within three weeks, the world will come to an end. The clock begins to tick fast as everyone reacts in a different way. One couple in particular had opposite reactions, the wife left in a panic which most would panic, but the husband decided to take a road trip to unite with his high school sweetheart. A neighbor gets in the way of the Master plan as time is not on their side. This is a comedy, drama and romance blended together, presenting a good cast of characters, lots of entertainment as well as laughter. Very Enjoyable and Highly Recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing","review":"This is a slow depressing movie. Steve Carell and Keira Knightley don't work well toghther. I kept hoping it would pick up but it never did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slogged at first, then somewhat redeemed","review":"Very hard to get through the first 45 minutes or so. In the middle, I had hope for a cohesive story. By the end, I was inexplicabley touched by the main characters. Pretty certain the whole thing was written by a clinical depressive with a nihilist outlook.Personally, the only time I can recommend a movie this depressing and hopeless (and really, not funny), is when it informs or encourages the kind of reflection that may lead to change (i.e., Schindler's List)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost 5","review":"I would have given this 5 stars but I didn't like the way it ended.

Not an overwhelming tear wrenching love story, but it was cute."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting way to watch the end of the world","review":"This is a fun movie because its not about the heroes or saving the world in some miraculous way. Its just an interesting take on how people would react to the world actually ending. I have enjoyed this movie a lot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Searching for a plot","review":"I was looking for a lighthearted, above average rom com. In Seeking a Friend the basic plot (the world is ending in 3 weeks, let's do the things we never got around to) should be fairly easy to build into a good story. Instead, there are completely illogical, poorly contrived plot angles that are poorly acted. The poor story and dialogue and unconvincing nature of these plot angles were so extreme that I couldn't not ignore them. They were too bad, even for a film for which my expectations are not high."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute and funny.","review":"This movie was cute and funny. It had enough uniqueness in it to differentiate between every other RomCom but gave you the ending you wanted."},{"rating":"1","title":"We fast forwarded to the end!","review":"We were glad we didn't see this in the theatre because we wouldn't have been able to fast forward.

An insightful movie that was thought provoking and smart. Keira was so charming! This was a gem, I'm so glad I watched this movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing to the extreme","review":"Someone must have gotten a big payday to do this snoozer.

And it was, in small vignettes and occasional lines. But there were boring and sappy ones in equal measure. We had to keep getting up to turn down the music - especially during closing histrionics - but I guess that's a matter of taste. I wish we'd seen more of the dog, who had the best role. As I said to my friend (sought out for an end of the day movie), \\"Hey, I'm really sorry about that one...\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Had a promising premise, but ultimately unfunny","review":"The trailer for this movie made it look rather interesting, and potentially pretty funny. For the most part, most of what was interesting or funny in the movie can be experienced by merely watching the trailer.Steve Carrell comes across as extremely creepy, as he does in most movies when he's not being overtly funny.Plot holes galore. Truthfully I looked my wife in the eyes after this one and said, \\"it's bad when i'm regretting that i didn't let you rent magic mike instead.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Check it out.","review":"Better than I expected.

Don't waste your time with this flick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Comedy - It's a dark journey","review":"This film has been mis-characterized. It is not a comedy. It shows the fairly mundane wanderings of two lost souls as the world is about to end. The funny parts were off-putting and not actually funny. My wife and I were 30 minutes into it before we finally laughed at something. I endured to the end, but I've seen this story before. Two unlikely souls find each other and find meaning. I wasn't convinced. I found myself rooting for the world to end so that I could see what the writers had in mind and how it would look. The rest of the movie was boring and not very funny. I don't know what other movie to recommend in its place. I just was expecting more from Steve Carrell. Oh and yes, everyone dies at the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland and Boring","review":"Who would spend their last days on earth in dull conversation about the stupid details of their lives? I expected so much more from this movie. I stuck through it by sheer optimism, hoping it would turn around, but Rob Corddry's three or four lines in the first scenes were as good as it got. I have sworn myself off popular indie films and Steve Carell for at least a year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as advertised","review":"I only rented this because so many reviews said it was funny.

Would definitely recommend this movie to friends"},{"rating":"1","title":"Half baked","review":"This movie could not figure out whether it wanted to be a comedy or a romance. By trying to be a romantic comedy, something was lost in the middle.

When it was over, my husband literally yelled out Bad! Twice.First, the casting was horrible and set the movie up to fail. Carrell is 50, Knightly is 27...watching them together was completely unbelievable. No chemistry at all. On top of that, the acting was too much to swallow and we never believed the characters. The whole time it just felt off.I read the bad reviews and thought that maybe we'd see something in it that others didn't, but no...this movie earned the bad reviews.If you insist on watching it anyway like we did, get it from the library but I wouldn't waste money on it.

Yes...the world really does come to an end.It’s sad from beginning to end.Please! Do not watch this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow and Barely Meaningful","review":"If you want to slow it down and enjoy a pensive, slow-moving, almost depressing plot that tries to impart quirky life lessons then this is a good movie for you. Do not expect any real comedy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly disappointing.","review":"I thought Steve Carell would lead the movie towards the funny side, and Keira Knightley would keep it centered and interesting, making a good pair.

Steve Carrell was lack-luster at best and Kira Knightly made more weird faces than good acting."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"Kept waiting for the good part and it never came. Chemistry between the two main characters just wasn't there. You would think that for a movie with such a novel premise, the writers could have come up with better subplots or scenarios exploring what could happen at the end of the world. But no. The plot was light, silly, and in no way compelling. Expected so much from a Steve Carrell vehicle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing and no point","review":"Terrible story lineSteve carrel and kiera knightly? uhhhh, ok.

Not very funny as previews suggest and just plain dull."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh!","review":"What could have been a smart black comedy turns into an attempt to prove that Steve Carell can do misty-eyed melodrama.

Kiera Knightley is not a good actor and in this movie it looked like she was trying too hard on the comedy bits and it resulted in some over-the-top acting moments. Steve Carrel plays his usual self. I didn't buy the romantic angle of it, and so the ending wasn't as heartfelt and affective for me as it should have been. The movie just didn't deliver on any level."},{"rating":"2","title":"sweet and interesting","review":"This is a sweet and interesting film with good actors.

The writing was so nauseating, even though I knew coming into it that it was comedy/satire, I winced and rolled my eyes too many times to count. The writer director took two of my favorite actors and turned them into total dunces. No one says the things this woman writes. Keira Knightly was directed to be yet ANOTHER version of Natalie Portman's Garden State character, you know, quirky/lovable-even-though-she-doesn't feel lovable...uggg, giant fart noise...that character was annoying and so was this one. Steve Carell's talent was squandered and the failed attempt to set the film on the east coast might have been the most distracting element of all...she had them bury a man's body in the bakersfield hills for god's sake...I only pray that these 2 talented actors were well compensated and that this writer/director never gets a shot at making another screen play again.Do not waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is not worth it","review":"Don't borrow with this sad little movie, it's depressing!

The narrator could not distinguish between different people talking to one another, leaving you in mass confusion as to who is doing what. There is no inflection for any emotion.

When I read in a preview that one of the narrators is a giraffe, I was intrigued enough to read the novel. However, the \\"giraffe's voice\\" was as boring as those of the humans'.

Wonderfully wicked repartees fly sharp and fast, along with hot hot hot bawdy love scenes and foreplay enough to steam up one's spectacles. And even better, there is enough emotional poignancy to add substance to this wonderfully wicked and witty farce.Definitely recommended to anyone looking for love and laughter.

Please read the Outlander series, Kilgannon and others along those lines. This was just plain stupid. Who really believes they said \\"nip it in the bud\\" in the 1800's.

Learn about the history of mobile travel from Conestoga Wagons to the new manufactured housing. I came to appreciate the culture of mobile home communities and why people choose to live in manufactured housing. I gained a new perspective on my culture. Easy to read, interesting, and relevant in today's communitites. Helps for understanding those around us."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fresh, simple approach to prayer","review":"This is a very accessible volume that lays out the rudiments of prayer--both a theology of prayer and the practice of prayer. Brown discusses what prayer is and is not, looks at pertinent passages from the Bible, then gives some practical suggestions and ideas for ways to pray. He even includes a section of questions from his radio audience--it is here that some of the more difficult issues of prayer are addressed. Brown's style is very fluid and simple; nothing flashy or superfluous, which makes for great readability. While much of the book is geared toward new Christians, Brown includes several nuggets of wisdom for Christians at all stages of the faith journey.

So we found the book with the same author and same title on the internet. However it has been revised since the original. We wish that it has said \\"Revised\\" or something similar with the title. The original was in KJV, however this one is in Newer Versions. It just doesn't read the same! Effort had gone into it to change each Scripture reference throughout the book. At least the option ought to still be there to obtain it in the Version of your preference."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please DO NOT make this mistake","review":"I purchased a 2 year warranty for my GS150 camcorder. I was supposed to recieve the contract via email/snail mail. I waited for a month and did not get anything. So I called them on thie toll free number. The lady I spoke to was really Rude and spoke as though I had committed a crime by calling them. She said I will recieve their contract by mail. I wait another month and do not get anything. I call them 2 more times and they say it will reach me within 2 weeks. With such a start, I am just hoping my camera holds itself well cause I will be not at all confident in contacting them for issues. Hope Amazon removes them from thier site and get someone better.Only plus was there was not much of a wait time when I called. Maybe they do not have many customers calling them :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"The One & Only","review":"While most of the tunes on this CD are dull and lifeless covers, and the audio clips from a handfull of NBA games are oddly chosen and aurally challenged, it IS worth owning, because it is the one and only place where you can get a full-length copy of Marvin Gaye's fantastic version of the Star Spangled Banner, recorded live at the 1983 NBA All-Star Game. It's a miraculous rendition, spoiled somewhat by a corny 'sounds of the game' intro and some sound engineer twisting too many knobs about two minutes in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"A beautifully written and incredibly concise book by the inspirational Sri Aurobindo. The book explains the concept of The Mother - the Supreme's Divine Energy - and how it works in this world through Nature. The book also touches on what one must carry out in order to be fit for The Mother's work. It is a spiritual work and can be appreciated by all people.The book contains several specific terms, but I imagine that their definitions can be found on the internet. Understanding the terms will be key to understanding the text because, while not many, they are key.Sri Aurobindo was a gifted author who knew the languages of Latin, Greek, French, Sanskrit, English, and Bengali, among others."},{"rating":"2","title":"On Aurobindo's The Mother","review":"I have been reading Sri Aurobindo for over 40 years. At one time I owned the complete library of his works, but years later gave it away. This work, The Mother, is a very short piece -- but with so much information. When I purchased it I was expecting a discussion of the woman who ran the Aurobindo Ashram who was known as The Mother. But this is strictly about the Divine and how She (or He, or That) presents to us in four aspects: Maheshwari, Mahakali, Mahalakshmi, Mahasaraswati. For reading, meditating, and for growing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A DRAMATIC FLORAL FRAGRANCE","review":"This is one of the early women's fragrances launched by Boucheron. It is more dramatic than Initial, highlighted by a floral Oriental tone.Jaipur or \\"jewel\\" was inspired by a trip made by the company's current president's grandfather to Jaipur, a city whose reputation for precious stones was legendary. Thus, the fragrance was introduced in a jewel flacon. The original bottles are, of course, highly prized by collectors today.Long recognized as makers of elegrant, luxurious jewelry Boucheron began in 1830 when the first store opened in Paris. It was not until 1988 that the first Boucheron fragrance was launched."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Family Fun","review":"I was pleasantly surprised with this one. Our entire family (me, hubby, and four kids ranging from 1 - 7) really enjoyed it. It was cute and funny and clean (which is a rare find, nowadays). There were a few slightly crude (fart) parts (if you've ever had a dog with gas, you'll understand :-), but overall it was great. MUCH MUCH better than Furry Vengeance (which we thought was just a waste of money/time)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing to do with Marmaduke cartoon","review":"Let me start by saying that the only similarity between the Maramduke cartoon and this movie is that the main character is a Great Dane named Maramaduke and his male adult owner is named Phil. After that it's just another teenager moves to a new town, tries to fit in, acts stupid, loses all friends, then finds true self. Only been done thousands of time. The twist with this movie that it's a teenage dog instead of a human.Jokes are predictable, acting is mediocre. Animation of Maramduke okay, other dogs not so much so. Campy dog dance routine at end is terrible.If you must see this move, borrow it from you local library or a friend that unfortunately bought it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marmaduke","review":"The DVD isn't very promising, but the movie isn't horrible.

Why","review":"When you see the source material (Sunday comics section in local papers), you understand in two seconds why this sucks. Its like making Charlie Brown Live action with the fat kid from super-bad. The stories were more like the Beethoven movies, tales of a real big dumb dog (more than likely the cartoonists). Only these were stories of what a real dog would do on a daily basis, not surfing, or dancing. This is an embarrassing project from start to finish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wouldn't play","review":"Never got to see the movie. I just got an error message after it dowloaded.

I hate children movies that try to incorporate adult themes in the scheme. Marmaduke is attracted to one female while his female friend is attracted to him.Can kids just be kids and not so concerned about relationships yet? They'll get plenty of that as teenagers."},{"rating":"1","title":"I LOVE DOGS, BUT THIS MOVIE NEEDS A POOPER SCOOPER!","review":"Before I review this film I want to state for the record that I do like smart family friendly films(I happen to love the comic strip Marmaduke also), but unlike Alvin and the Chipmunks or How to Train your Dragon, this film is just one bad joke after another. I'm sure the really little kids will find something to laugh about here and parents may like the film because their kids like it, but for everyone else this film is boring with very little humor.The film starts and ends with a dog F A R T joke(ha-ha very funny)! This isn't as bad as the two Chihuahua movies, but it isn't so much better than I can give it above a 1 1/2 star rating......probably 2 1/2 stars for very young children, but there are so many better films to introduce your children to. Please give your kids more credit than this steaming pile!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good family movie","review":"I ordered this last month for the kids. It is a very good family movie and my kids totally loved it. Not quite the same as the old Marmaduke cartoons that I grew up reading so it wasn't exactly what I expected, but it was funny and parts of it were also very touching. Overall it is a very good movie for family movie night and one your kids will want to watch again and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marmaduke","review":"We would recommend this movie to anyone age 10-99.

For some reason I thought this movie had potential, what with all the positive reviews and Owen Wilson voicing the lead character; I thought it would be funny in a light and goofy way. However, the humor is seriously lacking and the plot is extremely formulaic and cliched. It wasn't the worst movie ever--and some young kids might enjoy it-- but there are definitely much better animal flicks out there, like Homeward Bound, Cats and Dogs, Babe... films which can be enjoyed by all ages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute Movie","review":"Dog lovers perfect movie not easy to find.

Instead of documenting the erosion of individual freedom in the US the author documents the growth of the welfare state and the systematic loss of property rights. Although this book does disservice to the concept of freedom it is a pretty book that is nicely laid out. By endorsing this book in the foreword the Bushes tragically confirm that politicians have no concept of freedom."},{"rating":"1","title":"History?","review":"I am in an 7th grade social studies and this textbook is the worst piece of garbage I have ever read.

My family has very much enjoyed her 10 book series for young people; in particular we have appreciated Ms Hakim's ability to deal quite objectively with some of the less savoury aspects of American history.

It begins with the V and VII Corps fighting their way off the beaches and ends at the Falaise Pocket and covers everything in between. The author has an engaging style that blends the tactical with the personal that creates a lasting impression on the reader. You will learn about the bravery and hardship of many soldiers as they try to defeat a still determined enemy. There are also 18 quality maps that will help you understand the progress being made. If you're just starting out or have been reading about WWII for years, this book will be a delight. Its highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fails to read","review":"My new Code Scout arrived today & I spent an hour trying to get it to work.

Quite possibly the worst film ever made.","review":"I have enjoyed some of Jason Biggs past films since it is mindless, simple humor. But, this is nothing like American Pie, Road Trip, or that sort of movie. It involves a bunch of screwed up teachers in an elementary school. Cursing, smoking / doing drugs, and cracking raunchy jokes to 6-8 year old kids is not funny. It is disturbing. At best, this movie is background noise while you're doing something else.Avoid wasting your money and watch something else. This movie is pure garbage.Also, as to the comment that this is like Family Guy: This is nothing like that cartoon (which I enjoy!). These are adults and real elementary school age kids. It doesn't mix well -- at all. The net effect is that you actually feel sorry for the kids (who are portrayed as helpless in a poorly run school) rather than amused by the situation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Caustic smelling","review":"I bought this one last week, when it arrived and I saw it was a Doc Johnson item I started to be afraid (my bad I didn't realize it was).

So far only our UR3 material Doc Johnson toys doesn't smell like that.One year later, the old one keeps stinking.

Such smart, original writing. Colt does an excellent job of describing the L.A. scene (reminds me of how Carl Hiaasen so perfectly puts the read in Florida) and her obsessively self-absorbed characters (read Robert and Reba) are hysterical. I found my self laughing out loud on page after page -- to the point where people were starting to stare at me at the coffee shop. The plot is outrageous and totally over-the-top, but the perfect vehicle for her characters to shine through. I enjoyed every minute of this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointed!","review":"I have had intractable migraines for the last seven years, so almost all of my time is spent in bed, reading. As a result, I am always looking for mysteries that are light-hearted and funny; about all I can tolerate in my life right now are happy endings. Based on the reviews I read, I ordered The Butcher of Beverly Hills, mainly because of the comparison to the Stephanie Plum series, and I cannot tell you how disappointed I was. Say what you will about Stephanie Plum, at least the characters in the series, although a little over-drawn, are all least three-dimentional and believable; I can certainly imagine meeting Grandma Mazer in a grocery store in New Jersey, for example. I certainly cannot say that about the characters that people The Butcher of Beverly Hills - I found them to be flat and highly unbelievable.

Fiona has the spunk we like to see in a heroine, but Jonathan is just a bore. Their interactions are aimed, I think, at being sensually teasing, but they just come off silly.

It was shown on the Inspirational Channel, but now I may have to purchase a copy of the dvd. I was amazed at ALL the information Mr. Cameron dug up about our fore-fathers--much of it has been a part of our history lessons (well, it 'was' years ago) but there were some things I wasn't aware of. It was helpful to have him speak with experts along the way. Our country so needs to be aware of where it's now going...NOT what our fore-fathers had in mind when they were putting together our governmental leadership. I highly recommend families to watch this dvd together, then discuss it after-wards!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Retired Teacher Review","review":"Teaching the truth took up 44 years of my life. After viewing Monumental I believe this video should be shown in every high school and college in our Nation. This is not violating church and state.

The facts are well research and documented as if a student were doing a research paper.Great learning tool if you really want the truth and not someone's opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Monumental","review":"Great DVD; will open your eyes to the truth about how America came to be.Kirk Cameron has great movies"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you love history, you will love this documentary.","review":"I loved this documentary. It taught me things I never knew about the pilgrims. I had never seen the Forefathers' Monument until after I saw the documentary and I have lived a 40 minute drive from Plymouth all my life. What a great place to take kids to see on a school field trip. Kirk Cameron did a marvelous job tracing the journey of our forefathers and telling the story about their trip. I never knew how long it took them to finally get here from when they first tried. The message that the monument has for us was mind opening to me. Has to be one of my all time favorite documentaries. Great for middle school and older kids and adults."},{"rating":"2","title":"Informative","review":"This movie is extremely informative to the founding of America.

It seemed to pound the facts past me, instead of into me. The facts were GREAT. I am so glad to have someone research Where the United States is now and where it was and where we are headed. Prophesy is being fulfilled, and this proves it! Every family in the US ought to see it. Thanks for the knowledge."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Documentary - Everyone should see it","review":"This was an awesome documentary, presented in a way that drew the viewer into it. So much history that we aren't taught in our schools - and some that refreshed my own memory of what I learned many (more than I care to count) years ago! I knew about 85% of what was in this movie, but hadn't really thought about it since grade school.The explanations of certain aspects of this countries' (USA) history was excellent and interesting.

I am thrilled. SO INTERESTING."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love the message of this film, but the editing is over the top for me","review":"We are already a home school family, thus much of the history Kirk was covering \\"not taught in schools today\\" we teach our children. However, I admit that I was not familiar with the National Monument to the Forefathers - very noteworthy! I am totally on board with the message Kirk was trying to get across with this movie - that to return to American exceptionalism, we need to return to the basis of values that are the foundation of our union. I felt like the editing of this film was quirky and slowed the pace of the movie, the music didn't quite fit the message, and for me - a middle-aged father - it distracted from the importance of the message. Bottom line recommendation - watch the film, applaud the message, learn a few interesting history tidbits that you might have missed, forgive the editing."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing DVD","review":"I bought this DVD fully expecting it to be good--I loved Fireproof and knew what Kirk Cameron is all about. Well, this one actually knocked my socks off! Without spoiling the surprise for anyone who has not seen it; let me just state that I thought I knew all of the material he would cover and boy was I wrong! I learned a lot of interesting things about our history and I mean the true story--not the politically correct version that is shoved down our throats in today's government education system. I highly recommend this DVD to anyone who is wanting to find out the truth about our past. Many will disagree with my review but I am not interested in debating the issue with those of a liberal viewpoint. I am simply telling conservatives who wish to explore the true history of our country that they will appreciate this work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, the truth","review":"Every person who considers themselves an American, or wants to be an American, needs to see this movie. It quickly dispels the lies that are being spread about our founding, and the misinformation currently taught in schools about our history. I make no apologies, there are groups in this country who do not want these truths to be known, because it will expose them, and their agenda to control us, and destroy this great country.America will only survive if we go backwards. Back to what established us. Back to what sustained us. Back to what gave us moral compass."},{"rating":"2","title":"A movie for anyone interested in an accurate account of this Nation's History.","review":"We have far too much 'revisionist' history floating around out there in our schools and in our media. Kurt Cameron did the research and has brought this compelling story to video for all of us to see and remember. Our Christian heritage is real. It is not a figment of our imaginations. It is not 'old-fashioned' history. It is true that this nation was founded on Christian principles by Bible believing men. The further away from those beliefs we get the worse our lives become, the worse the economy becomes, the worse our families become. All of this is determining our future. The Bible says that God gives us the leaders that we deserve! Something to think about isn't it?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow, Just Wow","review":"I didn't really expect much when I went and seen it in the theater but it just blew my mind. So much information we've been lied to about all these years. Heck, even in a rural school system years ago all they did was teach half truths and lies because it came down from the Fed. I didn't take my son to the live screening because I figured it would be boring for him but now I've got the DVD and even his friends want to come over and watch it. If they would teach this kind of real information in schools kids wouldn't sleep through class; it's no wonder they do since all they teach in schools is pointless jack did this on such and such date.....Honestly get this if you haven't seen it; I get fuming mad every time I do just because it's information I should have know in grade school."},{"rating":"2","title":"INTERESTING JOURNEY","review":"KICK BACK AND ENJOY THE TRIP.

(he's admitted on camera backstage that he makes himself cry on cue)But this is 'conspiracy' FACT: Diebold, the company known for handing Bush 2 wins and now Obama 2 wins (\\"glitches\\" and all) - the same company that never screws up your ATM transactions - is the 'owner' of the case that our Constitution is held in!!!!!This is most definitely a hold card...Pray for our nation.Nanette"},{"rating":"1","title":"Thinly Disguised","review":"When I bought this I thought it was Kirk Cameron's search for the foundation or history of America. Instead I was treated to closeups of Cameron's face throughout most of the video talking about one aspect of America's founding, the religious persecution of the Puritans - mostly at their departure points of England and Holland. Though the film vaguely established the concept of freedom of religion in America (which we have mostly lost today) it did not delve into the hardships they faced to survive and what they did to water this beautiful flower that is so rare nowadays."},{"rating":"1","title":"Faulty disc","review":"The product I received froze at several points while playing & I never could view the end of the movie"},{"rating":"1","title":"momofmany","review":"Wow. Don't waste your money on this one, unless you are a white, anglo saxon and view history only from that perspective. I love history and was so excited to see this movie. So disappointing. I could hardly get through it. So much hype and exaggeration. So much emotion and lack of scholarship. So non impressive. I Love America and I love studying our history, but this silly movie does not deserve the plastic disc it is recorded on. Lots of emotion and national ego is what fueled the Nazi movement in Germany. Truth is what sets us free; ego is just pride, and pride is blind and takes us away from our best selves, and God."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish someone else starred in this movie","review":"I think the premise of this movie is good. I wish it starred someone other than Kirk Cameron. Kirk Cameron is a very hate filled person. I am a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints and Kirk Cameron hates the Church. He goes around spreading lies about the Church and posts videos on YouTube about our Church. Good Premise, wrong actor. This is just a review and I am not spreading any hate about Kirk Cameron. I am just informing the public.Here is a link to a video that Kirk Cameron himself says he dislikes Mormons. So in NO WAY am I being a hypocrite. [...]"},{"rating":"1","title":"My Name is Not Susan","review":"The fact that I share the same first name as this religious zealot leaves me cold. Never a fan of \\"Growing Pains\\", I have still been confronted with his library of material that preaches and thumps as the fire and brimstone language prevails. Having grown up in a devoutly religious catholic household, I'm no stranger to what some deem as \\"the holy word\\". Kirk is certainly free to have his own religious point of view. It's only when judgment and condemnation comes into play, and that is often, that he truly leaves me cold. Here is another one of his self-righteous tirades on video for your dazzling pleasure. I can only hope it fades away as quickly as the others. If there was ever talent in Kirk's DNA, he keeps chipping away at it with his self-prophesizing. I'm awfully bored."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best educational DVD's","review":"It is rare that an educational DVD is so simply and accurately done, this is one of them. The beginning few minutes starts slow but then captivates you with facts that most people have forgotten about with the beginning of our country and the pain and suffering they went through. Every school should make this a required viewing lesson, then people would have more respect for what and who we are."},{"rating":"2","title":"Monumental","review":"This is the second time I have bought this movie.

This is History that is not being taught in our schools anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kind of a joke","review":"My fault for measuring the cabinet depth instead of the shelf depth, but this thing protrudes over half an inch beyond the shelf. I can live with that. What's really annoying is how misleading the product appears. You will never be able to use more than four hooks, and it would just be easier to use if it only had two hooks on each side. Only giving this an extra star because it's cheap and at least gets four of my teacups out of the way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sliding cup rack works for us","review":"We ordered two of these to hang cups from in our cabinet as a way to maximize cabinet space. So far, they are working well. They are plastic so I'm a little concerned with how well they'll hold up in the long run. The main drawback is that if you have oversized mugs like we do, the rack won't hold many. I can only get four mugs on each rack. It's not ideal, but we've made it work for us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Next best thing to regular Hide Glue","review":"Its great that Titebond came up with this version of Hide Glue. Not having to deal with a glue pot is great. The glue bonds perfectly. Its light amber in color when it dries (i.e. you shouldn't be under the impression that it dries translucent). I haven't tried breaking a bond that I've created with this, so I can't comment on the ease or lack thereof in doing so. It gives you a fairly long time to work with your pieces before it sets. Which is definitely a plus."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good at what it does","review":"I used it a few times so far with an Ipaq 5550. It took a few minutes to figure out how to make a Bluetooth connection. The volume on the Ipaq was relatively low, so I used earphones. (Too bad car radios don't come with jack inputs.) Anyway, it guided me to a local address through side roads that I was unfamiliar with. I also used it on a 150 mile trip.One needs to make sure to set the route options correctly. Mine was originally set for 'avoid tolls,' so instead of guiding me on the major highway it tried to route me onto local roads on a long trip to avoid every toll. Once I corrected that, it worked flawlessly.I am concerned that Belkin has no plan yet to update the software that is written by a 3rd party. I know this because I called them. That would be unfortunate as roads don't change much but restaurants and gas stations do and over time, the maps will become obsolete."},{"rating":"2","title":"But it lacks desktop component software...","review":"The hardware is impressive; it has good range and good battery life. The software installs easily but leave me in the dark in various ways. For example, using the system on my iPAQ exclusively (no desktop component provided) means I can't see or verify the big picture. Following a 500 mile route (for preview and verification) on a PDA is for the birds. Also, I have to load three entire states worth of data just to traverse a narrow path through each. That's crazy! DeLorme's approach seems more sensible (gather data along the planned route only), and DeLorme's files are considerably smaller. Summary: The HW is great, but the SW needs work!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Works well as long as you don't drain the battery completely","review":"This was a very good unit and helped me a lot while it worked. But I left the unit on once in my car to compeletely drain the battery and now it won't work even after a complete recharge. The unit simply has stopped sending any GPS data to the PDA/laptop.I would avoid it because it is only a matter of time before you will leave it on one day and that will be the end of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Recalled Due To Exploding Batteries!","review":"The unit itself works well but the software and maps are way out of date. There was a recall of these units due to exploding batteries so Belkin stopped making them and never released any updates. I got a new one still in the package and the battery was swollen so much the cover wouldn't fit but it still works. They are selling replacement batteries on ebay but beware, they won't fit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Positive role model for boys (and girls) experiencing grief","review":"A very touching story about how parents and children experience grief.

This book does a nice job of demonstrating that experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Foam liquifies! and dispenser is not kid-friendly","review":"I bought a six-pack of this soap and every single bottle liquifies over time and does not foam.

If you know \\"some\\" about the HP series, this game will probably just frustrate you. My 9-yr-old has read all the books, seen all the movies, but is not able to successfully do many of the puzzles. It is a challenging game, mainly for teens and up, I would say, as far as difficulty. We enjoy playing \\"Party mode\\" best, as it doesn't take as long. Scoring is all on the honor system. I consider myself a pretty huge Potter fan, but still couldn't answer many of the questions regarding the actors and such."},{"rating":"1","title":"SHOULD be fun... but way too easy","review":"Yes, these Scene It games seem like a great concept, but especially for the Harry Potter editions, it fails. After all, there are a certain amount of books and movies (and the Scene It's seem to mostly rely on movies and somewhat one books, no more outside information), and most people who will be interested in playing it are Harry Potter junkies, who have most likely viewed/read all the movies and books. The Scene-It questions are simply too easy; the only people who may find it challenging are Harry Potter novices who haven't seen/read all the movies and books. In fact, the Scene It is so easy that, combined with it's slow transition speed due to flashy transitions, it become downright boring. Yes, I applaud the creation of this Scene-It series and I understand that the questions CAN'T be too difficult, but for most people who would even buy the game, it's too easy and not worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jennifer Drew Rocks!","review":"Stacy Moore is engaged to be married, but she's having a tough time finding just the right wedding gown.

Spiteri's singing is near-faultless and the band seems to have an instinctive feel for their music - from the lethargic 'Put Your Arms Around Me' to the pacier 'Black-Eyed Boy' instrumentation and vocals help to give the album a distinctive sound. Yes, it is dangerously middle of the road, the but somehow the band pulls it off, neither challenging the audience too little or too much. To my mind contemporary music doesn't get much better than the closing track 'Breathless', it was worth getting the album for that alone."},{"rating":"2","title":"A pleasant surprise.","review":"A pleasant mix of pop sounds ranging from soft easy listening to Motown-like songs sung by a very pleasant sounding lead singer."},{"rating":"2","title":"the biggest surprise of 1997","review":"Who would have known that a little-heard album by the oddly-named Scottish band Texas would be one of my favorites of 1997? Upon first listen back in February 1997 I was impressed. As the year went on the more the record stuck in my head and the more I loved its simplicity and beauty. There's not much to Texas. They're not the most innovative band. Not the most poetic. They're practically unknown in North America, despite being huge stars in the U.K.. What they are good at, and what is constanly present on White On Blonde, are perfectly-crafted pop songs with ultra-slick production.Every year one album jumps from out of nowhere and totally blows me away. White On Blonde just innocently fell into my lap, and I haven't stopped listening to it yet. A wonderful album in every respect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great pop album.","review":"This album sounds so complete. Great vocals from Sharleen, and moody music. One of the better albums of the 90's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great if you like Crickets","review":"I wanted the sound of a crackling fire. I HATE CRICKETS and the cricket noise is every bit as loud as the fire plus it never stops. If they had left the crickets off it would be better. With headphones on I can hear an occasional owl but not in an open room because the crickets are such a high pitch. I will keep looking for the right sound effect, hate this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Drawings & Instructions","review":"This is the first volume in Bill Holmes \\"Home Workshop Guns\\" series and it suffers from poor drawings, illustrations, and instrusctions. Unless you already have a fair idea of what you are doing I doubt you would be able to make a working firearm based on this book.If you are looking for a clear, complete, and easily understood reference on how to make a firearm I would recommend Gerard Metral's \\"Do-it-yourself Submachine Gun\\" book instead. It has much better drawings, illustrations, and instructiions.Do-It-Yourself Submachine Gun: It's Homemade, 9mm, Lightweight, Durable-And It'll Never Be On Any Import Ban Lists!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Need for References","review":"All of us who subscribe to this type of imaginative spirituality are seekers of a higher meaning. Because of this we need to protect ourselves from creative businessmen who mock truth and take advantage of our need for an understanding of our universe in order to make money. To be balanced is to be whole, and so to be without any skepticism whatsoever is just as bad as being overly skeptical to the point of being closed-minded. Drunvalo is a fiction writer. Some readers will not want to believe this, and so will not try to follow his references and will simply accept what he writes. If you really believe Drunvalo, try to make yourself believe even more by digging up his references. See where they take you. Or just ignore this critique and go on believing blindly. At least you will be happy."},{"rating":"2","title":"When the Student is Ready the Teacher will Come","review":"After reading all the reviews, I can summarize the value of this book as indicated in the title. If the book has value enjoy it relish its insights, if you think it is hogwash return it or throw it out. The reviews here could be made about any esoteric or \\"religious\\" book. This author like many others believes he is speaking a truth, feel your way through it, if it feels true enjoy, if it feels false, stop reading it. Either way its like discussing who killed JFK, you can choose to believe the lone gunman theory or the conspiracy assassination theory.Like many writers, they write like they speak, some speakers are very expressive others are very detailed. Drunvalo is a great story teller, but it does not always translate well to print.So the question is \\"Is this New Age Hogwash or Great Universal Truths,\\" my advice is read and decide for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Open your mind","review":"This wasn't the easiest of books to read, and is not complete without the Volume 2.Why not an easy read? First, the geometry of course, unless you're really into mathematics. Second, the mind-opening ideas. I am very open-minded, but each chunk of info got me thinking, wondering, connecting, so I took my time reading.It's really a different history of our planet and existence, much different than we were taught.So unless you are interested in the possibility of a totally different perspective that includes a lot of his information coming from a being named Thoth (you may recognize his name from ancient Egypt) and angels, don't pick up the book.If you're interested in the new consciousness, 2012 etc., definitely read.Drunvalo is humble and encourages the reader to do their own research and come to their own conclusions, rather than just take his word for it.

We were warned about people like this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Flower of Life Review - by Mari from Connecticut","review":"After reading The Ancient Secret of the Flower of Life Book - Volume I, I was able to add more pieces to the great puzzle of life. Drunvalo takes difficult topics and explains them clearly. He gives his audience much to think about. I have seen him speak on two occasions and found him to be kind, clear and very informative. He is not arrogant as one reviewer said. He meets with people all over the world and tells you of the latest discoveries. He has studied physics and the arts which gives a balance you don't often see. The book shows many drawings of sacred geometry, the MerKaBa and pictures of the sacred sites and artifacts along with his explanations. Book II will be out soon and I am looking forward to purchasing it. If you're a serious seeker of the mysteries of life, read his books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Consciousness Raising","review":"This book is not for those who think \\"in the box.\\" It IS for those desiring to expand their mental horizons. In this book the author talks about the 5 levels of human consciousness, the MerKaBa(the energy field which surrounds all living things), and explains with geometric diagrams, a very interesting interpretation of the Biblical story of Genesis. And there is a lot more in this book to blow your mind. Of course, there is no way to \\"prove\\" any of this, however, it IS information that you can apply in your life to see if it works for you. I have had personal experiences with some of this material that makes it real for me. It is written in a conversational tone, because the book is an edited transcript from a series of lectures the author gave. The subject matter is very deep. Don't pick up this book if you are looking for a light read, but if you are a seeker of truth, you will surely enjoy this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"You can't miss","review":"Of all books I have read about spirituality, Drunvalo's are the most profound, touching, revealing, loving. And with words so simple and direct;jewels of spiritual knowledge. This one is no exception.Thanks Drunvalo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utter GARBAGE","review":"The claims made by this character are simply laughable. For instance, after an exhaustive search on medline, the largest scientific journal database in the world, there was not ONE link to an article on these amazing children in china. Furthermore, a websearch for schools that teach these superpowers simply do not return any valid hits. You would suspect that this would be a booming business since I'd pretty much give my left arm for them. Furthermore this man is a charlatan peddling so called super water that is simply theoretically impossible. For all the good work so many people have done to advance our knowlegde of sacred geometry and esoteric knowledge, this man eradicates in two volumes. Do yourself a favor; spend a little more and buy books by:Viktor Schauberger, Graham Hancock, Gregg Braden and Franz Bardon."},{"rating":"2","title":"the ancient secret of the flower of life Vol 1","review":"Well written and interesting. Keeps your attention from the beginning until the last page. Highly recommended. Found the book to be relaxing as well as informative."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating, juicy","review":"A deep look at all the mysteries of life and the universe...at least some juicy bits. Great source of explanations, theories, to mentally chew on, even if they don't make sense or i agree with. Ties together a lot of different threads. So i rate this book high for philosophical/metaphysical variety, in depth explanation of certain ideas, profundity, and blending reasoned and researched material with more speculative stuff. But i stop short of 5 stars because parts of the book are sloppy, sometimes having a quickly-thrown-together feel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent and detailed text","review":"When I took Drunvalo's Flower of Life Workshop in the winter of 1990, he was talking about preparing this book. Reading through this text and Volume II brought up happy memories of learning about Sacred Geometry. I've been feeling rather spiritually stale. Going back to my roots to relearn this material has helped all aspects of my life. Indeed, it is very left-brained, but Drunvalo is a master of gathering up loose threads to pull the skein together in a body of knowledge we can use as a platform to make our own life journey a little bit easier. I feel deeply grateful for his efforts and personal commitment to make this world a little bit better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amalgamates Science and Spirituality; Past, Present and Futu","review":"My personal quest over the past 50 years has been varied; from one subject to another but only thru this book have I found connection. A fascinating book to forward any persons quest for truth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flower of Life - In Full Bloom","review":"I have read many books on sacred geometry, but this is the only one that actually gives an explanation for what makes sacred geometry sacred, along with the basis for these geometric forms and ratios, not just where they are found.Other books, like the Earth Chronicle series by Z. Sitchin do an excellent job of connecting mythology, historical writings, the bible, astrology and astronomy, but they raise a lot of unaddressed questions:Where does Atlantis fit in to this chronology?How can all the megalithic sites all have the same geometries far beyond coincidence? It's as if they were designed by the same person.Melchizedek answers these and corroborates the conclusions reached by Sitchin. Very impressive. I just ordered Volume II."},{"rating":"2","title":"Left brain approach to spirituallity","review":"Reading Drunvalo was my intorduction to Thoth and sacred geometry. Overall, I think that this is a good book that combine anthropology, physics, spirituallity and geometry. Very good intro to the synthesis of these ideas. I feel that the most valuable aspect of this book is that it attempts to give a mathematical perspective to the unity of the universe and it elucidates that thru creation itself that the infinite source not only pours out his essence but presents its omniscience within and throughout the phenomenom of manifestation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgrace","review":"this is such an interesting subject that this man has disgraced. people like this give a bad name to people making a true attempt at discovering the truth, such as Graham Hancock. pitiful. stay away from this garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nonsense","review":"\\"....I am so utterly important that \\"...for twenty-two years, the angels have asked that I teach people...through workshops..\\" and \\"Because you and I are One with the Creator...you must change yourself first...\\" ...and, I know all about changing the you that does not exist and can show you in a seminar for a small fee that, as Nisargatta has said, \\"liberation is not of a person, it is FROM a person,\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"flower of life","review":"they should really have this book in public libraries, so nobody has to spend money to read it. in it, melchizekdek proposes a geometric/mathematical model for radical abstract consciousness theories and a new age history of the world. mostly, it's rumors he's overhead, i dunno, outside a freemason cocktail party or something. it's not very well-written, which is good, since if you read it closely you can see how information can be manipulated to fit any argument. does sacred geometry exist? yes. do space aliens? maybe. portholes to other dimensions? if there were, i imagine there would be a starbucks coffeehouse at each end. walt whitman traversed more universes than this guy can shake a stick at. if you read this book, and believe everything in it, you're probably paranoid. get out more, and read better books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Nonsense","review":"Complete dribble written by a professional conman.

I promptly returned the wrong CD and asked to be refunded for the cost or have the correct CD sent to me -- that was over a month ago and I have still heard nothing.Guess I should have anticipated a problem when the original confirmation asked me to not write a bad review.

The only recording you really need is the original from 1966 with the authors themselves. But a few others are perfect in their way, such as Monica Salmaso/Paulo Bellinati. But this version is superb, too. Virginia's voice evokes a sacred, silvery presence of the goddess of the sea (on Canto de Iemanja) and some of the joy of the 1966 recording (on Labareda, for example).The arrangements of Luiz Brasil are real standouts. Lapinha shimmers with samba-de-roda handclaps AND big-band winds, felicidade AND sophistication. In other words, this CD benefits from some of the genius that made Caetano's Livro CD a career highlight.Get the 1966 version first. Get this a week later!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Major Disappointment!","review":"Although there is nothing like the pure voice of Virginia Rodrigues, this album was a MAJOR disappointment. Her first album was wonderful, her second OK, and this one, unfortunately, is in most ways a failure. The arrangements are unimaginative and they have sort of a Lawrence Welk quality, and most of the tracks lack any Afro-Brazilian feel at all. I hope that on her next album she goes back to the popular Brazilian rhythms and melodies that made her first album such an amazing musical achievement.If you want true Afro-Sambas, try to find the original 1966 album, with Baden Powell and Vinicius de Moraes, which is available as part of the 13 CD Baden Powell box."},{"rating":"1","title":"A profound disappointment compared to Nos and Sol Negro","review":"If you liked Nos and Sol Negro, you may not like this one as much - I didn't.

I use it to clean all my baby bottles and breast pump parts. Yes, the wire stem is delicate, but people must be scrubbing pretty hard for it to be bending and breaking.

The sponge does a great job of cleaning out the bottles and smooth surfaces and holds onto soap well, while the brush bristles aren't so stiff that they flick soap everywhere. Of the brushes we've tried, this one did the best job of cleaning.However, the fatal flaw is the wire construction that holds the whole thing together. It weakened very quickly at the point where it attached to the base, and it snapped completely off before the baby's 1-month birthday. The wire itself is thick, but the point where it attaches to the base is not able to handle the force or pressure exerted on the brush by everyday bottle cleaning.It's a great brush, but don't expect it to last more than a month."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really worth it","review":"I bought this thinking it would clean the Dr Brown bottles & nipples better than the one I got fr/ the super market... not so.

I much prefer our First Years brush, complete with the tiny little nipple scrubber that folds out.

I wonder if perhaps there was a bad batch that went out in stores?? I have had this brush for 3 months now and I have no rust issues, the metal wire part has not bent and I use this brush at least 2-3 times per day everyday. I find the stand very handy and the nipple cleaner connected to the handle is highly functional! The sponge part is tearing and wearing out, but I have tried other baby bottle brushes that did the same thing so I suppose that comes with the territory.I love this brush and find it handy and functional and will continue to buy only these Dr. Brown's brushes until my child outgrows the bottle!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sponge End wont last long","review":"brush actually works great, but i see chunks of sponge coming off almost daily after use. not very well made for durability."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for Dr. Brown bottles","review":"The brush is great.

This one also comes w/a stand!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Breaks Easily. Other alternatives available.","review":"At first I thought this was a great product. Until I started using the brush and found the following problems.1. Sponge head breaks apart. Little by little, the pieces of blue sponge start coming off until you are left with a small sponge head.2. Like one of the pictures shows, eventually the head breaks completely and you are left with a brush without a handle.I ended up buying about 4 of these before I finally decided to give up on the brush. I bought the brush that parent's choice makes (bought at the store with the smiley face) and comes with a nipple brush. The Parent's Choice blue sponge has not desintegrated. I still use the small little brushes from Dr. Brown's as these do work well to clean those blue tubes and the yellow filters for the bottles.One good thing about this brush is the stand that comes with it. Other than this, save your money and look for another alternative. Otherwise I guarantee that you will be ending up buying a replacement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lasted me 1 month","review":"I used this brush with my Dr. Brown's bottles and it lasted me about a month.

Breaks in a month!","review":"We are big fans of the Dr. Brown's bottles, but this brush has a fatal flaw. The stem is made of a very flexible wire which bends every which way when you clean.

It's much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Now I know why the Amazon overall rating is so low","review":"This thing is a piece of garbage. The wire started bending the FIRST time I used it.

It was discouraging that it portrayed surfers to be just a bunch of partying pot heads and drunkards, with lots of sex orgies. I've been surfing for forty five years, with a bunch of other well known surfers, who've lead more productive lives than this. This has a negetive impact on the younger generation of surfers and the surfing community. I enjoy Mathew's movies, and especialy surf movies, but this was a big let down, it's like a flat day, or in his case fifty eight days without surf. This movie is'nt even worth loneing out for my friends to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"something's bogus, dudes","review":"This is a simple movie, not made to be dissected, competed with or watched for the plot or action. rather, the film provides a taste of SoCal that is partly mythical and partly disappearing and for that alone i loved it.there's something wholesome about the film, left me feeling good which does not happen too often for me, and almost never with the large commercial blockbusters. to see Willie Nelson's smile, that alone was worth waiting for. mcConnaughey does a good job, as does Harrelson & most of the crew.in other words, this is not about surfing. it is about friendship and about knowing what you love."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"This movie is a complete waste of time. I happen to be a surfer, which is what got me interested to rent this movie in the first place. Everything about this movie is unbelievable. The plot sucks, and the production seems like you are watching a low-budget movie from the 80's. Almost like the intro to some 80's porn. It is a complete insult to what surf culture is about. We are not all stoners!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WIPEOUT (IF YOU'RE NOT STONED) -- EVEN IN BLU-RAY","review":"Haven't seen this movie stoned and don't plan to. I love the ocean, and the surf culture but this vanity production -- no doubt a blast to make -- is a bore to watch. And that is really, really sad because all the undisputed screen charisma of Matthew McConaughey, Willie Nelson, Woody Harrelson and Scott Glenn is utterly wasted on this episodic and stultifying vanity production that looks great in it's Blu-ray, hi-def clarity. But honestly, it's like looking at a turd in sharp focus. I wish it weren't so.There is a commentary with the affable McConaughey that, while minimally amusing, does not really answer the not so burning question of exactly why this movie was made or what it's supposed to be about. My amateur videos of fun times in Malibu, the North Shore and French Polynesia have infinitely more fun and big waves. I am so disappointed.

I would rather face a firing squad than watch this movie ever again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak, Lame, and Feeble.","review":"This is a very poorly done movie and is not entertaining. Some, might try to give it a chance, but the fact is, it never gets better, and it starts out lame. If you have never surfed, or your child never has, get them a lesson, and take picswith the video on your digital cam, and it will be more entertaining than this movie. Easy to see why it flopped so bad, and hard to believe it was even released for dvd viewing.The one good thing about it, is when you watch the next movie you regard as boring, not entertaining,and dull, compare it to your viewing of this one, and suddenly the other will become magnificent in comparison. Do notwaste your time, unless your goal is to waste time, or you insist on punishing yourself for some unknown reason."},{"rating":"1","title":"This floater should be flushed!","review":"I was stunned by this movie. With so many big name stars I thought that there would be at least a half decent story. There is not. This is just one big advertisement for getting stoned. I actually felt embarrassed for the actors. What were they thinking?! As for the writer and director, well I have my own theories about where they got their \\"inspiration\\" for this story. I've watched my fair share of surfing movies, and they run the gamut from corny to nostalgia to documentary, appealing to people casually interested in the sport, to die hard surfing addicts. But this movie fails to make the grade at all, and doesn't deserve to be named among this genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jersey Juice","review":"Im 29yold, 15yr surfer.I feel like they were going for a cheesy surf movie, like previous Hollywood surf movies such as North Shore and Blue Crush. The only difference was North Shore and Blue Crush weren't trying to be cheesy.The only thing that could have made it better for me would be a surf star cameo and some real quality surf footage, not re-used car commercial takes.

The Orthodox connectedness to the history of the faith is an important reason for this.I purchased The Inner Kingdom to learn more on the Orthodox understanding (and Bishop Ware's understanding in particular) of the mystical (supernatural - spiritual) theology of christianity. Once again I was not disappointed.While do not agree with all of the Orthodox dogma, I find much that I do share.

Peter Bowerman has one of the few \\"voices\\" that bears a ring of truth rather than hype to me. My aversion to hype is one of the reasons I struggle with even trying copywriting for real. Your books resonate with me because he is doing it everyday.This is as opposed to those who have done it for a thousand years and might not have to work as hard as the rest of us in this day and age. That's not to negate their success or status but getting advice from someone who has already made their fortune and can sell on name recognizability alone is very different than having someone who's risen from the trenches in the same era that new aspiring creatives are coming from.I say creative btw because much of what Bowerman advises should (will?) work for my design aspirations as well as writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the paper it's written on","review":"I just paid $US13 for this book (362 pages PDF) and read it in less than 2 hours.

It will take hard work, a will to spend your time on activities that lead to success, and an extremely optimistic attitude that will carry you through the slow days. I do believe though that Peter is onto something here.I can't imagine trying to break into writing without having any professional experience. However, if you commit to making the effort no matter how much rejection you initially encounter, I think that it is doable.For those of us already in writing, it's a no-brainer.

The colour shots (those that aren't faded overall to pink, that is) have tone reproduction that is harsh, contrasty and garish.I've bought other Schiffer books and been happy with the print quality so this one came as a surprise and a big let-down.

Now I am in and out of the shower in minutes, and the pressure is amazing!I called Oxygenics and talked to the salesperson who warned me if your pressure is NOT low, because of its special design for ultra-low pressure, this showerhead will make the pressure lower, or even close the water off altogether.So be forewarned: this head is only for very low pressure water; if you have regular or normal pressure, buy a different Oxygenics product.

Her memoir of her life on the country estate, trying to recreate an English garden in the unforgiving climate and soil of Northern Gemany is revealing not only in its picture of \\"Woman put in her place\\" but the rigid society in which she lives. Dealing with three babies (each 13 months apart), a cynical, smug (you want to smack him) husband, conventions (as the lady of the estate she could only direct the gardner, never soil her own hands) she struggles valiantly to establish her own personae. Yes, she probably was not an easy person to live with - some of her own nastiness comes through, but read as a blunt portrayal women's roles at that time, you have compassion for her. The book was her first and a best seller in its day."},{"rating":"2","title":"A gem of a read","review":"Elizabeth And Her German Garden by Elizabeth von Arnim was such a delight. It was my company before bedtime for a few weeks and it was such a gentle, lovely read to send me to sleep. Von Arnim talks quite a bit about her gorgeous garden and her seemingly idyllic, pastoral life in her country house in Germany, of playing with her charming young daughters, bantering with her husband \`Man of Wrath', entertaining a not-so-welcome house guest over the holidays. This book was such a gem of a read! The Solitary Summer is the companion to Elizabeth and her German Garden, and I can't wait to get started on that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, boring, boring","review":"I like Edwardian literature, I like women's literature. But this is pointless meandering, self-indulgent musing. It's not particularly funny. Who wants to read paragraphs on her flowers? There is no shape - what she writes about is trivial and random. Much on the garden, a few comments on people - mostly condescending about housewives and peasants. A few comments on cute things her kids say. None of this makes a publishable book. Her faintly complaining tone is tedious - she is clearly rich, with many servants and a privileged lifestyle. I can't believe this never went out of print and remains popular."},{"rating":"2","title":"Honest","review":"Honest is the only way to describe Lanford Wilson's Balm in Gilead. The title refering to the biblical verse about a balm to heal the mortal souls of sinners only scratches the surface of the lost individuals one finds in this funny, heart wrenching balad of street life.

It has great characters and dialog, plus the stop-motion and cinematography are breathtaking (make sure you see it on blu-Ray). The only small downside might be the plot, which is a bit generic, but it follows the story from the book. As to how much a child will enjoy this, I do not know, it has some heavy adult themes in it. The comedy is very offbeat, as always in Wes Anderson's films. I don't normally do reviews on here, but I was so amazed by this movie, that I just had to write something and hope it brings more attention to it. I didn't think it was the best movie of 2009, either. It was just a very, very fun, charming watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clever and funny.","review":"Definitely enjoyed it. Very cleverly done with some very funny moments. Another great Wes Andersen flick; if you're a fan you won't want to miss it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Film","review":"There is something special about Wes Anderson films, and Fantastic Mr. Fox definitely has it. Anderson makes fun of human (or animal!) frailties, but leaves us feeling good about ourselves and the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Masterpiece!","review":"This is without a doubt in my top 5 favorite movies ever.The humor is complex and exactly how I like it - a little adult without anything downright inappropriate (my favorite is the use of the word \\"cuss\\" in the place of any obscenities - as in \\"this is going to be a total clustercuss\\"). The visuals/sets are stunning and oddly soothing (Wes' choice of warm colors is flawless and well detailed). The story is hilarious, the characters are wonderful and the voices are perfect. Bogis, Bunce and Bean are a riot just as much as the animal characters.I laughed out loud several times while watching this, didn't want it to be over and continue watching it on a monthly basis almost two years after first seeing it! Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous Mr Fox.","review":"Fantastic Mr Fox is just that, fantastic. I will admit I had trepidations going into this film with the stop action, but after the credits rolled I understood why Wes held out for his artistic vision. The film boasts an all-star cast of voices, lead by George Clooney and Meryl Streep. The story is geniunely interesting and heartwarming, with sarcastic humor sprinkled throughout. Overall, Mr Dahl's beloved book has never looked more appealing.

Our dislike of the movie doesn't come through an inability to enjoy Wes Anderson, as we have seen and enjoyed \\"Rushmore\\", \\"The Life Aquatic\\", \\"The Royal Tenenbaums\\", and \\"The Squid and the Whale\\".I couldn't help thinking what a dull movie it would be if one just replaced the animal heads with human heads. To us as diehard Dahl fans, the movie failed to capture the spirit of the book... it winked at the adults too much and really did not speak to children. The main characters were prettified and yet charmless. The dialogue... meh. It was kind of a generic rom-com but because the characters are animals, it must be for kids, right?As a children's movie, may compare with Pixar, but really not in the league of Aardman Animations or Miyazaki. But then again, what is?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly awful adaptation of a fun book","review":"I honestly can't believe how many people have given rave reviews of this movie. It was awful.

I could barely stand to finish it! This movie was purchased for my daughter for Christmas and it was so raunchy that I wouldn't let them watch it!

The reviews on the box were so great! I gave it a chance and watched or about 40 minutes, and what a disappointment. Poor story line and poor graphics. Boring characters. See if you can find a preview first. You might like it! My copy is on its way to The Salvation Army."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull","review":"Based on other reviews, I guess I missed something. I'll keep it short: my kids (7, 9, 12) were literally yawning and asking how long this movie was after 1/2 an hour.As for myself, I was expecting a lot based on the movie pictures I had seen. But the style gets old really quick, something is definitely missing as far as graphics go, although I couldn't say what precisely.Clooney's voice is, simply put, boring as can be. Most characters are creepy, but not in a fun way, they just make you wish you were somewhere else. The story doesn't go anywhere, and doesn't want to end. I usually like offbeat creations, but this one simply leaves a bad taste, if you remember anything after seeing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible movie.","review":"I had high hopes for this movie, as the \\"experts\\" gave it glowing reviews. Thank goodness I rented this from the library before buying it! This has to be one of the worst movies ever created. It was so boring I could not even make it through the first half of the movie. The characters are flat and unmemorable. The voices were uninterested and almost seemed bored themselves. There really is no plot or purpose to the movie. No wonder it did so poorly in the box office."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best, most clever movie ever!","review":"This movie is one of the funnier movies I have ever seen.

Action, suspense, and many laughs await viewers ages 4 and up."},{"rating":"2","title":"What the Cuss","review":"This was a not so clever but funny movie. A fox that gives up stealing for the family life that he eventually goes back on his animal instincts to steal. Large cast of actors. I thought the addition of saying cuss instead of any cuss word was really funny. I would show this movie to kids. It wasnt offensive or obscene or very crude. Still had many crude moments as does many movies now adays but it was great to watch nonetheless."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Spell-binding Stand-out!","review":"There's plenty of coverage already on how unique and well-done this 'delightfully enjoyable for all ages' animated fantasy is!

Two enthusiastic thumbs up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing to our family.","review":"The animation here is quirky and the story is ok. But if our family's reaction (ages 57, 55, 34, 28 and almost 4) is any guide, this one's not worth buying. I don't think we will ever watch it again. It certainly failed our toddler's critical review. She announced, as it was ending, \\"I don't like it.\\" This from a child who, if she likes a film, asks to see it over and over again. She loves Horton (Hears a Who), Up, Kung Fu Panda, and the Bizard (Wizard) of Oz. She will sit through long films from beginning to end. But this one she needed some minor cohersion to get through."},{"rating":"1","title":"odd movie","review":"I can understand why the movie was not a box office success.

Intriqued at how an animated character could possibly be preppy, I watched the movie. Boy, am I ever glad that I did. This is really a stunny piece of work. Wonderful story and the stop-motion animation is really quite something. The details come through after you've watched it at least four times or so! Certainly not just a movie for children. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie is, well, fantastic! (if you'll pardon the pun)","review":"The story and dialog are hilarious! It's a great family movie because the kids enjoy the claymation and animal characters, but the humor is entertaining for adults.

Excellent single frame animation with an interesting plot. This is a great family movie. My kids liked it so much that I bought it from Amazon. Classified as animation, I'd up my rating to 5 stars. George Clooney does a great job with the character."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Fantastic Mr. Fox is fabulous!","review":"The fantastic Mr. Fox is a delightful movie about a fox who turns from his natural animal ways and tries to take up a new profession to appease his wife, Felicity. Mr. Fox is not entirely successful in his abandonment of his foxy ways and wants to have one last score against some hated local farmers. Fox enlists his forest friends in this venture but of course everything goes wrong. One of the sweetest things about this movie is the lack of standard profanity. By that I mean, throughout the movie one will hear cuss words as in \\"What the cuss did you just say?\\" but nothing more. The stop action animation of the characters is fluid and very well done and the voice actors are some of my favorites, George Clooney, as Mr. Fox and Meryl Streep, as Felicity Fox. My family and I have watched this film repeatedly and I would recommend it to families with children 8+."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful adaptation!","review":"Loved this book when I was a kid, and I love the adaptation as an adult. I admit I'm a big Wes Anderson fan, and this film definitely reflects many qualities familiar in his other films. If you're a Wes Anderson fan, I would say you'll enjoy Fantastic Mr. Fox; if you're a Roald Dahl fan, it really does depend (I know people who dislike this film quite a bit); if you like both, I'd say you're in for a treat.

Fantastic Mr. Fox is one of my favorite childhood books, and as is often the case it's hard to separate the book from the movie. The book is short, whimsical, and, quite simply, fantastic. To make a movie they had to add so much stuff that they should have just called it something else. I might have enjoyed the movie if I hadn't read the book so many times.The biggest disappointment is that since Roald Dahl grew up in Wales and England, in my head the characters always had British accents. The way he writes is definitely English, not American. The voices (and dialogue) in this movie are awful!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I also had a 'what the' look while watching this","review":"I'm sorry, I thought this was awful. I didn't hate it, but I didn't think it was great.The stop motion looked bad, although I couldn't tell if that was the intention of the animators or not. Even though I had read the book, I just couldn't find interest in the plotline. I had to constantly turn up the television volume because the voices were so low and quiet.I couldn't stand the animal characters and was cheering for the farmers about halfway through it. This movie was not a delight, and a bit disturbing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrific butchering of a fantastic story","review":"While I realize movies-based-on-books often only loosely follow the book, this waste of 1.5 hours neither remotely sticks to the original characters or plot created by Roald Dahl nor even attempts to capture any of his whimsical adventurous flair. The Book/movie is titled 'THE FANTASTIC MR. FOX' which is a catch phrase of sorts in the book but I did not catch once in the movie. The movie heads in a whole different direction for plot, the characters are not even slightly as portrayed in the book....very disappointed, don't waste your time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not satisfied","review":"I bought this movie to show to a group of kids for a Parent's Night Out event at church.I had my 9 year old son preview it for me and when he told me I probably shouldn't show itI thought I better watch it.

Had to go a different routefor the evening movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can you say \\"Boring\\"?","review":"I saw this movie in the theater, the history of how it was created was clever and the preview made it look quite interesting.Well the story was weak, the plot un-entertaining, and the ending - dull."},{"rating":"1","title":"surprised.","review":"I have waited so long to get this from the library so I could enjoy a highly rated animation. My husband was asleep in no time and I picked up a book to read after about 45 mins. I did not like that the colors of the clothes and setting were all about the same shade.

When I read the backcover description of the story it sounded like something I would really enjoy - I could not have been more mistaken. The plot had promise, but the writing was awful. The book was full of mistakes and contradictions. The \\"witty banter\\" between Claire and Ian was supposed to make Claire seem charming (I think), but instead made her seem moronic. The fact that all Claire had to do to distract Ian from his intended plan was flash him a huge smile made him seem like a complete pushover. What a waste of time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read","review":"I liked this one. It reminded me alittle of Suzanne Brockmann's way of telling a story in a story.Claire finds her husband dead on his birthday. She is at the point of asking for a divorce. But with his death she finds herself plunged into a mystery, not only for today but a mystery connected to a spy during WWII.Ian Marshall is a Nazi Hunter that her husband contacted before he was killed. He has his own reasons for hunting the spy.We learn the whole story, through flashbacks that touch our hearts. A wonderful love story that didn't have a proper end.Togather, through twists and turns we are kept on edge looking for our spy. This book truely has a different and wonderful ending. I greatly enjoyed the adventure and romance."},{"rating":"2","title":"This was a good book","review":"This was the first book that I've read by Brenda Joyce and I really liked it.

I would definitly read a book by her again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious Claire","review":"I too wondered who would bother to be around Claire, as detective. She was tediously strident and annoying. There just wasn't enough romance building time between she and Ian and it wasn't believable that he could fall for her given her behavior.

I am a huge fan of Nora Roberts, Linda Howard, Elizabeth Lowell, Jayne Ann Krentz and Catherine Coulter so obviously enjoy books of this genre. I was looking forward to a new discovery (for me) but I found Claire, the protagonist, to be extremely annoying and thoroughly unlikeable and kept hoping that Ian Marshall would be successfull in his attempts to get rid of her. Their relationship felt contrived and implausible. Definitely not a book I would recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"I've enjoyed other books by this author, but I think she's had a recent brain transplant, because this book is awful.

I haven't read all the novel yet. I'm a very slow reader, but what happened in 1935 left me breathless and I would have loved if she had developed that part a little more. Wonderful romantic suspense (more suspense than romance), that's what I like. This novel in my opinion is beautifully written, I love the style of this author, and I would recommend this book without a doubt.

Students who go home for Christmas will understand \\"Home for the Holidays,\\" even though it is quite out of date too; the humor endures even though many of the references are out of date (dress-studs?).All in all, a wonderful book even though some of the humor is a little hard to get to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Robert Benchley Was One of the Great Humorists","review":"Although some of his work is dated, the writings of Robert Benchley are classic humor and should be included in the curriculum of every English class or creative writing class.

Nash, the local DCI, isn't at all thrilled to have Kincaid on his patch, but Kincaid isn't convinced Nash is up to the job and finagles his way into acting as a consultant. While Kincaid looks into the other guests first-hand, he sends his partner, Sergeant Gemma James, to check into their backgrounds at home. The other time-share guests all have unique personalities, with enough flaws and secrets to keep the reader guessing until the murderer is finally unmasked.

Of course both characters, the writer George Sand and the poet Alfred de Musset, are neither conventional nor logical people. Unfortunately the story is not very engaging; if one knows nothing about Sand or Musset, it might not even make a lot of sense. All I can say here is that they let Italy fool them, which Italy will do every time. Stories in which people run off, thinking travel and new scenery will cure them of all their ills and relationship problems are mundane and always lead in the same direction-disaster. In this film, it becomes melodramatic when Sand and Musset travel around Europe (rather scandalously); Musset is a madman, and Italy just makes everything worse!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Foils for love","review":"What did George Sand do to make her name famous? What did one of her lovers Alfred de Musset do? Look it up on the internet.

I think that this book would suit someone who wanted to learn that poetry does not need to rhyme and that they can be very freeform. Woodson has a gift for writing poetry, but not for creating a plot. I would not recommend this book to someone looking for a great book, but for a quick read.

(Super NightShot Infrared System With Sony's NightShot Infrared System you can capture natural looking video, even when shooting in low light. Record subjects up to 20 feet away using the built-in infrared system.)NATURAL the key word, i thought that sony came out with a new technology eliminating the green hue shown in infrared, i even called sony to confirm before i bought this camera. the sales person even asked his supervisor to answer my question. (IM ASSUMING \\"NATURAL\\" MEANS IN FULL COLOR RIGHT.

Sony's software is Windows-only and their proprietary AVCHD format is not supported by anyone other than Sony (so far) it seems. There is not any software I could find for the Mac that works with the camcorder. Perhaps this will change with time.The software that Sony provides is pretty bad and in fact, I have not gotten the video playback to work cleanly. The user interface is clunky and not intuitive.The hardware (i.e .the camcorder itself) seems pretty solid and usable but I'm very disappointed in the rest. I'm sending mine back."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO WAY!","review":"It's just irresponsible for a company to put out a new product that has NO SUPPORT/ EDITING SOLUTION AVAILABLE.

And even then do not believe it, but treat it as a reasonable hypothesis until such time as you can prove it for yourself- BuddhaThis book gives the reader a true sense of brotherhood with all the human family, including the other beings that inhabit this planet whom are on their own separate evolutionary journeys.It speaks of reincarnation, astral plane travel, life forces, and kingdoms of nature, mental thought, group souls, and the progressive journey of the human evolutional ego.I often ponder, like so many others, into what is the true meaning of life - what is the purpose, who am I, why am I here.

Over $300 later, I thought I had everything. Not so! On the very first day there were items on the menu that were not part of the shopping list. And meal preparation?! Not as easy as described for a new mom with a newborn. I needed a personal chef to get everything done for me.

It's really great!The recipes take some time to prepare, and some of them were really unappealing to me, but when I ate them, they were great!

It worked and I didn't even follow the plan 100% of the time. While the shopping and meal preparations do take time, and often the quantity leaves you with leftovers that you can't consume (because you need to follow the next day's menu), it does work.

It is marketed as if you can close the van and actually transport it. The several little pieces required for the stunts have to be disassembled and crammed into the van during any futile attempt to close it. The car launcher which is essential to perform any of the stunts periodically jams. My 6 year old has barely touched the toy. I wouldn't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"FIND SOMETHING BETTER FOR YOUR LITTLE GUY","review":"This was the number 1 toy on my sons wish list for his birthday. This toy was very disappointing. Cheap,clunky and FRUSTRATING! There are too many little parts that need to be attached, detached and re-attached every time you want to close it. It doesn't close without a struggle. My 5-year-old already lost some of the accessories and the handle snapped off as we were walking to Grandpa's house some 6 houses away. He never really plays with it until he sees the flashy and deceptively slick commercial on TV and then he excitedly pulls it out and, within 5 minutes, becomes frustrated with it and walks away - disappointed once again. His birthday was in October and I hope to locate the reciept and get a refund. What a waste. And worse...seeing the disenchantment in his eyes everytime he pulls it out of his toy box.

My son loves the parts and likes to watch Dad try to make the stunts work. He also loves opening it up and spreading it out all over the floor. He wants more for his birthday. (Yikes!) The worst part of this toy is trying to get all of the bits and pieces to stay inside while trying to fold it up. Patience! Patience! No throwing toys! The button that is supposed to hold it closed only works when the truck is sitting undisturbed. If you move it or, God forbid, pick it up, it pops open and spills everywhere.

The guitars barely sound like guitars, the drums are a total mess, the bass is unintelligible. This disk is a total 100% rip off for fans of Marble Sheep.They probably wanted to make a disk that was louder than all the other disks on the market. Unfortunately for anyone who is subjected to this 'music', that means selling people a distorted mess. Sure it's loud, but it sounds like garbage so what was the point? To make people think they have a blown speaker?This disk really is horrible.

Just a little bit of cheap twine to secure it under the car. There are only 2 security grommets (one on either side) and so it pops off every time there's a gust of wind.I had to wait 2 weeks longer than the Amazon estimated time to delivery. The company sent me an email telling me it was taking longer so that they could custom fit the cover for my car. I'm more than a little bit insulted by that now.

Having lived in Egypt (where I read the novel 11 years ago) and studied Egyptian history, I can say that the work more than accomplishes the primary job of historical fiction--it transports the reader to another time and place, making that time and that place come alive.However, Zayni Barakat is, like much of Naguib Mahfouz's later work, a pointed commentary on modern Egyptian politics. In particular, it is the story of police surveillance and what it means to live -- and work for -- a police state. Al-Ghitani captures the dis-ease and perversity of the Nasserist police state admirably. The novel thus deserves to be read both as a diversion and as an education in contemporary Arab politics."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Touch of Pinkeye Maybe...","review":"A very slow moving script, misdirected direction, and a sappy, and do I mean sappy ending really throw this film a curveball. I enjoyed these characters, especially the real relationship between a gay Muslim man and his mother. I didn't care much for his boyfriend, he was manipulative and a cheater. Frankly our hero could have done better, and derserved better. The ending was a little too tidy for me. These were complex characters in a complex situation. The really stupid part of the film is the imaginary friend/spirit guide in the guise of the ghost of Cary Grant. This part was very distracting, and was used to lighten the mood. For the collector this movie has very little importance nor entertainment. Watch \\"Torch Song Trilogy\\" again. It'll have more suprises and laughs even on the third go around. A real disapointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sickeningly Sappy","review":"Being a Queer As Folk viewer, I thought I could handle any sappy, trite and overly sentimental screenplay. Apparently not. This could have been a really interesting story about a gay man torn between obligation to his family's culture versus his right to act from the values of HIS culture (Canadian).Instead, we get an imaginary friend who is suppose to be Cary Grant who gives him advice. About half way through the film I just couldn't stand it anymore and had to fast forward through the Cary Grant sequences. If this film had been a really campy comedy, Cary Grant could have worked -- but....ah, no. It was just baaaaad.The only good thing in this film was the cranky mother who was funny and just gorgeous to look at."},{"rating":"1","title":"How do you say \\"downright terrible!\\" in Hindi/Urdu?","review":"Why imitate a movie if you are going to do a worse job of it? \\"Touch of Pink\\" is nothing but \\"Wedding Banquet\\" and \\"Bend It Like Beckham\\" mixed together and made worse. The Cary Grant character is just filler for a vacuous film. Don't be fooled: this is just as Eurocentric as it can be. Just because a man of color is on the cover doesn't mean that people of color aren't thrust to the margins. In this film, the white lover's body is seen in stages of undress and with other partners. We never get to see much of the Indian man's body. He is chaste while his lover gets to taste the smorgasbord. This film and \\"Chutney Popcorn\\" can battle for the worst, sell-outish movies of all time. Don't get me started on how vexed I was that I spent money to see this waste of film. When awesome movies like \\"Khush\\" and \\"Fire\\" exist, don't waste your time on lightweight fodder like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Saw in theater...walked out","review":"Saw this a couple years ago in the theater. As a NYC gay man who generally enjoys independent movies, I found this film formulaic, shallow, and just plain uninteresting. The screenplay was boring, the characters unappealing, the acting mediocre at best (even for a low budget indie). In fact, although I paid for two tickets (me and my partner's), we chose to leave approximately 15 minutes before the ending. I just couldn't take the agony any longer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Birdcage meets Bollywood?","review":"I found this film to be highly entertaining - a sweet look at the struggles of a gay Indian man living in America to come out to his family and introduce his boyfriend.

These extra musical dimensions have always come from R&B and soul, as obviously these musical genres have very strongly influenced Cray. So, it's no surprise that an album like Sweet Potato Pie should occur. This is a strong album that has more akin to Midnight Stroll than Strong Persuader or Shame + A Sin, calling our attention to the Stax/Volt era of R&B evolution. It's also no surprise that the name of Otis Redding should come up in the credits. \\"Trick or Treat\\" is a wonderful Redding cover, and the whole album pays homage to Redding as Cray exercises his best soulful vocal impersonation of the late lamented soul singer throughout. Overall, a strong effort and a soulful step in the right direction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lighter but not lacking...","review":"Some will complain \\"not heavy enough\\" but this release definitely is not lacking in the songwriting ability that are Lana and company. When the intensity of Lana's other releases just don't fit the moment, you'll find yourself reaching for this disc. The original material is captivating and there are hypnotizing remakes of \\"A Whiter Shade of Pale\\" and \\"California Dreamin.'\\" The disc runs just shy of an hour but could be easily extended once \\"Carry Me Home\\" hits your speakers. This is an incredible tune that screams \\"replay\\" each time you hear it so it might just delay your getting to the rest of the selections!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Top Spin 2 is not that great","review":"Top spin 2 was not done well for the PC.

A wonderful gift for your spirit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting concepts, many missing details, sloppy","review":"This book is aimed at developers already advanced in VB, COM, MTS, and SQL. The author presents an interesting generic framework for implementing persistent distributed objects using Microsoft technologies. Most unfortunately, many details are missing from the example code, some of it depends on code not presented until future chapters or at all, and the downloadable code does not match what is presented in the book. Even within the book itself, some of the UML class models don't match what is described in the text. The concepts of the framework were useful to me, especially the generic database classes, but I expect more attention to detail in a technical book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Resource...","review":"I recently rolled off of a project that was predominantly a Microsoft platform. Paul's book for me, was a great help from start to finish. The title is an extremely accurate description of how he presents valuable information to the reader.A pleasant addendum to Paul's book, is the fact that he builds and refers to a very real world enterprise application, using all of the components that he covers thoroughly: VB, MTS, IIS, MSSQL, and XML. For example, Chapter 7 covers the \\"Class Manager Library\\" which the author builds in great detail. He covers all components with equal committment, and then follows it up with great instruction on how to take it to the web in Chap. 12.Cheers to Tindall for writing a succinct and well thought out book that has an extremely honest title, and jeers to those who attempt to lead you to buy their book via a misleading market buzzwords and fluff. Thanks for the honest picture - it helped me get a great project review!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong.","review":"Some of these songs seem different than the studio versions that I am used to from Highway 61 and Blonde on Blonde. For example, on \\"Visions of Johanna\\" this book has it in the key of G. As far as I can tell it's in the key of A. You don't even use the G chord to play the song. The fact that they never tell you when to use a capo is also suspicious. I know it's hard to find tab for some of Dylan's classics but this book is no more helpful than some tab you might find on the internet. It just costs more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible. 1 star for the picture on the cover..","review":"This book left me so frustrated. I tried for a week to play some of the songs while listening to the cd's of his, but after some time I just gave up. The tabs are just wrong (supposedly they are right somewhere, but they don't come close the cd versions)Now then. You have no options but to search the internet and try to find something that sounds close, and then try very hard to listen to the cd and add in little details that you won't find in the internet tab. This is probably a better route anyway because you are growing musically.So.. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME, MONEY, AND HAPPINESS ON THIS BOOK."},{"rating":"1","title":"A real piece of garbage","review":"The tab is aweful!

It has more episodes than the standard volumes. The third season in my opinion was the best of Sonic X. By the way, if you buy this the cover does NOT look like the one Amazon is displaying!!! It only has Sonic on it in that pose on there, and there's a nighttime background with a spaceship behind him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super cool","review":"Super cool anime, 5 of 5 stars, but if you are really a big sonic fan get the original japanese version!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a quality product","review":"It should be noted that the Amazon description for this product is wrong. It does NOT contain both English and Japanese audio tracks. No 4Kids DVDs ever do (save for a few rare, uncut releases).Sonic X may not be one of 4Kids WORST dubbed animes, but it ranks fairly high. Things are edited out for seemingly no reason, even the mildest of violence is cut, Japanese text and refferences are blanked and not even translated, and entire episodes are re-arranged. Not to mention, plenty of refferences to the Sonic games are not translated properly.Do not buy this set if you are looknig for a high-quality, entertaining product."},{"rating":"1","title":"A series that was great in Japanese but these season has been terribly butchered","review":"This was the WORST dubbed season of the series ever, I would stick to just downloading the originals or finding imports of them on eBay if you can. The way this season was butchered, the way these characters were voiced, The replacement music added, the stuff changed in this dub, insulting. Jason Griffith is the WORST voice actor I have ever heard, have you actually listened to him in Sonic Riders? The way he made Sonic say \\"Yeah\\" compared to the way Ryan said it in \\"Sonic Advance 3\\" and other games is insulting to the character. I was originally looking forward to this but then when I saw how much it was altered and edited, I just could not watch anymoreDon't buy this DVD, you would be better off just recording the episodes off of TV for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't really know tennis balls","review":"I am not qualified to professionally rate tennis balls, but here is my two cents.

All this movie supplied was superstitious ideas that only the uneducated will take as unquestionable truth. The movie demonizes the middle east because of 'terrorists' (who obviously live in caves) that can apparently 'build' nuclear bombs. The film should look at the root causes like the origin of this so called terrorist behavior. Could this behavior be the direct result of the West occupying the Middle east for soo many years?

After using interviews with random people on the street to show how unaware and uneducated the general public is about nuclear weapons, the filmmaker made a huge mistake using these people's opinions as support for his policy recommendations. Some of the footage, supposedly portraying accidents, is suspect because the explosions looked more like purposeful test runs. And after showing how \\"easy\\" it is to build a nuclear warhead, it's never explained how the US and Russia eliminating their ballistic missile supply would actually prevent terrorists from building their own. The knowledge won't just disappear, you know! If you feel like sitting through a lobbying group's two-hour commercial that resorts to scare tactics and doesn't mention ballistic missile defense projects once, by all means go see this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disturbing and unfortunately real!","review":"More than happy with the content of this documentary. It confirms that absolute mess this world is in due to greedy self indulgent politicians and war mongers, and that includes all nations that have nuclear arms and those trying to acquire them. There is no justification for storing 100's or 1000's or nuclear war heads on the pretense of deterrence.Russia unfortunately is indicative of a what happens when a countries political and economic system fails, it placed more emphasis on containing food storage facilities than nuclear war heads or waste, absolutely crazy.Worth watching for those who want to know the facts about the state of the worlds nuclear (arms) industry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Da Bears","review":"Came out looking like the picture-- if you're not the Bears fanatic your fiend is, this will up your Bear cred (and if you are, this will suit you).

The sentence structure is weak and as a reader from Huntsville noted, the book is chock full of run on sentences.It is cruel to ridicule any place as somebody will always be offended. Huntsville is the home of NASA and is a very up to the minute high tech engineering mecca.This book only has flattering pictures of the girls to recommend it. The book is yet another cranked out money maker for those who have a monetary interest in the Olsen girls. As beautiful and talented as these girls are, they did not create the \\"Dual Star\\" enterprise or any of the sundry money making machines to which they have been enslaved since infancy.

I have always had a hard time with Toshiba's customer service, so I decided not to contact them, and return the PDA back to Amazon.I think Toshiba has realized some of the problems in this PDA, which is why they have come out with a new line altogether.

The problem is that when you juxtipose it against a fresh vinly with Hirsh boost recorded on a CD it's not even in the same category. Start pressing the albums again for all ELP productions.

The album does suffer today because so much has happened in synthesizer, drum and guitar technology but the whole conception of Tarkus and its implementation make it seem like it was made yesterday. The strength of the album is the music fitting into an apocalyptic conception which is rendered through music, like War of the Worlds.

Trilogy, Brain Salad Surgery, and Pictures at an Exhbition are all consistently brilliant, and while the self-titled debut is a bit inconsistent, it definitely has its moments. However, Tarkus is consistently bad and in my opinion one of the worst albums of all time. Of all the 20+ minute suites of the prog genre (Atom Heart Mother, Karn Evil 9, Close to the Edge, 2112, Lizard, etc) Tarkus is by far the worst. It is pretentious, boring, barely listenable, and lacks any kind of musical coherence. The other tracks are all pretty weak as well, Bitches Crystal and Time and a Place being the only spots on the album with any kind of musical value. Are You Ready Eddy is vomit-inducing; it doesnt even have the comical value of the far superior Benny the Bouncer. If you are just getting into ELP but Trilogy and Brain Salad Surgery, but avoid this unless you want to laugh at how bad prog can be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Takes a while to get into, but it's worth it","review":"It took me a few listens to learn to enjoy this, but when I stopped trying to match up the music to the \\"story\\" on the inside cover and just tried to enjoy myself, I discovered that the Tarkus piece is one of the coolest tracks I've ever heard.

Disc #3 also has all of the 2012 stereo remixes in DVD quality.Disc #2 is the cd quality of the remixes, interesting stuff and I'll leave it open to personal tastes but I enjoyed them. Certainly won't replace the original version but it's a nice change if your a fanatic like me.Disc #1 is definitely an improvement over my late '90's Rhino cd.The packaging is a tri-fold with a slim booklet with nothing terribly new other than some info right off the start about Steve Wilson who was in charge of the remastering process.So overall a worthwhile purchase and I'm basically happy with it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Luv Tarkus","review":"Glad to have this in my collection with my other ELP music.

When studying US history we typically look at the Americans stand piont i thought it was interesting to see if at another angle. Tayo was a very bold character and i really enjoyed seeing his situation progress, and liked watching his life unfold the it did. I thought the book made a lot of sense and although it had a dark, morbid tone at first it really came to be an uplifting sort of story. Silko did a great job describing life on an Indian reservation after WWII. Reading of Tayos both physical, and spiritual journey made for a great book, and i would recommend this story to any high school, or college english, or history class."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a terrible waste of time.","review":"This book describes in tedious detail the many problems of a young Native American named Tayo.

I think that Silko is meaning to addess the problems that Native Americans face, but she does so by accusing whites of being \\"devils\\" and \\"evil spirits\\" whose only goal in life is to ruin the Native Americans. My final opinion of this book is that Tayo is too pathetic to be the protagonist of an entire novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"The only good use of this book is recycling it.","review":"Leslie Silko, through her intricate nonsense, tries to explain that all of the \\"white\\" people are evil.

And to choose a foolish character such as Tayo as a protagonist, when considering all the follies he experiences, is absolutely ridiculous.The book is so choppy that you'll get lost while reading. It supposedly contains a \\"plot\\", however I don't find it as a linear plot like other novels. The reader will be more tangled with the flashbacks and mythical nonsense.My final synopsis: THIS BOOK SUX. IT'S THEME IS BASICALLY: WHITE PEOPLE SUCK.

So many kids hated it, our teacher isn't going to make next years class read it. Throughout the book it will be talking about one thing and in midsentence it will change to another subject and tense.

I have taught it in courses on American Indian literature and in courses on American novels (no ethnic categories). It can stand up against any American novel you can name, in terms of its emotional impact, its artistic achievement, its prose style, its narrative structure -- anything. I admit it is a challenging novel, but it is well worth the work. It is best if you can read it with others, or in the context of a class or online study guide. Some reviewers here are high school students who read it for class, and I admit that may be asking a lot of high school student to dig into the novel as much as it needs/deserves. But that can be done, especially with the right kind of guidance. However, it is hard for me to imagine teaching a university-level course on American Indian literature without teaching Ceremony."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never Thought of it That Way","review":"This was an interesting and saddening book. Leslie Marmon Silko brings a new perspective to American society through her main character Tayo, a Mestizo (half Native American, half Mexican) World War II verteran. In her novel, Silko challenges the principles of both Caucasians and her own Native American people while describing Native American life in the 20th century.At first glance I assumed that this would be another attack on todays Caucasians who are taking the heat for the past. However, after looking deeply into the novel, I realized that the novel is more of a critique of society rather than the people in it. Don't get me wrong, Silko gets a few good shots in on both Native Americans and Caucasians, but her overall message is delivered in a way that makes you question several things. This novel's boundaries lie exclusively in the reader's mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply the finest novel yet written about native America.","review":"Silko's use of non-linear spacio-temporality, Pueblo mythology and cosmology, universal themes of communal and self-identity, and her emphasis on geography and place make this novel the best yet written by and about the indigenous people of North America. Although difficult at first to read because of the intense suffering of the protagonist, Tayo, the story itself becomes a ceremony of healing. When Tayo at last recognizes the interconnectedness of all things, he acknowledges the necessity of evil as well as good in this world. Contrary to some misinformed readers' reviews, Silko does NOT blame whites for the presence of evil; rather, Silko presents evil as an integral component in any holistic view of reality."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for those who care about the native mind.","review":"This book contains a great insight into the workings of the native American mind. European Americans cannot understand the native thought process. It IS truly different. There are other ways of looking at things other than \\"work hard and save your money\\" --- this book will help a person understand a different thought process."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard Time","review":"I needed to read this for a class in desert lit, and I found the book to be difficult. Not because of the non-linier format but because of the authors style. Stylistically, she has much to say and needs to say it. This book was easy to put down!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The best of times, the worst of times...","review":"Ratings for this book were 5 stars and 1 star when I first visited here :)None in between ! Ceremony was required reading for many too young to grasp the 140+ word sentences in the first few pages. For old men over fifty, we can cope with that technique, unhappily. The native American situation in America and a pow camp for contrast was most vivid. One reviewer stated that that Ceremony avoided bitterness and racial animosity; I couldn't disagree more. Of course it was there and justly deserved ! Another reviewer stated that we can't rely on Silko for accurate data on Reservations. I have been to one in central Wisconsin, Silko is right. One is a majority when it is the truth. Silko needs more years, and perhaps a writing class or two."},{"rating":"1","title":"You either love the book or hate it.","review":"It took forever for me to read this book. I thought the way Silko choose to write it, intertwined with myths and chants, was beautiful, but made it difficult to understand. I found that the story line was pretty slow and didn't seem to go much of anywhere. I would definetly recommend this book to anyone who wants to see an interesting writting style, but if you want to get into a plot with strong charactors, then you should definetly choose something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haven't finished it, but so far it's good","review":"I have to read this for a lame LBST class, but I'm trying to make the best of it. As far as I can tell, it is pretty well written, it's just a shame that I don't care. My teacher, however, gives it rave reviews. If you're just looking for something to read that's interesting. Search Dean Koonz or Greg Hurwitz. Unless you are actually into anthropology, then this book might be for you. And why I spent this much time reviewing a book I don't even care about...well...I guess I don't know. Hahaha"},{"rating":"2","title":"Silko's best","review":"This slim book contains wisdom that transcends the local American Indian cultures portrayed within. Witches and evil exist in this world; learn to deal with them, because you can never make them go away.Read this book more than once, and do a little research if you're not familiar with Laguna Pueblo or Navaho cultures. It is well worth your while."},{"rating":"2","title":"American Heritage","review":"I thought that \\"Ceremony\\", written by Leslie Marmon Silko, was a very good book. It told a story of a Native American and the life he returned to after coming home from World War II. The topic of Native Americans and the life they lived in the reservations is not a very populat topic in American History because it always seems to be over shadowed by things deemed more important. Tayo, the main character in this story, has several flash backs from the war and he is very sick when he returns home. Because he is half white he gets a lot of greif from some of the pure Indians that live on the reservation. Some of the flash backs include parts of his child hood which depict a poor life style in which he lived in, even after he went to live with his aunt. His flashbacks are worrying the others on the reservation and all the doctors that he sees are not able to cure him. His grandmother eventually calls an old medicine man to help Tayo. I would recommend this book to most reading levels."},{"rating":"2","title":"decent shoe","review":"the shoe is overall good..fits well and looks good. its a little rough on the feet tho..would want a loafer a bit more comfortable, but they do look good w/khakis, jeans. the price right now is unbeatable..i paid 90 at macys in the store so get them here cheaper"},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly what I was looking for","review":"This kind of movie is completely unpredictible and bizzare.

(It is)","review":"I wanted to like this film. I really did. What I saw was a dreary mess, incoherent footage of truly annoying and shallow sketches (they aren't developed enough to call them \\"characters\\"). Some directors' approaches to humor may be acquired tastes (think Hal Hartley, Whit Stillman, Richard Linklater), but Greg Araki's sense of \\"humor\\" is so humorless that I can't chalk it up to a matter of taste or style. It's shocking to see such a parade of cameos from known TV and film actors (I was hoping for more of John Ritter), but what in the name of god is Gibby from the Butthole Surfers doing in this film? Say it isn't so, Gibby! Compared to Nowhere, Linklater's SubUrbia is a bloody film classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Run from this movie!","review":"I have seen some other Greg Araki movies, and--for the most part--they are pretty good. \\"Nowhere,\\" however, is a nightmare.

There is no point to it. The character development is non-existent. The plot is non-existent. There is no coherent storyline. It does not portray any level of realism, and even if it's not supposed to portray any level of realism it doesn't even appeal to me as fantasy. I felt nothing for the characters.

The Doom Generation is, in my opinion, the worst movie ever made (and I'm not the only one who believes this I can assure you). so why did I see Nowhere? Well I figuired that a director couldn't get it so completely wrong more than once. I was wrong. I'm trying hard to figuire out why so many people like this movie, it has so many scenes that are put in for shock factor that are just stupid. I really don't want to see a guys nipples ripped off. Oh, by the way this movie doesn't say anything about teenagers, I should know, I STILL AM ONE!. Yes I am 17 and I have never felt or experienced half of the things seen in this movie. So many adults want to make their teen years seem so dramatic that I think that some of them acctually believe that they really were like that. If you really want to see a good movie about growing up and the hell that it can be go check out KIDS. now that is a wake up call of a movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gregg Araki is a big........Squirtle Burger??","review":"Well at some point during this film my soul died. I cant really imagine why anyone would want to pay money to destroy their soul. To people who enjoy good indie films I can only try to warn you what a mistake paying money for this film would be.Whats so bad about this film is that it thinks its clever, with its ridculous slang (yes squirtle burger is but one of the many brilliant insults used in the film), its stupid cliche and obvious metonyms, and its cast of actors who, although i know are somewhat talented, are utterly useless in this instance. They all seem to have aquired the keanu reeves 'plank of wood' style of acting. In short There are much better indie films out there which portray similar messages much better and that arent a big waste of money. I mean the money spent on this film could have been used to save children that are dying in africa....but apparently this piece of film torture was more important."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay...See It For James Duval","review":"This is a really dumb movie the only reason I liked it was because of the James Duval.

To my disappointment we do not get to see them much. The actor that caught my eye was James Duval he is so hot. The locker room and shower scene were so erotic. It is too supernatural and boring for me, the only reason I liked it was because of James Duval.

It fallows the guide lines of sex,drugs,whatever?? A brillant cast with manny suprises of poeple you haven't seen in years. Araki's multi layered movies has your eyes glued to the tv wondering what are you ganna see next. Brillant form of imagination when it comes to the characters names such as Dark,Zero,Cowboy ect. Also the way the characters rooms are decoraded. Nowhere lived up to everything that i expected it to be and when you get down to it the story is about an innocent kid lost with his life his sexuality his future and just wants everything to be ok. Happyness doesn't always come cheep i think that is what Dark Smith is learning in this film. It's an affectionate,sad,sexy film i give it 5 stars for araki's magor use of imagination !"},{"rating":"1","title":"This film goes \\"NOWHERE\\"","review":"I'm an independent/quirky-film buff, so a small movie like this has to be bad for me not to like it.This movie was pointless from start to end.

A whole movie about amoral druggie sex-starved teens partying all night? Wow, what an original concept. Whenever Araki wants to disguise his lack of talent, he throws a space alien or some guy with a dead dog on the screen-- you know, the sort of random visuals that pretend to be \\"alternative\\" but that anyone with thirty seconds and half a brain could come up with. The only reason that this movie doesn't get one star is that it occasionally has a good one-liner and John Ritter is fantastic in a brief cameo. But that isn't enough to make this a film worth spending your money on."},{"rating":"1","title":"polly","review":"I cannot believe that so many people reviewed this film and did not mention the amazing work of Sarah Lassez who played Polly/Egg. I have to admit that I did not like the movie and fastforwarded past many parts (I also have to mention that I am well out of the teenage years which could help explain why I did not care for the movie), but I thought the character of Polly was so well done. She demonstrated such innocence and naivety I was heartbroken to see what happened to her. I felt that she was the only true to life character and showing that she was from a home with a very loving father just made me feel more sympathy for her situation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Araki does it again","review":"All I can say is, no movie has ever made me laugh when I thought I should cry. James Duvall plays Dark, a character that is easy to identify with. Everyone imagines finding what they're looking for but no one considers what they'd do if it was taken away from them. I could've wept for him. This film glides from one extreme to another, comedy to drama, with thought provoking speed. Clever, moving and figuratively true to life, this film stands as an ultimate triumph."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another misunderstood movie by Gregg Araki...","review":"This movie complete's Gregg Araki's trilogy of hilarity. I dunno, I've read rave reviews of his movies and some really horrible ones as well. I guess you just have to understand his brand of humor. I think his movies are pretty damn good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining introduction to early jazz by a pioneer!","review":"Anyone who spent anytime around the New Orleans jazz scene knows that Danny Barker was the living voice of the music. Before his death, Danny always peppered his concerts with his spicy, insightful anecdotes (true in meaning if not in every fact). This book brings together some of his stories centered around Buddy Bolden (The \\"Father\\" of Jazz) and Storyville. His voice comes through strong and funny, just as he spoke in life. Factually, I am not sure of the accuracy of all these stories, but nothing catches the flavor of early New Orleans jazz like Danny Barker. All of us who had the pleasure to know him miss him, this book reminds us why we loved him so much.

Installing the PNY GeForce 8600GT video card was relatively easy. The PNY card was much larger than the OEM card which required rerouting one pesky cable under the card rather than over it.I haven't experienced any of the negative issues reported by the other two reviewers. The good news is my PC now scores 5.9 for desktop graphics performance and 5.5 for gaming performance. The bad news is I haven't noticed any change, better or worse, in my PC's performance since installing the 8600GT. Since I don't use my PC for playing games, perhaps my normal usage didn't require a more powerful video card."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nearly burned itself out","review":"Installed the product ok.

The book will force you to ask yourself questions you may not have ever thought about before:Am I doing the right thing?Am I doing the right thing....right?Am I contributing to the world? How?What difference do I make?I love this book because its so much more than a book; its a journey and Yeh comes along to make sure we stay on the path.Who ever said \\"Nice guys finish last\\"?

While I thoroughly enjoyed \\"The Demolished Man\\" by Alfred Bester, this novel comes across as being way too preachy. Seeking a telepathic companion, Joe Carter orchastrates the building of the first super-computer, named Bossy, that has the ability to renew mankind. Wash away their prejudices and preconcieved notions. And, I guess in the view of the authors, create a race of zombies with no convictions. Skip this one if you're looking for classic Sci-Fi."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Biography of the Transforming Power of Christ","review":"I was amazed to read this biography of Augustine. This biography tells the sordid life of Augustine. Like the prodigal son, he made devastating choices in his life that grieved his parents and family. A breakdown under a fig tree brought Augustine to the end of himself and to the transforming power of Christ. Augustine became one of the greatest among the Church Fathers, combatting false teachings. His work to return the church to the Bible as the infallible Word of God was continued centuries later by Martin Luther.The story itself is powerful, however the book is written in a straight-foward approach that is a little boring for the younger reader. It openly discusses points of immorality in Augustine's life that a parent would need to handle together with younger readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting","review":"The author makes some interesting observations, especially emphasizing the importance of the communal celebration of the sacraments and not just viewing them as something the individual receives. He also makes a strong case for the importance of the narrative aspect.However I have a problem seeing the book as a trustworthy guide due to some of the author's suggestions which seem at odds with the Catholic Church's traditional and moral teachings. He disputes Augustine's teachings on infant baptism, offers a case for pre-marital co-habitation and calls into question the validity of a child's first confession made prior to first holy communion. So I can't recommend this as an orthodox guide to sacramental theology, despite many great insights."},{"rating":"2","title":"half hour of great music","review":"first bosstones cd of mine. bought it after hearing the impression that i get on Leno. other songs that are extremely good are that bug bit me, another drinkin song, numbered days, and nevermind me. so good i was able to listen to on repeat 5 times around nonstop. a need to buy album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good album...","review":"It just upsets me when I see someone say they like an album like this and then say Janet Jackson is good too... that's just not right.

They have toned down their hard edge and Dicky has softened his voice on this album. Also, their guitarist has set aside his intense, distorted guitar riffs for more sedate pop sounds. In general, the Mighty Mighty Bosstones wanted to sell some albums so they made their music more radio friendly and entered the arena of pop-ska. Not to say this album is terrible, but a faithful Bosstones fan will want to pass over this CD. They lose a star off their rating because of the sell-out factor."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD kicks @$$!","review":"This is the best CD!!!! I could listen to it 24/7!!!!!!!

I challenge anyone to listen to \\"Noise Brigade,\\" \\"The Rascal King,\\" or \\"The Impression That I Get\\" and not jump out of their seat and dance.My daughter's only three months old, but this is already her favorite CD--she gets happy and laughs whenever it comes on."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite CDs","review":"This CD has some of the best tracks by the Bosstones.

Anyways, I think this i a wonderful CD especially if you haven't heard ska before. This is an excellent example.The Mighty Mighty Bosstones are excellent in mixing brass instruments in the big-band style with modern guitar. The last three tracks are more rock although they have some brass in the chorus. Give ska a try by getting this CD!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"ska or swing?","review":"When I first heard MMB, i thought they were some old band that sounded like the Brian Setzer Orchestra. Barret's voice is really different when comparing to Aaron Barret from Reel Big Fish and Chris from Less Than Jake. Some people think they are skacore, but i think they are ska with a swingish edge. I liked tracks 1 and 2 alot and my fav. was track 4. That was the most catchiest tune. I didn't really like Another Drinkin Song."},{"rating":"2","title":"90's Protest Album","review":"Let's Face It is what I would call \\"a nineties protest album\\". What I mean by that is that in this album, they protest to all the wrong that is going on in the world. And you thought music groups stopped protesting after the sixties! They touch on topics like hatred, violence, bigotry, drinking, and the desensitization of America today. This is a very refreshing change from alot of other nineties albums. It seems that lyrics in the nineties have all turned to \\"I love you baby\\" and \\"Please come back\\" and all the songs are about the singer's boyfriend/girlfriend. This is a very good album, a sixties feel with a nineties sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hell yeah","review":"Hell yeah, The Mighty Mighty Bosstones are awesome.

Could Mussorgsky really be mixed with Jimmy Smith licks and sci-fi movie-soundtrack synth?You'd better believe it could, and here's the evidence -- 33 minutes of continuous performance. ELP's high energy pushes Mussorgsky's material with such unbridled enthusiasm we can't help but be pushed along. Yes, at times it can get a bit silly -- that's part of the charm; ELP never intended to be taken seriously. If you can't have fun here, where can you have it?I probably enjoy it more now than I did so long ago as a teen.

I felt like it was a jumbled piece of work that had no storyline or plot."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT ANALYSIS OF MODERN INHUMANITY AND ITS ROUTES","review":"This book analyzes the origins of controlling and submissive personalities, in their being by-products of an alienated existence, and meant to overcome the uncertainty and loneliness that results, through the means of symbiosis with another human being. He shows that people are confronted with the contsant no-win situation of choosing between submission and submersion or aloneness and insecurity. Of course, he DOES pose a SOLUTION to this problem, that of a productive, creative, spontaneous, social personality. Needless to say this personality is incompatible with modern day capitalistic society, despite a possible extreme minority. If we want to be free and secure, the only solution is interconnectedness, and to live in a HUMAN society. THIS is what Fromm teaches us."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Damning Treatise On The Dangers Of Socialism And Group Think","review":"It takes a village took Nazi Germany to the brink of extiction and exterminated millions.Quake when you hear people push the socialist agenda."},{"rating":"2","title":"Illuminating","review":"Fromm's main achievement consisted in emphasising the Weberian view of religion in providing capitalism with its major impetus. His analysis of Calvinism and Protestatism is certianly worth considering especially if juxstaposed against other belief systems that stemmed the tide of capitalism in its earliest stages in China and 18th and 19th century Japan. Fromm's psychoanalytic background allowed him to develop further Adorno's conception of the authoritarin personality and middle-class facination with Nazi and Fascist leaders. And although the ideas are complex, fromm's style is highly accessible. His arguments are not always flawless and may sometimes reflect fromm's emotiveness in addressing issues that require objectivity. On the whole, it is a good read and provides a good introduction to anyone wishing to delve further into the thought of the Frankfurt school."},{"rating":"2","title":"Understanding man's journey to unconnectedness.","review":"By detailing man's progression from a feudal society to our current status of individual freedom (unconnectedness), Fromm illuminates the motivating factors of man's desire to belong. This book exposes many societally accepted maneuvers we use to rejoin ourselves with nature and details painful consequences of our \\"freedom\\" and isolation."},{"rating":"2","title":"How one surrenders one's freewill for an identity","review":"The thesis of this highly illuminating book is that in order to escape a sense of anomie and its attendant seeming rootlessness many people resort to things in society that superimpose an identity on them, a kind of drive-up window for a world view if you will. Thus you get things like religious cults and Nazis at the extreme and Republicanism and Liberalism more toward the center. The ultimate message of this book is to think for yourself and try not to give in to the comfort of a group and its inherently limiting regulations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Interesting","review":"At times, this kind of subject matter can be confusing and even dry. Fromm does a great job keeping the reader interested and informed. There were times that I had to reread a section, but I think this comes along with reading subject matter in this area.

A 3-and-a-half-foot long sterling silver chain with glued-on \\"crystals\\" (read: cubic zirconia at best, plastic at worst) doesn't cost $95 to produce. It costs maybe - maybe! - $10, and that's assuming the factory's in the US. Don't throw any more of your money away.

Alex Robinson's art is somewhere between cartoonish and naturalistic, and just seems natural for the characters and situations he creates.Robinson's story - again naturalistic, straightforward, lifelike - captivates, and the characters are all flawed in different and interesting ways. The subplots add up to something addictive, and keep you wondering throughout the length of the book.Box Office Poison is a great way to get into independent comics, and the quality of storyline is sufficient to win over most skeptics of the form to hope for what comics can do."},{"rating":"2","title":"ALEX ROBINSON RULES","review":"Whereas many recent graphic novels are mainly depressing, or mainly funny, or mainly artistic (or mainly UNartistic) -- Alex Robinson does everything in this outstanding graphic novel.It's a funny interwoven set of stories about characters with real depth ... and this book is funny!

I was supprised to find it still in print after 20 years which I would think is pretty good evidence of it's value. As the title suggests, this book is aimed at women but the points she makes apply to men as well. It is well grounded in legitmate psychololgy though it may be somewhat dated now.

A good guy, but not perfect, sort of ordinary. He looks stupid on television--the way a real human being would. At first I was worried that this schlubby guy would end up being unadmirable, the sort of slacker who screws up at his job. But he isn't; he doesn't.

My girlfriend and I saw Jacqui at Yoshi's in Oakland late in 2006, just after this album was out. The wonderful thing about the album is that it gets better and better with each hearing. \\"Easy Ride from Here\\" is my favorite; some say its optimistic, although I think there is a bit of tongue in cheek cynicism in the song, but still very light hearted. \\"Hot Legs\\" and \\"Lola\\" are interesting covers, but Jacqui makes them work. There is not a bad cut on the album, and it is, in my opinion, the most approachable album overall that she has ever done.

We'll never know but if this album was a hit, maybe Michael wouldn't have been so depressed."},{"rating":"1","title":"INXS \\"Elegantly Wasted\\" - the review","review":"if ever there was an appropriate title for an album, this was it.\\"Elegantly Wasted\\" was an album that was just uninspired. trying to capture on what made INXS special, this album misfires and wanders aimlessly. at this time in the 90's INXS had become irrelevant. the previous album \\"Full Moon, Dirty Hearts\\" was a sorry experience as well.It was not for lack of trying that INXS released this album, but time had been unkind to this band as the 90's turned its back on anything 80's and INXS was not spared. Sadly this was the last album that Michael Hutchence would record with INXS.Thankfully, \\"INXS Rockstar\\" helped show the world that INXS is one of rock's greatest bands and their legacy is secure.if you are new to inxs, this album is not for you!start with \\"listen like thieves\\", \\"shoobah shoobah\\", \\"the swing\\", \\"kick\\", \\"X\\" and \\"Welcome to Wherever You Are\\" as these are possibly their best work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Catchy Final Slice of INXS","review":"INXS seemed somewhat rejuvenated on this album, and it shows throughout. Michael Hutchense keeps himself reined in (well, reined in for Michael Hutchense), which keeps the album from sounding too self-involved. The title track (funky and catchy) remains my highlight, even if a friend insisted they were singing \\"I'm better than Oasis\\". \\"Girl on Fire\\" has a great horn section, and the gospelesque \\"Don't Lose Your Head\\" is quite good, but it made me think of Deep Purple's \\"Hush\\". In fact, many of these tracks wouldn't be out of place on classic rock albums of the 60s and 70s. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but I wonder if they listened to their favorite albums (especially the Stones) before entering the studio. Still, they manage to pull it off more often than not. No really bum tracks here, just several that don't make much impression (\\"Show Me\\", \\"I'm Just a Man\\"). A short running time makes the whole package go down a lot smoother, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just elementary school","review":"Although this book looks like it would be for elementary school only, it really branches out. Some of the short lessons transcend all grades and are even valuable for adults. A must-buy for anyone looking for a fresh approach to goal setting with students of any age."},{"rating":"2","title":"The only teaching book you will need","review":"As a high school English teacher, I have read a lot of teaching books designed to help out with discipline, motivation and organization, but this book tops my list. It is unlike other \\"handbooks\\" in that it comes straight from the heart: the author\`s passion for her students shows on every page and the advice and techniques she offers are down-to-earth and useful every day. It offers templates, which are great both for first year and seasoned teachers alike, and many more useful ideas to use in and out of the classroom. I have to say, during my first year of teaching, my desk and files contained mostly pages from this book!Perhaps the biggest advantage of this book for me, however, was the feeling that it leaves you with - not all teachers still have the spark or passion for their students that they had on day one of their teacher\`s training... this book helps to remind us how important it is to keep that passion every day while in the classroom."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must read book for teachers","review":"I loved the way the author handled her students. All teachers should read and be open to her suggestions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what it claims to be","review":"This is more an attempt at inspiring teachers than a how-to book with actually practical suggestions. Only taking away one pre-reading tip and one discipline tip.Bottom line: Not worth buying. Check it out from the library instead if you are really curious."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for a beginner teacher","review":"This book was just what I needed to begin teaching in the classroom. I am trying to be one of those teachers who do more than just \\"stand up in the front of the classroom and lecture all day\\". Great read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Complete Waste","review":"I thought this book was something so different so maybe that's my fault. I was thinking that it would be about brain based learning and NEW techniques to have students become creative thinkers. But as I was reading the book I found myself checking to find out what year the book was written. This book was not interesting, not worth my time, not worth the money. It seems to be for people who are CONSIDERING teaching and certainly has nothing to offer for someone who is already in the classroom. If you have been in the classroom for a year don't even bother with this book. It's not going to help you improve your practice in any way and there are a TON of much better books out there. This book is a complete waste."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book saved my teaching career","review":"I used to teach at a Catholic preparatory school, and I must admit: It is difficult as hell teaching inside the box. First of all, your range of motion is very much limited, and I got a rash from the corrugated cardboard flap smacking me underneath my chin.That, and I had to shimmy a lot to prevent toppling myself over, when my knees went crashing against the box wall.From then on, I vowed to teach outside the box!I now teach while wrapped in a bubble mailer.This book is much better than \\"Teach Like Your Hair's On Fire.\\" I tried doing that, too, but I kept setting off the sprinkler system, and too many ceiling tiles came crashing down on my head as a result."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Casual Thinking\\"","review":"Man Ray is a band with an identity crisis. They sound like they would have rocked harder and more precisely, had Grunge never existed. But, it did, so they had to \\"dumb down\\" their sound and make it \\"rough around the edges\\" so it would be more accessible to the general public. This lack of trueness to one's self is evident in many bands of the post-Nirvana '90s. Candlebox is a prime example. They would have sounded like Skid Row, were they honest and courageous and had simply done what came naturally. Unwittingly, these bands paved the way for acts that were genuinely polished, yet \\"rough around the edges\\" such as Our Lady Peace or Matchbox Twenty. So do we ridicule them for their lack of integrity, or thank them for inadvertently spawning a popular genre? Either way, I didn't really enjoy this record. Thanks mainly to the vocalist and his \\"lyrics\\". The lead guitarist has excellent tone, though, and there are some solid, inspired moments, though not enough to genuinely impress me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Josh White wants you to let it go...","review":"Josh White's life has changed in a profound way. I think he would want everyone to let go of his past. Manray was a band he was in, along with a couple others, until Jesus Christ came into his life. You can read all about it at www.telecastmusic.com where he explains how insignificant those days were, compared to how life is now. Please consider eternity. We will all be judged by God one day, and it is crucial that we don't arrive before God dead in our sins. Jesus wants to bridge that gap and be our advocate, as He has died for us. Check out Telecast, they are a great band."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Way It Is","review":"This is a common sense narration about life in the country. And it is realistic. No bucolic frolicking, but rather the unvarnished truth, told with sensitivity and humor.Here you will be told of searching for a lost cow in freezing weather when you thought you were going out to dinner. Or the problem of disposing of a horse that died. Birthing animals and dealing with predators as well as some of the domestic chores such as dealing with wood heat and cooking, some basic gardening, needs vs wants, all paint a vivid picture of country living.The other books on country living also put out by Loompanics would complement one's back to the land education.

Have been very impressed that I almost always was alerted before actually seeing the radar toting cop. The only time I could see him was on a very clear day going down a very long slope, probably from a mile out. Pros: great reception and easily readable graphics. Cons: N/A"},{"rating":"2","title":"Saved me more than a few times.","review":"This was a great investment. Works well enough that it has saved me from several tickets over the couple years I've owned it. It tells you which type of signal it's picking up so you can quickly discern whether it's a Po-Po or just a store or something else. It's loud too, and paired with my driving awareness it is much easier to avoid tickets."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Naked Truth","review":"I started reading Chris's new book about Hedonism II, and I was laughing out loud by the end of the first page. Chris has a way of giving the goods about this mysterious resort in a straight forward, no bull, tell it like it is, yet humorous fashion. It is an excellent reference guide to the best vacation you will ever take. You may even consider it a \\"training manual\\". Having been there before, it was easy for me to see that Chris knows exactly what she is talking about. She has captured the subtle nuance of the resort with class and ease."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book","review":"my fiance finished this book in one sitting and it took me two sittings. This book is a must have for anyone considering a trip to hedonism 2 (or three). and for those who aren't considering the trip it is still very well written and entertaining. over all well worth the purchase price."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this Book!","review":"This books is truly a great buy! I cannot wait to go to Hedo. I enjoy reading this book instead of searching the web. Contains really detailed information. This was exactly what I was hoping for! Buy it from the author direct and she will autograph it for you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"what a boring book!","review":"We didn't finish the book because we found it completely unerotic and asexual. The author tells you for instance to bring safety pins to hold your toga in place and to bring toenail polish because the sand on the beach will wear it off. Wow!!! The stories told are all childish fun, but there's not a single one titillating. Puritan lack of sexuality.

And now we are watching them with our son loving every minute.Price is great and packaging is top notch. However, it may be just me, but I was hoping that Little Drummer Boy would have been cleaned up / remastered a little more...a great show is hurt by the muddy vhs transfer; this is a shame because it's a true gem in the Rankin / Bass collection.Finally whoever owns the rights needs to release the following on dvd as well:The First Christmas SnowThe Little Drummer Boy, Book II,The Life & Adventures of Santa ClausAll in all a great buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"DVD's good, CD is NOT any of the original soundtrack","review":"I loved getting these DVD's plus the followup set that is in the light blue packaging... but OMG, the CD that comes with this \\"red\\" package is horrid!

I also didn't like the way the movie ended because I didn't like the way the scene of Santa's noisy sleigh flying to that island made me feel. And what was wrong with the doll on the island? We had Charlie-not-Jack-in-the-box, an ostrich riding cowpoke, a jelly squirting gun and a doll with no visible challenges.In addition to being maudlin, I didn't like the way Rudolf was accepted only after he bailed out the other reindeer. Sure, the other reindeer loved Rudolf and shouted out with glee - they could afford to after he bailed them out. Like couldn't he be accepted before he pulled that sleigh that foggy Christmas? I'd recommend all the other Christmas stories before this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"the original christmas classics","review":"daughter got me to buy this becauce it was the best price she found on the set ......loves it"},{"rating":"2","title":"the original christmas classics","review":"I purchased this set of videos last year and I had to get it for my son and his family in California.

However, the more modern Frosty show, \\"Frosty Returns\\", is definitely the worst of he bunch. \\"Frosty Returns\\" is a poorly written and poorly animated \\"special\\" and does not belong with these other Christmas classics. I'll pass on that one.The Little Drummer Boy is still my personal favorite even after all these years.I recommend this set so you can watch them when you want and not when the network decides to put them on...plus you're not bothered by all those pesky commercials :) You'll get hours of enjoyment and some good family time, because parents/grandparents can sit down with there children/grandchildren and watch all these classics together(well almost all of them.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Christmas Gift for Generations to Come","review":"I wanted to have a complete set of some of my childhood favorite TV Christmas Shows.

I can't think of Christmas without remembering these films. This is a very good collection for anyone who watched these as kids or are looking for wholesome holiday films to watch as a family. My only complaint is that the whole Rankin/Bass collection isn't here.

Take away the filler (\\"The Little Drummer Boy\\" and \\"Frosty Returns\\") and you still have more than four hours of classic Christmas television at a good price. In our house this simply replaces our old VHS of the outstanding \\"Rudolph the Red Nose Reindeer;\\" the others we've only played once, but for the most part they're pretty good, if you're in the mood for some 1960s cheer.The included seven-song audio CD is a mixed bag. It includes the Burl Ives numbers from \\"Rudolph,\\" but \\"Holly Jolly Christmas\\" is just the reprise. The other tunes? The classic Otis Redding cover of \\"Merry Christmas Baby,\\" a sweet version of \\"Winter Wonderland\\" by Jewel, a so-so big-band-style \\"Let It Snow\\" by the 1998 version of Chicago and a cringe worthy lounge lizard rendition of \\"Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree\\" recorded by 1960s teenybopper Bobby Rydell... in 2001.My favorite '60s TV Christmas treat?How the Grinch Stole Christmas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great nostalgia","review":"I used to watch these movies as a child, and they are as great as I remember.

It was created by CBS in 1992 and is horrible. Rankin and Bass had nothing to do with it. R&B did, however, create the true sequel to Frosty the Snowman, called Frosty's Winter Wonderland...where he meets and marries Crystal. Replace the CBS crap with this true gem, and I'll buy this set. Otherwise, forget it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless \\"Twaddle\\" that should never be shown to children.","review":"I didn't realize how bad these movies were growing up. I watched them every year as a child; I even looked forward to them, but honestly, they are trash. Watching them now thirty-five years later, I see they have horrible story lines, poor dialogue, and terrible behavior. For example, Rudolph is bullied to a degree that I didn't remember, even by Santa, an elf hits another elf over the head to test a toy, another elf removes the teeth of the abominable snowman, and some very demeaning comments in general. I feel these movies exposed my children to ideas and attitudes that are verboten today for good reason. Not everything that is \\"old\\" or \\"original\\" is of true value - and some isn't worth anything beyond studying the change in societal attitudes from generation to generation."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a RIP-OFF!!","review":"The tittle implies that there are 7 christmas favorites in this collection, but in reality, there are only THREE!!! Rudolf, Santa Claus is comin' to town, and Frosty the Snowman are the only actual videos on the dvd, the rest are just songs!!! So if you want the other stories, plan to buy them individually!

A person with a little knowledge can do a lot of dmamage. Please do not make this the first book you read about Jack the Ripper!2. Anyone with enough money can get anything published. I strongly suspect this is why this book exists. Any real publisher would have thrown it in the bin where it belongs."},{"rating":"1","title":"A sad case","review":"This is such a sad case. There are many inaccuracies and if a reader can ignore these there are enough grammatical and spelling errors to make this work a perfect candidate for English 101 students to rip apart. We encounter the word \`seen' when \`scene' is intended and so forth. An editor and a critic could have helped Dr. David J. Speare (veterinarian) turn this into a viable work. Some sections of the work seem well done and I felt I was learning things that I had never even encountered in the many works on the Ripper I had read in the past, and then there would be an inaccuracy and a misspelling and I would question the whole.The publication date of this work should probably have been postponed until 2007 or later, after research and proofing had taken place. Great potential, but a waste of money and effort as it stands."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating new angles to a favorite mystery","review":"This new text on Jack provides the reader with a glimpse of how modern science & criminology can shed new light on pertinent aspects of what is probably the most famous criminal mystery. The writing moves along quickly, although there are some typos which are expected in a POD published work, and is much more coherent than other books which I have recently read on Jack the Ripper."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME DOCUMENTARY","review":"I received my documentary on time and waited to open it til Thanksgiving to watch it with my whole family and I must say I ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT!!! Its definately a must see for all families no matter what race; ESPECIALLY African Americans though. Americans have been so DUMBED down; this would definately shine some light on a lot of those unanswered questions about not only Black history but a little of all history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the Hidden Colors DVDs","review":"I had first saw this documentary online and had to own a copy of it!

A bit choppy and scattered.","review":"In general, the information was great and accurate. Definately worth the money and time. It could have been organized a bit better.

Has many claims without sources,details,facts, or explanation ! Film seeks to tell you what's right in hopes that you except everything said as 100% TRUTH! Yes there are a lot of grey areas in history but by no means does this film fill any voids. Out of all people some guy penn named \\" Tariq Nasheed\\", who's actuall work is based on \\"pimping & whore-ing\\", men & women of his own race...? (Look up his videos,talks,an podcasts)This film is complete fraud its unfortunate the some people appeared in this dvd ...the turning point of this film is either when fraudiq nasheed made his appearance to speak out of ignorance or when one of many ridiculous false claims came up such as \\"the first samurai where black\\".......really ? In all I returned this filth dvd same day of purchase!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Many inaccuracies and little evidence","review":"Pros-It will generate lots of discussion and make valid points about how contributions of Africans and African Americans have been purposely omitted from history and textbooks.Cons- contributors in the film make blanket statements and generalizations about things Africans had nothing to do with. For example, they say Africans built the Great Wall of China and were the first Samarai in Japan. The ideas of Ivan Van Sertima are also stated as fact (They Came Before Columbus- Africans carved the colossal heads found in Central America).Overall, be prepared to cross check everything."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hidden Colors","review":"This movie was so awesome and it gave me a piece of mind with the history of my ancestors.

Being an African American male myself, I believe these type of teachings can instill a pride and confidence in the Black community that can create a step change in how the community looks at itself. The history about the African influences in Europe, Asia and America are great! The solutions segment are spot on! Great watch!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best documentary of the 21st!!!!","review":"I saw Hidden Colors in theaters and now I'm ecstatic that it's on DVD! All people of African descent and everyone else need to see the TRUTH that's being told by all the participants in this film. YOU WILL BE FLOORED!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding resource for HBCU students","review":"This documentary is probably one of the most valuable sources of information I can pass on to my HBCU students. It makes the truth plain and reveals what Eurocentrists are still trying to suppress, distort, steal and deny. I wish I could give about 200 copies to my friends and students.As Nas states in one of his songs,\\"They say we N-I double G-E-R, we areMuch more, still we choose to ignoreThe obvious, man this history don't acknowledge usWe were scholars long before colleges\\"This documentary acknowledges the extraordinary history of Africans and the impact that they have had all over the world.

Tariq Nasheed has done a wonderful job putting this work together and presenting it in a clear and consice manner. I showed the film to my 17 year old son and he flipped out. First there was anger, followed by disapointment and finally \\"curiousity\\" to learn MORE. Now he is reading historical referance books for himself and his own enlightenment.

You feel as if you are there on the dirt streets. Once again Ms. Miller makes you feel as if you are a part of the story. I read this book and went out and got the next 3 the same day. Springwater is a town I would love to be a part of. Can't wait for the rest of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rachel is disappointing","review":"After reading Springwater, I eagerly anticipated Rachel. I was very disappointed. This second book in the series lacked the poignancy and depth of the first. Of course, there were great moments of laughter and warmth as Miller's books always provide. However, the romance between Trey and Rachel seemed flat and almost forced. It definitely did not carry on the tradition established in Springwater. A disappointment, overall."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Lead in to her Other Books","review":"To me, this book was just a lead in to her next books. They met, they fell in love. I certainly didn't feel the feeling between the two main characters, Rachel and Trey. I did see her building new stories, but that was about all. A short read. Nothing to get lost in."},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought this book was O.K. but nothing special...","review":"To be honest this book really didn't do much for me. It was a bit boring. Nothing was really going on in the book & the couple didn't even start a relationship until the last 10 pages of the book & then all of a sudden they were wed. Rachel came to Springwater to be the first teacher & upon her arrival she meets Trey & soon finds out that he is part-owner of the Saloon across the street from her school. She despises the Saloon but they soon find that they care for one another. Not much more then that. The book was just lacking something. It needed some adventure or something. I sure hope the rest of this series gets better. This is book #2 in the Springwater series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice little vacation for the mind","review":"This whole series of books was a nice vacation for the brain. When you're tired of hearing about tragedies and violence and worst possible scenarios, when you've used your brain all day and just need a little quiet time, these are just what the doctor orderred. They are broken down into tiny little books, too, so you can begin and finish them in an afternoon. No high-brow intellectual stimulation, but better than the TV soap-opera drivel. Check them out they're fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Holds up to lots of chewing","review":"This toy has been a favorite! One of our siamese cats that has a chewing fixation. He will chew (and sometimes eat) almost anything sisal, plastic, wood, rope or string, feather, and many fabrics. And power cords. Sometimes I buy him dog toys because they are sturdier! This brand of toys in particular holds his interest, and I like the quality. He has never tried or been able to destroy them, even though he plays with them all the time. My two other cats also like this toy. This is a brand I can always count on to entertain and last."},{"rating":"2","title":"great remedy for cat OCD","review":"My cat, Haya-ji, has obsessive compulsive disorder. He used to chew his nails down to the quick obsessively, chew plastic mice to a pulp, and hide often. We have now discovered that chewing on this ring calms him down and is a positive thing for him to fixate on. Between this and some kitty anti-anxiety meds, he is feeling much better. His vet says he has incredibly clean and healthy teeth as a result, too.One ring lasts about a month before he has completely demolished it, but keep in mind he is a VERY strong chewer.The local stores all stopped carrying this item, so we have to have them sent to us in batches so he has his \\"fix\\" for a while.The other three cats in the house couldn't care less about the ring, but it definitely struck a chord with my neurotic tabby. I'm very thankful that this product gives him a positive outlet for his stress. I just wish it were still sold locally."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best toy I've found for a teething kitten.","review":"My kitten is teething and after a long hard search for products made specifically for teething kitties I found this. The ring part is just the right consistency for a kitten to gnaw on to get relief for teething and the ribbons on the sides are very attractive to a kitty. I figured the ribbons would be in shreds immediately but after a month of use they have no noticeable damage. It is very durable, even surviving a few dunks in the toilet with no problem. The toy is also light enough that a cat can bat it around. I am very pleased with it, as is my 18 week old kitten!"},{"rating":"2","title":"thanks","review":"thanks. Everything was good.

I bought for my husband he loves it! just as we expected Michael Mcdonald songs with happy memories, all the best ones too!!Love it!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What you're looking for","review":"Not sure why anyone would give this compilation less than 5 stars. If you're looking for a greatest hits package from Michael McDonald, everything you are looking for is on this package. Not only does it feature his career with and without the Doobie Brothers, it also shows the incredible versatility of his range and styles. Some may nit-pick that this doesn't dig deep enough into his career, but the truth is, it's a greatest hits package, and it hits that mark absolutely perfectly. If it showed up in the top 20 of Billboard with McDonald singing on it, it's in this cd set. Greatest hits packages are meant to lead us to an artist. It's up to you to decide whether you want to dig deeper into his catalogue. If you have the money, do so, by all means. You won't be disappointed. If you don't have the money, or just want the songs you remember from the radio, you'll find it all here."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Ultimate Collection","review":"Michael McDonald is, and always has been great to listen to. Driving in your car, out for the evening, or with someone you love, he's my choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"All the \\"pleasing\\" sound of a baying bassett hound","review":"Listening to this album, I finally realized why Michael McDonald's vocals bother me so much. His voice sounds as if he's singing out of breath and holding his nose. A thin-throated, hollow howl that grows more irritating (for some of us) with each exposure. McDonald's monotone delivery ultimately comes across as a tiresome drone. He shares a \\"Minimal Vocal Range Award\\" with Phil Collins, another droner. Both Mike and Phil need substitute singers---\\"pinch-singers?\\"---to do their vocals for them."},{"rating":"2","title":"I keep forgettin' how good he is.","review":"This is pretty much the collection I've been waiting for for many years. His \\"Very Best Of\\" had plenty of great tracks on it, but lacked his Doobie Brothers songs. And of course the DB collections have none of his solo work on them. So this is basically the best of both worlds, and a good 19 tracks too. I don't think the casual fan will be missing anything from this. Included is \\"What A Fool Believes\\", \\"Ya Mo B There\\", \\"On My Own\\", \\"It Keeps You Runnin'\\", and many more. There's also my personal favorite \\"Sweet Freedom\\". Overall a super collection, and one of the great voices in music. It would go well with \\"The Best Of The Doobies\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"A complete career retrospective","review":"\\"Rhino follows up their Very Best of Michael McDonald collection with a complete career retrospective of the R&B/blues-rocker. Not only do you get his solo best, but you get his best duets, best of the Doobie Brothers, and a new song off his last covers album. There are 19 tracks in all, but be warned; about 3/4 of the way through, you probably won't recognize much.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Essential Item for Collection, but can't scan into computer","review":"Most of the reviews are glowing regarding this compilation and I tend to agree. This is the only Michael McDonald/Doobie Brothers collection I have, so it sits well on my shelf and CD player.That being said, is it just me, or am I the only one who cannot scan this CD into my computer? Both my PC and MAC have been unsuccessful turning the selections into MP3s for ad infinitum play. Keep this in mind when considering purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bread and Roses","review":"The conflict between principle and practical reality is deftly explored by British director Loach in this affecting drama set in present-day Southern California, and features earthy performances by Brody and formidable newcomer Padilla. An intense, authentic depiction of our most vulnerable workers' struggle for a decent life, the film underscores the importance of taking a stand, however daunting. Shedding light on the desperate lives of people largely ignored in contemporary times, \\"Roses\\" is a tense, moving story about those still seeking--and being denied--the American Dream."},{"rating":"2","title":"A film about socioeconomic injustice...","review":"Maya, an illegal immigrant from Mexico, arrives to Los Angles in hope of a better life with her sister Rosa who helps her get a job as a janitor at a big company. Happily Maya works as a janitor until she finds out that she and all others at her company are being unjustly treated, which leads her to invite Sam Shapiro (Adrien Brody) who comes to help them unionize against the bullying company. This leads to difficult times for the employees as they are living under the threat of being fired, which would remove their sole source of income. Bread and Roses is a strong political film about socioeconomic injustice and how it affects families and friends, which offers a terrific cinematic experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lurch on the road","review":"I think everyone should take the time to read this and be open minded to the facts that it presents. Some where along the way we are going to have to face facts and realize we are going to have to take a stand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure right wing propaganda","review":"Although some of the info is accurate and a nuclear Iran can be danger to world peace, this author lacks honesty. As one of the other reviewers so eloquently puts it: \\"the man who has neglected to take any meaningful action at all against Iran's nuclear ambitions, Jerome Corsi now has the gall to write a book about the threat of Iran's impending nuclear arsenal.

The author shows strange sympathy for republicans and Jews ignoring the fact that Israel has also an illegal nuclear programme destabilizing the Middle East with its 200 nuclear warheads and if we are seeking stability in that region then everybody must come clean.Furthermore even the title shows that the author is onesided: 'Atomic Iran: How the \\"\\"\\"Terrorist Regime\\"\\"\\" Bought the Bomb and American Politicians'I have a piece of advice for the author:VERDICT COMES AT THE END OF THE TRIAL NOT AT THE BEGINNING.A good writer should analyze a situation from different point of views and let the readers to jugde and draw conclusions from the content.I think 'Iran's Nuclear Option: Tehran's Quest For The Atom Bomb' by Al J.

The subject at hand is therefore quite actual and most relevant for anyone interested in the developments in the Middle-East and how these relate to the global developments. Unfortunately, the author of this book is prejudiced and subjective in every conceivable way, and is so overly stressing regarding his viewpoints (pro-Bush, anti-Kerry, anti-UN, anti-Europe) that the book is a most annoying read for anyone who intends to make up his or her own mind. The author has enough facts to present a gloomy future regarding Iran and it's efforts to secretly build a nuclear weapon. Instead, this PhD-background author fully neglects his academic, all-angle objective education and keeps on hammering on his own viewpoints. Missed opportunity, despite the many facts."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would question the motives of this author","review":"I have not read this book, but I do have to make a statement about the integrity of Mr. Corsi. He helped torpedo John Kerry when he co-wrote\\"Unfit for Command: Swift Boat Veterans Speak Out Against John Kerry\\", which helped in getting Bush re-elected!!Shame on him.I have heard Mr. Corsi deride, on Coast to Coast AM, this administration now, after the fact-duh, but I am still waiting for an apology!He helped this madman get elected and he is responsible for all that has followed.

However, it's not a very entertaining record, and I haven't listened to it more than a few times, and only spotty-like at best. The folk-ish mood of the record isn't my style, and I can't safely recommend it to anyone who's into a lot of slam poetry or \\"Slam\\" the movie. It's more of a folk music record with poems on top of it, much like Carl Hancock Rux' weak record (\\"Rux Revue\\") is a blues/folk record with poems thrown on top of it.If poets want to attract people to poetry, don't approach it from the stance that what you're doing hasn't been done \\"quite this way before\\", so much as \\"it might be different, but will people I'd like to reach dig it?\\"I like his poetry, and found his monologue grand.

Sundiata mixes spoken word with some great jazz and vocals. Even when there is no music the cadence of his delivery is jazz. Space: A Monologue is like an Eric Dolphy sax solo in poetic form. Sundiata is more than just a great poet, he is a great performer of poetry. This is a great CD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Brigitte in Scotland","review":"This 1967 Brigitte Bardot vehicle, actually entitled \\"A Coeur Joie!\\" (\\"Head Over Heels\\") features an appropriately bored-looking Brigitte portraying a bored housewife who, on a whim, takes off for Scotland with a handsome lover (Laurent Terzieff). The on-location footage at a Scottish castle is lovely, but not as gorgeous as Brigitte, who set new standards for French beauty. Although the story does not amount to much, there are lots of little touches to amuse anyone interested in French culture. For example, drinking milk is employed as a torture, while smoking and drinking are presented as healthy pastimes. In the most amazing scene, Brigitte (a real-life animal rights activist) not only pets her dog but also her fish! The standard video release of this film is in letterbox format with large yellow subtitles written across the black stripe at the bottom of the screen. The visibility of the words is so good that one wishes that the dialogue made more sense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jigsaw","review":"It was a quick easy read.

It contains many clichés with little to really move story along"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money -- not worth reading even for free.","review":"There was virtually no tension in this story, and the plot consisted mostly of assembling pieces of a photo cut into pieces, distributed among several people. There were several beatings and a couple of murders, none of which was surprising, or exciting, or cause of much concern. The policework was rather boring and the dialogue was stilted and outdated. The author's descriptions and comments were trite and often embarrassing in their old-fashionedness, and his attitude toward women from another era.I had remembered 87th Precinct mysteries as being much better -- so either my recollection is at fault, or this one is simply a loser.Even at the special price of $1.00 this is a waste."},{"rating":"2","title":"Columbo","review":"The 1994 TV movie \\"Columbo: Undercover\\" is based on this book. In the movie, Columbo is substituted for several different characters from the book, alternating from scene-to-scene. Sometimes he's the book's Detective Carella, other times he takes over for Detective Brown, who also appears in the movie. As confusing as this may sound, the movie is actually a very faithful adaptation of the book - even the pieces of the photo are identical to the illustrations in the book. Fans of the book should check out the movie (which is available on DVD in the UK, but not yet in the US)."},{"rating":"2","title":"JIGSAW IS A PUZZLE!!!","review":"A man is found dead with a piece of a picture in his hand.

There is also a list of names that have been torn into two pieces. People that hold the pieces are turning up dead. Arthur Brown and Steve Carella try to solve the mystery. They are assisted by Myer Myer and Cotton Hawes. A former insurance investigator is involved. Brown gets beaten up but through it all the 87th comes through. The book is a little slow moving at times, not hardly as good as most of the other McBain book I have read.

Great watercolor illustrations as well.Shalom"},{"rating":"2","title":"good introduction","review":"This is about the fifth of the Very Short Introduction series I read. Although I didn't know much about Hegel's works before reading this book, I feel that the author does a good job introducing \\"Hegel\\" in a well-balanced, well-rounded way, in that he talks about how Hegel fits into the historical context and about other historical figures who influenced him and who he influenced.It was helpful for me that the author introduced the \\"dialectical method\\" that you hear so often about, in a clear, concise way. Apparently, the author doesn't cover all of Hegel's major works, but overall he does a good job getting the reader interested in Hegel's works enough that he would look into Hegel's works in more detail on subjects that interest him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crappy","review":"The VSI series has produced some terrific introductions (notably, Scruton's Kant) but this falls well short. Of course, Hegel's density and obscurity present some unique challenges but Singer's exegesis it extremely flat. Unfortunately, I can't recommend a nice, short introduction to Hegel. As far as I know, no one has yet accomplished this difficult task. However, for those with some philosophy background, I would highly recommend Justus Hartnack's \\"An Introduction to Hegel's Logic.\\" Because its object is Hegel's Logic, you won't find much discussion of the Phenomenology or his work on history. However, in a brilliantly concise 124 pages, Hartnack concisely digests and summarizes Hegel's most difficult work. It's really helpful for understanding how the dialectic works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why do you play with Hegel, master?","review":"I was really surprised to see my Singer cheri having written a book about Hegel. Why Hegel? Why the vulgarisation of philosophy? Who is supposed to read it? I did, 'cause I said to myself that this might be a kind of joke, but unfortunatelly it was not. But I will never understand why do we committ this kind of \\"litterature\\". Do not judge Singer using this book. He has much more to say."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting stuff","review":"I find changing behaviors very fascinating, and this book definitely delivered. The title is misleading in my opinion, it does explain methods of hypnotizing ones self to change negative behavior traits, but more than that, it seemed to help me understand things in a psychological perspective. It really advocated the use of automatic writing, pendulum and finger movements, similar to a ouija board, which is a little freaky to me. It helped me learn a new relaxation technique, which is always beneficial. It is a great addition to your library if you are interested in self behavior modification, with some less common bits of knowledge."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not an academic approach","review":"Some of the psychology in this book is dated. For example, the author frequently refers to homosexuality as a disorder so dire that extensive therapy is preferable over hypnosis.The author frequently throws out case studies, antecedents and statistics to back up his claims, but not once are these properly cited. Had there been proper documentation, the otherwise ridiculous claims that breast sizes can be enlarged with hypnosis (page 106) would be easier to swallow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Edition; Best Price","review":"This is the Bach-Gesellschaft edition with very little editing.

If you are a casual player of Bach, or if you are assembling an essential library of piano literature, this edition is just fine, however."},{"rating":"2","title":"music is great","review":"I got this book when I just learned to play the prelude 1 c major, and thought I would look into others later, even though the majority of those preludes and fugues are far beyond my ability to play. Since then I have tried to play prelude 2 (I) and prelude 24 (II) that is extremly beautiful though not easy to play, and I have listened all preludes and some fugues from CD or midi files with this book opened in front of me. I realized how great Bach's music is. Only complaint is that the cover of the book isn't glued strong enough, which is now seperated from the content pages already after only a short period use. Also, the prelude 1 (book I) is probably the correct version, but I have seen from some other books the other version with an extra measure between bar 22 and 23. I now play it with the extra measure since it seems making sense to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"love it","review":"I agree with all these reviewers here, who all have given this cd five stars. This is a fantastic, hard-rockin' record, sounding somewhere between grunge and alternative, which I suppose a lot of stuff coming out in the late 90's sounded like. This is very fresh, even ten years later, and never loses it's appeal to fans of solid rock music. The title track alone is worth the price of admission. Other favorite tracks include Bleed, Savior, Nowhere Man, Undressed, and, of course, the super finisher, Rain Down. This thing completely rocks from start to finish. I have a particularly fond memory of seeing these guys perform at The Hurricane in the Westport area of Kansas City. Missouri, and they did not disappoint. With one album under their belts and no record label support, Outhouse didn't get nearly the opportunity to show their stuff that they should have.

Toshiba promised to fix it or replace it, but, three months later, it's still broken and we're still waiting for our new tv. Since Amazon has a no-return policy for big-screen tv's, we're at the mercy of Toshiba and their terrible customer service.

F3.5 is great for most situations, and most macro work isn't done running down my subjects, so I can afford to setup my tripod. However, one of the attractions of this lens is as a general purpose lens, and I've found myself in shade on overcast days really wanting a faster lens.Autofocus with this lens seems to run from adequate to useless, never great.

Dave Jenkins, a rough-around-the-edges deputy, finds himself baffled not only by the murders that keep happening in his town, but by a voice from beyond the grave that scares him as much as it seems to be trying to help him. He's getting to the bottom of this case, despite being bogged down by petty small-town politics, rampant juvenile delinquency, and trouble on the job that's a potent mixture of professional jealousy and the strain of finding himself at the apex of a love triangle with his boss's daughter and the high school crush he never quite stopped pining for.

I called the tech support and they said that if I sent it to them they would work on it but it would cost about $100.00 so I figured I could live with the error messages. Then a tragedy happened and the screen got cracked. So I called to see if they would cover that and they don't cover the screen damage in their warrenty. That would have cost $190.00 to replace, so at that price I could just buy a hole new Pocket PC. One Year Warranty, I ask \\"WHAT WARRANTY?\\" I should have gone with the HP 1935 in the first place.

Given all of that, the \\"Rumble In The Jungle\\" song by the Fugees and the rest is a great new addition to this wonderful collection of more classic R&B. Heck this CD is almost worth the price purely for the quotes by Ali that go on throughout the piece. Ali was a great fighter but his mastery of the English language and his wit still amaze me at times. Moreover this CD is a wonderful representation of the documentary (which I feel is a must see by the way) and I can see visions of it dancing through my head."},{"rating":"1","title":"not recommended","review":"I don't recommend this camera because it's not functional at night, the beam is way to focused so you can only see a very small portion of the crib.

And the biggie - it works on the same frequency as pretty much all consumer Wifi routers which means we have to unplug both cameras in order to use our wireless internet, *every* morning. Oh, and the monitor stand is very unstable - I usually lay it on its side. Smooth stuff. They're about 2 iterations away from a great product.The good: The three available operating modes are nice. Night vision works well for us but we have the cameras really close to the cribs (twins). Sound alarm is nice since the actual audio has static (we turn the ambient audio off and just listen for the alarm).Overall... wait for it... lame. I'll give it a solid \\"C\\".

I returned it 2 days after I received it. The reception was horrible - even when I was in the same room as the camera, the reception was poor. The sound, and automatic audible alarm were even worse. To get the audible alarm to work, we had to manually touch the video camera to get the microphone to pick it up. There is a single pencil-tip thin hole on the bottom of the camera ball which is the microphone.I turned off all of our cell phones, cordless phones, and internet (per the Tech Support's request), and the reception was still poor.

The problem I have with the warm weather set of clothing is that its designed for tall women. The pants are several inches too long (I'm 5'2, which is not all that short, esp with shoes!) The dress hangs off me like a sack, even though I am 7 months along. I have gotten a good bit of use out of the skirt and shirt, so its not a total loss. However the shirt no longer fits since I have gone from an A to a C cup. I imagine anyone who began her pregnancy with a medium to large sized bust won't be able to wear it for more than a couple of months. If I had to do it over I would have used the $150 to buy nice individual items that would have actually fit! I wouldn't recommend this set unless you can try it on before purchasing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh.","review":"I received this as a gift, and I was pretty disappointed. The skirt and pants are great and I wear them all the time, but the shirt and dress never fit right, even toward the end of my pregnancy.

However, the converged efforts of many scholars of this historical book on Korea is one of the best examples of fair representation. Accurate and insightful, the book begins with the basic introduction of nomadic Korea and with skillful elucidation explores the history from the three unified kingdoms up to Korea in the 80's. Each phase is covered in collaboration by experts of that field. Complete detail to geography, arts and culture only enhances the events that took place.

To say that this is a work of fiction is an understatement. In short, the author takes turns pointing to various groups and calling them the devil in order to play to the fears of its intended audience. It's a conspiracy theory, wrapped in bigotry, with no basis at all in reality.If you're looking for something that \\"seems\\" kind of official to validate your radical religious right hatred of homosexuals, civil libertarians, and anyone not like you, and if you aren't concerned that your validation comes without any actual reality to back it up, then this is a must read.

I often consider how our Founding Fathers would view the permissive views and actions of our leaders and liberals in our society. Judging from their writings, even the most liberal among them would be sickened by the low standards and poor morality that Hollywood, Madison Avenue, and many of our government leaders exhibit and promote.David Kupelian leaves no stone unturned exposing the sepents under those rocks. He essentially proves a sinister plot to rob America of it's heritage and once lofty values. Nothing happens by chance at the macro-societal level. You will believe this too after reading this gripping yet disturbing documementary.Jesus warned us about money and power corrupting the soul. Many of our leaders have both, and are now obsessed with dragging America down into a pit of error and well, sin. Prepare to see your world with new eyes!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Glad I read this book","review":"I'm glad to have read Kupelian's book. The author shows how there has been an all out attack on traditional American ideas over the past 50 years via the media. It really opened the eyes to what a small percentage of Americans that are active and organized have done and are doing. Topics include; the myth of church and state separation, children rebellion, multiculturalism, big media, public school system, sex (and Kinsey), abortion, and Christianity. After finishing, I bought three of these books as presents; one for a conservative, and the other two for my liberal friends who need to see facts over hype."},{"rating":"2","title":"At Last Someone Has Captured The Truth.","review":"I cannot recommend this book highly enough. I literally could not put it down and have passed it along to friends and family. Mr. Kupelian has clearly outlined how those who wish to destroy our families, our churches, and our country have managed to do so while flying under the radar of most Americans. His explanations along with copious quotations and first sources are difficult to dispute and have whetted my appetite to investigate these issues more deeply. Please notice how the negative reviews posted here cannot argue with facts, but only by name calling. This is the mind-set that is trying to distort our values. Values that have made America great for over 200 years. There is a lot of work to do, but by reading this book, you'll be educated and primed to roll up your sleeves and fight for what you know to be right. Get your hands on this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Flawed but worth the read.","review":"I enjoyed this book thoroughly, and read it in one seating. Kupelian does a great job of research in terms of revealing the elaborate marketing schemes various left-wing groups have constructed in order to further their agendas.

Our country was founded on the escape of persecution, and the rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. To protect these basic values, we have the Bill of Rights. What the author suggests (discrimination against various groups and mass censorship) blatantly disregards the constitution and claims only his views are \\"American\\" and \\"morally just\\". What could be more American than the Constitution?This author is one of the most hypocritical people I've had the misfortune to run across. His statement is that radicals are evil. Alright. But, he supports anti-gay, anti-abortion, and censorship campaigns. Causes often associated with the RADICAL Right. Do that not make him also evil?

Other reviewers have previously covered these issues in some detail.Where the book does fall short in its search for truth, (important for Kupelian), is objectively looking at 9/11, the creation of Israel, the ownership of American major media and the role that the masonic orders have played in influencing the topics that he covers.Please remember one very important thing: presidents that belong to a masonic order are NOT Christian !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast Book","review":"The order was received promptly.

It is refreshing to find a book that discards all the post-modern dogmas of \\"tolerance\\" and \\"diversity\\", and instead reminds us that there was a time (and it can be that way again) when children's innocence was to be protected at all costs, and the nuclear family was the basic building block that formed our nation.It is a must-read for parents who want to know what they're up against, and a must-read for teenagers who need to know how they're being thoroughly manipulated by commercial, political, and social causes who want them dumbed-down & pacified."},{"rating":"1","title":"Feeble nonsense","review":"It's amazing that this kind of nonsense gets written, let alone published, in an 'advanced' society like the USA.

This book should be read by all REAL AMERICANS to see just what these evil traiters have in mind if they ever gain control of the country. Think Taliban with 10,000 nuclear weapons.

This book captures all of this and more in spades."},{"rating":"1","title":"Holy Crap is Right....way TOO Right.","review":"A reviewer notes that the Judeo-Christians are tired of being branded as bigots. I can't blame them for that. Perhaps if they chose not to impose their morality on the remainder (albeit minority) of the population by labeling them as \\"deviant\\", then they themselves may no longer be labeled as \\"bigots\\". Realistically, who threw the first punch here? The ideology that the minorities that are shifting our cultural perceptions are doing so through savvy marketing efforts would pre-suppose that these minorities are as organized as the Judeo-Christians who meet regularly and form agendas. That's simply not the case. Trust me. I wish it were."},{"rating":"1","title":"Your Kidding Right??","review":"The Marketing of Evil, the title says it all.

All the lessons our loving parents have taught us about good and bad and pure and evil have been abandoned for twisted and pervert lessons by educators and those who support them.Our children are being taught vile materials in school, they are told that perversion is acceptable when parents teach them otherwise, honoring God has become offensive to a small group who are forcing this standard on the rest of us and our children are being mentored by those who do not care about their wellbeing.

Unfortunately, the book suffers from the same basic problems as the news stories on Mr. Kupelian's website WorldNetDaily: poor writing and an excess of \\"spin\\". His basic premises may be valid, but the way he puts forth his arguments are completely over-the-top.He also suffers from the delusion that everyone who believes in traditional Judeo-Christian morality also agrees 100% with the Republican agenda when it comes to other issues. There are many religious believers out there who are conservative on sexual morality but liberal on things like the environment, the Middle East, social justice, multiculturalism, etc.It's really too bad that this book wasn't better written, as its message is an important one for people to hear."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book to make you think","review":"In my opinion readers should discern what they are reading, ask questions, seek answers and satisfy themselves that what they have read is truth or fiction. This book created many questions for me and while it may appeal to one type of worldview over another, the fact is, this book encouarges the reader to think more carefully about their culture and fauna of that culture. If a person wants pablum, there is plenty of that available from other sources. This book is a source to chew on, look into and encourage the reader to satisfy one's own curiosity. This is a source to send the reader into further investigation and from that standpoint is highly regarded by this reader. Anyone can tell someone what to think, few report what actually is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gem of a book","review":"Awesome book, a real eye opener.

It seemed like propaganda to me. But seeing these knee-jerk negative reviews made me ask \\"Why do people feel threated by this book?\\"Within the pages of \\"The Marketing of Evil\\" Mr. Kupelian presents a strong case that America has been convinced to embrace certains \\"rights and freedoms\\" that are nothing more than the selfish desires of a relatively small minority.

Then draw you own conclusion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just the facts ma'am","review":"and boy does Mr. Kupelian stick to the facts. He chronicles falsified data on abortion casualties, the conflict of interest of the justice on the Supreme Court who wrote the majority position on Roe (whose own daughter had an abortion, which he encouraged.)

Believe that homosexuals are just 'born that way'? Revere Dr. Kinsey as a cultural heo? If so, you can thank nefarious parties who have given you your opinion with little penetrating thought on your part.If you're not afraid to have your belief system rocked off its morings, read this book.

David Kupelian writes not only with academic excellence but interjects his personal immigrant heritage of a man who loves America and all it stands for. This book is not just a rant about what's wrong in our culture today, but is a message of hope and solution to the problem. As a professor of international marketing and business, I salute Mr. Kupelian for his clear and concise insight and grasp of the essence of how marketing can be used for irresponsible and disasterous purposes. It has always been a challenge to an educator to develop skills of reason, logic and rational thinking in both young and adult learners. To this end, Dave Kupelian has done an exceptional job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marketing Satanism","review":"This is a great follow up by the author.

It was probably 40 years old, but today you could check the items off one by one. They ranged from legalizing abortion to a large scale homosexual revolution. Things that you wouldn't even associate with communism. It was eye opening knowing when it was written, and this book expounds the truth greatly. Even most of the people that think they're supportin a valiant liberal cause hae no idea what they are actulally doing to this great country."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Blood Confessions\\" is an awakening.","review":"Kupelian's chapter on abortion, \\"Blood Confessions,\\" stands right next to everything written about the holocaust.

I'm sure many were simply deceived as I was. If you read this book and continue in the thought and practice of evil, it will be because you simply choose to be deceived. It's time to blow the dust off our Bibles and read them, and seek God for our Country, and our children. Without His influence on our lives, there is no hope.

This book covers some of their strategies, but not as thoroughly as Juliet Schor's \\"Born to Buy: The Commercialized Child and the New Consumer Culture.\\" That book does a better job of revealing the multibillion-dollar marketing effort to turn kids into oversexed, status-obsessed consumers. To get kids, and adults, hooked on various bread and circuses (like pro sports fanaticism) makes it easier for Big Business to continue their takeover of the country.For people who don't have time for a lot of reading, the DVD \\"The Merchants of Cool\\" covers much of the same sort of material. And if you want your kids to start thinking critically about their media diet, subscribe them to journals like New Moon, Teen Voices, and Adbusters; and get yourselves a subscription to Mothering Magazine and a copy of the DVD \\"The Corporation.\\"There are also good organizations working on these issues, like Commercial Alert."},{"rating":"1","title":"A lesson in marketing to right-wing Christians.","review":"This is a book that labels rock and roll, homosexuals, cultural diversity, sexual freedom, and all of the other right-wing Christian hot topics as \`evil'.

When I first heard the title track, I was absolutely blown away by the incredible musicianship and how they wrote the song in movements instead of the usual way.

Not only are the instrumentals great but Pearts lyrical writings, I am not a fan of Rand's but i fail to see many connections to her in the song. The song ending in another great instrumental though the robot saying \\"attention all planets of the solar federation\\" was pretty stupid.

For listeners that don't know the band's album chronology, most wouldn't even dream that this release came right after CARESS OF STEEL!!! Furthermore, it's unusual for a band to go from such a lackluster album (CARESS OF STEEL) in the minds of critics and some fans (even though I give CARESS 5 stars), to arguably their best album EVER!!! The title track is easily their best epic song ever, ahead of Hemispheres, By-Tor and the Snow Dog and The Fountain of Lamneth. \\"Side\\" 2 features a collection of diverse songs, such as the folksy \\"Lessons\\", to the very mellow \\"Tears\\", which features Hugh Syme.

Neil Peart's drumming is amazing here and some of the best drumming ever recorded.

The story told in this extended title track is punctuated by the ebb and flow of the music. The lyrics tell the story while the music sets the mood and conveys the feelings and emotions of the story.

This is what happens when a few teenagers (i.e. Rush) stumble upon a philosophy textbook or the doggrel of lousy writer and thinker (Rand), and says, \\"Cool! Let's write a concept album!\\" A little knowledge is a dangerous thing indeed. The boys are all excellent musicians, we know that, and sometimes the music really soars. But come on.

I would advise fans of later Rush (Permanent Waves onward) to understand that older Rush is a different animal involving different musical tastes in many ways. However, if you're looking to dig a bit deeper into Rush, then 2112 is a good place to start- a concept album with some pretty rocking moments and the kind of songwriting ambition we just don't see anymore.

I later realised through discussions with a friend that Neil Peart (Rushes Drummer & Percussionist)was a fan of Ayn Rand's work... in fact there is a dedication to her on the 2112 CD... 2112 1n fact seems to be based round the anti-force pro-individal objectivist philosophy of Ayn Rand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Artistic and Commercial Breakthrough","review":"Though Rush experimented with writing epics on their previous album, this is the one where it all clicked. From the opening whoosh of the synthesizer (its first appearance on a Rush record) to the thundering close of \\"Grand Finale\\", the title suite is a great slab of heavy progressive rock -- you don't even need to take the Rand-influenced lyrics seriously to enjoy it. Side 2, filled with more of the Zeppelinesque hard rock of their early period, is less exciting -- with the exception of \\"Something for Nothing\\" and the drug-addled \\"Passage to Bangkok\\", the songs are mostly forgettable.

Theatrical in its execution, the title track tells a story with music and words matched so well that you can just close your eyes and watch it play in your mind.

I still find myself screaming out \\"we are the priests of the Temples of Syrinx!\\" whenever I want to stretch my rock chops vocally, and my air guitar never gets better than when it attacks this CD.Rush grew up (and Neil eventually departed, at least slightly, from his Ayn Rand adulation) to record some terrific art-rock, but never surpassed \\"2112\\" IMHO."},{"rating":"1","title":"the \\"plan 9 from outer space\\" of music","review":"this album is terribly funny, but i would probably never listen to it. rush is really an extremely mediocre band and this album is nothing other than tasteless plagiarism of bands like yes, king crimson, genesis, not to mention authors like ayn rand. probably the most unintentionally funny album ever released. but since it is made by rush, it is still quite unlistenable. get something like \\"close to the edge\\", \\"the lamb lies down on broadway\\", or \\"trout mask replica\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"This CD is horrible!","review":"I love guitar music, but I couldn't get past the whiny vocals.

After the dopey, much too long instrumental, the 'story' starts like a bad sci-fi movie & goes downhill from there. It meanders like crazy, all too apparently trying to burn up time. Our \\"hero\\" is a puss, who dreams & cries, cries & dreams some more, wah wah wah. Supposedly, he kills himself because the bad guys win. Life sucks now in a world with no freedom nor imagination. Rush are like the bad guys, they have no imagination.The singer sounds like a girl, the guitar player can only play atonal solos completely lacking any musicality & the drumming exists, nothing more.I heard Rush was called the thinking man's band.

I'm a pretty big fan dating back to the early 80's, but the less costly Deluxe version probably would serve most quite well. That is also what I paid for the Moving Pictures BD-A.

If you've ever considered painting or decorating a tile ....have at it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad, but needs something.","review":"When 'Exit, Stage Left' came out, I was hoping for a good sequel to All The World's A Stage. I was kinda let down when I played the album, as it lacked the creativity and vibe of ATWAS. Maybe it's the fadeout between songs, maybe it's the lack of photo creativity in the album insert (album cover, if like me you purchased the 2-LP version when it was released). There are three photos in the cover, one of each member of the band, and they are not well-taken pictures. In the CD release, those same pictures are reversed - I was pretty sure Alex was not a left-handed guitarist.Nevertheless, the compilation of songs is very nice, and the addition of 'Broon's Bane' is a goodie, a nice touch to introducing 'The Trees.' It is also a treat to hear how 'Closer To the Heart' changes from live album to live album (starting with this release of course). Even with my opinion on it's short-comings, I see this album as a nice closure for the second chapter of Rush. Buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great 'live' release.","review":"I have loved this disc ever since I first heard it in the late 80's. My enthusiasm was only slightly dimmed when I recently learned about the studio overdubs. What a bummer. Hence my lowered rating. Otherwise I'm tempted to say this is the best live album I've ever heard. \\"Xanadu\\" and \\"Jacob's Ladder\\" contain some of my favorite drum work of all time-these are amazing versions of these songs. \\"Broon's Bane\\" is stunningly gorgeous, Alex plays with fluidity and grace. You get plenty of Rush's greatest songs here. In fact, this set can substitute for a 'greatest hits' package if you want (Tom Sawyer, La Villa, Closer To The Heart, Freewill, YYZ, etc..) Great stuff even with a few overdubs. Rush at their best.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where's Alex? Right Here!","review":"I think this is the best live Rush album, besides Different Stages of course. How could it be bad? It's a collection of the best songs from Rush's peak period (with the notable exception of Limelight). A lot of people have said that the songs are to close to the studio versions. And while some of them are pretty close, none are carbon copies. After all, if it ain't broke don't fix it. Actually, they did fix it though. This album is heavily overdubbed. No matter, it's still one to get."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Songs and Musicianship....very poor recording quality","review":"I have to be the odd Rush fan out on this disc. I have listened to this record for years and just cannot warm up to it. I agree with the fine musicianship and a good selection of songs from 70's and early 80's, however only one other reviewer recognized the totally overpowering bass. This record is muddy, bassy, and overall not a great quality recording. I am surprised Rush being as quality conscious as they are every allowed this to be released. This was released at the peak of Rush's popularity and nobody seemed to care that the original LP and now the disc is from a poor master recording. Most of the reviews focus on the song selection, and on nothing else. I am surprised this has stood the test of time with CD technology. If this is how Rush really sounded live in 1980, I am glad I didn't see them until a few years later. I have seen Rush 7 times live, they always played this well or better, but never sounded this bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, but not correct...","review":"This disc is magic. Alex Lifeson at his very best. One thing though... no extra tracks! It shouldn't be billed as having any. The original has all listed tracks too. Get it anyhow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rush at their peak.","review":"I don't even usually like live albums, but 'Exit Stage Left' is exceptional. This LP presents Rush at their creative and commercial peak, and faithfully reproduces their live concert sound while demonstrating their virtuoso musical chops. It also serves as a 'best-of' for their early to mid periods (1974-1981). A great headphone album, and a great concert document."},{"rating":"2","title":"A SECOND GREAT LIVE CD","review":"Rush is back with a new live cd, their second, after only four studio cds, just like their first live recording. This cd contains songs from their last four studio cds, plus one from their first four.Exit contains some excellent live recordings, before they became very complex in their recording of their music. For the most part, the cd has good interaction with the crowd, a good example of this is on Closer to the Heart, with the crowd singing along with band. This is a good cd, but I like their first live the best (ALL THE WORLD'S A STAGE), but you will not go wrong with either."},{"rating":"1","title":"not really my kind of music","review":"i bought this Rush album, not knowing what any of their music sounds like. I don't really like 80's music, so this cd wasn't my favorite. I am not really bashing this cd, it's just not my kind of music. I'm sure if you like this kind of music, it is the Sgt.

I know they could have done better than this! Is this the same producer that produced MY LIFE? This album is full of half baked hip hop tracks and amaturish hooks that sound like some child wrote them. Mary's incessant moaning and groaning in an out of key gets utterly annoying. I wonder if she was just trying to over compensate for some of the weak tracks she had to sing over. She's constantly wrestling with her songs and beating them up. MEMO TO MARY: SOMETIMES LESS IS MORE. I wonder what it would be like to have Mary team up with a more traditional R&B producer to help steer her in a better direction? I don't believe she has tapped into her full potential yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Good when Compared to Her past few but still missing","review":"I'd give this Album a 2.5 overall.Production by Puffy&Crew is a welcome for Mary but overall this Album has time warp written all over it.much like Michael Jackson's Invinvible alot of the material here feels like it was Canned Side tracks from 1992 that just didn't make the cut then.alot has changed&I use to like MJB more then but now give me that Ultimate Greatest Hits Set&I'm Cool.Her Formula of Making music has worn out it's Welcome for me&my ears overall.this Album is easily better than Her past few but still missing something that says something for me.this Album feels like a Attempt at trying to Re-Capture Her Street Cred&that should never come into Question because MJB has never really Crossed over to begin with despite having Success&being in the game over a Decade.running back to Puffy was a Cool Idea but I think at least 5-6 years too late now.most of the tracks here are decent to Good but nothing really knocks me out."},{"rating":"1","title":"No More Garbage","review":"Totally agree. This CD was g-a-r-b-a-g-e. I think Mary was trying to mend fences with Puffy. A testament that she is not the out of control diva people have always tried to claim. However, after this she'll probably be a bit more business savvy. Giving Puffy the reigns was a major mistake.Don't get me wrong. Puffy's strong suit is remixes. Should Mary ever decide to do a remix anthology of all her solo joints and featured appearances over the past 15 years - CALL DIDDY GIRL! He'll give those tracks the hookups they need. Otherwise, he should never be allowed in any studio during the creative process with real musicians. He's best adding a dash of flavor afterwards; usually biting a slamming 80's sample.Anyways all the great singers - except Chaka Khan - have had a few bad albums that were commercial failures and/or lacked any serious material worthy of radio airplay.Love and life.

In this her 8th CD, Mary has managed to create a set of tracks that covers ever aspect of Love and Life. From the raw emotions of \\"When We\\" to the passion filled \\"Ooh\\", Mary manages to mix raw hip-hop beats with the intensity of the soul singer. For those that just merely listen to an album to hear the beat, this is for you. For those that listen to the album to listen to the message in the lyrics, this is for you. And for those that like to look really deep, into the overall theme of an album, this is for you. Perhaps my favorite song on the album, Ultimate Meditation(AM)displays the intensity and passion that Mary has been known for, but taking her raw emotions to a new and exciting level. This is good, but I won't consider this Mary's best, for the best is yet to come."},{"rating":"1","title":"Her Worst Album Yet!!!!! - No More Drama is a close 2nd","review":"(...)

It took me about a month before I purchased this cd because I was very leary and I am pretty pissed. I have had this cd for about 6 months and I have only listened to it partially (I can't stand to listen to it completely)about twice. The only songs that I like are the 1st single, Don't Go and Willing and Waiting. Not Today and OHH are very annoying songs. I absolutely can't stand her current single \\"It's a Wrap\\", what in the hell are you talking about. I also want her to stop trying to hit high notes becuase she is not that great of a singer. I guess diehard fans will have to stick to her first two classic cds because her future is looking very bleak unless her production steps up becuase Puffy was just on here strictly for publicity."},{"rating":"1","title":"HOT MESS","review":"THIS ALBUM SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING WHITNEY ON THE CRACK WOULD MAKE IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH LOVE OR LIFE SHE MUST HAVE BEEN SMOKIN WHEN SHE MADE THIS ALBUM AND THE DVD IS A HOT MESS IT LOOKS LIKE A BACK YARD PRODUCTION I DON'T ADVISE ANYONE TO BUY IT TRUST ME IT WAS A GIFT AND I AM THROUGH."},{"rating":"1","title":"RETIREMENT TIME FOR MARY!","review":"This album sucked!

Why should Mary J. be penalized for growing. This album is still hot. Her music is still Grit, to the essence and element of the word. Her Pic should be right next to the word in Websters! Anyway, compare Mary to her peers. Compare her to the other albums out right now. You may be used to the saddness in her voice and love the way it comforts you. But happiness, in a once depressed soul, is much better than despair. Feel me!! Mary is real, so she gonna sing like she feels. Undeniable though, is the fact that Mary always brings us top form music. Reliaze that, and you will enjoy this spirtual soul singer and her ride to the top, that much more.

This album features club-ready slammers,tender love ballads,and gospel-flavored songs. This album is more upbeat and a celebration of coming full circle of who she is and has been. The songs are evidence of her spiritual growth and her transcendence over a childhood in the projects of Yonkers, New York and an early success plagued with drama,to her current joy.

No More Drama was supposed to be just that-- the end of drama in Mary's life (personally and professionally) but obviously from the vibe of this CD and other things in her releases previously, NMD must have meant no more drama for 2001.

I been a Mary fan since 1992. I own all of Mary's albums. It appears that Mary is trying to regain a Hip-Hop edge after going Pop with Mary and No More Drama. This is one of the first Mary albums I did not give a 5 star rating. As time goes by and as she gets older, she needs to make music that appeals to her new fans. Most of those who liked family affair would have a problem with My Life and What's the 411. She has to face the fact she is a pop star.There are a couple of tracks that would do well in clubs suchas Love at First Sight, Ooh, and All of my Love.

Mary shows much love to her fiance' on the album also. All the songs are very good. P.Diddy's beats are on point and fit the lyrics. There are only four appearances featuring other artists such as; Method Man, Jay-Z, 50 Cent, and Eve. I advise everybody to pick this album up. It is definitely one of the best of the year. The Queen of Hip-Hop Soul is back, and isn't losening her grip to the title."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mary good as always","review":"It is great to have Mary back with Puffy.

I am not a fan of the buble gum \\"of the moment\\" music. Mary's music is something that you can put away for years, then pull it out and its fresh all over again. You will still feel it the way you did the first time you listened to it. This album deserves the same accolades her prior albums received. Its fresh. Its authentic music."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT A PLEASANT LISTENING EXPERIENCE!","review":"Being a MJB fan since the beginning, I must say this effort is absolutely embarrassing. The music or should I say the beats and countless samples (thanks alot Puff) are elementary, there's no real instrumentation; everything sounds programmed, and the most shocking thing for me are the vocals which are horrid, ill-structured, and off key throughout the whole cd. I'm thankful I got a chance to preview it on AOL which saved me from wasting my hard earned cash. I checked it out from the library because the quality was not that great on AOL and it still has that nails scratching a chalk board effect on me. The only decent cut is the final track \\"Ultimate Relationship (AM).\\" Mary you got too much talent and heart for this type of material."},{"rating":"1","title":"No inspiration...no soul","review":"After listening to this CD for a few weeks, it is painfully obvious that the creative forces behind this product lacked any real inspiration. The beats are tired. The songs are lackluster. Why deviate from the winning formula that was \\"No More Drama\\"? \\"Family Affair\\" was #1 for months. Hopefully Mary will trust her instincts next time...from the DVD that accompanies the CD, you can tell that she wasn't feeling it...nor is radio or the consumer. After two failed singles, this CD has plummeted off the charts. Puffy is old news, and it's time for Mary to start really singing again and work with some contemporary producers. More than likely, a greatest hits package is going to drop next year...wait to buy that. I'm sure that it will contain the 'best' of what this CD has to offer, which, sadly, isn't much. A severe disappointment--and I think she's great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mary should have not rejoined with P.Diddy","review":"Sometimes it is not a good idea to return to your first love.

At first I wasn't sure why any kid would like this book. It's about an \\"ugly pumpkin\\" who can't find a home with anyone in time for Halloween. Several characters, including a goofy looking skeleton and a bunch of trees, are downright mean to this pumpkin, down to leaving him alone in the road and stealing his shoes, only to run him off again. However, our protagonist has a happy ending - just in time for Thanksgiving - as he finds out why being different really isn't so bad. One of my three year old's favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Ugly Pumpkin","review":"This book was in GREAT condition! It arrived quickly and I am very happy with my order."},{"rating":"1","title":"Freaks should hang out with their own kind?!?","review":"There are a lot of great things about this book. The art, the rhymes, the holiday fun.But the bottom line is the message. The original Ugly Duckling had a everyone has beauty inside message. This one has the message that Freaks should hang out with thier own kind.Seems very problematic and I am not sure there was any good way for the author to work around that.But I am sure that between the editor at the publishing house and the author, they really came no where close to over thinking the concept."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Poetry, Fun Story!","review":"I think that this story has good poetry, great old fashioned pictures, and is a lot of fun. It takes care of the Halloween story and Thanksgiving in one swoop. The poor pumpkin is mishapen and is considered ugly. Others play jokes on it and no one takes him home. Does the story have a happy ending? We'll see!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Family Favorite","review":"All three of us love this book--our little girl thinks it is funny and the illustrations really hold her attention, as so the sing-song rhyme scheme which is present throughout the book.

Also great for kids who like Halloween themed books."},{"rating":"2","title":"My children love this book!","review":"My daughter borrowed this from the school library and after reading it 4 or 5 times in a row we bought a copy.

Highly recommend this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Same great album + new packaging and bonus track","review":"If you already have this CD, get it anyway! The new packaging is pretty cool (like a mini-LP case) with a booklet containing press releases, notes from Robert Fripp and whatnot.

My God. Has it been that long? This album stands out as unique in my 200+ whatever collection of CDs. There is just nothing to compare it to. Is it rock? I'd say no. It's not dance music. But it's very intense electronic guitar oriented music. Excellent drumming and stick bass. Sweet vocals. So unformulaic. The electronic guitar feedback at the end of Thela Hun Ginjeet is simply orgasmic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Technique+Power=A Great Album","review":"Can't say I'm totally familiar with a lot of KC's work. A lot of their early stuff that people seem to love is just lost on me. Discipline, however shows this band in a state of grace. They capture the power of the Wetton/Bruford/Fripp trio, but ain't so heavy handed with the \\"whomp\\" of that trio. Tasty is a word that could be used, among others for this disc. I used to listen to this album daily, and thought about taking up guitar because of it. I didn't, but the textures on this disc stay with me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seriously incredible, demented and inventive Prog/Art rock","review":"I dug into this when it came out --- I was in a metal band playing Sabbath and Priest, but we were into everything from Sinatra to Sex Pistols and rediscovering all the 60's groundbreakers like Robert Fripp, et al...When Discipline came out we just about shat ourselves...the musicianship, dynamics, vision, and skill level is out-of-this-world. Wild guitar playing, endlessly inventive, seriously demented percussive and melodic structures, themes and lyrics. Incredible high-tech engineering and in-your-face effects and synth-like guitar and bass work. Very New York street vibe. You can taste and smell the city streets, underground clubs, and avant garde art events in the music.If you don't know about Robert Fripp (guit) , Adrian Belew (guit/vox), Tony Levin (bass) , Bill Bruford (drums) you gotta check this stuff out...intense!

Blue destiny is a awsome book, it has nonstop action, the characters are awsome but i wish it was in color, and around the middle it gets kinda boring and the action stops but then they pick right back up. this book doesnt have anything to to with the gundamwing series which most of you are familiar with but its still good, anyone could read this even if they dont know much about GW but its still awsome, so all i can say is just buy it.!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good enough i guess^_^;","review":"Well, what can I say... I guess this G.Novel is a welcom addition to the UC huge story line, with a nice and innovative mini story. to be frank, this Novel from the Gundam universe is VERY Good, but for some reasons there are some missing elements that should've been added to the story. anyway, this thing is VERY GOOD..give it a shot!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Being a new fan of the Gundam anime, and unable to track down copies of Tomino's novels, I was very keen to pick up this title which purports to credit him as the author, when in fact he has no actual contribution to this book other than the basic ideas. I was further disappointed to find that it's not actually a novel, but is black & white line art in the usual manga style which, while it attracts legions of fans, doesn't particularly appeal to me. It can be tricky to follow and often requires a huge leap of imagination to fill in the gaps between frames and the half empty dialogue bubbles. I can only take so much 'What....', 'How....', 'Hhffff.....' etc, before I become annoyed at the lack of more substantial dialogue. As for the characters in the story, they're pretty much rehashes of figures from the anime canon so they're adding nothing new in terms of background or depth to the Gundam universe. Unless you're a big manga fan, I recommend saving your hard-earned cash for the anime."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Stuff","review":"I purchased this item and recieved it very fast. Could not ask for a better transaction. Thanks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Only rating./reviewing the 5.1. surround mix","review":"I am only reviewing the 5.1 surround mix and not the entire package. This mix is dreadful. Most of it consists of extra reverb in the rear channels. It reminds me of the sound you get when you flick the \\"Simulated Surround\\" button on your receiver. There was so much potential in remixing this title. Understanding that Rush is a trio would seem to be constrictive to mapping out a surround mix but their masterful use of overdubbing rhythm guitar and synth/keyboards lends itself to moving the sound palette to multiple channels. This new mix doesn't even move Geddy's voice to the center channel. So, if you are looking to purchase on the strength of it's 5.1 surround mix.....don't bother. The remastered stereo mix is a much more satisfying experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The music on this set was as always great.

The guy who mixed it didn't really do what I call a great job. He kind of phoned it in. There's some good moments but for the majority, all he did was put all the music in the mains and then put it in the front and backs again with a little delay so it opens it up and spreads it out. It sounds real nice, but it's not dynamic enough for my taste. In my opinion, the big guitar riffs should come blasting out of the front speaker and slap you in the face! And the little guitar or drum fills should be sneaking out of the back at you. And the vocals should MOSTLY be out of the front. There's a little bit of that, but almost none.In the meantime, getting to hear one of my very favorite pieces of music in a brand new way for the first time after listening to it religiously for 35 years is, well... a religious experience! Certainly worth adding to your collection if you love Rush."},{"rating":"1","title":"I CAN'T HEAR ANY SURROUND EFFECT IN DTSHD!","review":"I have read the reviews and some of the comments.

I had no trouble building the boat. I built the boat with no staples or nails. Her stapleless building technique was straight forward and easy to do. The most difficult part was beveling the inside stems. I would not bevel the entire stem at once, but bevel as I stripped.

In answering this question, the book delves into the brutish outlook of company and founder, which Stone summarizes as, \\"crush the competition.\\" Oddly, Ellison himself is not present. Instead, we glimpse him only through the words of official spokesmen and journalists.

Sorry.I'm not too big of a classic-rocker, but you just cannot disregard Rush as one of the best, EVER. I've always kind of known about them and aknowledged their existence, but never really cared about them until someone said I might like Rush if I was a Coheed and Cambria fan. So I decided to check them out, and the inspiration is definitely there, and it's very obvious. Though Claudio Sanchez claims they'd never listened to Rush before, it's very curious as to how similar they are. Anyway, back to Rush. The epic song \\"2112\\" is one of the greatest to ever be recorded to a compact disc, or anything else. Wait, the whole cd is just amazing. Buy no matter what your interests are, you should be able to respect these guys immensely."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is it","review":"If I could own just one RUSH LP/CD this may be the one I would select and perhaps many others would agree with it. If you are not familiar with RUSH you may be in for a surprise. I think the band is not for all. If you are a Top 40's individual this may be a bit too much for you, they don't have the catchy groove that will take you away - not something you will want to necessarily dance to.If you are musically inclined, or appreciate music at the talent level, well now we can start to talk. These three musicians are true masters at their domain and confuse you (amateur musicians) with timing and tricks that will blow your mind.They do have even more interesting work, like 2112, but these clean cut tracks are certainly ones that you can sit back and enjoy: time and time again."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Rush Album","review":"Moving Pictures seems like the culmination of years of exploration, probably because later albums haven't come close.

Not only are Mr. Lee's high-pitched vocals capable of startling every canine within a five mile-radiance of his revolting shriek, but his lyrics are some of the most pretentious, ridiculous and overtechnical blather in rock history. In the background, Mr. Peart and Mr. Lifeson meander on, spewing instrumentation that is as clean-cut and precise as one could hope, but does not have a drop of soul. A gratuitous layer of synthesizers completes this smooth, anti-septic product. Even Moving Pictures, their most accessible album (that at least spares listeners the Ayn Rand garbage) is an overglossed, hollow, lifeless creation. I may not know how to tune a guitar by ear or how to use a capo but I think I can tell that Rush is a...band."},{"rating":"1","title":"SEll OUT","review":"Rush wanted to get on the radio so Neil Peart decided to write Limelight and Tom Sawyer.

This was disappointing to me because DTS, while not having nearly the audio fidelity of DVD-Audio, is a significant step up from Dolby. Having said that, what's here is pretty hard to argue with. This is RUSH in high fidelity - as it was meant to be listened to. Another review mentioned the surround mix is mostly subtle, I can confirm that, the rear channels are not heavily used. But the Clarity! I've never heard Neal Peart's playing sound so precise and have so much bass. I imagine that the Blu-ray, with it's DTS-HD master audio track, will sound even better--that's why, even with this being as good as it is, I'd recommend waiting for that (if you have the setup), to experience this album in the maximum quality it is available in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reviewing Rush Moving Pictures in TSDETS HD Master Audio","review":"This new Audio Lossless Format is revolutionary.

Crisp sounds and visual imagary keeps this album alive after many many years of music change."},{"rating":"2","title":"go buy the cd","review":"this is a masterpiece and it should be in your collection if you want to call yourself a rush fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply a Masterpiece","review":"Its hard to believe that Moving Pictures was released over 20 years ago. With such hindsight it has become more apparent that those of us fortunate enough to have heard Tom Sawyer the first time it was played on local radio were witnesses to a turning point in modern music. While Rush has continued to amaze me over the years and release outstanding records this one stands over the others as a highpoint of their creativity. I find it hard to believe that another rock band could put together 7 songs in a complete package that flow from song to song so perfectly. The emotion, sound, vocals, percussion, guitars, and bass all have yet to be matched by ANY other band. This record should be on any list of the alltime greatest recordings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential for everyone","review":"\\"Moving Pictures\\" is the perfect marriage of accessibility and intellect. With such classics as \\"Tom Sawyer\\" and \\"Limelight\\", you're sure to hear a familiar riff or two upon popping this album in. What gives Rush songs such staying power, however, is the pure talent. Instead of just a big riff and showy vocals (the only things bands like AC DC ever really had to offer), Rush creates an entire soundscape, full of complex rhythms and great textures. The fact that I (primarly and emo/post hardcore fan) can not only enjoy, but also rock out to, these songs 20 years after they came out says a lot about Rush's capability as songwriters. This is hard rock for the thinkers and those that just enjoy exciting music. Looking at some of the more exciting bands of the last decade, such as Sunny Day Real Estate, and seeing how much they owe directly to Rush is a true testament to their talent, and this album probably shows them at their peak."},{"rating":"1","title":"Five stars for the music. ONE star for the recording.","review":"Another miss by RUSH. WOW ! Come on guys, you have to be aware of all the crap recordings you have been offering us fans over the years. PLEASE bring back Terry Brown !!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"SHOULD NOT BE LABELLED \\"RE-MASTERED\\"","review":"Was very disappointed to find out that this was a RE-PRINT and not a RE-MASTER. Feels like I've been had!"},{"rating":"1","title":"OVERRATED..","review":"2 1/2 stars. I can't force myself to give this album 3 stars. But 2 is not enough. Permanent Waves was the last Great album by Rush. The Camera Eye is a rock n roller track. Glad to have seen them do it live many years ago. Limelight is also good. Vital Signs was, and still is, a testament to how terrible this band's music can be at times. YYZ is absolutely a great song, but horribly recorded. Try this: Listen to La Villa all the way through, and then listen to YYZ . You will see the sub-standard production of it. Moving Pictures is ok. I still listen to it, but not as much as their earlier stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have....","review":"CAMERA EYE, the 10 minute opus in the middle of the album, alone is worth the price of admission! This album is absolutely fabulous. Not only do you get CAMERA EYE...but you get TOM SAWYER and YYZ too...it's just a classic album that no good rock music collection can live without."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic","review":"Classic album. What drummer hasn't put on a set of headphones and tried to tackle what Neil Peart has done on this album?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Exceptionally poor quality recording","review":"I read other reviewers' opinions that the quality of this recording was poor. But I though, hey, this is Blu Ray audio - they must be crazy. So I ordered it... and now I am sending it back. The sound on this is indeed extremely poor. Do yourself a favor and get the Chronicles CD - it will give you all the high points of Moving Pictures, and then some, with better audio."},{"rating":"2","title":"What A CD","review":"In 1981, Rush put out the best album they ever had in their career. Moving Pictures is very outstanding and musical. The big hit Tom Sawyer is their biggest hit or at least I think it is. Red Barchetta is about a fast car that a boy or guy had found in his relations barn and he goes for a ride in it and as you hear the song you can picture yourself in this car and driving it. It really gets your blood pumping. Limelight is also a good song that Peart, Lifeson and Lee had performed on. YYZ is very fine instrumental material. My friend and I used to listen to Witch Hunt and Vital Signs in the dark. WOW what a rush that was. Now I know why they called themselves Rush. All in all this is a very good CD that any Rush fan should have in their collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest Rock Band of All Time","review":"If you don't at least respect Rush for their musician ship, then you dont exist. Rush has the greatest talent of any rock band in the world. Their lyrics are meaningful, their music flows perfectly, and they dont sing about violence or hatred or sex like some of the crap bands that I have heard over the years. I you are smart and not an ass, I can almost guarantee Rush is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just about as close to flawless as you can get","review":"I have had 3 copies of this album two worn out and one played very little, 4 cassettes, and 3 cd's (one original, one gold and now this new one) I do not say this lightly- this is one of the finest recordings ever made. These three guys are the best at what they do. Just stick it in the player and put the headphones on........and take a ride with Tom Sawyer, a futuristic city, a witch hunt, life on a lighted stage and all in a priceless ferrari."},{"rating":"2","title":"the surround mix is...","review":"OUTSTANDING. If you're on the fence about getting this you shouldn't be. Deep bass and tasteful yet subtle surround mix."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic","review":"What more can be said about \\"Moving Pictures\\" that the other reviewers have not already mentioned? This is simply one of the all time best rock albums, and any true fan of the genre should own it - even if you generally don't appreciate Rush. There isn't a bad song on this album. Even though this was released in 1981, it still sounds modern and current. In my opinion, this is one people will be listening to 100 years from now, and beyond."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic","review":"The new era of Rush music. This album is a big favourite with fans and contains a healthy dose of synthesizers. I know fans are divided on the synth issue but I really feel on Moving Pictures the mix is spot on. Rush have always experimented with sound but have maintained contemporary musical sensitivities to produce music that challenges the listener. This album is a classic and well worth a purchase!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Commercial Zenith For Rush","review":"Rush made it big on FM radio while still playing quality progressive rock,something only they and Yes have really been able to achieve. This album and the previous one, Permanent Waves, were part of a very successful period for the band. I think Permanent Waves is a little more consistent though. The first four tunes here are maybe the best album side Rush ever produced,though classic rock radio has me kind of sick of this stuff from overplaying it to death,namely 'Tom Sawyer', 'Red Barchetta',and 'Limelight'.'YYZ' is the second best instrumental in their catalogue(La Viila Strangiato is still supreme).Side two is not as focused despite a couple long pieces that are usually a strength for Rush. 'Camera Eye' is the best of the bunch,but 'Witch Hunt' is maybe the most musically plodding thing this band has ever done. 'Vital Signs' Signals things to come and would have been more comfortable on the next record."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE IT!","review":"I am a huge Rush fan. And I LOVE THIS CD!!!!!! I bought it for one reason...YYZ. And I love the whole thing. It's amazing. Those 3 guys really know how to put out good material. Also, I reccomend the triple-disc live CD. A MUST HAVE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Exelent CD.","review":"First I would like to say that the Song \\"Limelight\\" is the best Song I have heard by Rush.I think it is one of my favorite Rock songs and I listen to every kind of rock from Johnny Cash to Obituary.Rush is a new band to me(lol) I have always ment to listen to these guys but I just started picking up CD's in the past month.This record is great from start to finish.I wont go track by track because there realy is no reason...Every song is worthy of respect ,But the standouts (to me) are \\"TOm SAwyer\\" \\"Limelight\\" and this instrumental called \\"YYz\\" Geddy Lee and Neil Peart realy Throw down on this cd...I think Peart may be the best drummer in Rock ...Better than Most Death Metal drummers I have heard (and I have heard them all)...Buy this CD you will be very happy with it....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timeless....","review":"Do you have that one cd that you will always consider to be your all time favorite? The one where you can play from start to finish and each track takes you on a journey or to another place? For me it will always be this release. I feel that the overall sound on this album is probably why it has treanscended for so many years. As I have gotten older I find myself appreciating production and the mix of an album more so than in my younger days. On a really great system, these songs will go right through you. Check out Neil Peart's drum sound on this album...so tight and clean and not exactly replicated again on any other release. I would next have to say that LIMELIGHT for me, is probably THE quintessential Rush song. Opinions are sure to vary, but one can't deny the impact that this album has had musically, commercially and historically."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"This is one of the obligatory CD's for anyones collection. I find that it's soothing, especially when I eat alot of cabbage and fart.

Chinese food tends to make me fart too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Music, Awful Remaster","review":"What a let-down. The best Rush album in pristine 96khz 24bit resolution could have and SHOULD have been epic. Not so. It's compressed, loud, and harsh in the high end. Hold on to your vinyl copies or try the Mobile Fidelity gold disc version of this classic. It's still the best digital alternative if you can find it. I'm giving this review a two-star for effort. Hopefully we'll see more music in blu-ray high rez-- and done \\"right\\" for a change."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing, decent sound but could be a lot better","review":"Sounds pretty good but they didn't do the titling/buttoning right... you hit dolby 5.1 and it's like you hit nothing. Has 4 or so videos that seem to be 5.1 - the audio portion I have a hard time telling if it's that or just fancy surround. Could be much better in my opinion with a little more clarity on the procedural stuff and perhaps better mixing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible DVD-A mix","review":"I purchased this in hopes of hearing this wonderful album in 5.1 surround sound and what I wound up hearing was lots of reverb. I checked my receiver settings, all was well, set to Straight (no dsp effects turned on) and still, that damn reverb was there. Why? Simple. No 5.1 surround mix was ever done. the \\"audio engineer\\" simply processed the stereo mix through a dsp to create the illusion of a surround sound mix. It's just plain awful."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 stars for Moving Pictures","review":"Rush is just amazing and this CD is a must have for any fan. They keep getting better and better."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best from Rush","review":"If you have to choose only one Rush record, this is it! I like many of their albums, but this one is the most powerful example of their amazing sound. Geddy and Neil do their best straining basses and drums to the limits, and Alex rises his guitar up to heaven. Probably my favourite CD"},{"rating":"2","title":"Never been better before or since","review":"If you love hard rock, you cannot leave this earth without hearing this album. There's just something about the sound of this album that makes it so unique. Unique to all other Rush albums and unique to any other rock album ever made. No filler, but Camera Eye seems a little weak compared to all the other amazing tracks."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Rush, what do you expect?","review":"The only thing I can say about this album is how much you would expect it to sound like Rush, despite the ever increasing presence of the synthesizers in their sonic arsenal. If you're new to Rush, this is an album you must hear. \\"Tom Sawyer\\" was the track that introduced me to the band, and it will make a great first impression on any hard rock fan. Just stop reading reviews and buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Rush Album","review":"The contrast between an album like 2112 or Hemispheres and Moving Pictures is quite astonishing. Transitioning into shortened, single-track songs established a different Rush that had evolved from a rather metallic sound into a more complex and light-hearted band while still maintaining a continuously transforming lyrical and instrumental creativity. Moving Pictures is the quintessential Rush album and features one hit after another with a fantastic set of thematically varied songs that explore many of the more theoretically analytical conceptual qualities of life: burgeoning individualism, linguistic relativity, libertarianism, personification of nature, and phenomenological fairy tales all cohesively embody the album and provide a theoretical foundation that is intrinsically illuminated by the outstanding technical ability and profound emotional qualities that are conveyed by their music."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great classic, remastered","review":"A disc set that is produced beautifully! Disc 2 has 3 videos with a fantastic remaster of their audio and the HD DTS is a fantastic for a surround of an originally produced in stereo that really does it justice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recomended, over-looked, seldom-seen New Zealand film","review":"Ignore Leonard Maltin's review of this film and check it out for yourself! What the British did to the Maoris in New Zealand curiously parallels what happened to the Native Americans in the USA. The story concerns a Maori warrior serving in the British Army who discovers that his family has been wiped out by the same military he is serving in. He tattoos his face and engages in UTU (ritualistic revenge). It is a powerful film, little-known in the USA, but tight, exciting, and and sure to leave you thinking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved this film \\"UTU\\"","review":"We had seen this film years ago and had been looking for it ever since. We received the VHS copy. The quality of the film was not great but primarily because we had gotten so used to high definition.

Item arrived with 1/3of product missing, due improper sealing of the top of the bottle,and product having spilled inside the carton carrying goods.People should be very carefull with these type of items, becauseleakage can cause serious discoloration of other items."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fatal Flaw","review":"The product description twice mentions the \\"doctor recommended\\" program of walking 10,000 steps per day, which is why I bought this watch/pedometer. But it doesn't accumulate your steps throughout the day. If you sit down for 30 minutes, the pedometer goes into sleep mode and you have to re-start it to continue counting. If you forget after driving or working at your computer, you miss the steps you take, which pretty much blows your program. All the watches in the Accelerator line are virtually identical. They're just packaged differently. Furthermore, if that flaw doesn't bother you, the directions for this watch are impossible to understand. I had to call customer service three times and even they had to ask for help to figure it out. They faxed me a simplified set of directions, but that was only slightly more help."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Exercise Tool!","review":"This watch has made working out easier and more enjoyable. It takes the guesswork out of estimating mileage for running and walking. I find myself going farther than ever. I use it when I walk the dog, walk at work, and run. The watch looked large in the picture, and I was worried about it being too big for a petite wrist, but it was no larger than my other athletic watch. The watch was easy to set up once you understand the map of the features that comes with it. I had to adjust the stride length a couple times, but once I got that down, I was ready to go!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This wasn't the solution I was looking for.","review":"I bought this watch to count my steps so that I'd have a better idea of my activity during the day. The problem is that if I sit down at my desk, it will sense that I'm not being active and turn the counter off. That's not really helpful.Also, the display is very, very confusing. You have to cycle through 20 different screens to find the one you want. I keep the manual on the kitchen counter because I have to read the complicated directions every time I want to make any changes. All in all, I wasn't very happy with this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Accelerator Women's Hiker Watch","review":"Attractive. Lightweight. Multiple functions.Too bad I couldn't figure them out.

I'll stick with those cheaper models.A higher I.Q. than mine is required here!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed with the step counter","review":"I bought this product hoping it would accumulate the steps/day to motivate me to walk more. It was a bummer to see after I've started the pedometer steps that it would go into sleep mode and that all the steps were not counted. You have to hit start button after sitting down from driving or when at rest to start the count again. It became a bigger nuisance and high maintenance to keep checking if it was not tabulating or not! At night it would chirp intermittedly and hard to follow the instructions to turn that feature off. I'm going for an Omron as recommended by friends instead!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't believe it works this well!","review":"Excellent alternative to more expensive GPS's and old-fashioned 'clickety-clack' pedometers. I can vouch for the 95% accuracy. I don't like the auto-resetting function of the pedometer but maybe I just haven't figured out how to use it properly. I do like how it records data by date. Prior to use, you do need some patience and a 9-yr old child to help teach and motivate you to figure out most functions. I would ask Tech4O to come up with a model that has a better crystal. Mine is pretty scratched up and I might pay $50 more for one that's more scratch-resistant."},{"rating":"1","title":"techo watch","review":"I like the watch OK but it is too complicated and takes too long to get going before I start to exercise.

The hose continuously falls out of the canister. And the hose has pulled apart from the nozzle that connects to the wand. The suction is really good only if the bag is brand new. It's heavy and bulky. If you really want to waste your hard earned money, this is the vac for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE VACUUM","review":"I purchased this vacuum because I have mostly hardwood floors and thought the power nozzle would work better than a floor brush. Was I wrong!!! The nozzle has no suction without the rug power on and that only pushes the dust and particles to another spot. The tiny floor attachment is what I end up using and it takes me twice as long to vacuum. Also, the attachment holder which doesn't keep the atttachemnets in place, keeps you from getting under beds and tight areas, the reason I prefer a canister. I think it is also cheaply made machine. The first time I changed the bag the clip broke. There is also an irritating high pitched screach the vacuum makes that makes this a horrible little machine. I wish I had researched this a little better and perhaps seen it in person before I purchased it. I don't recommend this to anyone!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after 1 year","review":"I must say, I loved this vacuum when I first purchased it. It was a little heavy, but it had excellent suction. If I had reviewed it when I first purchased it, I would have given it 4 or 5 stars... Over time, it lost suction. About a week ago, the hose came apart from the handle and wouldn't stay in, so I kept having to push it back in. This morning I tried to turn it on, and now it won't work at all... I checked a couple different outlets, but it wasn't an outlet problem, it's the vacuum. It comes with a one year warranty, but that ran out about 2 weeks ago. Very frustrating! Money down the drain. For this amount of money, a vacuum should last longer than 1 year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Badly designed hose connection","review":"The accessories that come with this vacuum are a joke. I bought a standard size brush head and found it does not fit the end of the hose which is an oddball size. Hoover doesn't make an adapter and I haven't found one elsewhere, either. Otherwise, the power is decent and it is light and compact."},{"rating":"2","title":"After 6 different machines, I'm finally done wasting money.","review":"My wife and I couldn't be happier.

Great on carpet and wood floors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy This Vacuum","review":"Do yourself a favor and pick out another vacuum to buy. This thing may be the worst home purchase i have made to date. Why would a vaccum have an adujustable power knob? Isn't the purpose to pick up as much crap off the floor as possible? Even at full power, the suction on this thing is a joke, any attachment falls to the floor & i feel like breaking the machine into 100 pieces everytime i am forced to use it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hose breaks easily","review":"We've had it for 3 years but only use it occasionally to clean the one small carpeted room in our house.

The final center connectionbroke yesterday, and now no power to the head.HORRIBLE construction and/or poor plastic selection by the manufacturer.This plastic is way too brittle for vacuum cleaner wands.The pros:Great suctionBrush really picks up pet hairNo real dust from exhaustI would not buy this again, nor recommend it to ANYONE unless Hooverredesigns the wand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I purchased this vacuum a few days ago.

I asked customer service for noise level information and they replied with \\"We don't have that information...\\" Called Hoover Corporate and left a message for the Safety Officer requesting noise levels and an octave band analysis (to determine the frequency of the whine). That was early Nov and still no response.The Hoover does a good job and has a very strong motor (hence the whine) but cheesey attachments. I also did not like the short cord and the location of the on/off button which is very easy to confuse with the cord return button. At the very least the buttons should be of different color. Somehow, I expected more from Hoover product engineering!I returned the vac and purchased the canister recommended by a leading consumer product source as the \\"Best Buy.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Lackluster performance","review":"I purchased this as I had another Hoover cannister albeit a more expensive one that was an excellent machine. I cannot say the same about the Duros. It appears to have reasonable suction with the crevice tool and/or the step tool but it does not do a good job on carpets. I'm not sure why. I suspect the \\"powered\\" head is just poorly and/or cheaply designed. I usually end up using my older upright vaccum when I really want to clean my carpets. The Duros just isn't up to the task. It appears that $250 or $300 is needed to purchase a decent Hoover cannister."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid at any cost!","review":"Bag does not seal well, so some dirt leaks back into room. Twice the bag developed a hole and filled the inside of the vacuum with dirt. I will never buy a Hoover product again if they are willing to produce such poorly designed products."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't beat the price.","review":"Works better on hardwood than carpet. I bought this as a basement-only workbench vacuum cleaner. It doesn't come close to my electrolux. But, that's to be expected - my electrolux costs 5 times more. This is an excellent choice for a secondary vacuum. Cheap, compact, comes with many attachments. The 'bag full' indicator is handy."},{"rating":"2","title":"I didn't think I liked canister vacuums","review":"I bought one because we have both wood floors and carpeting. This machine does a great job on both. It's much more powerful than I imagined it would be. While the canister is heavy, you're really only dealing with the much lighter handle. Even the stairs are easier. I've had bagless versions, and frankly, I'd rather not deal with the mess. The bag acts as a filter, so you're changing the filter everytime you change the bag. I've heard that the canister style lasts longer. We have two long-haired fur balls at home, so we usually burn out a vacuum cleaner in a year. The upright models designed so that the mess doesn't go anywhere near the motor run about $500. The bags are available here and at about a hundred web sites on-line. Don't look for it at your grocers though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good vacuum","review":"This vacuum is not as compact as I've expected, and it's little bit too heavy to carry around. However, the suction of this vacuum is pretty powerful, and it's fairly easy to take it apart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Real Value","review":"Just recieved the S3590 and was very pleased.. This tracks well and is easy to move about the house. The insulation is done well and noise is sufficently damped. A light on the power head is nice and the suction is great. I shopped vacuums at 3 times the price and was not impressed. Only negative is the accessory holder is awkward and the dusting brush is a little small. Buy this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Conventional Vacuum","review":"It was hard to locate a conventional canister vacuum at electronics and hardware stores with the evolution and popularity of filterless upright models. The Hoover canister vacuum is what can be expected from conventional technology. It is simple to use, works powerfully, and is just as reliable as any new reengineered product."},{"rating":"1","title":"It Scratches your wooden floors!","review":"This is a nice product except that it has scratched our wooden floors!The wheels are made of hard plastic and they leave marks on wooden (or laminated wooden) floors.

Would it be very costly to have softer wheels that would not damage the floor?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete Junk","review":"I purchased a refurb from Allergy Be Gone through Amazon. The power floor attachment would not stay on the very first day. It would come off at the slightest touch of an object. Worse yet, the hose came apart (tore) from the rubber flange, making the thing completely useless. I bought it for my vacation home and used it three, yes count them, three times total. After the first vacuuming, the power floor attachment had to be duct taped to stay on. The third time I used it, the canister tipped over and when I uprighted it, I found the hose broke. What JUNK! DO NOT BUY AT ANY PRICE!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Designed Electrical fittings","review":"I had one of these for several years - I bought it in 2000 or so. It worked great for a long time and in 2008 it broke down - the fittings loosened up so that it wouldn't stay together. I duct taped it to make it go as long as possible but finally bought another one in July 2008. This one lasted about 6 months! Same problem - seems there is a short of some kind. I pulled it apart (literally took it apart piece by piece to see if I could find the loose wire) and can't find a thing wrong with it other than the carpet brush won't rotate.I think it is just poor design on the electrical connections."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Design","review":"I bought this vacuum on the strength of the brand name, but it must have been designed by a person who never vacuums. Each time I vacuum, I want to throw it away. The canister is heavy and when you try and vacuum and pull it along, it rams into the back of your legs. It does not move smoothly on its' wheels and you can only vacuum a small area at a time, before having to move the unit and get frustrated with it. The only redeeming quality it that it actually picks up dirt and dust."},{"rating":"2","title":"First Canister Vacuum, Happy with Purchase","review":"This was our first canister vacuum purchase after having several upright models fail on us. We were surprised at how lightweight it was, easy to use and it went together fast. I love having the cord stored away when not in use and it works like a dream. The bags are a big small, but that's our only complaint. It picked up everything, including cat fur, which is our biggest carpet issue. It swivels easily and fits under most anything without having to move furniture. We are happy customers for sure!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good, if you can find a bag for it.","review":"Do not waste your time on the Hoover Duros.

There are many issues with this piece of junk.First, this vacuum is LOUD. Yeah, I get most vacuums make a little vrrrm noise. ..But this one is so loud that I get a headache while vacuuming, and on top of it being completely and utterly loud, it's accompanied by a high pitched ringing sound.As far as performance goes, it does NOT even pick up 50%. I will go over the same area 20X and see the same little crumbs and whatnot on the floor..so I end up picking it up with my hands, bc this garbage vacuum isn't even capable of picking up larger crumbs, little fuzzies, or basically anything that is visible to the eye.If you are reading this and considering this vacuum.......You have been forewarned!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the $$$","review":"After the hose on my Kenmore broke, I picked up one of these locally. (It was somewhat of an emergency having 2 dogs, 2 cats and 4 kids :P) I really wish I had just waited for the Kenmore hose to come in...the Hoover S3590 was a waste of money and does not work well on pet hair. It also does not perform well on hard surfaces and floors. The attachments were a joke!I would definitely not recommend purchasing this unit...save up the money and buy a Kenmore! :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"JUNK","review":"Works great for about 2 weeks. It is now sitting in the closet with all of the other JUNK vacuums I have bought over the years. The bags do not fit properly and the canister fills with dirt. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.

There have been months when the bags for it haven't been available and we've had to use our other lightweight vacuum instead.We bought this vacuum cleaner to clean the stairs and the loft level of our house. Our main vacuum cleaner is a Hoover Windtunnel self-propelled upright model; the Duros isn't as efficient as that, but it does a satisfactory job of cleaning low carpet and hardwood floors. The tools are a nuisance as they constantly fall off the machine, but, apart from its durability, the main complaint we have is the noise. It has a high pitched screech I've been unable to tame - drives my wife nuts!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Buy","review":"Purchased this vacuum to clean carpets and tile floors.

But after unpacking the unit my wife stumbled across the little warning in the manual: \\"This product contains chemicals known to the State of California to cause cancer, or birth defects or other reproductive harm\\" (not sure if that was the precise wording in the manual, but it was one of those warnings).Now, I understand that nobody takes these warnings seriously, right? That's also why they appear only in the manual but not on the package or in product advertising such as on Amazon, right?Our trust in the product was wrecked, however. We couldn't bring ourselves to clean our apartment, and expose our two-year-old daughter to this, when there are other manufacturers who will sell you products without those questionable chemicals. The unit is going back.Which, I guess, might be the actual purpose of these warnings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Bought this vac at a big box store about 6 months ago. I have always had uprights, but now have a house with wood floors. I was hoping this canister vacuum would do a better job on the bare floors, especially considering I have a shed-monster springer spaniel! I was wrong and I am disappointed. This Hoover is hard to use and feels like you are yanking a small stubborn animal all over the house. Every so often I have to stop, turn around to see what it's up to, and give it a pull. This is my first and last canister vacuum. I recommend spending more money and getting a quality upright."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hoover Vacuum","review":"The price was the best found for this product.

It cleans carpet well, and I can turn off the brush to actually clean hard floors instead of tossing the bits around to find later. When a portion of the wand is removed, it is conveniently sized to vacuum carpeted stairs. I also like that I can adjust the suction for more powerful (spilled beads) or less powerful (every vacuum cleaner I have had before tried to eat throw rugs) cleaning.I have found it a sturdy and reliable product. The filter bags are great, especially for my roommate who has strong allergies. I only wish the bags were available at the usual local places instead of by internet/special order.I ordered through GoVaccum; shipping was prompt, terms were clear, and I received a great vacuum at a reasonable and affordable price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Euro-style vacuum!","review":"I love this vacuum! it is lightweight but sturdy; very efficient and modular; stylish and well-designed.

Definitely recommend this European style canister vacuum."},{"rating":"2","title":"powerful suction and easy to empty for asthmatics.","review":"I'm not a nitpicker like some reviewers.

This album is to the early era what Test for Echo is to the current state of Rush affairs: neither is very good.Granted, \\"Bastille Day\\" and \\"Lakeside Park\\" are both quality songs, but that's about all there is here. \\"I Think I'm Going Bald\\" seems like a silly novelty song (in other words, not to be on a Rush album) and the two longer songs just seem to drag on forever with few rewards along the way. If you want every Rush album in your collection, and many of us do, then by all means add this one to it.

In fact it wouldn't be exaggering to say that I am their biggest fan as I have copies of most of their best albums and even own some too. That said this album is a bit too weird and noisey for me. There are lots of weird sound effects, the singer sings in too high pitched a way and there is even some daft song mocking baldness (a touchy subject, take it from me). That said there is a nice, melodic song called Lakeside Park which almost makes it worth buying, if it wasn't already on the best of."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is not their best!!","review":"Well, I have the \\"BAstille Day\\" version contained in ALL THE WORLD'S A STAGE\\", so I did not buy this album, because this song is the only worthwhile moment here...Geddy's voice was never more annoying than in this album. The two \\"epic\\" pieces are boring and unfocused. Of course we find a lot of great musicianship, after all we're talking about Geddy and Neil here! (Let me tell you a little secret: I Never liked PEart's lyrics. They are dumb, disconnected, they have no rhythm when Geddy sung them. The classic songs would be much better with other lyrics).Anyway, most of RUSH fans swallow anything they do. I do not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very underrated","review":"Caress of Steel is a very underrated Rush album. Bastille Day is very energetic, as well as Lakeside Park, which both are gems mostly forgotten by the fans. I Think I'm Going Bald is a peek at the lighter side of Rush, not seen to often, though their video for the Fly By Night song By-Tor & The Snow Dog during their Vapor Trails tour is another peek at that. The Necromancer, and The Fountain of Lamenth are both things I love about Rush, epic musical rock epics that span genre and time. They are certainly projects which very few modern bands would have the audacity to concider, let alone pull off this well. This album is timeless, and though bnot perfect, very few albums are. I hope Caress of Steel is not overlooked by fans of Rush. If you like 2112, A Farewell to Kings, or The Camera Eye from Moving Pictures, give this album a chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"SUPERB!","review":"I must be a RUSH fanatic, because this entire CD is great! The worst part of the album was having to flip the darn thing over to hear \\"Fountains of Lamnenth\\"! This is definitely old-school Rush, since Geddy stills screams, because he hasn't had vocal lessons yet. That's a plus; I don't believe any of these songs would sound as good without the screaming. I'd say what's bad about this disc, but I can only say it eventually ends. \\"Bastille Day\\", \\"I Think I'm Going Bald\\", \\"Lakeside Park\\" and \\"The Necromancer\\" are great! If you're into great music, with lyrics that tell a story, Caress of Steel is for you. I have to thank Clyde for turning me on to Rush. Of course, he was a drummer and who better to idolize other than Neil Peart. One warning, after I picked this up 2112 came out and I bought it, too, then I saw them live with UFO and Max Webster and I was hooked for life. Rush is ADDICTIVE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rush at their early best.","review":"I listen to this one more because at all the parties you'd go to back in the day, they'd be playing 2112 or Fly By Night. Was it the cover art that steered people from this one? It's a mystery to me. 'Fountain' is worth the price of the CD alone. If you don't have it, and you like early Rush, you NEED this CD now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Prelude to a masterpiece","review":"Most people say it's under-rated, and forgotten. This is probably true as the album didn't really have a strong \\"hit\\",(Bastille Day and Lakeside Park are probably the only songs that ever got any airplay) it lacked the focus that most of their future CD's would have. It was kind of a concept album, dark and moody \\"heavy metal\\" - ish but not quite. Bastille Day captures the essence of the Rush sound in the early years, strong, melodic, loud and clever. Still, for me I have fond memories of listening to the Fountain of Lamneth and Necromancer in the early 80's as a young musician and being taken away to a strange and dark place with its haunting melodys and raw texture - a mix of acoustic guitars with a very agressive and hard sound. Over- all there is a lot of character in this transitional work, Rush was searching for something and in retrospect Caress is a prelude to the masterpiece that was coming, 2112."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product, quick response time","review":"Fan of old Rush.

On the second side, though, the band moves on to new territory with its first two stabs at progressive rock epics. \\"The Necromancer\\" is pretty dire, with Neil Peart's earnest, oh-so-serious narration and the painfully bad Tolkein lyrics. \\"The Fountain of Lamneth\\" is more listenable but comes off as too fragmented. The band would do far better in this style on the next few studio albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Low Point","review":"This is not a very good album and the band must not think so either. Nothing from this album has been played live since 1980, and even then it was as part of a medley. The only two good songs here are Bastille Day, and song about the French Revolution and Lakeside Park, about a place Neil grew up by. I Think I'm Going Bald is a throw back to the Rush debut album. Sure the musicianship is okay but the song is over all weak. Then there are the two 'epics'. Just because a song is nineteen minutes long doesn't mean it's any good. This albums I guess was sort of an experiment for the band I guess. They did write epics after this that were much better. Check out 2112 or Hemisphers for those."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it","review":"If you are expecting sexy revealing photos of Jenna, don't buy this calendar.

After reading, the book it should only be used if someone is very young and not used to understanding themselves and experiencing temporary mild depression in regard to a specific issue (such as dealing with minor social problems at school or work) and not by someone who is experiencing moderate to severe depression or in our case to address communication and marital issues.

It has excellent practical advice regarding how to manage your emotions by behaving and thinking in new ways. It takes you through the process step by step and can be understood by ordinary people like myself without rereading it five times. After benefiting from reading this book for a while, I became curious of why this type of thing works so well for my depression. After a long search, I discovered a book called \\"The Ever-Transcending Spirit\\" by Toru Sato that explained this beautifully.

I'd expected new information and a great deal of useful pencil-and-paper work not contained in the original \\"FG\\". There is some of that here, but far too little, and functions neither to add new info to nor to expand meaningfully upon the original book.

The thing that sets this book apart is that it gives you a step by step written procedure with which you discover, analyze and dispute the thoughts that make you feel bad. After doing the written exercise - the triple column technique, I found that the new rational thoughts attached themselves to the negative emotions I was trying to overcome. Later, when I re-experienced situations that could produce the same negative emotions, the new rational thoughts would bubble up to my consciousness and keep me from re-experiencing (or at least minimize) the negative emotion.

Also, Harry seemed a bit interesting as well, since I like detective stories. But, sorry, couldn't tell ya much about the other characters since they weren't too developed, nor was the plot. Sure, I know who they were and what was going on throughout, but there wasn't much about them to keep me interested. Figuring it all out was quite a simple task, too. I mean, the author kind of gave it to us! I just felt that this novel was missing that \\"something\\" that I had expected as I read through it. You know, that jolt of excitement that builds throughout. I had it in the beginning, when I had opened up and began, but after completing a couple more chapters, I already knew where things were headed. I only finished it up to see if I had been correct."},{"rating":"2","title":"Echo Reverbs","review":"Good premise, as usual. Good set-up and dialogue and I especially enjoyed the political aspect of the law enforcement world. Politics often rears its ugly little head in some surprising places so it's no surprise when it hits here.I agree that the political ending tended to be a little less satisfying but then maybe that is the real world view that Connelly so accurately reflects.Even as a talented mystery writer we see glimpses of the good journalist. On to the next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I couldn't get into this one","review":"Normally, a Harry Bosch book is a one to two night read for me. It took nearly a week and a half to scrape through this one. Echo Park felt more like a Lucas Davenport novel than and entry in the Bosch saga. That's not to say anything bad about Lucas, I love him too, but I read Sanford when I feel like a more fantasy-cop sort of ride. I read Harry because he's the gritty real thing.There wasn't really any good character building in this one. Irving wasn't raising cain. And Harry felt like he was a character based on himself.Maybe too much time in Florida is taking some of the edge out of Connelly's writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yet again...","review":"Michael Connelly produces perhaps the most compulsively readable modern noir. His novels are always tightly plotted and the former crime reporter brings an air of authenticity to the proceedings during the investigation, and the post-investigaton phases. His characterization is also top notch; he is able accomplish more with a well-turned line or two than many authors do with pages (and pages) of \\"character background.\\" With \\"Echo Park\\" the winning streak continues. This entire series is well-worth a read for any crime fiction aficionado."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry Bosch at the top of his form","review":"This has plenty of action and red herrings to keep you intrigued from beginning to end. Harry Bosch is his usual obsessive self, worrying over an unsolved case from years earlier as he tries to weave some moldering strands of evidence into a nice, tight net. As he sets out on what appears to be a straight line toward the villain of the piece, the road suddenly takes a turn, and then another, so that the readers' interest never flags."},{"rating":"2","title":"Michael Connolly winner","review":"Echo Park is the best Connolly thriller yet! I will not give away the plot nor discuss the plot as it would spoil it for you. Buy it! Read it! This book is a mover,shaker, and page turner.

Michael Connelly seems to be recovering from his dark period."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decently entertaining book","review":"This was the first Michael Connelly book I have ever read (after it was recommended to me) and I wasn't disappointed. Echo Park was a fast paced murder mystery with just enough twist and turns to keep me engaged and interested. The character of Harry Bosch was likable and interesting. A caught serial killer is ready to confess to a cold case that Bosch was formerly trying to solve. Bosch is brought in to confirm the authenticity of the confession. After Bosch finds out that he and his partner may have missed a clue that could have caught the killer back then, he wrestles with his demons and tries to find out how they could have missed it. Add a little romance and politics into the equation, and the latter half of the story is engrossing. I recommend this book to all readers who enjoy murder mysteries and police novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good enough","review":"A hundred pages into the book, I started scanning for words indicative of actual story development, and not long-winded accounts of little importance. Also, showdowns in dimly lit tunnels just seem contrived to me by now. I like my novels a tad more understated. My first Connelly book is thus a disappointment, although I did feel a slight chill in the beginning. I still feel he has something to offer, so suggestions are welcome. This book just fell short."},{"rating":"2","title":"A masterpiece of the hard boiled","review":"Being a veteran reader of mystery novels I could never anticipate how Mr Connelly will play with the plot and with the characters and that is what it makes this novel powerful, special and different from others written by him or by other authors who believe themselves as masters of this genre. The ending is colossal. Overall, Echo Park lives up to all expectations set by all the acclaims written in the first pages by the media. Mr Bosch character portrayal is one of a kind. It is clear that Mr Connelly has greatly improved from his previous works. He creates and handles the plot with strokes resembling a quality only a top seed tennis player could get with a racket and ball"},{"rating":"2","title":"good formula","review":"I like the Lincoln Lawyer series better but Harry is ok as a crime-solver. He's a little jaded and /or out-of-sorts all the time and the scenarios are not too believable, but I like detective stories and this one is decent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read","review":"The author once again kept the intensity up. bosch is the typical good cop you always want to root for ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a favorite","review":"I hate to say it...but I wasn't in love with this book. I've read pretty much everything else Connelly has written, but this book just seemed a little \\"off\\" based on his normal level of suspense and ability to connect the dots as to \\"why\\" things happened. It almost seemed like the author was a little burned out or hurried on this one. It's just my opinion...and you know what people say about opinions...."},{"rating":"2","title":"and THIS would be my favorite Harry Bosch novel","review":"Really, really entertaining. This Bosch novel is a bit seedier than most of the others - and that is a great thing. The setting alternates from urban to forest and back again, which is always fun. Connelly does a bang up job of describing the real L.A. in both geography and human mannerisms and interactions.The relationships between the characters are exceptionally well developed and they seem very right and pure. The primary villain (who is it?) is masked from the reader until it is too late to alter your expectations as to the conclusion of the book.Just a satisfying read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Michael Connelly at His Very Best","review":"Michael Connelly is the best thriller writer today and this wonderful book illustrates the lengths to which the author goes to present his readers with thoughtful, complex, authentic prose. You get your money's worth with Connelly and his great character, Harry Bosch. In \\"Echo Park\\" Connelly gives us several intertwining plots that relentlessly move toward a credible, worthwhile ending. His characters are well-drawn and he gives us a little more insight into Bosch's personality. Bosch's behavior, which borders on recklessness and even immaturity, is presented better than I recall in any of the other Bosch books. For the first time, I begin to have a little sympathy for his bosses. But all in all, if Bosch has his flaws, this wonderful police procedural does not. Connelly's never been better than he is here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hollow Park","review":"Dear Mr. Connelly,Perhaps H. Bosch did not receive the memo -- he needs to retire and stay retired. Old Blue Eyes kept retiring and coming back; he was never as good and neither is Bosch."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!","review":"Having read several of Connelly's books, I expected this one to be a cut above the usual crime thriller genre. I was sorely disappointed. Although the plot is somewhat interesting, the characterizations are weak and there is just too much tough cop talk and unbelievable heroics. The narration is weak, especially the personification of the FBI agent girlfriend, which is absolutely grating. I did finish it, but wish I could get my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget It!","review":"Save your time and your money. I admit that Michael Connelly knows how to write but this is a slobby and lazy effort! There is NO character development - we know the name of his girl-friend but not how she looks or anything about her except that she is an ex-FBI profiler. As far as the mystery goes, Bosch is so intent on solving his old murder that he doesn't seem to care about the nine women murdered and cut up by the other killer. Connelly is riding on his past merits. Skip this one and read one of the older, more developed Harry Hosch mysteries."},{"rating":"2","title":"Silky.","review":"This book was so nice. So smooth. So silky. Writing-wise I mean. Tender in all the right spots, and filled with romance. NOT! This book was action packed and intriquing. Filled with suspense and mystery. Boiling over with tension and suspension. Like a rockin Mustang. Which is appropriate because that's what Bosch drives. I wouldn't mind a Mustang. Especially since I am driving a Prius right now. Which is the least manly car there is. Feeling like I am getting softer by the day. Need to man-up with a Mustang or something tough. Anyway, nice book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Michael Connelly","review":"I enjoy all the books in the Harry Bosch series. The plots are easy to follow and the dialogue is good.

I started it in the morning, & didn't stop until the end (evening, same day). As always, Michael Connelly has the twists coming left & right, & I never saw them coming. I thoroughly enjoyed the story, plot twists, & of course, Harry Bosch's relentless & dogged nature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story","review":"I keep coming back to Michael Connelly's Harry Bosch novels because the storylines are so well developed--they twist and turn and never lead you directly to the end. Wonderful storyteller set in a background of the LAPD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Echo Park","review":"Loved the book, Harry Bosch is one of my favorite characters. Hope Michael Connelly will continue writing this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard to put down","review":"The 12th in the Harry Bosch series is the best one I've read so far, and they're all good. Took about 150 pages to get going but when it did it was captivating and hard to put down. Suspensful and a real page turner. Highly recommended. Connelly is the absolute best author in this genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"What are the limits of right and wrong?","review":"In the 12th book, Harry Bosch had returned to active duty in the LAPD Open-Unsolved unit. When a serial killer Raynard Waits claims he had killed Marie Gesto in 1993, Bosch insists he joins the investigation. Together with his former-returned lover, the FBI Agent Rachel Walling, Harry Bosch finds himself, again, in the middle of a conspiracy that smacks of money and politics.As usual, the plot sparkles with surprising twists - such as how Harry Bosch missed a crucial clue back in 1993 that allowed Raynard Waits to kill nine more women - but sometimes the prose drowns in the details of food and music. With Harry Bosch, Connelly tests the limits of right and wrong and what is a \`correct choice', but it feels as if Connelly had maximized the character's stretch. Although Echo Park is not one of Michael Connelly's spectacular books (such as The Poet or The Lincoln Lawyer), it is still a great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engrossing","review":"I found the story line quite engrossing. Lots of twists and turns in the plot line. I have read several of Michael Connelly's novels and find that the plots keep you guessing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bosch on the edge","review":"Bosch in on the edge in this book; he has been working the Maria Gesto case on his own time ever since her disappearance in 1993. She was never found - dead OR alive - so the file sits and mocks Bosch. When a man accused of two murders offers to come clean about several other open murders in order to avoid being put to death, he includes Marie Gesto in the bunch. Bosch is called in to listen to the testimony and do some work to ensure the department is not being scammed. When Bosch discovers a clue that was overlooked that might have helped him solve the Gesto case - and prevented all the murders by this same guy in the meantime - he starts to lose it.This is a dark book in the series, yet one that gives us a lot of insight into Bosch and his world. Don't miss it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It started out okay","review":"I feel today's thriller/mystery writers have a tough time conjuring up twists and turns. This book was no exception. After all, it's all been said. With thousands of books coming out each year it has to be a difficult task to come up with something interesting.I thank Mr. Connelly for trying. Out of loyalty I will continue to buy his books. I have for years.I just read the excerpt from his next volume. Like \\"Echo\\" it starts out swell."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not quite 5 Stars","review":"Like another reviewer, I'd have to give this latest Bosch outing, four and a half stars. Unsettled by a case that was never solved, Bosch is really thrown for a loop when evidence in the notes show the serial killer they were looking for had actually contacted he and his partner at the time. The fact that they never followed up on the potential lead could of caused a number of unnecessary deaths that followed.For the most part I thought it was just great. Connelly is fantastic at tightening the suspense, and writes thrillers better than almost anyone out there. What felt a bit false and stale to me was his relationship with agent Rachel Walling who he's been previously involved with. Much of it made sense, I think I just felt the ending we've seen before and felt convienient for Bosch. Overall I thought this was one of the stronger Bosch outings in some time, and if you're a fan, you shouldn't miss it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Old Harry","review":"I just finished reading Echo Park and really enjoyed it. I like the way Michael Connelly keeps the action moving and keeps the reader wondering what is going to happen next. I usually have some of the villians identified but in this case I did not see Abel Pratt involved in the plot. I too feel it would have been good to see what happened to those corrupt people. However, I used my imagination which perhaps is what the author intended."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time","review":"This is my second Connelly book. I thoroughly enjoyed Lincoln Lawyer, but found Echo Park a disappointment. Although the story line held potential, the story teller failed. A mediocre book, at best."},{"rating":"2","title":"A solid entry in the Harry Bosch series","review":"It seems that Connelly can do no wrong, this is yet another tense and surprising entry in this series. Installment after installment Connelly proves to be a master of the police procedural, sending his likable characters into disturbing crimes and very intense situations. This installment feels particularly different for reasons I will not get into. It may not pack quite the emotional punch of some other installments but Echo Park's a very worthwhile read for a Harry Bosch fan. Not a bad place to start, either.The villain's interesting and among the best in the series. That said, Rachel Walling, one of the best things about The Narrows, just seems almost unnecessary here, and I felt like her presence grinded the story to a halt. The plot itself is also a bit thin in the 1st half of the book, not really taking off until the mid-point.That said, it's a great book....again, not the best in the series but up there."},{"rating":"2","title":"The trouble with Harry is, well, . . . Harry.","review":"Connelly's Harry Bosch has a bouillabaisse on his plate; a serial killer on the loose, his FBI girl friend who is mad at him, an ambitious prosecutor running for office, smarmy defense counsel, and corruption striking close to home. Harry handles all with his usual reckless hamhandness. He would not be lovable Harry, otherwise. This police procedural mystery, a predecessor book to \\"The Overlook,\\" couples all this excitement with Harry's recent penchant for stumbling over old records and closed files and solving old crimes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth buying","review":"I have had my acoustic-electric for almost 2 years now...I love it! I already had an acoustic, I wanted a pink guitar and it has worked out wonderfully. I am 5'9\\" and I have normal sized hands and it is a nice fit. I have found that because of its smaller size it is easier for me to play than my acoustic. My girls (14,8,4) love to play on it as well. It has held up nicely, it sits in my living room on a stand and looks beautiful. The only problem I have had is needing to replace the batteries for the tuner fairly frequently. My youngest daughter likes to turn it on and leave it on. You may want to get extra strings to replace them quickly though...they didn't stayed tuned very well in the beginning. Really though, the smaller size is perfect for anyone from 12 up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Burnt Motor!","review":"I bought the cleaner in April and just decided to get to cleaning my carpeting now in August. With its initial use, the machine cleaned the carpet beautifully and was easy to use, BUT I smelled a burning odor. I attributed the smell to perhaps the newness of the machine. Well after I cleaned the machine as directed in the owner's manual, there is the suggestion that you run the machine in the \\"dry\\" mode to remove any residual solution that may be still in the machine. When I went to turn the machine on, nothing happened! There was only a low humming noise; no brushes moving, no strong motor sound at all! The machine is now at an authorized Hoover dealer and I am expecting either a full repair, but I suspect a replacement -- at least I am under warranty. I've have Hoover vacuums that last and last for years -- what gives with this carpet cleaner? I would have given it \\"5 STARS\\" because of its cleaning ability and ease of use, but I am disturbed by its mechanical failure!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective!!","review":"I bought this in Jan, when it was discounted.

I highly recommend this product. It is truly superior and worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Happy With Purchase","review":"We have used the cleaner in 4 rooms and have been impressed with the results. We previously had a Bissel brand carpet cleaner for about 4 years and I think the Hoover extracts more dirt from the carpet. We have a wool carpet and the Hoover seemed to lift less carpet fiber than the Bissel.The hoover seems to have a better design to clean the rug cleaner as well, with removable brushes and a door on the front to get to the channel that the dirty water follows into the tank. I think it's important to clean the rug cleaner after each use since it could get clogged with dirt, hair, etc.Several other posts mentioned poor water extraction, but I found the water extraction was acceptable (e.g. carpet dry within 12-18 hours). The poor performance may be due to a see-through door on the front of the cleaner. You have to push firmly on the door to make sure it is closed (the door was partially open when it arrived)."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE PROOF IS IN THE DIRTY WATER!!!","review":"This is a great product for the price. It definitely lifts the dirt out of the carpet. It's very satisfying to see the absolutely filthy water this thing sucks out of the carpet. And it makes my medium shag carpet stand up nicely again. The two upolstery attachments are awesome...great for cleaning my micro-fiber couch. The one drawback is how wet it leaves your carpet. For every tank-full of solution you use, 2/3 of it stays in the carpet.

It makes the dirt disappear and makes your carpet look really fluffy. The upholstery cleaner also helps with cleaning the car and couches.

Did a nice job on carpeting that had not been cleaned for too many years. The only downside I have seen is that, while the receptacles are easy to remove from the machine, it is difficult to take them apart to fill or empty. It feels like I have to force the latches too much -- since they are plastic, I am afraid they will snap. That is the only downside I've seen on this otherwise easy-to-use product.The product came in a day, too -- even using standard ground shipping. A very nice surprise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent product for it's price","review":"I have this product for about 10 months now and i have to say it works wonders. It makes the carpet look as new as it was. The cleaning and suction works great and if you follow the warm water advice (as pointed out in other reviews), then carpet remaining wet after vacumn is no longer an issue. it lifts hair very efficiently. If it is not able to do so then it atleast bundles up the hair because it is a wet vacumn and then you can easily throw off the hair. Cleaning the vacumn is a bit time consuming. But i guess it can be considered worth the effort for what it helps you clean the house so fast."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good purchase","review":"We bought the Hoover SteamVac Agility Carpet Cleaner today and immediately started in on our dirty living room carpet.

Water in the recovery tank is dark gray/black every time and easy to empty. Wipe the bottom areas of the cleaner with paper towel when you're done (remove and rinse the brushes if you have time) and put away.I've done sections of the house little by little because it is so easy to get out and clean a section even if you only have an hour to work with. I'm only 5'1'' tall and find it easy enough to push around. It is noisy so I use earplugs to save my hearing.The best thing is that we're saving a ton of money over hiring a company to do it for you.

Save your money and buy a better quality unit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic !","review":"Great product ! Easy to use ! Almost effortless to handle, and seems to glide across the carpets when in use. Cleans better than any other carpet cleaner that we have owned. Filling, emptying, and refilling the canisters is a breeze compared to others products. Would recommend this product to anyone that may have shoulder problems...like us !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Scrubbers wouldn't spin","review":"Purchased this as a replacement for a Bissell ProHeat ClearView that simply stopped pumping after approximately 5 uses. I have pets, and pet hair got caught in the Hoover Agility's spin scrub gears very quickly. After cleaning my living room and dining room, the brushes wouldn't spin, even after disassembling and cleaning the removable brush cartridge.The Agility is very light and easy to use, and my carpet dried quickly. I was concerned that the plastic latches that secure the caps to each water reservoir would break easily.I returned it and purchased a Eureka Atlantis, and I'm very pleased with that cleaner so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to use!","review":"If you've got kids or pets this is a life saver. It is easy to use-lightweight and maneuverable, the parts snap in and out of place, and you don't have to hook it up to your faucet! Someone complained that it left the carpet too wet-not true! The wetness is determined by how well the operator pulls moisture out of the carpet-you can easily see when there is no more moisture to suck out. I'm very happy with mine!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good performance...great value for the price.","review":"You can't beat the performance of the Agility at its price point. I live with Barfy the Wondercat as well as a dog. This unit does a great job of cleaning up not only the usual carpet dirt but the inevitable pet stains as well. Highly recommended!Since I have not had the cleaner very long, I can't give it five stars. In six months, I'll revisit and update!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not powerful enough","review":"The suction is not strong enough -- too much water stays in the carpet. The power brush attachment is very convenient for cleaning upholstery. The vacuum is pretty heavy, and I remove all of the attachments from it before operating it to make it a bit easier to move.These complaints aside, I am happy with the machine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Steam Vac that has great features for pet owners","review":"This steam vac is easy-to-store with the fold down handle, is a great color, is SO simple to fill, empty, and use. I'm thrilled with it. The clean surge feature removes tough stains, especially pet stains, and the front end is a snap to wipe off after cleaning. My old cleaner would have grit and pet hairs that were deep in the carpet clogging up the water suction section of the cleaner after I finished using it. Getting them out of there was a hassle, and almost impossible. This cleaner allows you to pop off the cover of that section, wipe if off, pop it back on, and no clogging ever again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucks","review":"If you want to spread water all over your carpet, use a garden hose. Piece of crap, brushes dont spin, will NOT vacuum up water. Call Stanley Steamer and save your cash and closet space!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Machine","review":"I like this machine. It works really well. The only thing I would have to complain about is the head doesn't seem heavy enough. I wish it would hold tighter to the carpet. It would take more of the moisture out of the carpet so it would dry quicker."},{"rating":"2","title":"how easy it was to put together/","review":"when i bought this product i had a bunch of tools ready and waiting....i never believe what they say NO assembly required....I did NOT need one tool and it was sooooooo simple, just pulled it out of the box and off I went. A friend of mine had one, I previously had owned an older model Hoover and loved the way that one cleaned. What makes this one is that i have pets also and i am able to take it apart and clean it after I use it. Thanks for the GREAT PRICE, and shipping it out so fast, and thank Hoover for making such a great Steam Vac."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to use, works great","review":"If this was a little lighter, I would rate it 5 stars. Easy to use, easy to store. Works!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good cleaner -- could do better on berber tho","review":"This Hoover steamvac does a good job of getting the dirt out of the carpet. After a thorough vacuuming, the unit pulled up some BLACK water! I was amazed.However, I have berber carpet: although the vac does an adequate job of removing the water, I noticed that about 25% remains behind. Other reviewers don't seem to have had this experience - so I gleen that they have \\"regular\\" carpet.It would seem the vacuum/suction is designed for somewhat longer carpeting -- as it doesn't form a great \\"seal\\" on mine...Overall tho, I'd recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hoover SteamVac","review":"I did not have I hopes for this carpet cleaner. I've always used rented machines. I also have family members who have bought carpet cleaners only to be disappointed.This was a GREAT surprise. It's light weight, easy to get into tight spaces and everything stores right on the machine. It cleans like a professional machine and nothing leaked or left extra water in the carpet. The hand tools were easy to switch and made the carpet on my filthy stairs look new! I used to avoid cleaning carpet because it was such a hassle, but no more and this machine will pay it self off in no time. No more having to clean every room in one day because of a rental or finding a way to get it home and no more sore back from lifting the heavy machine!! I highly recommend this machine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to use, lightweight, efficient","review":"I recently purchased this carpet cleaner and I am very pleased with it. It is easy to maneuver, easy to fill and empty and does an excellent job cleaning the carpet. It also sucks up the solution efficiently so the carpet dries sooner. I appreciate that the upholstery cleaning tools caddy is removable. It is also easy to clean the machine after you're done cleaning the carpet! I previously had an older model Hoover 6-spin scrub machine and this one is a terrific improvement. My old one cleaned many a carpet as it was shared by 3 family households. Looking forward to this one lasting even longer as I'm going to convince the others to buy their own machines."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good however,I have some thoughts.","review":"First off this is a good product and cleans my carpets fast and it heats the water which helps a lot,But here are my issues,The design of the side by side tanks well if the cord is wrapped up before you put the tanks back on,it's will catch on the cord,and the cord is a little too short for me,prehaps a extra foot or so would be nice.The good things are it's light weight and very easy to use and store the handle comes down to make easier to store and it comes with a attacments for small areas to clean,Hoover did a good job on this one,I only wish for more colors to choose from a purple steam cleaner. Ummm I wish I would have got the blue one.Oh well at least I have clean carpets.:)"},{"rating":"2","title":"SteamVac Review","review":"This really isn't a steamvac, since it uses hot water. It did a very good job of cleaning some really dirty carpets. Overall it was easy to use. I did have some problems getting the hot water tank onto the machine without water being released out the bottom, so would recommend not putting it on while it is on the carpet - just more water to suck up.That said we are happy with it and glad we bought it and would recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"notlucky","review":"When our old Bissell finally quit after doing 3 homes for several years, I researched Amazon and based on all the good reviews this Hoover received, I ordered it. Prompt shipment just like all my other Amazon purchases. But, the machine ran about 2 minutes and the motor burned up leaving a terrible smell in the house for the rest of the day. No problems with return or the credit to our account,all accomplished on line. We just got a bad machine I guess. Bought another Bissell and hope it lasts as well as the old one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same problem as Patricia","review":"Mine is a more expensive model, but the gaskets go bad on the clean water tank after a couple of uses. I've replaced the tank 4 times already and the most recent time was just a few months ago. This weekend we went to shampoo the rugs and the tank is leaking again. It's a problem with the tanks and has made me swear off Hoover products."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where has our quality gone","review":"I order the agility because of its great reviews. The carpet cleaner I received was terrible it never sucked. I read the direction, put the water with the soap in the container and proceed to do my carpet. Out of a gallon of water I put in the machine it only sucked a cup of water out. No matter how many times I went over the carpet it would not pick up anymore water. I had bought the machine at Costco and they let me return it. I was using a Hoover that was 15 years old and that sucked better than the new one. I still need a new carpet cleaner but I am afraid to buy one I really hate returning thing to the store. Where has our quality gone? Maybe we need things made in America again."},{"rating":"1","title":"First time using it.","review":"Okay I have had a bissel in the past for 4 years it broke. So I did allot of research of hoover steamvac. i came to find that this one had allot of good reviews. So I bought it. I used it the first time yesterday, and it would not SUCK up the water I dd my whole house and it only had 1 cup of water it suck up. I read and instructions and even tried different thing, but nope it did not work."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISGUSTED. BISSELS R BETTER","review":"THE ONLY THING GOOD ABOUT THIS THING IS ITS PRETTY. BUT I HAVE HAD TWO BISSELS, THEY ;MAKE WONDERFUL STEAM CLEANERS, CANT MAKE A VACUUM THAT WILL LAST A DAY THOUGH. BUT THIS HOOVER I WAS SO LOOKING FORWARD TO. I HAVE NEVER HATED SOMENTHING SO MUCH IN MY LIFE. IT DONT SUCK .U GOT ONE FULL THING OF WATER GOIN OUT ADN 1/4 THING OF WATER DIRTY COMMING IN. U FIGURE THAT ONE. AND U GOTTA CHAGE AND REPLACE PUT MORE WATER IN 5 TIMES IN A SMALL LIVING ROOM AND 2 TIMES IN A SMALL BATHROOM. AND I HAVE A TRAILOR. SO GO FIGURE. IT ALSO SAYS U CAN ONLY USE HOOVER CLEANER IN IT.I LOVE THE BISSEL PET ODOR CLEANER.THIS IS THE MOST PATTHETIC PRODUCT I EVER SEEN USED OR BOUGHT. I HONESTLY AM VERY DISAAPOINTED. I AM A PRODUCT TESTER AND I PURCHASED THIS THIHG . I HATE IT. I WILL NEVER EVER OWN ANOTHER HOOVER STEAM CLEANER. SHOULD HAVE GOTTEN ANOTHER BISSEL. IF THEY WOULDHAVE HAD A NO STAR RATING, ITS GET THAT ONE."},{"rating":"1","title":"no suction","review":"My parents bought this cleaner a few years ago, and I've borrowed it a few times to clean my carpets. The tanks are easy to put on & remove, and my only complaint is that it has very little suction. I'm not an electronics idiot, and I read the manual, cleaned the lint screens, etc. It just doesn't have the suction to pick up the water. The brushes are agitating and I can see foamy water, but very little of it gets picked up. A gallon of clean hot water and solution goes into the tank, but only about 1/2 - 3/4 of a cup of dirty water is picked up.Once again I have very wet carpets with a fan blowing on them, hoping to cut the drying time. As I sit here regretting my decision to borrow their Hoover instead of renting a carpet cleaner I've decided to buy a cleaner myself, but will do a lot of research before deciding which one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works Great until it breaks","review":"I purchased this unit about a year ago, and have been happy with its performance. It is light and manageable but still does a great job on my carpets. However, as mentioned in numerous reviews, I was concerned about the flimsy plastic design. Not surprisingly, a hose broke 4 months ago and it had to go in for repair. Four months later it is still in the repair shop. Why? - because Hoover (or the company that bought the Hoover name - PTI) can't seem to be bothered to send the repair shop the replacement parts or if they do they are the wrong ones.I suspected I might be in for trouble when I had to go to three different shops to find one that would repair Hoovers. The two previous stated the same thing: It was too hard to get parts from Hoover and they didn't want the hassle from their clients when they had to wait.Buyer Beware - the units work well but be prepared for a ridiculously long wait if it does need to be serviced."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hoover F6215-900 Steam Vac","review":"Before purchasing this vac, I read all the feedback. Everyone seemed to love this vac. I have used it and it does do a great job for what it is. I have a dog that was on prednisone and they drink a lot of water and urinate more often. I just pulled out the steam vac and sucked it up and cleaned the area at the same time. Sure beats having to spend up to $45.00 renting a steam vac and all the cleaning supplies that go with it and picking it up and taking it back. What a hassle!! Now, when there is something that needs to be cleaned, I can do it in a jiffy!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Super shampooer","review":"Our carpets look almost like new. We also cleaned the carpet in our mini van. It also looks new. Would recommend to everybody."},{"rating":"1","title":"Suction sucks","review":"Other users complained about the poor suction from the unit. I couldn't agree more. The damn thing hardly sucks up any of the water sprayed into the carpet. You have to use the handheld attachment unit to suck up the water. I have an older model that sucks up at least twice as much."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works wonders","review":"I have 3 small children and I use this about once a week. It has gotten out every body fulid known to man. Not to mention all the spilled drinks and food on the floor. I love it. I have had it for over a year now and I have had no problems whatsoever. My Grandma even wants to get one because she saw how well it worked. I would recomend this to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"cleans your carpet well","review":"I used this one to clean my carpet which had several layers of dirt. I am completely satisfied with the cleaning power"},{"rating":"1","title":"Please don't buy","review":"I,too, bought this after very extensive research and reading of all the reviews. People were so pleased and I was swayed by their raves. My experience was quite different,although, quite similar to the negative reviews. Bottom line: it didn't suction up the water. I reread the instructions, cleaned the machine thoroughly and went over and over the wet areas with no luck. Very little water returned. I ended up using towels and walking back and forth on them to try to get the moisture out. Took a horrendous amount of time. Very frustrating experience. I also waited too long before I first used the machine so that by the time I had this experience it was well past the 30 day return."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fell apart after 20 uses","review":"I liked it while it lasted. It didn't get rid of stains, but had a generally positive effect on the appearance of my carpets. I also broke the rules and used in on my hardwood floors. They looked great! But both hoses broke after about 20 uses, and the repair guy said that it wasn't even worth fixing for the $80 it would have cost. One star may seem harsh, but it doesn't matter how well it cleans - if I have to replace an appliance after 20 uses, it's not worth buying in the first place."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"I really like this product. Except for it being a little on the heavier side to move up and down steps, it is a great product. It works great and is easy to clean and easy to fill. Plus, the handle folds down to make for more compact storage. It really does a good job on the carpets and you can definitely see a huge difference. I would definitely purchase another Hoover product again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"Vacuum cleans your carpet fantastically. The dirty water that is sucked back is proof that your carpets needed the cleaning. I do have a problem with a little bit of leakage from the bottom whent he vacuum is stationary but it is nothing that cannot be sucked back up. I find it fairly light and easy to use. I have done my whole house and even went out and did my car carpets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hoover F6215-900 SteamVac Agility Carpet Cleaner","review":"I bought this item after I used my daughter's and was just amazed at the cleaning power of the machine.

Very easy to use and very easy to clean. When I first started using the machine, I noticed very little water coming out and my carpet looked wet and dirty. I pushed down on the front of the machine thinking that some extra weight would help it work better. Something \\"clicked\\" into place and then the machine started picking up all kinds of dirt and water. My carpets are now clean and beautiful looking - as if cleaned professionally. Well worth the cost."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good machine","review":"I am very pleased with my Hoover SteamVac Agility. I researched for over 3 months on different products, websites and customer comments before making my final decision. I am glad I purchased this one. So far I am 99% satisfied; it was delivered faster than expected, it works great, cleaning results are outstanding, easy functioning, not complicated to put to work, no leaks, water containers of good size, etc. The only thing that I have to get used to is the weight; it is kind of heavy to push around while cleaning compared to my previous machine (kirby) that has a transmission. But I have to admit that with the outstanding cleaning results I can care less about how heavy it is to push around. I will definitely recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent CD","review":"Come on folks,,,, It's RUSH. A three man band that puts out music better than most larger bands.

I tried buying a new AC Adpater power source, but the problem was obviously with the unit itself. Kodak said, \\"too bad. you can send it in for repairs.\\" Hardly worth the trouble. Not crazy about the C330 camera either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easyshare Dock (Series 3)","review":"For some reason, I did not receive cables either. At the \\"List\\" price, I thought it was too expensive (thinking cables were included). At Amazon's price with free shipping and no tax to my state (CA), I was able to justify the cost. I mainly use it to keep the batteries charged at all times. The transfer button (I had no problems with it) is handy. Even though the transfer is slow (compared to my DSLR), I don't have to keep popping my SD card in and out; which cuts the odds that I get something foreign in the works. Its' three segmented lights give you somewhat of an indication of the state of battery charge. When you press the transfer button, a single light blinks indicating that it's ready to transfer pictures. It's pretty nice looking (silver over black) and stable on my computer work area. Just remember where that little clear adapter that came with your camera is, you will need it to mount your camera to this unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kodak Easyshare Camera Dock","review":"Not impressed at all with this product. You are better off just to plug in your camera in the USB port and let Windows process it. At least you will get a chance to indicate where you want your pictures saved. I suggest you don't use Easyshare software. Windows Pic and Fax Viewer is far superior to this software. If you decide you will use it you will find that all your pics on the hard drive will be set to use Easyshare. The solution to this is to uninstall Easyshare and all pics with revert to Windows."},{"rating":"1","title":"No AV cable, description promises one","review":"This is nothing more than an expensive battery charger. Before ordering, I sent a note to Kodak, asking what was needed to display photos from a C310 on a TV. Their response was to buy the Kodak Easyshare Camera Dock Series 3. I looked on the Amazon web site and with the description for this product, it said \\"In addition to a USB 1.1 cable, the Camera Dock Series 3 also comes with an AV cable, enabling you to display photo slideshows to friends and family via your TV.\\" This is a lie. No AV cable is included. It's another order and another $20 to get the cable.

The book is a fairy interesting picture book about dinosaurs and other prehistoric animals, and it gives a basic outline of the timeline of the animals. It gives very little else in the way of useful information. There are pictures of dinosaurs that are unlabelled, so when my daughter says, \\"What kind is that?\\" I have to say that I don't know. Very little information is given about the dinosaurs, and nearly all of it is about groups of dinosaurs (sauropods, etc.) rather than individual ones.

From beginning to end, it reads like a novel. The reader gets to know many of the people who were affected by this tragedy - the victims, the heroes, the cowards, and the scoundrels. In the end, we wonder why we haven't heard about this horrendous disaster. The book is fascinating reading!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hidden From History","review":"This disaster has been hidden from historical references better than anything I've ever come across. Over 1,000 people die horribly, mostly women and children, and the following has occurred:The 2004 Microsoft Encarta DVD Encyclopedia makes absolutely no reference to this event.The book \\"New York Times Page One\\" does not show this as one of it's important front page dates.The book \\"Chronicles of the 20th Century\\" (1300+ pages) only makes mention of the ship's owners being found negligent, not the event itself.The largest loss of life from a single disaster from 1904 until 2001 and they can't mention it! Thankfully, this book does it justice and brings the hidden truth to light."},{"rating":"2","title":"O'Donnell makes little known tragedy a fantastic read","review":"As a student of history and also a firefighter, I had heard of this disaster but knew nothing about it. O'Donnell does an excellent job describing the time period, the community, and the impact of the disaster itself. The hundreds of dead children and the defective life preservers will make the strongest stomach wince, yet O'Donnell write very tastefully and professionally. The book sometimes seems quite graphic, but there really is no light hearted way to tell of this horrible event.I really could not put this book down. The chapters were the perfect length; long enought to give a great amount of information, yet short enough to keep the story rolling. Oddly enough, I read it exactly 100 years after the burning of the General Slocum. Kudos to Mr. O'Donnell for finally bringing this event into the light. Also check the Slocum website for more info, pictures, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book of little known Tragedy","review":"I drive past the place of the Slocum tragedy almost everyday, and yet I had no idea that this event ever happened.

Her selfishness causes great pain to people around her, and she thinks she's entirely justified!I thought this book was just awful, and I honestly can't see why anybody else recommends it.

But from the very first, I had to force myself into the book. It has no lure; it never really caught my attention. I wanted to find out what happened so I continued to read. But, in my opinion (and I think mine an educated opinion, I read all the time), the story is not well written. The characters never fully come alive. It's not truly believable. It's a lot like a serial story or TV show, where the author keeps one step ahead so you'll keep coming back even though the story is no good. That's how I felt about this book. It wasn't believable. I wouldn't read it again. And I don't want to read the sequels.

There's no conclusion, no real ending, nothing. For the review with 5 stars that claims there was suspense I wonder what book she was reading because it certainly wasn't this. This book is boring and long and has no real ending. It does help you understand Amish life, but if you're looking for a story with a beginning, middle, and end look elsewhere.

The author, Beverly Lewis, did a good job of introducing the customs of these prayerful people. She developed the characters quite well but, when it came to finishing the story, I was disappointed. There were too many loose ends. This may be Lewis' technique for making you want to read her next book but I, for one, wanted to hear what happened to these characters. I did not want to be launched off into the nether world trying to guess what happened.

The suspense of hearing (as I said it was an audiobook) about the little satin dress and the repercussions that arose from finding it became evident clear from the prologue. I became enthralled with the secrets and emotions involved with this amish community set book, and I absolutely loved the surprise ending! This book has made me a clear Beverly Lewis fan and I can't wait to read her other Amish series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable & Slow Paced Story","review":"This was a free download for Kindle that I read one afternoon. It was a quick and easy read that started out rather pleasantly interesting, but it I had a hard time staying interested since the story dragged. It is a Christian fiction book and I liked the way the religious themes were developed and explored. However, I was rather disappointed when the book ended in a fashion that just set-up for the next book. (Which I will not be downloading & reading.)The book's pace was slow thus it ended right when you were thinking things would pick-up. I can't say much about the ending without giving it away, but I will say that chances are good you will be able to predict the ending easily as you read through the chapters. Even though there wasn't anything really wrong with the book, I rated it low because of the predictability and extremely slow pace."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stays on the phone for awhile...","review":"I liked this book - I sympathized with the struggle and really felt sorry for the heroine when she was casted out. I also like the open end, so I could come up with my own which kept the cloying sweetness factor down.I was a little astonished by the German terms - I understand that this branch of the Amish come from Switzerland, but as a native German speaker some of the terms seemed really off - but that's minor.Might be a good read for a teenage girl!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasant Surprise","review":"I was shocked how exciting a story about the Amish way of life could be!! I like fact based stories and would have been please to read a book that centered around a culture so very different from my own life BUT although this is a very educational book in one sense it also is very suspenseful and entertaining as any fictional top seller out there. The charactors are endearing and very easy to get attached too. You really want to root for Katie and you really feel her pain throughout the novel. I am very pleased with this Freebie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Visiting lancaster?","review":"If you are planning to visit Lancaster or anywhere the Amish live, I highly recommned you read a Beverly Lewis book and this is a great place to start.

The shunning refers to what happens when someone in the Amish community doesn't abide by the \\"rules\\"of the communit and refuses to confess. A young Amish woman must try to decide if following the rules and expectations of her family and everyone she knows and values is worth giving up her dreams (music) and marrying a man she respects but does not love."},{"rating":"2","title":"Emotional.

It's part of the heritage of Lancaster County Series.Beverly Lewis is a long time novelist of Amish fiction. Since visiting Holmes County, Ohio, (The second largest Amish Community in the country, I think.) I have developed quite an affection for the Amish people. I have read everything that I can get my hands on regarding the subject, including this series.Most of the novel has a Christian message, but the characters will still capture your heart even if you don't normal read this type of thing. The book begins in a small Amish Community near Lancaster, PA and unfolds the tale of a young girl's question of faith and curiousity towards the outside world.The Shunning is really an easy read for a long weekend at the lake. Give it a chance. You might actually be surprised."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trite and Predictable -Shun It..........Reviewer: Sucker For Freebies","review":"One star for the background material on Amish life, the reason I wanted to read this book, although some of the reviewers have said the material wasn't accurate. Still, you got the flavor of what Amish life might be like.As for the plot itself, it was pretty transparent from the start. I don't even need to read book 2 or 3 of the trilogy to predict how it will turn out. Bad, especially for a Y. A. audience. Lewis should have more respect for her readers. I wouldn't let my students read this stuff without a strong warning. Even for free, this wasn't worth the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good fiction.","review":"I read The Shunning, The Confession and The Reckoning rather quickly. These books by Beverly Lewis are strictly fiction. I am sure she researched everthing needed about the Amish and the Lancaster County area but the reader has to remember that these books are strictly fiction and for our reading enjoyment. As in all religious denominations there are many differences just as there are many different people that make up each individual church and community."},{"rating":"1","title":"Second Chances is One Chance Too Many","review":"I purchased this DVD so I could enjoy this early '90s program again -- oops! The 4-DVD package has only about 8 episodes of the original program as it was broadcast and the rest are episodes of a spin-off of Second Chances. Most of the episodes of the original show were fun to watch, but I was disappointed that most of the original characters disappear about halfway through the series with little, if any, explanation. J-Lo is in all 16 episodes and as enchanting as she is, she alone could not carry the story lines created for the other characters. Speaking of story lines, it seemed as if the writers gave up about half way through and phoned it in for the rest of the program. Second Chances had plenty of promise and the plot lines could have been concluded in a variety of ways, but the only direction the producers took this show was down-down-down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be Prepared","review":"The screws packaged with this product have heads that are too large for the holes in the plastic bumpers.

I bought the book because I love the magazine, but the only thing better about the book is that it doesn't have ads. Although, one could say that the resource section in the back is one big ad, and even it doesn't correspond the company with the tips in the book. There is also no index.Spend the money, you would have spent on the book on getting and/or renewing your subscription to the magazine, it's superb. The book is only mediocre at best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice pictures....","review":"As in the magazine, the photographs are gorgeous. Actually, I recognize some of the photos from past magazines, so maybe if you've had a Real Simple subscription for a while you might not even get anything out of the visuals. As for information, it's pretty worthless. There is hardly any text at all, as you would see if you could flip through the book. Some of the pictures are of interesting organizing solutions, but many of the photos don't even have captions, so an interesting way to store jewelry, for example, is shown to you but not explained. It would make a nice coffeetable book, but don't buy this if you are actually looking for some serious information."},{"rating":"1","title":"Proportions not ideal for ferrets","review":"Lixit (and one or two almost identical knock-offs) have the ferret dish market pretty well tied up, and a locking dish is a definite must for ferrets, but I wish they'd tailor more than just the packaging to the actual animal! These dishes are too tall for ferrets- especially when mounted in higher-end ferret cages that have trays on each level. Between the rims on the trays, the lock underneath the dish, and the depth of the dish itself, the top sits several inches above where the ferret's head would naturally be.

The live versions of \\"2112\\" and \\"Something for Nothing\\" leave their studio-born siblings in the dust. The same can be said for just about all of the tracks here. Heck, I even like this version of \\"By-Thor and the Snow Dog.\\" I'm not a huge fan of Phase-I Rush, but the energy here is contagious and the album is a lot of fun to listen to.And what would a 1970's-era live hard rock album be without an extended drum solo. At least we get to hear one of the greatest rock drummers of all time on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rush ATWAS: The finale of their magnificent power era","review":"From the first time I listened to this album (or Rush) as a kid, in my 8-track back in 1978, I knew this was something special. I have listened to this recording over 500 times and I still marvel at its rawness, power and intensity...This is the culmination of Rush's powerful 70's era before they would become more refined and sculpted. They would only get better. Who would've guessed? This album was also therapy for a long period of hopelessness and isolation I endured in my youth. Thank you Rush and Company...Curt"},{"rating":"2","title":"One Of The 70's Best Live Albums","review":"All The Worlds A Stage captures Rush during their most consistent period. Along with Kiss 'Alive',BOC's 'On Your Feet...',it represents what a real concert was in this golden age of arena rock.For a test,put on some of their later output like Test For Echo,Roll The Bones or Presto (3 worst Rush albums)then play this and compare how far they've strayed from what originally put them on the map. If they had come out in any era with material as weak as those records,I doubt anyone would have cared to write about them today.These are more than just songs. They are classic pieces that remain in my head forever,every last note.It's a shame that they've turned their back on playing some of their greatest music in concert,and even believe some of this is embarassing ."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst live Rush album","review":"While the musicianship on this CD is awesome (as would be expected of Rush) the quality is awful. What bothers me is the production of this disc. It sounds like it was recorded in Gomer Pyle's barrocks. If you want live early Rush, then try \\"Different Stages\\". \\"All The World\\" is for die-hards only."},{"rating":"1","title":"Average live set","review":"This is generally considered an accurate document of what Rush sounded like in the mid-70s. The set list is essentially a best-of from their first four albums. Sound quality is actually quite decent as long as you don't expect the studio-doctored slickness of later live albums. Spirited performances of \\"2112\\" and \\"What You're Doing\\" are standouts. But for some reason, the rest of the music doesn't really click. \\"By-Tor and the Snowdog\\" runs far, far too long and most of the other tunes don't offer enough to distinguish themselves from superior studio versions. This one is for completists and hardcore fans of the band's early period."},{"rating":"2","title":"4.5 stars- Better than I remembered","review":"Just recently I bought \\"All The Worlds A Stage\\" for the first time on cd. At first I didn't like it very much because it sounded pretty raw when compared to the smoother EXIT STAGE LEFT. I think with the release of EXIT they were playing better because they had been doing about 250 shows a year for quite a few years and they were maturing as live musicians, but still, this first live album shows them more raw and energetic, so it's good to have both in your possession. It sounds much better to me than when I first heard it in 1981. This remaster sounds quite a bit better than the vinyl album did (which is something that I can't say about all rock albums). If you don't have this live album, but have a lot of the studio albums, don't hesitate in aquiring this first Rush live album."},{"rating":"2","title":"FOR ALL DRUMMERS","review":"If you are a drummer, or aspiring to be one, this album IS A MUST.

'Working Man'is played to perfection as well as 'Bastille Day'. If you want to hear music at its best, buy this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not For Music Critics","review":"At this writing, this is out of print. That's a real shame, because there are some pieces in this that every Rush fan needs to hear. They feature an extended version of \\"By-Tor and the Snow Dog\\". With the extra feedback missing on the studio versions, it adds an eerie effect to the song. But the real highlights include \\"Lakeside Park\\", \\"2112\\", \\"Something for Nothing\\", \\"What You're Doing\\" (it's amusing to hear band members say as leaving the stage \\"Man, oh man, I guess that's it!\\"), and the medley of \\"Working Man\\" and \\"Finding My Way\\" (can anyone knock Neil Peart's awesome drum solo here?).If you're wondering why I entitled this review \\"Not For Music Critics\\", it's because Rush is a band that's been unduly slagged by the critics. Those who can't become critics!"},{"rating":"2","title":"rush in the raw...","review":"this album is classic rush... if you are a true rush fan! I gave it 4 stars instead of five due to the sound quality of the recording. Even in its enhanced digital remastered state, the quality is lacking but this is 70's live albums true to form.

Highlights from this album are the full version of 2112, in the mood, fly by night, and finding my way/ working man...( the drum solo..listen to pick out rhythmic sections peart uses in all his solo's) All in all its a gem... in the rough... i would recommend this album to the true fan of rush"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"All The World\`s A Stage\\" of Experience","review":"I have been listening to Rush since I was 13, and from ages 13-15 they were my favorite band.

Unless you're blessed with brilliance, inpiration, and limitless free time, avoid this book. I've read many chapters two or three times over and still cannot apply what I've learned to the problems at the end of the chapter. In that respect, this book fails as a student textbook.

Los cuatro protagonistas acompañan las cenizas de su amigo desde la capital británica hasta la costa en un viaje en coche que es también un viaje hacia el sinsentido de sus vidas. Swift nos ofrece los recuerdos, las traiciones y los miedos de sus personajes a través de monólogos interiores entrelazados con escenas del trayecto hacia la costa. El resultado es un texto estremecedor, profundo, que nos invita a pensar sobre la naturaleza perecedera de todo lo que conocemos, sobre la caducidad de la materia de que estamos hechos no sólo los hombres sino también nuestros sueños."},{"rating":"2","title":"Post Modern Authentic","review":"Part way through the book, I paused and thought about these messed-up lives and unexpressed emotions, then it occurred to me that these guys are just like everyone I know. To me, this is why I found the voices so authentic. I am Vince's age and shared his attitude toward those of his father's generation. There is little narration and much stream of conscious thinking which makes the book, at times, hard to follow. Develop a score card of characters and relationships early since it does get confusing. Ultimately the four stars are for the implicit language which limits the scope of the book somewhat. Although the dialog is onviously authentic, I know that I missed some things since I am not from the neighborhood and the dialog almost assumes that a reader must be from nearby."},{"rating":"1","title":"A let down","review":"I could not get truly involved in this book.

The spiritual side, the utter pain and joy of living human lives. These are your average Joes and Joans. The workings of the minds of most of us.The technique of very short segments(chapters) of each character's thoughts, combined with jumbled time sequences, is not new. For this story, it was outstanding. I found it useful to reread each character's segments as I was nearing the end. It tied up the loose ends(RIP Peter Falk).The ending was good. I did not feel disappointed, but I was rather encouraged."},{"rating":"2","title":"Last Orders","review":"Overall I enjoyed this book.Initially I thought what other readers have commented on that the 4 characters were difficult to differentiate from each other. I made a list of the character names their wives and their children which helped get me a bit further into the novel when I didn't need it anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Touching Tale of Life and Death","review":"Graham Swift's Booker Prize winning novel would be interesting even if it only dealt with the basic premise of the novel- Four aging men journey to the sea in hopes of scattering their deceased friend's ashes. However, Mr.Swift goes beyond that and sets it above other literary works by intricately weaving together the collective memories and voices of the seven major narrators. The text is simple, the language is beautiful, and the abiding truths concerning life and death are symbolic. Last Orders is an exquisitly written, touching tale depicting the importance of life, love and friendship that all readers can relate to and learn a thing or two from."},{"rating":"2","title":"Closing time too soon!","review":"An intense, realistic story with an unusual narrative style.

Many reviewers said the characters and situations were funny and authentic. Taking the garbage out is an authentic actitity, too; but terribly uninteresting. What is funny about this group of pathetically boring characters and their box of ashes? I forced myself to finish this book, but found it a great disappointment. I agree with the Boston Review's comments. It is a banal book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally engrossing","review":"Using multiple narrators, Swift achieves a kind of carousel effect with the same characters going round and round. We notice a little more detail about each, and learn a little more about them on every go round.The characterizations were excellent, and all (except Vince) remind me of that wonderful line from Dark Side of the Moon, you know...\\"Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way\\".My only gripe is that important factors motivating the characters are never fully revealed...What did Amy tell June about her father? What did Ray do with the money?Swift writes with elegance and clearly loves the England he so wonderfully evokes here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Working Class Canterbury Tales?","review":"I found the constant change from character to character and from time frame to time frame made the story difficult to get into. Whatever humor there was in this story escapes me. What a very sad commentary on the family relationships of the characters. Only two seemed to have any satisfaction in their lives. Depressing at best. The fact that I needed to read this for a book club discussion is the only thing that caused me to persevere to the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Booker Prize material","review":"This novel has an interesting structure, but it takes so long to get the cast of characters straight that I kept losing my concentration.

The author repeated, 'he said' and 'she said' until I thought I'd scream. I'm not sure how else the author could handle dialogue when there are so few characters, but it seems he could have come up with something creative. Trying to give the book/story a chance I watched the movie on TV (should say I tried to watch the movie) and it was equally boring and pointless. Couldn't finish the book or the movie. Gave the book one star just for the work that must go into writing a novel.

We read it for book club and it was highly rated by my fellow readers. Others raved about the book leading me to think perhaps I'd missed something so I rented the movie and watched it (or at least I tried). The movie was equally terrible. Not one word of the book or movie did a thing for me. Whatever the book had to offer was lost on me.

Every album beginning with their self title debut RUSH through Signals were 4 or 5 star albums. Their distinct sound and creativity in their early years makes them one of the greatest rock bands in history. Unfortunately they succumbed to the influences of the 80's new wave rock beginning with this album marking the beginning of the end. If you are a hard core Rush fan like I am don't waste your time with this disappointing effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rush moving in the wrong direction","review":"I'm a big Rush fan. I bought this album when it came out and actually saw them on the Grace under Pressure tour. This album marks the beginning of \\"techo-rush\\".

If I was going to choose from thier albums, this would be low on the list."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"I suppose after several high quality, and in some cases classic albums, the band had to hit a rocky patch. 'Grace Under Pressure' was the beginning of this. Tracks like 'Red Lenses' and 'Red Sector A' would be instantly forgettable if they weren't so dire! The lyrics in both are terrible, what does \\"I must help my mother stand up straight\\" mean exactly? The opening keyboard sound of \\"Between the wheels\\" is just awful! And how many, er, times is the word \\"time\\" used in the opening 2 verses? Two tracks feature no bass guitar at all, using a synth-bass instead, which is not what Geddy Lee is about, as he has been the 'father' of the instrument for so long. Highlights are \\"Kid Gloves\\" and \\"The Enemy Within\\", the rest is not worth the time taken to listen to it. The band didn't properly recover from this until 1991's excellent \\"Roll the Bones\\". Sorry, unless you're a diehard Rushhead, give this one a miss."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rushing Into The 80's","review":"Well, Rush WAS a great combo of both progressive and hard rock in their heyday. Signals was a slight downturn from Moving Pictures,but Grace Under Pressure slides further. In the 80's (worst musical decade thank you very much)everyone was obliged to make their stinky \\"robot man\\" album full of synthesizers and sci-fi themes. It got overdone to death and this album is no exception. Synths (sequenced in live shows)take over leaving Rush not even sounding like a power (what power from here on ?)trio at all; a trend that continued for many a dull album. However I always liked \\"Kid Gloves\\";it has great tricky time changes and maybe Lifeson's best guitar solo ever. Overall, not their absolute worst (Roll The Bones is a few down the line),not the best,not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"Rush for me made the most brilliant and inspirational music ever heard between 1976-82, but it was inevitable that the bubble would eventually burst. 'Pressure' is Rush's weakest album since the Led Zeppelin-esque days of the mid 70's, apart from 'Kid Gloves' and 'Enemy Within' the whole album lacks the passion and sheer excitement of the '2112' to 'Signals' era. Keyboards played TOO much of a part on this album, and the bass and guitars were pushed further into the background. Successor 'Powerwindows' wasn't much better, and the trio didn't really recover from this until 1991's excellent 'Roll the Bones'. I suppose a few duff records out of more than 20 ain't so bad though..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yep!","review":"Some people say that this is one of the most difficult albums that Rush has ever made. However, I liked it when I heard it for the first time. \\"Distant Early Warning\\" and \\"Red Sector A\\" are classic Rush songs. Also the part one of Fear which is \\"The Enemy Within\\" is absolutly amazing. The other parts of Fear that had been released before this album are Witch Hunt (part III) {in Moving Pictures} and The Weapon (part II) {in Signals}. The keyboards especially very powerful in these songs. The only song I don't like so much is \\"Red Lenses\\" which has it moments but I find it too poppy for me. Well, a great album from Rush.Stars: Red Sector A, The Enemy Within, Distant Early Warning"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not their best, but really good...","review":"This is a really good album...I thought that I would dislike it, being a strong fan of 2112, Fly by Night, and A Farewell to Kings. I am glad to say that I was mistaken. It is not as good as the albums listed above, but it catches them in the middle of their synth period. This album is really catchy and has great singing. It shows how diverse Rush can be. Recomended to the moderate fan, but not a casual fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Did you see the Grace Under Pressure tour?","review":"Accompanying this disc, the live show here featured more RED than I thought was possible to absorb in our relatively small (~12,000 seat) Tucson Convention Center arena. I believe the album was played in it's entirety, and the fact that it WAS 1984 signaled the Distant Early Warning of things to come globally which most of us could not have imagined then in a seemingly \\"innocent age.\\" My Grace Under Pressure lp has grooves that are, possibly, even more worn than any other RUSH lp in my collection. I'm glad that the band has retained use of the stylish mannequin skull at their concerts to the present day. And I agree with the other reviews about the style of playing exhibited by all the band members, on this disc. I think this collection of songs was one of RUSH's greatest accomplishments in the 1980's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not their finest Hour","review":"I am a huge Rush fan, and have been for years. I can't recommend this CD however unless you have ALL the others. This is in my opinion one of the worst CDs they ever produced. The musicianship is tame, and the subject matter is tired after being rehashed from their previous (much better) works. I would recommend 'Signals' (a masterpiece), '2112', 'Hemispheres', 'A farewell to Kings', 'Moving Pictures', 'Permanent Waves' (another masterpiece), or even their 'best of' before this one. The only time I could recommend this is if you need the complete collection, as this CD is important in that it is a transition for them as a band from their 2nd to 3rd \\"reincarnation\\" of their music. Overall though, not a good CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh God....not this one.....please.","review":"Every band is allowed one aberration in their catalogue, and I suppose a back catalogue the size of the Rush one could be granted two. Along with \\"Exit, Stage Left\\" this is probably the most deeply horrible experience ever to carry the Rush name, albeit for totally different reasons. While \\"ESL\\" is simply fatuous, \\"Grace Under Pressure\\" is intensely annoying for its failure to exploit the potential within it.Lyrically it is certainly no worse than the albums which preceded or succeeded it (although the laughably heavy-handed \\"Red Sector A\\" should perhaps be singled out for special abuse). Musically, however, it could be Britney Speares: lightweight pop, the music undermining the lyrics rather than reinforcing them. Quite how the same team that wrote \\"2112\\", \\"Ghost of a chance\\" and \\"Vertigo\\" could be responsible for this is still a mystery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Downward Trend","review":"\\"Grace\\" represented the first of several disappointing records by this immensly talented trio.

I really liked the video for Distant Early Warning, so I decided to give Rush a try. After one complete listen-through of this album, I was hooked. From the complex and loud solo on Distant Early Warning, to the \\"Police-ish\\" sound of The Enemy Within, each song has it's own unique sound. The funky and jazzy sound of Red Lenses is the highlight of the album. Give this one a try; you will be hooked too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rush's classic period ends","review":"I would give every Rush album up to this point five stars ending with Signals. The band parted ways with their producer Terry Brown and embraced a keyboard dominated sound on this album, abandoning their hard rock past and thus totally alienating me as a die hard fan. When I first bought this album in 1984 I could'nt believe it was the same band. For anybody who wants to hear Rush at their peak, any of the albums from the self titled debut up to Signals will leave you amazed at the awesome musicianship of Geddy, Alex, and Neil."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grace Under Pressure","review":"This album isn't exactly what one would call positive,but that doesn't detract from the songwriting at all. This album seems to be a very underrated Rush offering and it's most likely because of the use of synthesizers and Alex Lifeson's minimized role. Even with that, this album is great. Distant Early Warning is a Rush classic, Between The Wheels is brilliant as is The Body Electric. Sure this isn't an album full of prog rock epics, but it is good songwriting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unusual rush album","review":"This is by far the most daring album from Rush if you think about it. No Rush album sounds anything like this, not signals or even Power Windows even though the albums were so close to one another.

Jack and Rachel's two daughters, 13 and 15 year old, had the intelligence of 3 and 5 year olds. Rachel was the one with the head injuries, but one has to wonder if Jack suffered from head injuries also. The story was told in 16 days, which seemed to be enough time for Jack to realize that he's put the love of his life on the back burner for the past six year. Grow up Jack!

The characters met and romanced in such a normal average way (in college - very much like me and many of my friends), and yet how the author made it seem so wonderful and extraordinary. I've known so many Jacks - he's just such a typical character. And he makes so many classic mistakes. Not checking up on your daughter's whereabouts on prom night because you're afraid to rock the boat - this is totally believable. Particularly since he had been out of the loop for 6 years.

I find that once I start reading her books, I can't put them down until I turn the last page and then I am sad that the book is over! Thank you, Barbara, for sharing your talent with so many of us! This book left me with a deep impression - it was definitely one of your best! I am already looking forward to reading your next novel...hope the wait is not long! You have the ability to relate to your readers in a very special way!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you don't have anything else to read...","review":"I happened to read this book because it was at the beach house we rented for vacation last week. The description made the book seem interesting, but it was very one-dimensional & the characters were so stereotyped that they are not believable.For Rachel to have loved (still love) Jack so much, she found it very easy to suddenly pack up & leave him. Also, the writer should have thought out a better way to communicate for Rachel - Katherine seemed very harsh & abrasive. I also found it hard to believe that Rachel was such a loner in the city, but quite the joiner since moving to Big Sur. Nothing really flowed together right to make the story believable.If you don't have anything else to read, give it a try, but don't buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great gift for your cowgirl friends!","review":"Although short, this hilarious book of quotes will make any country girl laugh until she has tears in her eyes.

I got it for myself on a trip out west, so then I thought it was a good gift for a friend who just moved to TX from NY. It was well received."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crappy Cap","review":"The cap gets a few stars for looks but the plastic is not durable at all and the first time it dropped from my backpack it broke (compared to my Nalgene bottle that's been dropped thousands of times and never breaks).If you are going to get the bottle, I recommend getting the bottle bandit to help you hold the bottle on or get the screw top instead which looks more durable.Plus, if it does break, you have to spend about $2+a lot more for shipping to replace it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just the cap","review":"This is just the cap to go over a sport top. The product description is misleading - there is no screw top, there is nothing to drink from. This cap snaps onto a diferent bottle top. If you are looking for a sport-top, pick a different item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very cheap plastic","review":"I wish Sigg would make a better cap for their water bottles.

It would be one thing if these were covers by other ambient artists, but this is not worth the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ah Wilderness","review":"I normally do not read plays, but I was glad I did read this one. The reason was that we were planning to go and see it on stage, and we were inviting some friends to go with us. I wanted to know a little about the plot and whether it would be an appropriate play for our friends. It was easy and interesting to read, especially the descriptions of the different characters in the play. We went and enjoyed the play. It was great to see how creative people can work with fewer props then what were described in the actual written play and still produce a great rendition of a very pleasant and entertaining play."},{"rating":"2","title":"music to travel by","review":"I listened to this cd while traveling from Virginia to Colorado last spring,by car. While going through Kansas,with the wheat fields blowing in the wind,clear blue skies dotted with white clouds, I passed a sign telling me I was following along the old Oregon and California trails.My mind began to wander and I began to visualize what their travels must have been like and comparing that with the way I was now traveling.This cd began playing and between the music,the scenery and the history,I was nearly overcome. This has to be my favorite road trip cd, I never travel without it.Pop this in the cd player,roll down the windows and roll on in bliss! I have all their cd's and my stress levels after a hectic day at work just melts away when I listen to them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely beautiful!","review":"Wow. This a truly amazing CD. I kept hearing great things about Secret Garden, and I finally picked up a copy of White Stones. I can't figure out how I got by without this music! I like to describe it as a Classical/Celtic sound, but I'm not sure if it will fit into any category. EVERY song is so wonderful, and aside from a tiny problem with the accordian thing that goes on in track 5 (hence the 4-star rating), I don't have a complaint with ANY of them. BUY THIS CD! Enya fans--don't miss out! This is right up your alley. Of course that goes for everyone--unless you're a total clod, you will LOVE this music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasant and soothing","review":"I like the album, but I would prefer more traditional Irish music. Their style is more synthesized or augmented than acoustical. Still, it's a good string of music. I play it and their first album frequently at home, b/c my wife used them to help her relax while in labor with each of our two children."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK, But Not Wonderful","review":"I bought this CD based on the recommendation of the reviews. Although I'd never heard this group before I was anticipating something really special and wonderful, but I find it very derivative and not original. I would suggest to anyone interested in buying this CD to try and borrow a copy and listen to it first. You might love it, you might find it so-so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Done","review":"A really well thought out and well played album. If you like anything from light classical, soft jazz, or traditional celtic, you'll like this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Peaceful and provocative","review":"On a par with their first album, it has to be a tie. It is like a cross between classical music, haunting celtic melodies, and some tune that you would swear that you have heard before but can't remember when. I find that many of their songs seem to take me to a place in time I have never been and stir something that I can not place - like a dream forgotten upon waking."},{"rating":"1","title":"You'd better like fiddles","review":"Sadly, I purchased this CD without the aid of a sound card, but after reading reviews on the Amazon.com web page. While I don't dislike fiddles, a little goes a long way. This CD is virtually all fiddle music. I no longer own this CD and won't purchase any CD again without the benefit of listening to a sample first."},{"rating":"1","title":"yeccchh, p-tui","review":"You know, I bought this because it was recommended by Amazon because I've bought (and liked) Loreena McKennitt albums, but this was just awful.There are one or two cuts that are kinda New Age-y and the rest of the album is schlocky violin music that's more like Mantovani than McKennitt.I realize most New Age music skates a fine line between \\"muzak\\" and music anyway, but this album falls on the wrong side of the line."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great music to work by","review":"This is my first CD by Secret Garden. I actually bought it a year ago, and I listen to it all the time, still! I work with computers, and I use this CD to keep me calm when the coding gets frustrating. It's very relaxing and helps me keep my focus (there are no vocals on this CD). My favorite tracks are Steps and Moving. I find myself humming them all the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"I lose myself in the mystical land of green!","review":"When I first heard, Secret Garden, I was taken to a land where the mist surrounds the body in a cloak of forever. Music that moves from the lilt of the voice of violins to the harp's memory of the ages. A garden of lush music that captivates as it lifts and transports one to the edge of dream, a peace not found in life but in the mystical."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Secret Garden","review":"Of the 4 Secret Garden CD's I have, White Stones is by far the best. It was a hard choice between White Stones and Songs from a Secret Garden, their first album. Both are exceptional with hauntingly beautiful melodies. But I still pick White Stones as their best. Was disappointed with Dawn of a New Century, and their newest album Dreamcatcher doesn't have enough new music, most of it is from \\"Stones\\" and \\"Song\\" albums, which I already have. If you want beautiful, haunting, melancholy music, get White Stones and Songs from a Secret Garden."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best possible Secret Garden playlist/CD","review":"Rather than reviewing any single album, I'd rather learn/know which 2 or 3 CD's of a group I should buy, to compile the best possible collection in a playlist or CD. For Secret Garden, the answer is clear: Dawn of a New Century, and White Stones.From DONC, I included Prayer, Drremcatcher, Moongate, Sona, Evensong (a version I custom-edited, using the Audacity software), In Our Tears, Aquarell, and Aria, in that order. I followed that with, from the WS album, Hymn to Hope, First Day of Spring, Passacaglia, Sanctuary, Home, Illumination, and Celebration.The combination is one of the finest CD's/playlist I have ever found, heard, or created. It's the perfect romantic gift. My wife and I both love it, and friends we've shared it with also love it. It's absolutely perfect for making dinner together (or with the kids), listening to while working, a hot tub session, and bedtime. I simply can't praise it more highly than that. But you'll need both albums ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing can touch your soul the way this music does.","review":"Absolutely beautiful.

I have them all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hauntingly Introspective...","review":"The melodical themes invoke powerful emotions within the listener's psyche. Inner visions evoked are very emotional, almost a \\"sound tract\\" for the listener's private \\"video clips\\". I would strongly recommend this CD to all."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best ever!","review":"I've been a fan of new age music for quite some time, but the secret takes it to a whole new level I hope the new album comes out soon. This will surely be my gift of the year for my family and friends. Secret was a GREAT recommendation from a good friend. Thanks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Immediately moving in a sombre, yet classy way","review":"Secret Garden is in my enduring \\"to keep\\" category, surviving several prunes as I run out of storage (with three towers).The music tiptoes into Irish territory, without being to easily type-cast. It is ambient, without being boring, a touch moody yet not saddening."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read!!!","review":"Very impressive first book! The threat of terrorism on American soil is dealt with in a manner reminiscent of Tom Clancy. In equal parts exciting, entertaining, and thought-provoking, Threat Level: Severe was a fast favorite. I look forward to future novels by this author!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great quality pics, poor quality printer","review":"If you look at the reviews, you'll notice a Jekyll and Hyde trend in the reviews. Most everyone likes the prints when the printer works. I truly hope Kodak steps up their quality control program. I too am one of those consumers that likes the printer, but darned if I can get it to work. I bet you I have only made a dozen prints and this thing has been a paperweight ever since. Darn those people from Kodak. If you disregard these negative reviews, BUYER BEWARE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"STAY AWAY - Pictures are great - paper feeder works 2% of the time","review":"Absolutly the worst engineered paper feeder of all time. The frustration far exceeds the nice pictures. \\"Easy\\"share? You've got to be kidding. That is the LAST thing this printer dock is. Stay FAR away from this one. This one worked for 22 pictures, then would no longer pull in paper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally Pleased. First rate photo's at home, smae price or less.","review":"Totally Pleased.

Kodak's easy share printer dock is an excellent value."},{"rating":"1","title":"AGGRAVATING","review":"This is a wonderful item IF or WHEN it works. It prints the pictures beautifully IF it works. The trouble is that after using it for a little while (and I mean a little while) It will quit feeding the paper in and the lights start blinking saying that you are out of paper and that you are out of ink. I have messed with it and messed with it, for some of you who have the same problems sometimes cleaning the feeder roller with rubbing alcohol will get it to work but this doesn't work all the time. Right now my printer won't work and I cleaned the roller and it is very aggravating as the paper and ink aren't cheap. I think it is cheaper going down to WalMart and using their instant photo machine. This is not worth the money or the aggravation!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Flaky paper handling","review":"I got this printer, together with the Kodak Easyshare C340 camera.When the printer works, the pictures are beautiful.But the printer has a serious paper handling problem.first, every single sheet of paper must be pushed in, it will not pick up the paper on its own.After you push the paper in, it will either jam, because it pulled several sheets or will report that is a paper jam, just because the sensors didn't detect the paper size.Sadly, I also got plenty of paper and ink cartridges for this, that I must keep using it. When they run out, this printer will either go to a new owner or the garbage.Kodak email support is great. Very prompt responses.The support for other operating systems is nonexistent. No support for Windows XP 64 bit edition.I'm now looking at the photo printers offerings from Epson.Hope this helps."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked great for a little while","review":"My husband purchased this for me last Christmas along withthe camera. It worked great for a little while. I used it every so often, maybe I printed a total of 60 photos in the one year that I had it. One problem I have always experienced is that the printer cartridge runs out long before the paper. You cannot buy the cartridged separately so this has been very frustrating...I am left with loads of expensive paper and no cartridged.Then, I go to print a photo last month and the printer is only printing 1/2 the photo. I had to send the item back to Kodak only to find out they want $80.00 for the repair. I told them to throw it out. What a waste....I wish I my husband had never purchased it."},{"rating":"1","title":"J Matheson","review":"The Kodak Easyshare printer dock worked okay at first. Then I started having problems with automatic paper feed and jamming. The problems got increasingly worse and I would waste more and more time trying to hand feed paper into printer and most times it would Jam. Paper and ink would be wasted. I am currently looking for an alternate printer dock for my digital camera"},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL!","review":"A terrible printer. Quality is okay, but after only a few uses the paper would not feed. I was able to continue using it by carefully feeding the paper one sheet at a time. After a short while and only a dozen or so prints, the printer would display \\"paper jam\\" nearly every other time, which was a royal pain since you have to unplug for 5 seconds and then start everything over. I am now ready to throw it away. I would not waste my money on another Kodak printer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kodak Easy Share 3 just landed in the Dumpster","review":"After many years of frustration and hundreds of dollars in repair bills I just breathed a sigh of relief by throwing it in the dumster.Each time after a month or so of non use, the paper feed would not work. After calling Kodak they said send it in and was charged $80's, they sent me a refurbished model which worked great for a couple of months and once again the paper feed stopped working so again I sent it back to Kodak and another $80's, I think they sent me another refubished model, anway just now it would only print the top third of the picture so after getting mad at it for the very last time it was thrown in the trash, I wish I would have done this sooner.3 printers all failed. Has anyone found a good alternative?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Little wonder!","review":"The printer dock series 3 is a wonderful little device. It's so easy to use. It charges my camera, downloads my pics to my computer, and produces quick pics. My first one broke after several years. I purchased another one \\"used,\\" and now I'm back in business. One of its best features is that most easy share cameras can access this machine with a simple change of an adapter plate. So if you update your easy share camera, you can still use the printer. Just wonderful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easy Share camera dock and printer","review":"This product was very long in getting here and was not as advertised (in good condition). The paper tray would not send paper through the dock, it was scratched and look like it was very will used. I had to take it to a repair person, who used most of it for parts on another dock. So I can only say that it became a very expensive thing. I was not happy with it at all, except that I did get a working dock by combining it with another dock."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jams and misfeeds make this totally unacceptable","review":"As other reviewers have stated, when it works the pictures are of very nice quality. Unfortunately, the misfeeds and jams started after printing a small number of pictures (20 at most) and have gotten worse and worse until it's totally useless. Do NOT buy this piece of junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad follow up quick shipment","review":"when the product didnt work with the home computer after the sale they did not even respond to an email trying to figure out what to do. the product was shipped quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major source of aggravation!!","review":"This printer is incredibly frustrating to use! I had an earlier version that worked better until it jammed and then broke. This one is terrible - it either doesn't pick up the paper so it thinks it's out of paper, or it jams, or there's some other error. It is a piece of junk. When it does work correctly (and this is after 1 1/2 hours of messing with it), the pictures are beautiful. However, the ink and the paper are not designed well enough to work together despite Kodak's claims -- I always run out of ink before I run out of paper, and you can't purchase just the ink without the paper.Overall, I have to say that few things aggravate me as much as this printer. The reason I'm giving it 2 stars instead of 2 is because when it works, it works great. But it's such a piece of crap that it rarely works. I wouldn't give this printer to my worst enemy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally Satisfied","review":"My Kodak EasyShare Printer Dock stopped working, so I was in the market to purchase a replacement. Since my Kodak digital camera & printer dock are both discontinued models Amazon was my only option. I wanted to know the cost & condition of the printer dock before I made the purchase. As I reviewed the available products the cost of the one that I finally purchased caught my eye. I made the purchase & within a few days the product arrived at my home. I was surprised to se that a printer cartridge was still installed in the printer dock, so I immediately printed a picture to see if everything worked, the picture printed out crystal clear. The printed dock also came with extra high quality nphoto paper, again I'm totally pleased with this purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Convenience","review":"This product gives me a convenient chance to edit, modify, and control the type and number of photos I can personally make here at home.It is a shame that Kodak elected to discontinue this product,but, thru the vast informational sources available on Amamzon.com,I was able to find a source at the \\"CameraGuy Store\\" and the received item was even better that I had expected.I believe that the evaluation of the advertisers on \\"Amazon.com\\" contributed to this outcome."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kodak Easy Share Printer Dock Series 3","review":"I've had my printer dock for about 4 years and the only reason I keep it is because it also charges the battery to the camera. My main problem is 9 times out of 10, the printer jams or misfeeds. I just tried the rubbing alcohol on the paper roller and it was able to grab the paper. Also, the picture doesn't print out immediately, it pulls the picture back and forth through the paper feed to add each additional layer of color so this constant use of the paper feed may also be the reason for the paper jams. The picture quality is good but I've just reverted back to uploading my pictures and having them printed at local store. This product is not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"It was very easy to load the printer cartridge and attach my camera to the dock.The pictures I printed had yellow lines.I followed all the suggestions in the guide and called Kodak customer service and the solution was to send it in to be serviced.So I never got to use the product. This was a birthday present so we were doubly disappointed.I recently purchased the G600 printer dock and was very pleased. The pictures are sharp and clear as getting them printed professionally."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Gimmick Than Tool","review":"We thought it would be cool to have a widget that both downloaded our photos to the computer and printed high-quality prints. Turns out we almost never use the printer... which has been annoyingly glitchy since we first set it up and tried it out.Recommend that owners of Kodaks stay with the plain vanilla dock included with their camera, and acquire one of the inexpensive, widely available multifunction photo-printers for their computer setup. One of those will print your documents as well as your photos, and at the moment they are dirt cheap too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easy Share . . . NOT","review":"The quality of the pictures are nice WHEN they will actually print. Unless you use the printer with your camera ON the dock it is incredibly hard to get the darn thing to work. If you decide to crop the picture on your PC and then want to print it be prepared to invest time in getting the darn thing to work! I have had it for sometime now and I have never been more irritated than when it comes time to print pictures on this thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hunk o Junk","review":"Don't bother with this printer. It rarely feeds the paper through correctly, it rarely even recognises that there is actually paper in the feeder, it says that the ink cartridge is low when in reality it probably isn't.I could go on and on.Just. Don't. Bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most aggravating device I've ever used","review":"This printer produces beautiful pictures, (when it works), I liked the idea of not using ink cartridges, you know in advance how many pictures you will be able to print. After a little while; and I mean a very little, like 3 months; it started having problems puling the paper, it will either just jam or say that the ink needed to be replaced.

The color register is off so my prints look like they were for 3-d glasses.

All of season one and the pilot is included! No fancy extras or animated menu screens, but who cares, you get DUE SOUTH ON DVD!! You can select an episode and a scene within that episode, and that's about it. My only complaint is that the visual and sound quality were lacking at times.

If the other seasons (when they're released) are of the same quality, I'll be happy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful dvd cases","review":"I love Due South, but presentation of these dvds is quite simply below par. The dvds are doublesides, which makes them extra vulnerable to damage, which is all too frequent considering the dvd case they come in. The three dvds overlap each in a case, which refuses to let go of the dvds in question. Detaching the dvds from the case can only be achieved by causing cracks on the dvd. If you buy this season, as Due South fans inevitably will, do not keep the dvds in these case. Use separate jewel cases for them."},{"rating":"2","title":"First season of my favorite show ever.","review":"\\"Due South\\" was a classic! The first season, with RCMP Constable Benton Frasier, (accompanied by his deaf wolf, Diefenbaker) totally removed from his Yukon roots, and dealing with his friend and reluctant partner, Chicago Detective Ray Vecchio was absolutely classic. Some of the best scenes, though, take place in Ray's precinct squad room, where his harried Lieutenant Welsh (Canadian actor Beau Starr) was always trying to figure out, \\"just how does the mountie figure into this?\\"Great, great show.

The story of a Mountie and his wolf teaming up with a Chicago detective makes a really interesting story that works. Paul Gross is definitely the right choice to play the lead in this series and Benton Fraser. Some stories are funny and others are touchingly emotional. Even now, this series hasn't aged one bit and it is a shame that it is never talked about much here in the US. Great episodes are in this season, but the DVD is lacking when it comes to content and picture. No special features are to be found on this DVD and the picture quality isn't the best, with streaks appearing for a couple of seconds in about three episodes, but most of the time it is great. But with those small flaws, the episodes are so great, all of the mistakes with the American DVD can be forgiven.

I ordered a new one, a Marsona 1288A, and discovered that it was notperfect like my old one. I can hear the 'looping', and my ears cannot filter out that sound.Not effective for those of us with sensitive hearing.

I don't notice the problem with looping mentioned by others. There are ~8 overlay sounds which can be combined with the background noise- mainly various birds. Several of the bird sounds are a little unpleasant; when I first heard the owl I thought one of my kids was hurt.My main gripe with this product is that when you keep it close by, there is a clear static background hiss at most volumes which becomes very annoying. I think if you were to keep it tucked further away into a corner that would not be an issue.Thinking about it now, this device really doesn't do anything that a couple of $15 nature CDs can't do, & the CDs would likely have better sound quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good night's sleep is worth a lot!","review":"We didn't really want to spend this much, but my husband and I have difficulty agreeing on what sounds we both want to hear.

The consistency masks his once in awhile snoring, the creak in the door as he opens it early in the am, and his occasional restlessness -- and vice versa (only I don't snore). The best part is the good night's sleep we both receive. If only one of us goes out of town, who gets the machine!?

It can also provide soothing background nature sounds for the daytime. I sleep like a rock with it and take it with me on trips. It is a bit bulky but very light.

Almost nobody. They have nothing to do with boyz-bands and I am sure Hanson will make some experimentations on their next album because they learned a lot of things in 2 years.

Admittedly, the fact that they initially had any popularity at all can be attributed to the fact that prepubescent girls made them popular. However, once Hanson were in the spotlight, at least the rest of us could have a chance to see what all these preteens were going crazy over. It turns out that actual talent lurked beneath those adorable looks, and if you don't believe me, just listen to any song off this album.

Pure pop pablum, regurgitated without a hint of creativity, this CD might best have been marketed for pre-teens. Along with the Backstreet Boys and Spice Girl media blitzes of the mid-90s, MIDDLE OF NOWHERE marks a low water mark for Western Civilization."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please, please no","review":"This just goes to show, in general, how easy and pointless it is to make pop music these days. Packaged, fake, sugary music without a modicum of talent or thought. Another horrible, horrifying, horror-inducing element of music that has been inflicted on the public by pre-adolescent girls. The thought that musicians who spend their lives working on and studying music will never get as much attention as these kids' cute little barbershop trio sickens me. I'll restrain myself before I have a heart attack, but I think you get the idea. If you buy this album, you are directly contributing to the dumbing-down of this country."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why????????????","review":"Why would anyone waste their money on such ....!

On, \\"I Will Come To You,\\" the middle one (also the gayest one) sounds like someone is giving it to him up the tailpipe. Just like all bubblegum crap, these guys went byebye a long time ago.

Unfortunately, their music is not so cute. In fact, it's hideous. Granted, for such a young band, their music is polished, but it nonetheless sounds exactly like what it is--the creation of three pre-pubescent boys from the midwest. The mature listener cannot relate to the schmaltzy lyrics, and the catchy tunes become more irritating than musical after the first listen. Sorry all you Hanson fans--I give this one a big thumbs down."},{"rating":"1","title":"This CD is one of the worst.","review":"In buying this CD I thought it would be a wise investment.

Hansons major record label debut reminds me of the golden age of bands like Alvin and The Chipmunks or the ever popular Barbie and the Rockers. After thinking about it, I guess the immaturity that Hanson's music reflects can be expected from the teens and pre-teens that the band consists of. This cd is perfect proof that a record company should wait until someones is at least out of high school before they give them a contract."},{"rating":"1","title":"MMM Bop - MMM No Way","review":"For the exception of Taylor, no of this band can actually sing. The singles are all head wreckers especially - MMM Bop, Where's The Love & Weird. I will come to you is an okay song, but the rest are pretty much the same, ie. Crap. The only reason why people should have this album is if they won it. Don't waste your money"},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT TALENT?","review":"After being surprised on how successful Hanson actually became to be after their first single \\"MMmbop\\" I visited a \\"Blockbuster\\" music and listened to their whole cd. I'm sorry but their music is completely unoriginal and dreadfully uninspired. They do happen to have decent lyrics though i think they had a lot of help from the army of studio musicians that helped them out with this album. They do possess some talent, however, that can be said of hundreds of thousands of other kids in the United States and around the world."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK","review":"I THINK THIS CD IS NOT VERY GOOD.

It was okay, but I'm not really that impressed with it. Sure they write SOME of their songs, but it's going to take a little more than that and a happy beat to win me over. I personally think that they should stop performing right now. No one important considers them to be serious artists anyway. Maybe they should come back in 15 years and try again. Right now they are just three more boys for you screaming twelve-year-olds to obsess over. As for the album, once again, it was okay."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Archies for the 90s","review":"Just to see what the fuss was about, I got a copy of this. Utterly inoffensive, bland, bubble-gum. No big deal. Their millions of fans will come to their senses at the onset of puberty.

Their catchy tunes stick to you like a bad habit. They are just songs you don't care for. What does he say? Mmmbop, I need a tampon? They are totally unoriginal and almost any teenager could come up with better tunes. Why Hanson became so popular is a mystery. I truly hope they cease to put out albums and just stick to picking up 9-year old girls. Whenever any girl over the age of 15 is asked what they think about Hanson, they always say that they are cute in a little boy sort of way, which makes me laugh every time. Who ever buys this CD deserves to be put in front of a firing squad. Don't get me wrong. I've tried to accept Middle of Nowhere because I listen to everything from Frank Sinatra to Nine Inch Nails to Miles Davis to Busta Rhymes and Middle of Nowhere should really to be thrown...to the middle of nowhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hanson is overrated","review":"Yes, the Hanson brothers might be talented and able to produce things that are called \\"songs\\" but they lack depth and experience. I find their songs to be shallow and lacking any real substance at all.

Don't expect Hanson to be around for the long haul."},{"rating":"1","title":"middle of nowhere is a terrible cd","review":"i have listened to this cd and i just can't seem to get why anyone likes it. this music is just too happy and lame to me. mmmmbop doowap. not very good lyrics to me. i dont see where these kids have any talent.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could be good--if they actually could SING!!","review":"Granted, the three brothers (or is it sisters) of Hanson may write their own lyrics (as trite and terrible as they may be) and attempt to play their own instrutments (very poorly--that's why it's considered to be a mere attempt), but the boys (or girls) have the absolute whiniest voices in the music business. Every time one of the girls opens their mouth, a high pitched whine comes out, and it sounds as if someone was scraping their nails across the blackboard. This album was dubbed as the mark for the \\"bubble-gum\\" pop music come back, yet if all the \\"bubble-gum\\" pop music sounds as terrible as this, the \\"bubble-gum\\" music will be a very short, passing fad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Just A Kid's Band","review":"I bought this CD for my 10-year-old niece and after listening to it with her, ended up liking these guys. Their songs are catchy, upbeat and infused with a lot of '50s and '60s influences, and their playing is quite accomplished. Because they are so young, play upbeat pop, and have their faces constantly plastered on every teen 'zine around, this sort of band is always dismissed as a passing kids' fad -- pre-teen heartthrobs with pretty faces and nothing more. Well, it ain't true. These kids know how to make good music. And so far, they seem completely unaffected by the trappings of success, and remain very personable and likeable in interviews. Hey, celebrities that kids can actually look up to! What a concept!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It is gggooooooddd!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This is a really good CD!!

Next is the #1 smash single MMMBop. Weird ,another big hit, is followed by the upbeat Speechless. Then comes another hit Where's the Love followed by the mysterious Yearbook and keyboard Look at You. Next is Zac's Lucy followed by I Will Come to You. The disc ends with A Minute Without You, Madeline, With You in Your Dreams, and Man From Milwaukee.

It's unique and anyone can see that Hanson has talent. To rock fans they are a \\"guilty pleasure.\\" You hate everything pop, but can't help but admit Hanson has talent. The Hanson c.d.'s are the only pop c.d.'s I own since I am fan of rock, but I just think it's cool I can like both. Anyway if you haven't given this c.d. a try you should. The songs are full of meaning even if you aren't twelve. I'm 17 and they still hold meaning for me. They talk about life situations that aren't so dark and depressing. Some rock is rather depressing and it's nice to get a breath of fresh air and listen to Hanson. They just make you feel good. This c.d. is definitly worth being remembered."},{"rating":"2","title":"These guys are not teenyboppers!","review":"For anyone who thinks Hanson was just a short phase, listen to some of their music. Could the Backstreet Boys have written something like \\"Yearbook\\" or \\"With you in your dreams?\\" I don't think so! These guys are great songwriters, singers, and musicians, and I like how they do so many different kinds of music. Some songs, like \\"MMMBop make you want to get up and move, while others, like \\"I will come to you\\" are slower, with strong melodies.I sure am glad that I have this tape, and I can't wait to hear some new songs from Zac, Taylor, and Isaac."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Music","review":"This CD is a great CD, even if you're not a Hanson fan. Yes, it sounds a little young, but think of the ages of the people who wrote it! FOr an eleven year old, a fourteen year old, and a sixteen year old, this is not bad at all! And even for a group like the Backstreet Boys, it would be about average. When I listen to the CD, it reminds me that music can be fun. It doesn't have to be sad or angry. It can be happy and lighthearted. The one song on this CD that gets me every time is the one they wrote for their dying grandmother. It is not in the least overdone or sappy. This Cd also proves that kids can do almost whatever they want, if they put their mind to it. It reminds adults that not all teens are awful people. Even if you aren;t twelve years old, MIddle of Nowhere is worth your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Man, I Hope No One I Know Is Reading This! :)","review":"I used to always listen to this CD until about 2 years after it came out when I decided it was time to listen to CD's by artists other than Hanson, Aqua, Vitamin C, and the Spice Girls. There isn't a song on this CD that I don't like. They are all really good. Sure, some are better than others, but they all hold on to you. My favorites are Thinking Of You, MMMBop (obviously), Speechless, and I Will Come To You. This CD is what the late 90s was all about! Now a days, the music business is at a major low point, and a gem like this is hard to find. Since the music business is in a slump, I have taken to listening to CDs (like this) and around the time this came out, when for me the music business was at it's highest. This CD is HIGHLY recommended to anyone! Also check out Hanson's \\"3 Car Garage, The Indie Recordings...\\" it's also really good. ENJOY!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best ever","review":"This is the best CD I have ever heard. Everyone should give MON and Hanson a chance.

These three hellions from Oklahoma are at their brutal best here.If your into BRUTALY HEAVY metal,this is the album for you!It's like Venom-meets-Slayer meets-Morbid Angel,with a little bit of Max Cavalera-era Sepultura and Pantera thrown in for good messure,but MUCH heavier.It has everything a metal fan could ever want:roaring vocals,speed-demon guitar riffs,ear-shattering solos,and vicious double-bass drum blastbeat fury! Can a band be too heavy? You be the judge.In closing,if your ready for the heaviest album ever made,buy Hanson's \\"Middle of Nowhere\\" right now!One warning though...if you have sensitive ears,avoid it like the plague!And if you decide to catch Hanson live,bring a helmet,because those mosh pits get EXTREMELY rowdy! -Happy Headbanging-"},{"rating":"2","title":"girly for sure, but they have talent","review":"Hanson is the type of band that gets made fun of for their look abd style. Sure, I can understand why, but listen to their music for a second. It isn't half bad. The first time i saw them (the same as every 9 year old boy) I thought were kinda cute girls. Leaving that aside, they made good music. They wrote it all as well. The lyrics, of course, are nothing special, but when this album came out, they were kids. After you get past the whole look of them and start listening to some of the music, you'll see what I mean"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not horrible...","review":"People like to bash Hanson just because they were young and groomed and had a record deal. While they probably WERE signed to be a gimmick, they did have reasonable talent. While their songs aren't driven by the instruments, they still play and they deserve some credit for that, even if their songs are still 1/2 synthesizers. They also write all their songs, so those 2 facts alone should warrant them some respect. Now the music sounds like a 90's version of the Jackson 5, which could either be good or bad depending on your taste. I never would put these guys in the same category as BSB or Nsync as far as 90's boybands go. This is just power pop, but its not THAT bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Once good, Always good","review":"This album is awesome. Completley inspirational. Could you imagine being the ages that hanson were (11, 13, 15) when they wrote, played, sang and put together this ablum, and producing something that great? They were enen younger when they started. If anyone of you would just sit down and truely listen to it, you would love it too."},{"rating":"1","title":"A review from Mr. Entertainment Lover","review":"Don't get me wrong. I'm sure Hanson are very nice kids but their music isn't that great. It's like that other sappy bubble-gum music. Such songs as Where's the Love and MMBop can give you a headache. However if you like bubble-gum you should get it. If not, don't."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disgrace to the music industry","review":"This CD is (politely put) garbage.There is nothing more to be said. i'm a guitarist myself, and after being able to pick up most of their songs by ear in about 10 minutes, I have ome ot the conlusion that they are talentless musicians, especially the guitarist. He should listen to John Petrucci, or Steve Vai. Then he'll realize just how crappy a player he is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great debut from an amazing band","review":"Don't believe those who will say that Hanson has no talent. One listen to 'Middle of Nowhere' and you'll realize that the guys actually do possess a great deal of it!Musically, this album rocks while not quite fitting into the rock genre. In other words: it kicks!Proving that they've got true substance in their writing, 'Middle of Nowhere' showcases Hanson embracing such reality subjects as lasting friendship (as witnessed on 'MMMBop'), death (the emotionally-charged 'With You In Your Dreams'), loyalty and devotion ('I Will Come To You'), and recognition of having been betrayed (the confrontational 'Speechless'). They also display their light sides (on the quirky 'Man From Milwaukee' and upbeat 'Look At You'), making it impossible for the listener to keep from smiling.Fun, danceable music, and well written, thought provoking, and uplifting lyrics... Put this one in your cd player and watch the positive affect!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hanson Rocks, And So Does Their C.D!","review":"Looking for an awesome c.d that both kids, and adults will love? You've found it! The musical trio, Hanson, (Ike, Tay, and Zac), add new meaning to music on this C.D! Starting with their song, Thinkin' Of You, and ending with Man From Milwaukee, this c.d rocks the whole way through! Not only does it have its up-beat songs, it also has its slow, sensitive songs too! Tay's vocals add a lot to this c.d, and Ike and Zac's backgrounds make it a favorite of mine! Try It! You Wont Regret it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A blast from the past.","review":"I was in junior high when MMMbop came out and like everyone else I thought these three brothers were girls. That damn catchy tune was stuck in my brain for a good six months in 1997. Even though I haven't kept up with their music since, Hanson's debut album Middle of Nowhere was a fun and decent pop album for its time. Songs like Where's The Love?, I Will Come To You, Lucy, With You In Your Dreams, Weird, and Madeline are standouts. Taylor Hanson's vocals are good and even Zac sings on the puppy love track, Lucy. Ah those were the days when kiddie pop ruled the world!"},{"rating":"2","title":"decent bubblegum","review":"I'm not familiar with anything Hanson has released recently, but back in the day I distinctly remember when Hanson hit the big time, and a couple of their big hits flooded the airwaves. The radio used to play those few songs over and over but, truth be told, I liked those songs, and I *still* like them.My friends never liked the band in high school because they weren't cool (my friends, I mean) but when you realize the music of Hanson is just friendly bubblegum pop with a few adolescent ballads throughout the Middle of Nowhere album, you really can't ask for anything more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where's the love these days?","review":"Middle of Nowhere is a classic. I don't see how people can overlook this album. Maybe it's because Hanson has fizzled out since the end of '97 after their wonderful \\"Snowed In\\" album was released, but that's no reason to forget about this amazing debut. 1997 was perhaps the last great year in music. Compare MON to anything any other band releases, and you'll see that music these days is falling by the wayside.

I had seen Hanson's picture in a magazine next to my teen idol of the time, and I just caught myself staring at their picture instead. When I heard \\"Mmmbop\\" on the radio for the first time, I recorded it onto a tape which I later took with me to a camping trip out by a lake in the middle of nowhere (Ironic huh?). I played it non-stop and bought the cd the first chance I got and I haven't regretted it since. I have become the world's largest Hanson fan. I'd recommend this cd for anyone. It has a bit of a bubblegum pop flavor mixed in with some rock. Every song is different, and the really deep lyrics make you want to hear each song over and over. I think that every pop and rock fan should own this cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strange title...","review":"I find the title quite odd.

Let me start by saying that the only two decent members (Cuban Link and Triple Seis)left terror squad due to problems with Fat Hoe but if they were still a part of the group this album would still suck. It was destined to be garbage. Fat Hoe is a disgrace to the memory of Big Pun RIP and so is Remy Fartin. If Pun was alive he wouldve b---h slapped Fat Hoe and Remy into next week. Decent tracks: YEAH YEAH YEAH, BRING EM BACK AND LET THEM THINGS GO. Filler:Lean back(phenomenal beat, lame dance record), Take You Home, Terror Era(Remy Fartin biting Big Pun.

With Fat Joe included, they bring a story, more than you'd expect from a 5 star rap group (Sorry but DA Band was not a real rap group). The hot summer anthem \\"Lean Back\\" even had senior citizens pulling up there pants and doing the Roc-away. Second single \\"Take Me Home\\" is a catchy replica of Camron's \\"Horse & Carriage\\" type sound but much more sexually raw. Remy Martin is amongst the crew who has a great future ahead of her.

I like the majority of the songs but they really should have reconsidered using Remy Martin as there \\"First lady\\". I read an interview she did on a hip hop website and her attitude is horrible. I understand about being cocky but she is not all that to have such an attitude about her style of rap.I can tell Jay-Z was a big influence on the 1st track and probably some songs throughout (of course they would never admit it). All in all the CD is cool, but they should be a little more selective when it comes to adding new members to be on the front line like Remy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fat Rap","review":"Terror Squad seems like all the other rap performers who make MTV's top 10--they wear the usual uniform of baseball caps and oversized athletic jerseys with the expected overkill of jewelry.

Originally released in early 1975,this was the band's second record. I don't CARE what numerous young {er} whipper-snappers (age 18-30) say about this lp, 'Fly By Night' is a TRUE '70's progressive/album rock gem. Sure,most of the later day Rush releases are decent (some in fact,are great), but there is nothing(I repeat,NOTHING!) like Rush's first four albums. What I've always dug SO much about this CD reissue is that even though I'm a huge live album fan, I still like being able to check out the 'original' versions of tunes like the Canadian trio's classic rock opener, here \\"Anthem\\", the epic \\"By-Tor And The Snow Dog\\" (if this song doesn't make the hairs on your neck stand up, you should seriously listen to soft rock), \\"Making Memories\\",the title track \\"Fly By Night\\" and the somewhat dramatic \\"In The End\\". Highly recommended.

Form the word go, we can see the difference between him and previous drummer John Rutsey. Peart's skill is just overwhelming. BUt this is not enough to forget about the flaws in this album. It's plain boring, bad rock, it seem they are trying to copy everything and putting together in just one song. It's a really awful album.

The addition of Neil Peart raised the games of Alex Leifson and Geddy Lee. The arrangements are more intricate, Lee's bass is more active, and Leifson's guitar has more fire and complexity. Peart's drumming is aggressive and relentless, with a sheen of pure virtuosity that would separate him from most other rock drummers. The songs are somewhat schizophrenic, ranging from innovative musical templates for the prog-metal genre (\\"Anthem\\", \\"Beneath, Between, and Behind, and \\"By-Tor & The Snow Dog\\"), straight-ahead rockers (\\"Best I Can\\", \\"Making Memories\\", \\"Fly By Night\\"), and ballads (the unplugged-before-MTV-made-it-hip \\"Rivendell\\" and the epic \\"In The End\\").

Neil's drums sound awesome and it sounds almost like a whole new recording compared to the previous CD. Neil really shows that he is already the best drummer in rock and has been for a long time. The band really cut loose on this album and it shows with the aggressive playing. If you like this album and the first RUSH album then you need the remastered versions of these classic recordings.

Rest, Relaxation, New and Friendly people, good conversation, and fun activities are all my destiny. Thanks Chris!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Premature publication......","review":"Sorry but the latest edition is not really updated for 2004. The hotel is undergoing major renovations so the update is very premature. 2005 would have been better. Why the rush? A few new photos of the author and her sig/other and some small facts don't make the sale. We purchased the book at the hotel. Ifyou've been and got the first or second book, you're fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"An honest appraisal of this resort.","review":"Having been to Hedonism as many or more times than the author, I can safely say that the book gives a true picture of Hedo which is more than some other sources do. Naked Truth is reaally an appropriate title as the real truth is told. My hat [and duds] are off to Chris."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining as well as informative","review":"As a repeat guest of Hedonism II, I really did not need a \\"guide\\" to the resort. But I thought I'd read the book to see the resort from a different perspective. I found the book to be enlightening, accurate, funny and quite interesting. I would highly recommend this book to anyone that has been, or has ever thought of going to Jamaica."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing","review":"I really had no idea what this movie was about when my husband and I rented it. I wish I hadn't wasted my time. I really like Michael Douglas, but this movie is not worthy of his acting ability. He has made much better movies. I agree with all of the other reviewers who said this was boring. It was also depressing. Very hard to follow and keep up with what with all the bouncing back and forth between stories. I know that there is a drug problem out there, and I know there was probably supposed to be a hidden message. It was one of those movies where you have to really think about it. My husband made a comment about the movie that if he wanted to see that stuff all he has to do is watch the news. We watch movies to escape, not be reminded of all the depressing stuff in the world.Unless you like this kind of thing, I wouldn't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"An \\"R\\" rated after-school special","review":"This has got to be the most heavy-handed, patronizing film of all time. The performances of all the teenagers (especially the one who played the daughter) were cheesy and laughable. I was surrounded by snickers when I saw this in the theatre.Even more ridiculous is just how much people go on about the \\"realistic\\" portrayal of the drug problem. Realistic? Douglas just happens to become nation's drug czar at the same time that his daughter becomes a drug-obsessed, skid row prostitute--while maintaining \\"all A's\\" at her exclusive prep school. When her husband gets thrown in the can, Zeta-Jones transforms overnight from happy housewife to sangfroid assassin and drug queen. I'm sure we can all relate.If it weren't for that enlightening Orrin Hatch cameo, this would've been just another one-star wonder."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bored to death","review":"I enjoy almost all movie's, but this one was extremely hard to watch. What I was really thinking was what a waste of 3.00 to rent the movie. The movie had no plot and was boring, I watched half the movie and had to turn it off."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring, breaks no new ground","review":"Why are people so impressed with this? It could have been a movie of the week on NBC. \\"Haunted\\" by the characters? I don't think so. Thank goodness for fast foward. Script is nothing new or provacative. People apparently don't know what a good film is."},{"rating":"1","title":"hard to follow.","review":"I am not going to take the time to tell you what this was about. Basically because I have no clue myself. This movie was so freaking hard to follow. It was SO long. I guess I understand. The guy finally realized his family was more important than his job and drugs can have an effect on even the most unsuspecting families and pepole. But holy man make it like and hour and a half amd save me the time. Perhaps if I watch this again it will make more sense to me. This was a good movie I think. They just made it hard to follow. Going from one story to another. Over and over. Give it a try I guess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste your money!!","review":"This movie was the worst movie I have seen in quite some time. I expected much more with the great cast of charactors. During the entire movie, the scenes were jumping back and forth from one part of the world to another. The camera scenes were continually jerky and very destracting, along with poor color. The plot was the generic drug cartel theme with no real excitement or action. I alomost left the movie theater but I kept thinking the movie would improve. It did'nt!! It was a real dissapointment and waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"An entertaining movie...","review":"I have to say I was a little dissapointed with the movie because of all the hype, but is was still really good. It has a few different story line witch all kept my interst.I think everyone should check it out and rent it, but I wouldn't buy it, there is no reason for repeat viewings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Best Picture Nominee?","review":"Having heard that this should have been the Best Picture winner for 2000, I was extremely disappointed instead. The movie was long, dull and at times very predictable. However, the portions of the movie that featured Catherine Zeta Jones and Benicio Del Toro were decent. Benicio Del Toro's Oscar was well deserved. The Michael Douglas portion was right out of any bad 80's movie about the \\"horrors of drug abuse\\". Forget about best picture honors, how the heck did it even get nominated? As far as DVD's go, this was pathetic. Rent it for curiosity, but don't waste the money buying it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One thing missing for me...","review":"I'm not gonna waste your time recapping the story, telling you how great the film is. It's wonderful.I will say that the only thing missing for me was a director's commentary track. There's a \\"behind the scenes\\" section of the dvd, but that's not enough for me.I think-okay, KNOW, that Soderbergh is one of the most thoughtful and intuitive directors of our time. And for someone like me, who uses dvds as a film school of sorts, I found this greatly disappointing. It's a walk inside Soderbergh's brain that I didn't get to take...I would guess that sometime down the road, there's gonna be a Criterion re-release of this film on dvd, ala \\"Boogie Nights,\\" complete with supplemental material, and hopefully, a commentary."},{"rating":"2","title":"The More Things Change...","review":"This movie is more timely now than it was when it was written and filmed. Though the cartels have changed players and the violence has escalated, the resulting problems and emotional turmoil created by the conductive drug flow into the US has been captured poignantly in this film. If the drug dance and its related effects between Mexico & the US interest you, prepare to be fascinated for the next two-plus hours. So, yeah...you could say I liked it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"you got to be kidding me!","review":"This may be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The plot goes nowhere. There is no action per-say. The acting wasn't that great. I can't belive this film won 4 acadamy awards. Bottom line this film was realy bad!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The war on drugs?","review":"This movie is interesting in the way that it portrays the cross section of real life as opposed to what the government has been putting forth. While it is a timely subject given our ongoing efforts in the area I'm afraid the whole feel of it and the acting just did not work for me.Douglas does his usual good work and there are good performances by others but perhaps it's more just the way it was directed. It did not strike me as having a feel of authenticity, it was too obviously contrived. It strikes me as not being one of those movies that makes you want to get inside it and believe, it does not create the sort of empathy feeling one might have for a Tom Hanks in Saving Private Ryan (admittedly a tough comparison of course).Possibly worth a rental but with all the tens of thousands of titles out there I have to say I would not rate it terribly high. No serious political commentary, no memorable or outstanding theatrical element."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch at your own risk","review":"Technically, the film was well done. It did a good job of portraying the many facets of the drug problem. But I had come off a streak of seeing several films that left me saying - wow! - now that was a good film, and telling friends about it. THIS ONE WILL LEAVE YOU THINKING - THANK GOD I DIDN'T WATCH THIS WITH ANYONE. I WILL NOT RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE. I WILL HIDE IT FROM THE KIDS. If you want to go to bed depressed - this is your film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed.","review":"I was just not impressed with this film. Maybe if I saw it before all the hype I would not have been disapointed, but frankly, I just did not enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"can you say 'gloss'?","review":"soderberg is probably one of the most over rated directors working today. if you want to make a film with a 'documentary' feel why not get someone who knows how to shot it, like say i don't know a documentary filmaker? but that is not the point. this movie glosses over, and not very well, the issue and problem of drugs and politics. it presents it as a cute problem that needs to be nipped in the bud. pure ...! the only reason it gets 2 stars is because as always benecio del toro was very good and convincing. over all, highly over rated(i would venture to say the most over rated apart from gladiator-at least that was amusing). and would someone please be an honest and intelligent person and agree."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring!blah!blah!boriiiiiiiiiiiiing","review":"I fast forwared through most of this movie, I only rented it be-cause of all the hype. I enjoy most of the movies that I rent, but this one was so boring that I felt like I should've gotten my money back..!! The movie had to many plots, the color was hideous, and it dragged on forever,what a WASTE OF TIME."},{"rating":"1","title":"Azrael","review":"This has got to be one of the worst movies of all time not even good enough for the b-movie films of yesteryear. Don't waste your time and or money on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Traffic","review":"Perhaps we are the only people in the country who were dramatically disappointed in the hype regarding Traffic and all of the awards it received, but to our family we found it to be boring, tedious and uneventful. There are much better movies out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bored too","review":"I was shocked by the movie because it was so long and drawn out. There I was also amazed that it had won alot of awards. The movie went nowhere through out the beginning to the end. The characters weren't developed enough to understand them emotionally. The plot never thickened nor was there ever a climax(the part where you are on the edge of your seat) The only thing I was doing in my seat was dozing in and out of pure boredom!! I mean did the people giving out the awards actually watch the movie????? Or did they just see the list of stars?? I do not recommend this to anyone at all!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"You either love it or loathe it","review":"One of the few movies I ever walked out on (I eventually sat through it on the insistence of trusted friends), this film is somewhat polarizing. I found it to be trite, vapid, predictable, and nausiating with its jerky let's-cash-in-on-the-indy-craze handheld camerawork.If you loved this movie, I am happy for you that the greatest people producing DVDs is making it for you. But PLEASE rent it first or you may be one of the 10-20% of viewers who felt like they had just seen the wrong movie.(If it helps, my judgement is that THE LIMEY is the only good film Soderberg has made, and I would give it about 3-1/2 stars)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very real drug life","review":"I just watched this movie and was very moved by the story. The story is very close to real life of the \\"drug cartel\\" as well as the user and drug enforcerment. What I really liked about this movie is the honesty that is protrayed in all aspects of drugs itself. What the drug does for a person, how it comes in to this country and other countries, also how it is acquired by the user. The honesty includes those that are from the underprivilaged comunities to the \\"silver spoon\\" communities as well. Bravo to the writer and the director of this movie!!! I recommend this movie HIGHLY!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Two consistent mistakes troughout the movie","review":"This is a movie with starpower and sustance, but it commits the same mistakes with consistency troughout the movie. If you can look beyond them, great, some of us can't.mistake 1: the only cast member that does not produce the spanish language with a thick american accent was Salma Hayek. Everyone else, From Del Toro to the little characters is a Culprit of mangling the language into an East L.A. version of it.mistake 2: All scenes in cars in the Mexico side have all the actors \\"buckled up\\" when in Mexico the bucke up law just passed in 2008, In fact buckling up is considered for sissies by the macho military/policial culture.Thoper Grace's performance was a surprise, the kid did break out of his tv personna."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Real Traffic-Stopper","review":"I went to see this movie initially because of Michael Douglas, but it turned out to be his wife, Catherine Zeta-Jones that stuck out as a pregnant drug lord's wife, who'll do anything to get her husband out of jail. I instantly became a czj fan, and watched some other stuff of hers. Now I can really appreciate just how good an actress she is. She can play a farm girl, spy, action heroine, gypsy, villain, queen...and always pull it off. Not to mention in any time period. This was really the role of a lifetime for her; it's too bad Oscar snubbed her."},{"rating":"2","title":"This film got the new millennium off with a BANG!","review":"A highly melodramatic and involved story, coupled with flawless performances, makes \\"Traffic\\" one of the best films ever! Benicio Del Toro may have won the Oscar but Catherine Zeta-Jones is memorable as the housewife forced to take over her drug lord husband's (Steven Bauer) empire. Her transformation from the innocent and most pregnant spouse to \\"godmother\\" is stunning. She may have won this year for \\"Chicago\\" but she deserved one for Soderberg's triumph.The film's \\"look\\" is also one of its drawing cards. Filmed in documentary-style, it makes the viewer feel as if he/she is watching an episode of a reality series, as well as a motion picture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointingly Vacuous Disc","review":"I was really looking forward to a director's commentary (and maybe even deleted scenes) for this particular film, but apparently it's not to be. Bronkovich lacks likewise. He must really be busy on Ocean's Eleven. Soderbergh's comment track on Out of Sight is one of the most insightful and entertaining I've heard yet on DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST MOVIE EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This was the worst movie I have ever seen in my whole life! It had no plot, jumped around at a psychotic pace that no body can follow. The only people that could possibly like this movie is someone that has no attention span. Do not watch or buy this movie. Del Toro must of thought, hey I have a bad movie so I better put in a whole cast of star actors to make my bad movie good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Much Movement","review":"Traffic is an average movie which does not inspire enough interest to get out of that pigeon hole. It deals with many stories and they are all related on some way, obviously the director was watching some foreign films, for this is nothing new. Most of the stories are preposterous, take for example the wife of a drug dealer, in a few weeks she is talking to dangerous drug leaders in Mexico as if she knew what she was doing. Also, the drug czar wandering around in the ghettos of Baltimore, these scenes do not add up and as a result the film is mostly a compendium of utter boredom that drags on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy the DVD Version Instead","review":"I liked this movie. The cast was pretty good and the acting and story were also strong.The HD DVD sucks royally. The video quality is like a regular DVD. I saw this using an HDMI connection on a 1080 HDTV on which other HD DVDs have looked much better. High definition discs are still new and I expect it will take some time to improve the technology, but this movie is an exact replica of the DVD version.I bought this at Best Buy, on sale for almost the same price of the regular DVD. And it is definitely worth less than the regular DVD because I could at least watch a DVD on my blu-ray player when they become somewhat affordable in the distant future. This is why I like combo formats better than regular HD DVDs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Three separate stories...one seamless screenplay: TRAFFIC","review":"TRAFFIC is the film for lovers of the seamless screenplay brought to the screen with thought, care and professionalism of direction and acting.Three stories all separate and disconnected, but all beautifully bound together in the drug trafficking war.You will not know from one minute to the next wherethis is going to wind up.Highly recommended.CRASH is an excellent companion film as well as THE FRENCH CONNECTION."},{"rating":"2","title":"Remarkable","review":"Thought provoking, suspenseful, illuminating and candid. Actors love working for Steven Soderbergh and it shows. Each role was well developed and fully realized on screen. This movie is powerful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Movie Serials with a Twist","review":"This is a movie about the debatably successful war on drugs. It is made up of four story lines, presented like movie serials, which Steven Soderbergh does a great job in weaving together by the end of the film. As a result, the viewer sees how a police officer in Tijuana is linked to a young, female drug-user in suburban America.This film questions the war by pointing out that it is never-ending and is pervasive. The best line is where the drug czar, played my Michael Douglas, asks \\"How do we wage war against our families?\\" The movie is not saying that the war is completely futile, but it says that we should rethink our strategy.I would highly recommend seeing this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Traffic","review":"It's great movie, I guess it's of the best movies which I've ever seen about drugs. We can see again wonderful directing by Steven Soderbergh. I was really shocked from this super film."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you have not seen it, don't!Unless you love a documentary","review":"This show was way over rated by Critics and I'm very dissapointed after watching it. The show is so real that it is so flat. Basically watching some documentary flim is not my idea of a good picture or movie. The actors were great but this show just have not enough impact. All reviews you read should be really considered before you watch this show. Rent it if you must, but don't buy for the sake of people's review. I'm very sure that are people who hated this show after watching it and would agree that they were just as disappointed wasting your time on such a movie.No doubt they may win something for the movie awards but I give full thumbs down to this movie. I give my vote to Moulin Rouge."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hello, character development?","review":"What do you get when you add a lack of character development, a weak plot, bad acting, and a horrible editing job? Traffic. I don't even want to write about how bad this movie was, because I don't want to waste more of my life in addition to the two and a half hours a spent watching this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Traffic","review":"Do not be misled into believing this movie is action-packed, drug running, police bustin', shoot-em up kind of movie. This movie was the greatest let down I've seen this year. I pre-ordered this movie months ago and anticipated seeing it. Definitely do not waste your money on buying it. Rent it first if you just have to see it and save some money."},{"rating":"2","title":"C'est Fantastic!","review":"I thought this movie was incredible. It was so deep and powerful and just amazing. It's the kind of movie that leaves you thinking about it for days. The cast was awesome, I especially thought Topher Grace (Seth) did an excellent job. The different plots interwined beautifully and the hand-held camera work was the perfect touch. This is definitely one of my favorite movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Video is so jumpy that makes me dizzy","review":"I can never understand why professionals like jumpy shots and be so obsessed with it that they make movies using this amateur \\"technique\\", if you can even call it a technique. Hey, I did not need any trainings to be shooting jumpy videos shots that make everybody sick even when I was a kid.I tried watching this DVD more than two times but I could never go more then a few minutes before quitting. I became so dizzy, not just because of the unstable video shots, but also because they kept changing shooting angles and perspectives every second or two. I almost threw up.I actually bought this DVD nearly 10 years ago and hoping that I could one day watch it to the end after I could overcome this kind of motion sickness caused by their style of video shooing. But, I could never. I am finally giving up. Money wasted on this DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great movie on an important issue","review":"Michael Douglas has produced a great movie about the intricate world of drugs and the violence that it causes in all walks of life. [...] Drug law enforcement creates tremendous moral and ethical problems. Douglas has portrayed it brillinatly. Catherine Zeta Jones is as lovely as ever and acted very well. Douglas is a superb actor. It is a captivating movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"YOU NEED MORE STARS TO RATE THIS MOVIE","review":"why? cause is a masterpiece,this movie won 4 academy awards of 5 nominations.traffic also deserved the best picture oscar why? because:best director + best editing + best screenplay + best secondary actor = a best picture. i don't know how gladiator won the best picture and don't get me wrong i think that gladiator is a very very good movie but is not oustanding like traffic. (warning this movie is for people that likes movies with something that is missing nowdays........a plot)"},{"rating":"1","title":"huh?......","review":"one word, overrated. the only actor who i liked was don cheadle, i may be biased on that as well because he is incerdibly under-rated and is great in anything he does.obviously drugs are bad and there are things going on in life, that either we as a nation don't know, or just choose to ignore.check the original, british version for a better story, acting et cetera, et cetera."},{"rating":"1","title":"Traffic jam","review":"Please people, get over this movie. Just because the director uses a \\"neat\\" tint to the film and runs around with a hand cam does NOT a great picture make. Think of Godfather III, looked like a Godfather film, smelled like a Godfather film, but it was terrible. Don't be tricked into this ridiculously average film. I'll give you the fact that Benicio does his best to save this picuture (he is always great), but it's more than even he could overcome. First of all, some spoiled rich kid would not go to the \\"hood\\" to buy dope. They'd have some guy like James Spader's character in Less Than Zero to buy from. Also please explain how Ms Zeta-Jones goes from a naive tennis club wife to Don Corleone in a span of 2 minutes? Lastly, the speech between Michael Douglas and his daughters friend in the car almost tossed my red vines. Possibly the most overrated film of the last 10 years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Burt from netherlands has no idea what hit him","review":"Well there are people who enjoy good films. Then there are others who look for the action packed blockbusters. I personally enjoy movies with good writing, directing, and cinematography. Which Traffic contains all of. This is one of the most well put together films of all time, not to mention classics such as Citizen Kane. Don't mind the individuals who have no idea what a good movie is when it hits them.People need to realize a movie doesn't need to have action to make it good.Traffic is an outstanding movie, i suggest many people purchase it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Traffic","review":"This was one of the worst movies I have seen. Could not give a [care] if someone doing drugs, hiding the doing of, selling etc. The acting was good, but the movie was not anything of interest to me or my family.

The movies strongest attributes are its exceptional cast and moving story. Everyone is perfectly cast and there isn't an actor I would change. The brightest of all these bright stars are Michael Douglas, Benicio Del Toro (who won best supporting actor), and Don Cheadle. The story is told like Nashville and Magnolia. There are several mini stories that intertwine. I also loved the different colored lenses for each story. The DVD has superb picture and sound quality. If you're one of those people that likes a truck load of extras though, I suggest you wait for a special edition to be released. If not run to your local movie store and pick this baby up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"RED LIGHT!","review":"I loved it! I don't make a habit of purchasing DVDs unless i've seen the movie. Well, I've seen the movie... twice as a matter of fact. Michael Douglas is one of my favorite actors. There was drama, there was action, there was intrigue. What more could you ask for? If you're looking to add a good, and I mean good, movie to your collection, I'll say that you won't be dissapointed. This is one that you can put on for friends that have different tastes, but all will enjoy. Take the plunge."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought Provoking and Magical","review":"The movie offers a non-judgemental view about the drug war. It has mind-blowing cinematography, and an excellent cast. Benicio Del Toro (who won an Oscar for his role in this movie) is by far the sexiest man EVER, and a superb actor. He is like the icing on the cake for this spectacular movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too close for comfort","review":"This star-studded movie (with many cameo's from Washington's finest) was an outstanding rendition of a tried and tired theme...How do we win the drug war.

Then that man is tortured. Then he is tricked by an assassin. Finally, he ends up dying on his feet by two different murderers. It's bad enough that the gay Latino character has to be a villain, but he is gullible and subject at anytime to abuse as well. What does this say about the filmmakers' views on gay Latinos? We already know based upon \\"Basic Instinct\\" what Michael Douglas feels about lesbians. To top it off, the scene in which a black drug dealer prostitutes a white female high school student was racist and designed to scare the white fathers in the audience. I don't care if I get dismissed as PC, this movie was trash."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie","review":"Traffic is a movie about the reality od drugs, their trade, and other factors in between. I think the director has done a remarkable job setting tone and mood throughout the three storylines. he uses different colors and contrasts to depict a certain storyline and to help portray a particular feeling. For instance, he uses dark blue contrast in i think \\"chicago\\" where mike Douglass daughter has develepoed her drug habit.

I tried watching it a second time and still just kept boring me for some reason. It did remind me of say 'Crash' or 'Pulp Fiction' in how different stories try to interlock but kept getting lost in them.

At first, it seemed riveting and interesting but after a couple of hours, the only good parts were Benicio Del Toro's scenes. The story was boring and far-fetched and in my opinion, this was a hyped up bunch of hot-air. For example, I've never seen a government official break down at a press conference because his daughters on drugs. Come on! Don't insult our intelligence. And drugs being transported as fully constructed dolls made of cocaine! Hmmmm, what happens if someone sweats on one of the dolls? This movie wouldn't even fool a kid let alone an adult.

The version i bought is a \\"Criterion collection\\" with 2 discs special edition. But what the dealer mailed me was not just a single disc edition. But it also the illegal version!!!! the dealer printed the cover by himself and it doesn't fit the box at all.The disc inside the box wrote \\"disc 2\\". obviously the \\"Disc 1\\" is disappeared!!!! (I can provide photos to prove it)And in the delivery description dealer wrote was from UK. but finally it was mailed from Mexico. It made me need to pay extra 16 Pounds for the VAT and handling fee costs!!!!I definitely request to refund including the VAT fee.What an irresponsible dealer!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better than Gladiator.","review":"I don't place movie reviews here on Amazon, I usually stick to the music side of this site. But this movie immediatly prompted me to write a review on it. So when I rented this movie not expecting much in return, just something to fill my evening while the wife and kids were out of town. I was truely moved by the movie. Steven Soderbergh has now made two fantastic films in a row, and is truely a craftsman of films when it comes to all the junk that fills the screens these days.And what can I say about Benicio del Toro. I can't, his performance was brilliant to say the least. M.Doulglas, and C. Zeta-Jones acted just as well too. The un-sung hero in this movie is Ericka Christiansen, who plays Douglas' daughter. You could feel the pain that she was going through as an addict, and the turmoil that it put on her parents was very convincing.This movie was hands down the best of 2000."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the big deal?","review":"Just another movie about drugs; selling them, doing them, etc. (Yawn.) What's with all the hype? Don't believe it's a \\"must-see\\" just because the ads and the critics say so. They are both bought very easily. The cast is good but how much entertainment value is there in watching a father lose his daughter to drugs and then to prositution? We can see that for free on Jerry Springer. And we are supposed to care about people who are so absolutely stupid? This film, just like real life gives you no reason to care about people who choose to be morons. This film makes you wonder if the producers and writers themselves were high. People on drugs should enjoy it though. It will support their dillusion that they are cool and a rebel. Unfortunately because of this film's success we can expect a dozen carbon-copies within the year. Remember when movies used to be a good experience?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark, dreary and spot on.","review":"It was almost too strong for me. The truth can be very, very unpleasant and this movie is filled with plenty of truth. I kind of wish someone will turn it into a musical where the happy druggie kids rise up and teach the fascist DEA agents to relax and be happy. Ah, it will never happen, but we can dream. Isn't that what the cinema is all about?"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not a thriller..","review":"I rent this film because of the names, the 4 Oscars and the description as a thriller.It's a fair story but not a thriller!Furthermore, the part of judge Robert Wakefield (Michael Douglas)was not of any importance the way it was presented. To be more interesting, it should have been more developed, I think.I expected he would be more personal, more involved in the plot than just visiting the general in Mexico. And his daughter was addicted...so? He sent her to the group...so? The wife's part was completely absent and inactive as a mother...We could live without. The film itself is a drama. Not an action film or a thriller as we were presented by the trailers. Sorry, gyus!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This film is so over-rated","review":"This film is not complex or interesting.

This is junk!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A dull, drawn out movie","review":"This movie is only the second movie i have ever walked out on. there really isn't any plot. the scenes in mexico hurt your eyes because of the coloring. the show never ties anything together the only good thing about the show was Catherine Zeta-Jones. OVERRATED MOVIE OF THE YEAR!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring !","review":"Traffic is easily the least entertaining of the 5 best picture nominees in 2001 oscar and I am so pleased it didn't win the best picture. Why Steven Soderbergh won an oscar for this one instead of Erin Brockovich is beyond me. The story about DEA war against Tijuana drug cartel. The movie itself is boring and way too long (listed at 147 Mins). And for some reasons, the picture is presented in 3 different color setting for each plot line so Michael Douglas, Catherine Zeta Jones, and Benicio Del Torro all have 3 different colors. The DVD itself is OK. Picture is sharp and the Dolby Digital 5.1 is ok as most of this movie is dialogue anyway. If you have heard good things about this movie, it did win 4 oscars, rent this first before you buy as this is not as good as what the critics said."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"I watched this movie because of all the hype it got when it was in theaters. It ought to be called something like, \\"a day in the life of the drug trade.\\" There are a lot of characters, none of whom is really developed. The cast is apparently working as an ensemble, with no main plot and no main character; just a bunch of minor intersecting story lines. Partly as a result, no character and no plot was interesting or engaging. Also, the camerawork which showed scenes in D.C. under a blue filter and scenes in mexico under a yellow filter (so signify heat?) which i assume was supposed to be artsy, was mostly just irritating."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is your brain on drugs commercial","review":"Could be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. After paying to see this movie, I felt ripped off. This experience is like watching a 2 hour commercial. The movie left me feeling insulted and very disappointed. I have yet to meet anyone that saw this that actually liked it. Don't assume it is good just because of the hype and the actors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent DVD","review":"This was one of the best movies of 2000. Benecio Del Toro's performance was mesmerizing. Extremely good storytelling through melding of performances and editing. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE","review":"This movie was by far one of the WORST movies I've ever seen!! However if you can watch 5 movies at one time and keep up with each movie all at the same time then I suppose you'll like this movie. If you're like me and only care to watch one movie at a time then this movie is NOT for you! I found this movie confusing, boring, and horrible! I DO NOT recommend this movie to anyone. All of my friends agree that it was horrible and can not figure out what all of these people who say that it's going to be a classic are talking about!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sloppy narrative","review":"Three things: 1. If Catherine Zeta-Jones never knew about her husband's business, how did she get so good at running it so fast? 2. Whenever the film went to Mexico, why was everything pinkish-orange? 3. How did Michael Douglas leave the White House press room so easily without passing anybody?This film is terribly overrated. I can't believe it got the notices it did. The DVD is not unique in any way; typical stuff like behind the scenes and trailers. I would have liked commentary. (Even though I think if a film is made well enough, it doesn't have to be explained.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Barely tolerable","review":"I saw a sneakpeek of this one shortly before it came out, and wow, was I not able to predict the way it would be received. Soderbergh shows a surprisingly uneven hand with his storylines. Del Toro is good, but he's been (and will be, no doubt) much better. Michael Douglas is, surprise surprise, Michael Douglas. And Zeta-Jones is not as deft an actress as she is stunning. Sorry, but it's true. My main problem with the film, however, has to do with the overall approach. It reminds me of Natural Born Killers, in which Oliver Stone tried to make a point about how popular culture makes us numb to violence by making a movie equally numbing. Interesting point, but not an enjoyable film experience. Similarly, Traffic seems to address the \\"the drug problem is really complex and seemingly unresolvable\\" idea by making a movie as muddy and tangled as its topic."},{"rating":"1","title":"truly dreadful","review":"After all the hype I had expected far more. The sub plots of each of the stories were so poorly captured that they became meaningless. The \\"documentary\\" style failed miserably and even the ambitious photography failed to hold the Tijuana scenes together For me the only remotely interesting area was Michael Douglas' role as the Drug Watchdog who struggled to save his addicted daughter . Unfortunately even this story became muddled and failed to take advantage of a good opportunity give us real meat in the story. In another of the parallel stories, Miss Zeta Jones' souless acting added an additional burden to a story that lacked all credibility. Across the board, the few interesting plot elements were treated so sublty as to be lost. In summary this was a movie that lacked direction and took way too much time to go nowhere.All in all a waste of time - I am sorry I wasted my money"},{"rating":"1","title":"No Entertainment Value","review":"Although I agree that this movie has a unique storyline, that's all this movie has. The writing may have been incredible, but I'm no critic, so I'm not rating this movie on that. I'm a common moviegoer, so I rated this movie based on entertainment value. This is quite possibly one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I was bored multiple times while watching this movie. Right from the beginning, the storyline was too difficult to grasp. Even the two friends I was watching this movie with agreed that this movie was the exact opposite of entertaining. The media may have hyped this movie up, but it definitely did not gain popularity by common word of mouth like most great movies. I would definitely not recommend this movie to somebody in the mood for watching something entertaining. The only reason you may want to watch this movie is for it's uniqueness."},{"rating":"1","title":"OVER DOSE PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I rented this movie this past weekend. I heard that some people liked it and others did not, so i wanted to form my own opinion. My opinion is that this movie was a utter disgrace to film making. It was awful, not entertaining, and boring. I wanted to turn the dvd off but my girlfriend kept saying \\"Maybe it will get better.\\" Well just for curiousity I fast forwarded through the rest of the 40000 chapters. Lets give a synopsis of all the chapters. \\"OH LOOK WE ARE TALKING\\" \\"WE ARE WALKING\\" \\"OOPS WE ARE DOING DRUGs\\" \\"OH NO MY DAUGHTER IS A DRUG CRAVING WOMAN\\" \\"OOPS WALKING AGAIN\\" \\"IM MAD\\" \\"ISNT MEXICO WONDERFUL\\" there is the entire movie, so thank me cause i have saved you the 20 bucks to buy this movie"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT FILM","review":"I did't know what to expect when I decided to pick this up in the video store.

The movie tells the stories of different characters and families on the opposite sides of the drug war. The movie tells a comlex story in a very understandable manner. However; the story is not new. I think around 15 years ago, when I was still living in Montreal, BBC made a TV series with the same story line. The location has now been changed from London to Washington, from Pakistan to Mexico. I can still remember the series because it made a tremendous impression on me when it was first broadcasted. The way the BBC series was shot was more conventional, like a BBC series. It was very well done. The new movie now is shot with more updated technique. If I must chose between the two - I prefer the BBC series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay, this is my second attempt...........","review":"...Traffic is a monstrous dissapointment. I hate this movie. It is just a preachy, campy film produced by user/losers of the Hollywood psuedo-elite who spend 23 hours a day trying to get drugs legalized so that they can get high without fear of being arrested.

Why? was this movie considered a great accomplishment and an in depth study on the war on drugs. This movie was nothing more than boring , and long , and I found myself dozing off here and there during it. The only interesting story was Douglas and his daughter , the mexican cop , and the druglord's wife were boring and a waste of film. If the movie was about the czar and his daughter it may have earned at least 3 stars , and whats worse it'll switch characters to characters like about every minute , so you can't keep up with it. A 3 hr waste of time even though it had one of the coolest lines when the actor from That 70's Show and the czar's daughter are on the bed smoking heroin. Whats even more disgusting this film won an Oscar. It's trash like this that try to be groundbreaking and prove a point of some kind , but does nothing more than suck 3 hrs out of your life. Nauseating dribble"},{"rating":"1","title":"Laughably Overrated","review":"Soderbergh is without doubt the most laughably overhyped director in the business right now. \\"Traffic\\" tells us absolutely nothing about the \\"war on drugs\\" that an intelligent, informed person didn't already know. Furthermore, Soderbergh's acclaimed filmmaking techniques are all essentially \\"borrowed\\" from other directors who have used the same techniques to much better effect. At it's core, \\"Traffic\\" is a completely hollow, completely commercial Hollywood-style movie which the director and studio designed to win the superlatives of the adoring critics and the Oscars committee. There's nothing artistic or creative about any of Soderbergh's work, except maybe in the most shallow sense. The cast of the upcoming \\"Oceans 11\\" gives his game away anyway: Julia Roberts, George Clooney, Brad Pitt, etc., etc.. Soderbergh's game is the same as Hollywood's - to rake in the cash. This kind of moviemaking isn't art; this is commerce and marketing, pure and simple. Hand over the cash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing and distorted.","review":"It's nice to see Hollywood tackle a serious issue, and the Drug War is one of the most serious issues there is.Sadly, Traffic offers a distorted view of reality. Cocaine is presented here as an overwhelming, almost demonic force. Viewers might never guess that cocaine is actually very similar to alcohol, in that only a minority of users ever become addicts.Worse yet, Traffic seems overtly racist and insulting to Mexicans and African-Americans. The scene where the black drug dealer in the ghetto dopes up the rich white girl and has sex with her is like something out of Archie Bunker's nightmares.Yet it's all done with a gritty, raw style that is quite accomplished and impressive. It's too bad this talent serves such mean ends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hollywood destroys another classic story.","review":"When I watched this it reminded me what I thought of The Assassin (Bridget Fonda). In that case an absolute classic movie Nikita was destroyed with a mind numbing version for the US audience. It's happened again here with Traffik becoming remade as Traffic. Traffic won all the awards and took all the money buy you owe it to yourself to watch Traffik, the original."},{"rating":"1","title":"A tired movie with a tired DVD","review":"What were the studios thinking when they designed this DVD? It was like it was made in 1993 or something. I've gone more exciting DVD title screens from movies I bought for $10.00. Beside that the hoopla about Traffic was not at ALL warranted. The movie was WAY TOO LONG!!!!!! It was like someone got a hold of a bad movie of the week mini series and decided to put it in a feature film. The transparent efforts to make this movie\\"artsy\\" were a TOTAL waste and just made the movie look worse than it all ready did. This movie was truly unsurprising and I could have probably told you the end by the middle. It was TRULY a WASTE of my time. PLEASE DON'T EVEN RENT THIS MOVIE!!!

It was very dry and lacking in plot and acting. The story went absolutly nowhere! This is the type of movie where I find myself being the annoying movie patron just to entertain myself for the extent of the filth on screen. In direction and cinematography I would give it 4 stars.

I thought the movie was somewhat boring, however it was very accurate in many ways and in many other areas it was very HOLLYWOOD. I understand the effect the director was trying to create, but the harsh lighting and colors combined with the way the movie was filmed just made it all the more difficult to focus on the movie. If you want to see a movie about the Mexican/American drug problem, you will be pleased to know this movie is more accurate than people think, but I'm glad I didn't pay to see it at the movie theater.

I am in law enforcement working in the Narcotics section. If anyone cares to see what drugs really do to a person, starting from the lengths drug addicts go to get their drugs to their behavior on drugs and the vicious addiction cycle, this is the movie for you. The movie achieves a good balance in portraying how supply and demand work together equally to further the problem. Without giving away the ending, \\"Traffic\\" depicts just how frustrating and complicated the drug problem is for both the addict and for law enforcement. This movie is a must see."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long, but really good.

Micheal Douglas, Catherine Zeta Jones, and the rest of the cast all give superb performances in this mesmerizing film. It runs a bit too long, but all in all, it is a wonderful film.

Four Oscars fully undeserved."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very over-hyped effort, but good acting.","review":"First things first: The acting is pretty good, even when it is unintentionally humorous. However, I've got to wonder what kind of person thinks that this film makes anything other than the most simplistic statments about drug traffic or national drug policies. What was Soderbergh thinking? The characters are all charicatures from the liberal mindset. The viewer has no opportunity to empathize with any of the characters...the victories are hollow and the tragedies are meaningless.

But, Del Toro IS quite good...."},{"rating":"1","title":"I want my money back","review":"I absoultley hated this movie! Its was boring, very very boring.

Don't buy this thinking that it will be a masterpiece, because it's not. It's a very good film, but you will not feel for it. At the Oscars this year, Steven Soderbergh won Best Director for this film, he didn't deserve it, the main star of this film is the editing.

AS the stories start to converge the movie gets even better and you start to realize that although fictional this is way things are in real life. Excellent acting by all the big stars as well as the supporting cast. It is also filmed in a different way, it isn't as clear and pretty as most films are but it adds to its appeal and helps you understand that a lot of times life isn't pretty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Style over substance","review":"It's the same arrogance that led to a plethora of dull, uninspired, pretentious 12 minute 'concept' songs in the 1970s that is behind this style of film.Traffic has everything: a good cast, an engaging plot, an exciting scenario and a message - so it takes a special kind of skill to ruin it in the way that it has been. A skill that is prominent in art-school classes populated by 20-something know-it-all, upper-middle-class talentless fools who seem to believe that the secret of good film-making is a sepia-coloured filter over the lens, and multiplying the run-time by 2.In short, a great idea badly made."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Wonderful","review":"I wanted to see this film on opening day. It's been a while since then, but I finally got around to seeing it. It's one of the best films I've seen in a long time. The three storylines came together almost seamlessly, creating an epic film of the war on drugs. The great camera work added an edge to the film; it helped put you \\"there\\". The different locales each had different hues, also a nice touch. Benicio Del Toro was also magnificent. The best part of the movie, however, is the one storyline involving the teenage girl. The harsh reality of drug addiction is displayed here in incedible realism. High-class teens are the target here, as told by one of the kids in the film. He couldn't be more right. Watch the film and you'll understand.The references to the school and locations in Cincinnati are true-to-life as well...just a nice little extra for those of us who live around here.Great film. That's all I can say..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just like sitting in Traffic","review":"Unfortunately I went to see this film in the theatre.

The message was delivered but boring none the less."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste you time or money","review":"This was the worst movie I have seen in a long time. The cinematography was awful.

God only knows how angry I'd have been if I had gone, in my car, to a cinema to watch it, instead of renting it. And if I'd taken someone I liked????... the mind boggled.Isn't it obvious to everyone that this kind of stuff won't wash?

Also, a little flavored lube goes a long way if any smell still remains! Easy to clean if you use the reservoir with a bit a mild soap and warm water in it, just fill a few times and squirt through, then repeat with clean water to get soap out.

The pages are lined- 24 lines per page with a 3/4\\" margin in top for titles and numbers. The end papers are heavy but plain.My only problem with it is that it is so thin. I know it says it has 160 pages, but even that isn't really adequate. For the serious journal keeper, you no more than get started and you are ready for another. For years the standard was around 190 pages- and I can remember when the average journal was well over 200 pages. Is this being done simply to sell more journals? Or is it possible that most people find it difficult to fill even a thin journal with original ideas and notable occurances and observations these days?In any case, it seems a waste to put so few pages between so fine of covers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for a Journal","review":"I worried about the size when I ordered it, when it arrived I was so glad it is small enough to fit in a backpack or purse.

Often today some positively wicked tracks are lost behind second rate vocals like P. Diddy's \\"Badboys For Life\\" and Prodigy's ill-fated single \\"Baby's Got A Temper\\" where, if provided a touch more attention, the sound alone would triple the quality of the track provided the vocals were completely eradicated. That's never a problem here. While it would be nice to imagine, say, Gift Of Gab or Buck 65 throwing some rhymes over top a track here or there, each one is a pure sound complete in it's own right. While they pretty much all follow the same formula, they sound fresh and invigorating and, at the least, make me hungry for more of the like.

This can only be done when the participants truly grapple with the experience of adoption.

I found her compassionate, straightforward style and her specific suggestions for parents to be invaluable."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK starting point","review":"For adoptive parents who know nothing about life stories and how to present this information to their children then this book is a reasonable place to start. In my experience though, most parents have given considearable thought to the information that their children need and they would gain no further benefit from this book which contains very little information.

I knew (and you will, too) exactly how the book was going to end about 10 pages into it. The book is also lacking in emotion and description. It reads like this: Foly said, \\"...\\" She said, \\"...\\" He said, \\"...\\" The she said, \\"...\\" Get the idea?

While Foley is a charming old-world criminal, and Cisco one of Leonard's strongest female characters--a complex mix of Rambo and Daddy's girl--that it's a shame how Leonard manufactures a series of threadbare plot devices to bring them together: stakeouts and near-misses; minor characters who fill up pages but amount to nothing; lots of south Florida \\"atmosphere.\\" It's almost a textbook example of the Master running on autopilot--or on auto-Hollywood.

I picked this one up on the recommendation of a friend, for a long plane ride.Well, this book sure beats the inflight movie! In fact, I haven't seen the film made from it, but the book does read just like a film.The plot is fairly simple; a jail break, and a fatal attraction between a cop and a suave criminal. This book is particularly fun to read in light of the recent jailbreak in Tennessee, where the criminals ended up on the lam for weeks.These criminals are cut of a different cloth and the anti-hero is totally fictional; too intelligent and gentle to be real. But the characters are excellently drawn, the pace swift, and the book is diverting enough to keep you happy on any cramped flight.

Though known as an author of crime-based stories, no genre fully captures Leonard's interests, which are primarily character and dialogue.This book examines the developing relationship among a couple of escapees from a prison, and a federal authority who tracks them. In addition to Leonard's usual gifts for capturing precisely the nuances of the street & its cadence, Leonard probes the tentativeness and ambiguity in the developing love story which is the novel's ultimate focus.The story is perhaps not quite so crisp as some of his earlier work. On the other hand, it's much more feeling.Any new book from Elmore Leonard is a treat. OUT OF SIGHT is no exception."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite Elmore Leonard book","review":"This is my favorite Elmore Leonard book to date. now, i have only read three of his books, but I find comic crime novels to not be that interesting. However, I loved the movie and that that I should try the book. The book lived up to the hype. It had a movement that just flowed off the pages. The characters were well rounded, interesting and funny.

It's the kind of book you can read on the train, subway, bus, plane, the kind of book you can read in bed, alone or not, on the couch, alone or not. The poems tell it like it is, they dance, they sway and they groove. They are tough, funny, inspirational, and blunt. In some cases, they are..., sensual and revolutionary.

Upon hearing this cd, you can't help but ask two things. 1) What in the world were they thinking when they made this cd. 2) Haven't we heard this before?From the beginning it sounds, like we are listening to a past cd of theirs. It sounds like any other cd of theirs, in some vague way. Side one is another opus song of theirs, like 2112( which was great), but this one seems to have no reason to be there,it's there just to fill space. The second side, has three songs, all of which, but one, are weak. La Villa Strangiato is the only saving grace, and it isn't that good. Don't waste your money, I bought this on tape many, many years ago, and this is the only RUSH I do not have on cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"REAlly dislike it","review":"I only consider Rush to be a great band after the PERMANENT WAVES album. Before that, the band had th awful albuns FLY BY NIGHT, CARESS of STEEL and, amidst others, this HEMISPHERS, that will add absolutely nothing to your collection, only a bunch of screams by Geddy Lee and an horrible guitar tonality by Alex Lifeson, besides the silly lyrics by Peart."},{"rating":"2","title":"What an album!","review":"The orchestral tendancies of Rush are in full force here. The guitar harmonies create a very deep and involved sound. Circumstances is my favorite sad and confused song of all time.

Its got two of my favourite songs of all time on part two of Cygnus X-1, which is far superior to part one, and Circumstances which sounds so cool, especially the French lyrics. Geddy is in top form. His distinctive voice, aided by the excellent guitar work, sets the album's mood. The intelligent lyrics and complex structure prove once again that Rush is much more than a Led Zeppelin clone. They are, in fact, much better than Led Zeppelin. Why didn't I give it five stars? Well, The Trees is an excellent concept with great lyrics, but I find the music lacking.

But the other songs are some of their best, especially \\"The Trees\\" and \\"La Villa Strangiato.\\" Those two songs are required listening for the new fan, and they are 2 of Rush's best songs and consistent concert favorites (though the lyrics haven't aged well in \\"The Trees\\"). \\"Circumstances\\" is a fun song that they threw in, but its not as good as the last two.This cd is perhaps their oddest and most complex one they ever made. If you are collecting their albums you should get it.

This is Rush's masterpiece and continues an incredible upward climb that began with 2112, continued on A Farewell to Kings, and finally reached its apex with Hemispheres. There are no dull moments here, no filler, nothing that, quite frankly, could have been done better.Rush would continue to put out some good progressive rock/metal/jazz fusion pieces throughout the years (along with their share of duds) but they have yet to approach these three, with Hemispheres lording over the other previously mentioned gems.This is progressive rock at its best, and Rush at their finest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Rush, there is better though","review":"Excellent musicianship, well written songs and best of all it is not your typical commercial product"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hemispheres stands alone","review":"In my opinion, this album stands alone as far as musicianship & creativity for Rush. Some of the bass licks are very difficult to play, as well as the guitar and drums. La Villa & Circumstances show the ability to write complicated, progressive lines, and Side 1 and The Trees show Peart's mind expanding lyrical ability (Caress Of Steel is another favorite of mine).

OR my 80 lb. German Sheppard leans back against one of the feet and it slides and BOOM on the dog's head. Then despite my best efforts to tighten the screws on the cross bars, I have had these slide as well.

Installation wasn't a problem, took about 15 minutes. But within 5 minutes our puppy quickly figured out that there is no clamp on the horizontal bars. He easily slid it to the side and climbed up front. We fixed the problem with some hose clamps and rubber tubing from Home Depot (an extra $10 plus the trip to the store). It isn't perfect, but it works for the pup. If we had a bigger dog, I do not think it would take much effort for him to pull this away. It's reasonably secure, but a simple tug would probably move it enough to get thru.Bottom line...it isn't bad, but don't expect perfection. At the minimum, be prepared to do something to hold the horizontal bars in place.

We travel frequently by car and we tried 'Dog Whisperer' techniques to keep our guy in the back, but it was not working. The Highland Pet Barrier is perfect. It fits easily into our Honda CRV or our larger suv's, Grand Cherokee. It's legs screw in or out to adjust the height. The horizontal arms slide out trombone like and then can be locked to fit the car's width. We attached bungee cords around the back seat head rests to allow us to 'angle' the barrier, placing the legs snug against the seat base, giving our pooch the entire back cargo area. It works wonderfully. No more dog trying to drive. HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS. And the price was terrific! I saw some at 3 times the price. Shpg. was very prompt. If you're considering it go for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"I ordered this through a local auto store. Easy to set up- takes about 20 min.

It does not hold in place vertically, and the horizontal bars do not tighten at all but freely slide in and out like a trombone. My lab/retriever mix is not the sharpest tool in the shed, but even he quickly figured out how to slide the bars in with his nose and hop through. Every car ride, he would either do that or just push the whole thing down, no matter how hard I tightened it. This seems very dangerous driving down the road with your dog's head through the sliding bars. He finally popped it out of the plastic joint while pushing the barrier over. I can't see this working for small dogs either. Either your dog is smart enough to slide the bars in, strong enough to push the whole thing down, or small enough to crawl right through. Don't waste your money on this useless product like I did, I am kicking myself for not spending the extra cash for something that actually works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"NOTHING on this barrier tightens! The included screws do nothing - they loosely fit into their holes and therefore, do not hold the horizontal bars in place. Additionally, the rounded ends of the horizontal bars easily expand and retract but there is NO WAY to secure them in any one spot - so if your dog has HALF a brain, he/she will just use his/her nose to move the bars aside (in fact, it's so easy to move them that I'd bet most dogs will do it accidentally). VERY poorly designed. We are absolutely returning this piece of crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't hold my 70# lab","review":"Had for one day, my lab tore down, yes she has SA but really thought it would hold up.

It was very easy to assemble and install. It does not impede your rear view too much, and is durable.

While it will work for me and my mellow dogs, it still needed some slight modifications. NO, you don't have to be a handyman.....if you're good with tape then you'll be OK! As many others have mentioned, the provided screws don't tighten the cross bars onto the main beam. I cranked them as tight as I could get them without any effect. They did not tighten at all and the cross bars still moved up and down at will. Additionally the extensions on these same cross bars are very loose, and have no mechanism, operational or otherwise, to secure them. To say that they're loose would be an understatement.In both cases I pulled out the 100 MPH tape (a military type similar to duct tape) and locked everything down. Like I mentioned, it will work for me because my dogs are older and mellow. However, if you own a hyperactive pup, DO NOT GET THIS BARRIER as the design is shoddy at best!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty much useless","review":"We tried to use this in our Ford Escape. As other reviewers have said, if you're not handy with \\"fixes\\" don't bother. The screws that came with this product to tighten down the bars don't fit. I tried using hose clamps as another user did but my determined dog quickly figured it out and moved the whole unit right out of the way. Also, if you have back seats that are at an angle, you loose a tremendous amount of hatch space because the legs must be moved way out in order to line up straight. Waste of $$$"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great","review":"Maybe it depends on the car, but I couldn't get it tight enough in my SUV to prevent the dogs from knocking it down. It also probably depends on the dog. If the dog really wants to get past it, they will. If you have a more mellow dog who will be satisfied with a \\"psychological barrier\\", this would be ok. Oh, and as a previous reviewer mentioned, the \\"trombone\\" style sides slide easily back and forth, I had to get some hose clamps to keep them in place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality!","review":"Not only is this barrier a very poor fit for our Ford Expedition, but the hardware is awful. The height of our cargo area just happens to be too short for the extension and too tall to work without it. The screws are less than half an inch from the ends of the pipes causing it to be practically useless. It wobbles and falls on the dogs constantly, we finally had to wind a bungee cord around it and tie it to the headrests which doesn't seem the least bit safe, but at least it is a temporary fix. Even in a different vehicle I would think that the quality of this barrier would be sub par, all the dog has to do is bump near the base and it will tumble down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I installed as the directions stated to do and proceeded to put my two 60 pound dogs in the back of my SUV.

After having used this for a month or so, I have to agree with the negative reviews. This gate is poorly designed. The pads that hold the gate in place do not pivot and my car's roof is not flat, so there is a gap between the gate's pad and the ceiling. This causes the gate to fall over, especially if the dog has been lying against the bottom of the gate. Also, installing the gate was a pain - not because it was difficult but because the screws holding the crossbars in place were difficult to access.

Even when he does not push all the way through it, he pushes it enough to loosen it and then it rattles loudly while I drive. With a newborn in the back seat, it is imperative for me to be able to keep my over-sized puppy in his own space.

My dog didn't know what to do about it, so he stayed in the back. It was more like a mental barrier for my dog because he could have easily moved the horizontal bars since there's no lock to keep 'em in place.But then, after a few uses, my dog figured out a way to move the bars.

I guess I went in with high expectations. In the beginning of the book, I thought it might be worthwhile, but as I read on.......the repetitive nature of the book got old very fast. The book could have gotten its message across with a lot less pages. I found the ceremonies that they had in there useless....I hope they don't recommend this book for someone that is lonely. I think the authors idea for the book was a good one, but the execution of their idea didn't deliver in print."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wicca Watch!","review":"If you remain at all confused as to the nature of this book, simply try google-ing the names of the authors. We find here a trend in the Wiccan religious tradition being written by purportedly Catholic nuns. Here is a quote by Wiederkehr in one of her other books, \\"God is Someone who has taken the time to sit on a quilt with me waiting for beauty. She is a Mother of Presence.\\" -- Yes, you heard right, God is a woman; does that make Jesus a woman too? It's all so confusing. Buyer beware! This isn't the placid book it claims to be about happy, let's-hold-hands-in-the-sunshine banal spirituality, it is a quiet indoctrination into Wicca."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good story, told with eloquence and passion.","review":"Rushdie is an author whom I had mentally classified over the years as clever, but difficult to like, while feeling slightly guilty about not having read more of his work. I had read \\"Midnight's Children\\", been put off by the controversy over the \\"Satanic Verses\\" and by the reviews and subject matter of some of his other books (e.g. \\"The ground beneath her feet\\").\\"Shalimar the Clown\\" completely changed this assessment. It is a book I never would have read, if I hadn't been prompted to by book group. A strong argument for being nudged to read out of one's comfort zone. I loved the book. For many reasons, but primarily because it's a great story, skillfully told. Rushdie is amazingly erudite, but manages to avoid the trap of coming across as a know-it-all. His passion about the situation in Kashmir gives vigor and fluency to the writing.A strong 4-star recommendation, and - for me - a reason to consider exploring more of Rushdie's work"},{"rating":"1","title":"I think he done said what he's gotta say","review":"I've read all of Rushdie's novels and only truly loved \\"Midnight's Children\\" and \\"Shame\\". \\"Shalimar The Clown\\" reads as though someone is trying to write like Salman Rushdie: it's strained, show-offy and kind of trite. It has an \\"Entertainment Weekly\\" tone. Sorry, I found \\"MC\\" to be, arguably the single most thrilling read of my adult life, but almost everything since then has been dissapointing.Sad, but I guess everything moves on."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Found It Unreadable.","review":"If you like books that are pedantic, boring, that attempt to erect too elaborate of a framework from which to hang a plot, then this is the novel for you. Maybe things got better after page sixty-five, that's all the farther I got. It's probably not ethical to base a review on a book I didn't finish, but Rushdie leaves me so annoyed every time I read him that I really wanted to say something here. Why on earth is this man regarded as one of humanity's greatest novelists?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Read","review":"Rushdie's literary style is difficult at first. I think it is called magic realism. However, as you enter the world of Kashmir, it is an appropriate technique. As the book gathers steam (like a locomotive pulling out of the stattion)it becomes a much faster read and then the plots become compelling. I feel like I understand what has been lost in Kashmir in the past 50-60 year. Excellent. Will probably go back and look at some of his other works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Work of genius","review":"While I am a big Rushdie fan, his last few novels (especially Fury) have disappointed me. This, however, is again Rushdie at his best. Slowly, he weaves the reader into the plot and the characters. One thing I found missing in this novel, is the humor that was such a part of Rushdie's earlier works. This made the whole experience of reading Shalimar somehow more opressive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Feeling Bhoomi move","review":"I saw Salman Rushdie at a book festival and came to the realization that this man is one of those great writers that come along only once in a while. It always amazes that great writers do not always get five stars for their books. Their books are complex and somewhat above the din, somewhat above the crowd, somewhat above it all. Shalimar is like that. Fantasy, unbelievable alliances yet they ring true. Often he preaches a bit, or simplifies but that wonderful sense of fantasy remains. Thats what I love about Rushdie, that feeling of reading while in a high fever. You dont just read his books, you do it to be in presence of a genius you dont quite understand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extraordinary!","review":"StC is a surpassing novel, transcendent.

I also had it as an audio book and tried to listen to it many times, yet each time I registered it as painful. Needless to say, I not go past the first 100 pages. The writing is verbose, artificial and cold. I tried very hard to like it, care for the characters and the story. For me Rushdie is a man with a huge ego, and with certain literary skills, but not an enjoyable writer. The only time I could finish one of his books was when I read Fury, another cold book with a big ego, but thanks goodness, less artificial and flowery. Not sure why men's fiction is considered better than women's fiction, maybe because most literary critics are (still) men?!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Uncomfortable.","review":"After a few pages , I gave up interest.Weirdness is another word that comes to mind.Worse yet, I borrowed it from the libraryand had to purchase this copy to replace it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Pics","review":"Lots of great pictures from NOLA and the surrounding region.

I had heard of them before then, and liked their music, but it was not until the release of this one that I actually bought a Rush album.PW is pretty heavy on synthesizers, but here they finally found a good balance between synths and guitars. The songs take on a sort of \\"power-pop\\" bent, and this disc has some of the best guitar riffs of Rush's synthesizer era.Best tracks: \\"Big Money\\", \\"Mystic Rhythms\\", \\"Territories\\", \\"Manhattan Project.\\" But overall no real duds.BTW, if you're wondering, the second Rush album I bought was Moving Pictures."},{"rating":"1","title":"sounds cheesy","review":"This is one of rush's worst albums at least in my opinion. Guitars are almost removed entirely and replaced by synthesizers which makes the songs end up like sounding like cheesy 80's pop. Aswell as with the exception of \\"grand designs\\" the lyrics of the songs incredibly weak;who wants to hear songs about dropping an atom bomb and running marathons. When the lryics go \\"imagine a time\\" it sounds like a childrens story.

Even though your music had always been serious, it still had a bit of lightheartedness to it, i.e \\"Closer To The Heart.\\"Power Windows is a complete retreat from the Rush that made their classic albums, and I didn't like the keyboard dominated sound one bit when it was released.

I did grow up on Rush's music and i love their works but i wouldn't recommend this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Probably The Best Rush Album Ever","review":"Power Windows is heavily depended on keyboard sounds.

There is a reason they have been around a long time, and will be around for us to enjoy hopefully for many years to come.This ties with Subdivisons as my 2nd fav Rush album behind Moving Pictures"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than average, but not Rush's best","review":"While I consider Rush to have been in decline since Moving Pictures, that is not to say they were not still a potent band after that album. This album lacks some of the boldness and complexity of some of their previous music, but it still stands above most other contemporary efforts in terms of mature, sophisiticated sound. To compare to cheesy 80s bands such as Flock of Seagulls is just plain silly. Yes, there are some synthesizers, but can't we be just a tad less superficial? This is not hard, progressive rock musical genius such as can be found on Moving Pictures. Still, there are pleasures to be found here, although it took 3 or 4 listens before I really started to groove on the subtle melodies and chord progressions. Only Big Money is a radio-style hit, but I assure you this is better than some of their later mush."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific playing and Rush's \\"New World Man\\" view","review":"In this 1985 album, Rush presents songs that reflect the concerns and issues of the time, such as greed on \\"The Big Money\\" and nuclear power on \\"The Manhattan Project.\\" These aren't songs with the length or jams of Rush's early work, but they are strong, and the keyboard and especially, the rhythm section of Geddy Lee and Neil Peart is terrific."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Girl Shares Her Opinion","review":"I had never heard of RUSH until the \\"The Big Money\\" came on the radio one night in the fall of 1985. It immediately caught my attention. I remember thinking that the song sounded so... \\"BIG\\"! Sorry, no pun intended. The sound was aggressive yet melodic and (it seemed to me) a little over the top. But I immediately decided that I liked it. It was like nothing I had ever heard before. Soon afterwards I learned that it was just three guys making all of that music! I was impressed. I purchased the album and loved it. I have since looked forward to all RUSH album releases. They are outstanding musicians."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST '80'S ALBUM!!!","review":"The surreal, 80's-psychedelic-ish soundscapes really put my mind at one with the surreal-80's-psychedelic-ish album cover. The music is thoughtful and heartfelt AND greatly energetic. Really gets my blood-pumping and puts my mind at ease!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Keyboard excess","review":"'Windows' continued the keyboard synth-rock sound of the mediocre 'Grace Under Pressure', and is a slight improvement on its predecessor. The production is smoother and more polished than 'Pressure', so the keyboard sound stands out even more. 'Middletown Dreams', 'Emotion Detector' and 'Grand Designs' (the latter has some brilliant bass playing from Geddy) are probably the best on offer, while 'Mystic Rhythms' and 'Manhattan Project' have keyboard overload that it makes you wonder if Alex forgot to bring his guitars to the studio. Remaining tracks 'Big Money', 'Territories' and 'Marathon' are OK, but sound much better live. Multi-layered vocals were introduced for the first time and work quite well, and the musicianship is as proficient as ever. But 'the principle gets left out' (lyric from 'Grand Designs'), the principle of Rush's music being the guitar coming first. 2.5 stars"},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredible","review":"Incredibly bad that is. I did actually get images of rainbows and Skittles adverts when my friend (who, incidentally, hugly regretted buying this 'masterpiece') showed it to me. This is barely rock half the time; it just has a synth-laden cheesey happy pop sound most of time. Admitadly, what they're doing is far more ambitious than any pop band, but that is still the sound they have. Sure, these guys are talented - not a doubt! But what does that count for when the music is plain horrible? I've listened to Images & Words and Operation: Mindcrime far too many times to bother with this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Three Overly-Serious Fish, Sans H2O","review":"I bought this album when I was 17, and I remember at the time thinking the boys sounded uninspired and more than a tad uncomfortable negotiating those fluorescent blue mid-80s waters.

Pretty wild, huh?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A slight case of overbombing...","review":"\\"Power Windows\\" is really a powerful album, but it is absolutely not my cup of tea. Many songs remind me of this stupid \\"faster, louder, harder\\"-attitude of the '80s. \\"The Big Money\\" says it all:Horrible guitar-solos, thundering drums with lots of echo, layer by layer of squeaking synths--all systems set on maximum effect. This is really pop-metal at its worst! \\"Power Windows\\" is a very uncool album. It sounds ridiculous and overblown today, because many musicians show their virtuosity in a more subtle way. For me, the gap between \\"Moving Pictures\\" and Rush's mid-'80s work is very wide. I'm giving two points, because the musicianship is still impressing on this record, and the whole affair sounds more thrilling than on the sterile \\"Grace under Pressure\\". Nevertheless, if you want to hear \\"Worst of the '80s\\", buy this album!"},{"rating":"1","title":"GOD AWFUL!!!","review":"This snooze fest is about as exciting as watching paint dry. \\"big money\\", \\"marathon\\", and \\"manhattan project\\" are great but the rest of the album is sooo bad that it actually takes effort for you to want to put this cd or tape into your deck.

If you've never listen to Rush, buy this album and sit down with headphones and the lyric sheet: but don't expect to grab everything in a first listen. This album was made to be explored over repeated sessions. Perhaps that is why you've never heard it on the radio!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best from the Synthesizer Era","review":"Signals is where Rush began implementing synthesizers in a dominating manner, but it is the following trio of albums (Grace under Pressure, Power Windows, and Hold Your Fire) where they overpower guitars almost completely. Power easily blows the other two, not to mention the later Presto, out of the proverbial water; it is most definitely the definitive album from this era of the band.This is Peart's best lyrical effort since Moving Pictures, if not ever, and the music is a notch above Grace. \\"Middletown Dreams\\" has some very good lyrics, while \\"Grand Designs,\\" \\"The Big Money,\\" \\"Manhattan Project,\\" and others rock out musically. I can even see how some people call this Rush's best album. All in all, it is certainly another solid Rush effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Money Sucks Around The World!!! Synth Overload","review":"I remember going to Tower Records to buy this the moment it came out. I was shaking with anticipation. Upon listening the first couple tracks my heart sank.

I hoped it would have been bigger. If you start with a loaf of bread (any size) add some english muffins and maybe another type of bread you are well into the \\"stuffed\\" zone.

With the poignant look at the social stratum in Subdivisions, or the dismal reality in Losing It, the band were able to make us look at what we were, are and will always be. Signals is not a political statement but a human outlook, void of stats or judgment.

Take a listen"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Rush Classic","review":"After 2112, Rush began to depart from their lyrical and musical focus on mystical and fantasy themes. Beginning with Moving Pictures, Rush took the spirit behind their earlier work and coupled it with a new technologically aware focus. Rush began to embrace the technology of the modern information age as well as the reality of space travel far before most people became cognizant of these things. Many of the songs clearly echo that theme. A notable piece is \\"Analog Kid\\", which features a smooth, spacey break, lifting your mind into orbit. A great piece of history that is still worth the listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Conform or be cast out\\"- Subdivisions","review":"After their masterpiece \\"Moving Pictures\\" Rush came back with an album that was, contrary to the opinion of many, just as good in it's own way. Signals would begin a shift in songwriting away from long complex compositions to songs that were shorter and less impressive technically. But that did not bother me as long as the songs were well written and had parts I wanted to hear over and over. Signals delivers with a few of the best songs Rush has ever written. Subdivisions, New World Man, The Weapon, and Losing It are all excellent songs that I put on almost all of my Rush compilations. The other four songs, especially Analog Kid, are good as well. Digital Man with it's reggae beat/chords would give a hint of what was to come (and perhaps be abused) on the next album Grace Under Pressure. I put Signals right after Moving Pictures, next to A Farewell To Kings and 2112."},{"rating":"2","title":"This album IS cool and cast IN (to my player, that is!)","review":"This album is a great follow-up to the landmark Moving Pictures, which is the Perfect album. I mean, how could you follow that? I think they did very well, considering the pressure they were up against. Subdivisions is still their most cold and emotional song.

You want this!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The remaster makes all the difference","review":"The remastering of Signals brings the instrumentation up out from the depths of the original murky mix to wonderful effect.

Not that they haven't had some good songs since then . But I don't feel that anything they've done since Signals measures up to it as a whole .You can tell listening to this that the boys were under the influence of reggae at the time . And in this case , that is a very good thing indeed . Some of the jamming that Geddy & Alex do on Signals is the best they ever did . Neil's drumming is excellent , as usual . Between this & Moving Pictures , Rush were really at their peak ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album from that \\"transitional period\\"","review":"Marks the beginning of the period where Rush truly began experimenting with electronics and synths creating musical soundscapes.Subdivisions, The Analog Kid, and Digital Man were immediate standout tracks while others seemed to fall flat on that first listen like New World Man & Countdown. The latter's only redeeming quality being awesome outtro jam that closes the album. While the use of synths may definitely seem over the top at times, it was necessary to plant the seeds for those later masterpieces in Grace Under Pressure and the utter perfection of Power Windows.If you're more into the band's technical/art-rock era definitely check out Caress of Steel, 2112, Hemispheres and A Farewell to Kings."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Subdivisions\\" is the greatest five minutes in rock.","review":"I don't think this is the best Rush album (that honour belongs to the majestic and incomparable Moving Pictures), but it's right up there."},{"rating":"2","title":"sounds like a vinyl","review":"I almost got the remaster when i saw they had these.

As I said, I am a Rush fan and I like all of their albums, but I believe this is one of their more accessable offerings especially for the new listener.

It is a rare one indeed when you can simply pop it in the stereo and enjoy the entire CD. I wore out the album, wore out a casette tape, and I now own the CD. This is Rush at its best: temendous music, incredible diversity and intelligent lyrics. And you can ge it at a bargain price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Signals Crossed","review":"Rush's 1982 album Signals contains one of their most popular songs, \\"Subdivisions\\". It is a classic song about the perils of teen life in the suburbs. Championing the call to be your own person instead of conforming to what the cool kids in school do, it has become a battle cry for nerds and outcasts everywhere. While \\"Subdivisions\\" is now the most remembered song from the album, it also contains Rush's lone American top 40 song, \\"New World Man\\". It's not only surprising that the band has had only one top 40 hit, but that it's this almost forgotten song from their vast catalog. The album closes with \\"Countdown\\" which about the launching of the Space Shuttle Columbia which was inspired from the band's visit to the Kennedy Space Center to watching its initial launch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't listen to Peter Tucci","review":"So Rush uses synths.

This period is one of the best periods from Rush for those of us who love synthesizers! Before signals Geddy used synths sparingly. After Hold Your FIre synths starts to dissapear from Rush albums, this is ok too after all Rush is a rock trio and synths or no synths the band rocks, but Signals has a synergy that at the time was fresh, and holds up well today, in fact sonicly Signals is far better than many modern rock albums from bands who sell millions of records toting lame songs and second rate guitar chords stolen from bands who played them originally 20 years ago. Signals is very original and sounds like no other Rush album. Analog Kid may well be one Rush's finest moments."},{"rating":"1","title":"and down we go","review":"When this album came out it made me embarassed to say I was a rush fan.Cheesey synthesisers and boring compositions take over on this release.In my opinion Rush never got their magic back from this point on.After hearing this album I felt grateful for having seen them on the Perminent Waves tour.If you like seventies Rush,don't buy this or you will be highly dissapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"One must put up barriers....","review":"...to protect oneself from the Peart's and Portnoy's of this world.

The songwriting is unremarkable and the lyrics are painfully bad (though the pseudointellectual nonsense of later albums is absent). \\"In the Mood\\" may be the most ridiculously goofy thing they ever recorded. The attempt to clone Zeppelin is pretty obvious and results in a bluesy sound on some tunes. Other than \\"Finding My Way\\" and \\"Working Man\\" (where they demonstrate their developing instrumental prowess), this one is mostly forgettable."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Lackluster Debut","review":"Classic rock bands such as Led Zeppelin, Van Halen, Black Sabbath, and Deep Purple all had really strong debut albums. Rush did not. The lyrics on this CD are all very amateurish, especially the lame rocker In The Mood. John Rutsey is an okay drummer but he cannot hold a candle to Neil Peart. Alex Lifeson and Geddy Lee show promise as the great musicians that they are but the album comes across as too Zepellinesque. The only worth while song here is Working Man. The band did have to start somewhere and they did get better. This is for die hard fans only."},{"rating":"2","title":"LED ZEPPELIN ARE OVERRATED GARBAGE!","review":"Will you people stop comparing Rush to Led Zeppelin! Led Zeppelin are the most overrated band of all time!Why does every other band get compared unfavourably to Led Zeppelin, but never vice versa, huh?I really want to know.Let me say that Led Zeppelin copied The Who, Cream, Blue Cheer and old blues like Muddy Waters.As for the album, it is much heavier and louder than anything Led Zeppelin ever did-Led Zeppelin(when they used electric guitars) were never \\"heavy\\", they just had a harsh,hard sound-no power.Their songs aren't even all that good either.I think it's high time the music community did a serious re-evaluation of Led Zeppelin."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Toronto Tornado","review":"Before Neil Peart joined the band, and brought along a certain science fiction/fantasy approach to their lyrics, Rush was pretty much a straight up, albeit Zeppelin-influenced, group from Canada with a guy named John Rutsey holding down the drum duties. At the risk of bringing the wrath of Rush fans world-wide down on my head, I think this is their best album. Without the complicated time signatures and Peart's often overblown lyrics, songs like \\"What You're Doing,\\" \\"Finding My Way,\\" \\"In The Mood,\\" and especially \\"Working Man\\" are given room to breathe and, dare I say, boogie.

The strengths of this album are the first and last tracks, which are classics of the AOR era. The middle part is pretty good, but poor Geddy insists on making up for a perceived weakness in his voice by overuse of cheesy echo effects, which sadly date this perfomance to the arena rock era of the '70s. Take that away and this could be something released tomorrow by some cutting-edge up-and-coming rock group. You can plainly hear the influences, and at the same time hear the potential that resides within some of the songs, which hint of things to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who dares rates this album with less than 5 stars?","review":"Many will think Zeppelin after their first listen of this album which is not a bad thing at all , but poor David Coverdale is still looked at as a Rober Plant rip-off with no identity whatsoever ; Geddy Lee does a great Plant impersonation in this one before entering the fascinating prog-rock rock world flapping his own wings.This is a true work of rock 'n' roll art with a great opener, catchy middle which keeps anticipated for more and more and an ending that will absolutely blow up your mind making you wanting to replay it.Surely, the L.A. scene which was in its high during the late eighties based their edge and style on such albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where it all began","review":"It's almost hard to imagine how Neil Peart was not yet a member of Rush when they made their debut album. Sure, the Peart influence is not heard on this recording, but Geedy Lee and Alex Lifeson(and the original drummer)were still young lads exploring their individual talents and putting them together on an album for the first time. For 1974, most bands new or old couldn't help but sound like what was most popular, and the Pink Floyd influence is detected on \\"Here Again.\\" There's also a lot of Led Zeppelin similarities in most of the songs, but as we know now, Rush eclipsed Led Zeppelin through the years to become a solid band with tremendous talent and originality, and their signature sound is not absent from this recording when you listen to the guitar licks on the opening track \\"Finding My Way,\\" and of course \\"Working Man,\\" one of the greatest radio anthems of all-time with an amazing guitar jam that can't be compared to anything else."},{"rating":"2","title":"RUSH!!!!","review":"Man this CD just rocks!!!

Granted there are no fancy synthesizers,instead electric guitar winds through all songs. No fancy drum solos, but who cares. Lyrics? Come on! This is rock and roll!

That's just how it is. This first album is fine if you think of it as an historical artifact. Here we see the raw talents of Lee and Lifeson first displayed. It's clear that Lee especially is a great talent on bass. However the lyrics are banal, when not silly, and Lee's voice just doesn't work with some of the macho swagger stuff like \\"In the Mood.\\" Is it any wonder we never here most of this stuff live? Now, we can listen to the music and look at the pictures in this album and see young men who are so obviously dreaming of being rock and roll stars and compare them to the older, wiser, and more musically sophisticated men who, 33 years later (!) are 'making memories' for us under the moniker RUSH."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow...this is bad","review":"Note to fans who have not yet heard this masterpiece: do not waste your time.

And I haven't even mentioned In the Mood (Yikes!!!).So, come on, all you people giving this album 4 and 5 stars...either you have no respect for what Rush did later in their careers, or you are a severe masochist...possibly a sadist as well, since by giving the album 5 stars your obvious intent is to get others to listen to this as well.Kids, do yourself a favor: if you love your ears, avoid this album like the plague.

I can only stomach all the Led-Zepplin-esque guitar riffs and lyrics for so long before I have to hit FF on most of the tracks. Though John Rutsey's drumming is tight, (and a lot better than he gets credit for, I might add) he's no Neil Peart, for sure.

Things start to spring happen for the lovely couple when her birthday hits and her cousin and friend arrive to celebrate but it all turns on Chaplin when the cousin and friend happen to be impostors and so is Kidman. The 3 have a history of doing this. Chaplin robs his bank, is out of job and doesnt know what to think, but in the end, his feelings for Kidman succumb to him. Nicely captured performances by Chaplin and Kidman but this leaves you with wanting a different premise. Vincet Cassel (Brother Hood Of The Wolf, Elizabeth) also stars as Kidman's angry and jelous boyfriend. Also too much subtitles."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bad story.","review":"No complaints about the actings here.

The problem with BIRTHDAY GIRL is how it sanitizes a criminal, and tries to make us think \\"Oh, well, now she's changed, she's not so bad after all.\\" Never mind the fact of how many lives she's ruined, and how she leads Ben Chaplin's character into robbing his bank, and basically ruining his life. That's okay, but Chaplin didn't really have much of a life? Come on, I get tired of writers and moviemakers trying to make criminal life so attractive and then cleaning it up by making the flapless Kidman fall in love with the pretty gullible and stupid Chaplin. I really can't find much to recommend with this movie, and Kidman should keep it off her resume."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and short birthday","review":"Nicole Kidman and his couple(In the film)Ben Chaplin are the best of the movie.With a simple but interesting plot, and excellent(Very excellents)actings.But thing gets boring and predictable here, and not evem the beautiful touchs of comedy here can entertein us.A real big shame, poor Nicole."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thrilling, Humorous, and Fun","review":"For the most part the story turns unexpectedly except for the obvious part that John and the woman would end up in liking each other in the end.

Soon, Nadia is celebrating her birthday and two \\"cousins\\" come to help celebrate. John finds himself way over his head in the middle of an increasingly out of control situation reminiscent of \\"Something Wild\\". I'm not always too crazy about Nicole Kidman, but thought she did a fantastic job in this movie. Everyone did. I totally believed that an Australian woman and two French guys were Russian. This wasn't a blockbuster, but a really entertaining movie with plenty of twists and turns to keep the viewer engrossed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazing actors can't save this train wreck.","review":"Birthday Girl starring Ben Chaplin and Nicole Kidman starts off as an appealing, strange love story but the film loses its edge 30 minutes in. Kidman is superb as always and Chaplin always gives a quiet, realistic perfomance but even their apparent talents can't spark a weak story. I could see the twist coming a mile away and there's nothing else worth talking about. Birthday Girl is anything but a blaze of glory. Skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre","review":"Even with Nicole Kidman starring in this movie, it was not her best film. I found the story a bit ridiculous. It seemed to be a low-budget film as well. Pass up on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was confused","review":"This movie was very confusing. I kept wondering what happened to all of the others that Nicole and her friends robbed; did they kill them? And why did they drag Ben Chaplin with them after he'd done what they wanted? If these people had done murder, then the ending was totally inappropriate. I'd have liked to have seen Ben getting revenge. I was disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Liked It but Hubby Iffy/Kidman & Chaplin good duo","review":"This is quirky little film. I enjoyed it primarily because of Nicole Kidman and Ben Chaplin. Kidman has been coming more and more into her own as an actress and this performance is no exception. She is very talented and is taking very diverse roles. She and Ben Chaplin make a very attractive couple and you will find yourself rooting for them. She is a Russian internet ordered girlfriend for Chaplin. He is dismayed to discover she doesn't speak any English although she wrote him letters in English. However, her communication abilities are ample in the bedroom so he keeps her. But then her two buddies from Russia show up and suddenly Chaplin's character is facing a whole new, much more threatening situation. I like Kidman better with Chaplin than I ever liked her as Tom Cruise's costar. I think it is worth giving a try."},{"rating":"1","title":"A huge disappointment","review":"Geeky Brit, John (Ben Chapin), sends for a Russian mail order bride via the net and ends up with the sexy Nadia (Nicole Kidman) whose English vocab consists only of the word \\"Yes\\". (Sounds like the perfect woman to me. Just kidding). John believes he has finally found his soulmate, but things soon go awry when Nadia's cousins make a surprise visit on her birthday, leading to a turn of events which transform BIRTHDAY GIRL from a clumsy and unfunny comedy to a clumsy and not terribly thrilling thriller.BIRTHDAY GIRL is yet another movie in which Kidman's talents are wasted. Her appealing performance is the sole redeeming feature of this slop. And as if that isn't bad enough the tape I viewed ends with the Robbie Williams video \\"Something Stupid\\" (No!!!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Same story as Original Sin with Banderas/Jolie","review":"Nicole is hot in this movie, and very believable as a sexy Russian golddigger chick. If you have seen Original Sin you will know exactly how this movie will end. The difference is Original Sin is set in the past over 100 years ago, and Birthday Girl brings this story about one of the oldest cons in the book into contemporary times. The ending is again a bit upside-down, obviously intended to make the audience feel better about human nature. Enjoyable flick anyways, with some good tongue-in-cheek humour."},{"rating":"2","title":"Man seeks love through mail - order bride............beware","review":"John (Ben Chaplin) is an insecure man in his early 30s who never had any luck with women or love.

On the way home from the airport he figures out that she does not speak any English at all, which leads him to attempt to get rid of her. However, she seduces him and tries her best at being a 'good' house wife and eventually he falls for her and buys her a Russian-English dictionary. One day she announces that it is her birthday and a her cousin arrives unexpectedly with a friend. Uncomfortably he tries to get to know them, but it does not work out as he expects. Birthday Girl is a humorous love story with a surprising element of deception that will keep the audience engaged with the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Is One Birthday I Won't Be Celebrating","review":"Birthday Girl is one of the worst movies I have seen. The acting is okay but it's really annoying that they speak more Russian than English in the movie. The storyline is so dumb and not well thought out.Birthday Girl is about a lonly bank employee who orders a Russian mail-order bride. When he first meets her, he realizes she isn't exactly what he wanted. Her name is Nadia and she doesn't really speak English.The story goes on and on and on into neverland.

I enjoyed the easy to read layout and found it to be a quick, yet revolutionary, read. I picked it up on a lark and I'm glad I did. It's never to late (or too early) to start becoming healthy.

Beth's words of wisdom helped alleviate my guilt, especially when I felt like I was anything but an ideal mother. Her humor raised a smile and she tackled some topics that, unfortunately, mothers don't always talk about because we're afraid to admit that we don't love every aspect of motherhood (which, btw, is very natural).Beth also encouraged me to take time out for myself and when with my children, to truly enjoy them. I still carry this book around with me...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music for a lazy Sunday afternoon","review":"Ned Doheny was one of the best kept secrets of the early 70's. \\"Postcards From Hollywood\\" was a favorite of critics and the epitomy of the mellow California sound (think Eagles, Jackson Browne leavened with jazzy Steely Dan musicianship). It's too bad Doheny's early albums are out of print, but this collection is a great starting point. Though the music is 30 years old, it still sounds as fresh and lovely as the day it was released. Timeless stuff that will leave you swooning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic CD from a terrific talent","review":"I first became aware of Scott Joss when I attended a Merle Haggard concert last year. He was playing fiddle, as well as some other instruments and sang some. It impressed me enough to do some digging to find out who he was. I found one of the songs on this CD on YouTube and really liked it, so decided to buy the CD. Every song is better than the one before. It's a terrific album that will be well appreciated by anyone who enjoys country music, esp. the Bakersfield sound. I later learned that he has been playing with Dwight Yoakam for several years. He's a true talent and should be a headliner himself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Move along - you'll thank me later","review":"I rented, rather than purchased this movie, and boy am I glad. (Although if there was a way to get my rental money back I would.)The concept had the potential to be an all-gay sendup of the the women in prison films - except it looks more like the transition scenes in a gay porno with all the sex cut out. Bad lighting. Bad acting. Bad sets. Bad writing. (You get the picture.) Even the actors look embarassed to be in this one.Oddly, on the DVD, this is also a photo gallery option - that has almost nothing to do with this film. Out of 75 or so shots, only a half dozen come from the film - the rest are gratuitous shots of naked men - apparently from other vidoes (most likely porn) the company owns.The movie: a painful 82 minutes. The DVD: a waste of plastic. Move along to something better - you'll thank me for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"CORNIEST STORY OR NO STORY AT ALL","review":"I bought this DVD and found it to be one of the worse investments I ever had.

The actors are somewhat cute, but the acting is just horrible. The average porn film has better acting than this.

Not worth owning at all unless you want to see what may be the worst ... movie ever made."},{"rating":"1","title":"There should be a support group!","review":"Yes, a support group for all those who have suffered through this \\"movie\\"! It is indeed the worst movie I've ever seen, however it's so bad it's hysterically funny. This poor film has a huge identity crisis going on, is it soft porn, drama, comedy, or what? Example; towards the end of Cellblock, there is a tense fight scene which takes place in the cell. One of the charecters, (I won't mention who and spoil the fun!), reaches over and grabs a milk CARTON, cracks it against a table and comes at the other with those jagged edges! I think once a year, everyone who has seen this should get together, watch the movie, and then have a great Cellblock Q party afterwards to celebrate the movie ending!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unwatchable and CORNY","review":"I bought this video with the intention that, while KNOWING it would be bad, I'd find some glimmer of camp value in the cheesey storyline or dialogue. There is not. How this version of a script could be made without someone walking in and yelling \\"Stop, let's cut our losses\\" is beyond me. Imagine 90 something minutes of porn acting and porn plot with no porn... And done poorly! (And that might even make some of you think, I LOVE bad movies, I want to watch it... ) It's not even BAD in any funny sense of the word. It's just \\"wrong.\\" Rent it if you must.

Not worth 1 star or wasting the actual plastic of the CD box."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read!","review":"Interesting and entertaining collection of true life regional murder mysteries, ranging from the somewhat infamous (Frankie Silver) to the obscure. The common factor in all of them is that they occur in Appalachia in the 19th to early 20th century, a time and culture in which ideas of right and wrong were more rigid and citizens were more willing to mete out justice themselves.A great evenings read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Text Book","review":"I had a class in Panama taught out of this book. I don't recommend it for that purpose. If you're interested in learning some general stuff about t he tropics, it's great (If you can stand the author's personality). I find the book to be awkwardly organized and overly repetitive. It's three time's as long as it needs to be for the information it contains. The information within is a mixture of personal observations and widely accepted facts without clearly distinguishing which are which. Save your money, get something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good companion to other books","review":"Wonderfully researched, if sometimes silly in the execution.

Kricher's book is the perfect companion. Can be read in advance to prepare yourself for the astounding diversity of species and environments or consulted for immediate information through an excellent index. The well written and thorough text is a joy to read. Be warned the variety of animal, plant and insect species is unbelievable and Kricher's book is not a field guide. He does cover many of the common species, but if you are a bird, plant, reptile or insect nut, then bring appropriate field guides."},{"rating":"2","title":"great general guide","review":"This book provides a good overview of several ecosystem types within the neotropics, including information on plants, insects, birds, mammals, and inter-species interactions. It's written in an academic but accessible style. My only criticism is the presence of numerous typographical and measurement-conversion errors in the book. Overall, I would definitely recommend this book - I brought it with me to Peru, and read it from cover to cover."},{"rating":"2","title":"The ultimate hard-boiled crime novel.","review":"It's a crime that this book is currently out of print. If Paul Cain had published more novels (this was his only one, though he wrote many fine short stories), he might well be as famous as Hammett and Chandler. One reviewer, years ago, wrote that reading Fast One was like traveling to Antarctica -- once you arrived, there was no where else to go. In other words, this novel is truly the hardest, toughest, bleakest and bloodiest of the hard-boiled genre. It defines the outer edges of tough-guy fiction. Spare, terse and without redeeming social value, it is a remarkable work. I highly recommend it. Do whatever you can to find a copy, but you can't have mine"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to Read Edition","review":"After reading \\"Seven Slayers\\" (the collection of seven of Paul Cain's short stories) I had to read Cain's one and only novel, \\"Fast One.\\" The only problem was that it was hard to find at a reasonable price. I was glad to see it back in print and available at Amazon.com; however, I was highly disappointed in the Blackmask.com edition (the one star is solely for this specific copy, not the book itself).I admire what Blakmask Online is doing, but they need to take more care in their editing of classic works. The erratic use of punctuation and frequent misspellings make it almost unbearable to read. I feel like I need another edition just to see if what I am reading was actually written by Paul Cain.Ultimately, if you want to enjoy this novel I would suggest picking up a used copy from another publisher. Paul Cain's work deserves much better treatment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"Prof. Baron Joseph A.

However, if you try to using it holding it like a pencil, which I usually do unless I'm whisking a stiff batter and can tilt the bowl a lot, it's very uncomfortable in the hand. Also, the heavily weighted handle means that it often falls out of small bowls. Finally, if I use this in a non-stick pan I worry about scratching the coating. I'm going to try the WMF with the plastic handle and silicon balls, hoping that it's more ergonomic and that the handle is lighter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too stiff","review":"I had used a longer whisk like this at my sister's house and liked it very much, but this short one was much too stiff.

I tried not to be put off by such errors, but after that tenth time I read the possessive \\"Doris Duke'ss&quot.

But even more than this, is the subject matter--Doris Duke. I find her to be a very bad example of a human being. Who cares who much money she gave out. She was self absorbed and has made no significant contribution to this world."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Surprise","review":"I've understood the syntax of C++ and the basic ideas of OO for some time now, but I have not used these tools professionally because OO design is so hard, and I have little experience. I have often wished I had a book that would help me evaluate an OO design, and determine what its weaknesses were. This is that book.I especially like the format; the author presents an OO class and then step by step tears it down and shows you what's broken about it. For each problem and its corresponding solution, the author presents a rule of thumb that can help you avoid similar design mistakes in the future. Some of the material is specific to C++, but a lot of it is applicable to any OO language."},{"rating":"1","title":"Introduction to C++ class design","review":"This book does not cover programming style in the traditional usage of the term. There is no discussion of general programming practice, naming conventions, documentation, commenting, formatting, and layout. The best target audience for this book is newcomers to C++ having difficulty with class design. Chapters on abstraction, consistency, inheritance, virtual functions, operator overloading, wrappers, and multiple inheritance provide solid guidance. The author repeats principals in multiple chapters such as \\"Look for simple abstractions\\", \\"Reduce coupling - minimize interactions between classes\\", and \\"Usually, the destructor in a public base class should be virtual\\". Substantial amounts of code listings appear in the book (approximately 20% of the pages)."},{"rating":"1","title":"a bit stilted","review":"history reads as if it were written for Scotchmen exclusively. Not enough bio data on figures that are introduced so there is no grounding .....also, I never fail to marvel at how many histories invariably allude to their first settlers encountering the \\"indigenous\\" people.

I would recommend purchasing another musical toy instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Care Bears Dance 'N Play Piano","review":"The toy is not durable. My granddaughter (not 3 mo old yet) & I played with it. During that time the middle bear broke off it's base. The plastic broke and a piece chipped off also. It will not glue back on.

It needs to be made stronger to keep up with the Care Bear name.Thank You."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute but boring","review":"My daughter got this when she was 23 months old. I think she was too old for it by then- She would occasionally push the buttons to hear a song play, but that's about it. We have other toy pianos, but she never liked this one. (By the way, there are 8 keys, but it only plays 4 different songs.) I agree with the other reviewers about the noise; it is way too loud. We put a piece of packing tape over the speaker, which brought the music volume down to a much better level."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of fun for my little girl","review":"I got this for my daughter around her first birthday. She really enjoyed it and played with it everyday. I didn't find it annoying, especially seeing how much she liked it. She would give the care bears kisses. That led us to more care bear stuff, but I think they have a good message overall. She also really likes the rainbow motif that is on this toy and other care bear toys.

The dub is good -- they do a competent job, although you have to get used to new pronunciations of \\"Macross\\" and \\"Fokker.\\" However, I will not be buying the rest of these, for the sole reason that they censored the DVD terribly by cutting out Minmei's famous shower scene from episode 4. That's right, one of the most famous scenes in 80s anime, which was left 80% intact by Carl Macek, yet they throw the whole scene out. This is perplexing, since they allow Misa to say \\"Oh, S---!\\" in a scene where she says nothing of the kind in Japanese.

I expected this book to be some thing like Palm OS Companion guide which explains every thing about the OS. Even after paying for the book (Palm OS Companion is free) I am not satisfied.

Members of the design team describe various features of the O/S in their own words along with trivia about MS politics and lots of patting themselves on the back:\\"this is a cool thing we did\\".

In fact, my Seneca and Abenaki friends tell me that the writings of Ms. Sams are more about a White person's version of Native beliefs. There is too much New Age in her writings to be followed by a serious student of Native American religions. However, as a tool for Shamans, the cards and book are effective. Ms. Sams' writings present a safe approach to traveling between worlds. She encourages people to see beyond themselves.One caveat: Seneca, Hopi, Lakota, and Yaqui teachings not interchangeable. Each group has a different perspective and belief system. People should understand that Native American beliefs are community and tribal based. To learn the ceremonies, they have to go to the tribe."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true asset","review":"To anyone who appreciates the teachings of Native American, and wishes to create a conduit through which he or she can connect to higher planes of existence, our guides and souls, this set will prove itself invaluable.Personally, I found this set to be far more potent than the Medicine Cards previously released by Jamie Sams."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sacred Path Cards","review":"I was very dissapointed with this item.

The book does not present an encyclopedic picture of Benin history and culture, but it is still extremely enlightening. Printed in Italy on heavy, glossy paper, this heavy, 330-page book is semi-coffee-table in size, measuring 9 by 12 inches. My main disappointment is that most of the illustrations are monochrome, not color. Thus this 1992 book does not have the knock-your-eyes out, National Geographic impact of newer books such as the 2002 \\"Gold of the Akan from the Glassell Collection\\" by Doran Ross. But this is only a minor criticism to a very good book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not grammar or spelling","review":"This book was a complete waste of money. The activities are silly busy work; they involve no instruction or learning. There are no lessons of any kind. Examples of activiities include: Write a sentence that uses every letter in the alphabet or Invent 5 words by spelling common words backwards to mean their opposites. Another gem is: Calculate how many scrabble points you would get for spelling your own name then think of as many words as you can that have the same point value as your name.If you just want cutesy activities, the book may be of some use. For every 20 worthless activities there may be one activity that relates to grammar or spelling (1.e. Rewrite the following sentences so the pronouns relate to the antecedent).

Ralph has always been capable of effortlessly vacillating and simultaneously joining seemingly disparaging musical genres into a single masterpiece. This collection simply epitomizes this unique ability. As the vocal four-count intro to the stunning duet \\"Mi Ricordo\\" hardly prompts the listener for the coming intertwined harmonies, the drum-machine laden \\"One Million Miles Away\\" is the most widely accessible of the regretfully-short track listing. Fans of classical will adore, fans of music will appreciate. I've listened to the album 20+ times in the short period I have owned it and still am brought to shivers by the simply stunning melodies of this masterpiece. I would have few qualms in paying 100+ dollars for this; the paltry sum it asks is almost insulting.

When we bought this, it was poorly assembled and it wouldn't even stand up straight because it wobbled horribly! I'm not abouttttt to let my son climb on something that's just going to topple over on top of him. Also, there is no room at the top for him to sit before sliding down the mountain of a slide, not to mention NOTHING to hold on to for support on his downhill race. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone-- buyers beware!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"especially great for inside","review":"My son got this slide at 18 months and loves it.

The worst thing, however, is that there is no place at the top of the slide for the child to get himself in a sitting position to go down slide. This is a very poorly designed product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Birthday Fun","review":"Bought this for my daughter's first birthday and she has enjoyed since day one.

It took me several minutes to clear out my horn. The cork grease was ok, but I'm not even going to try to put the key oil on my horn, because everything else is of such low quality.

Now all three boys can watch what they want and it makes a quiet trip wherever we go! We even purchased a new vehicle without the DVD player because these work so well!!!

This player will only recognize the first track of each folder. After that, it splits up the MP3s into about 30-60 mp3 tracks per MP3. It's horrid.Other than that, the item is small and light.

The warranty period is one of the shortest for all DVD manufacturers.When the product stopped working I tried multiple (and I mean multiple) times to get in touch with the customer support line to find a repair location (the warranty had long since expired). They don't even answer the phone. All you can do is leave a message.After multiple messages left (from both my wife and I)no call back ever. A poor product and even worse customer support."},{"rating":"2","title":"died in 6 months","review":"This is an edit of my previous review. Originally I gave it 4 stars. If I could change that (Amazon doesn't allow changes to the star system), I would change it to 1 star. After only 6 months of very light usage, it suddenly gave out. The motor doesn't spin the disc. The player was handled very gently, so it's not due to misuse, apparently just cheap and poor engineering. After reading other reviews, I see that most unhappy buyers got no satisfaction from either Amazon or Audiovox, so I guess I will just chalk it up as a learning experience and avoid Audiovox products in the future"},{"rating":"2","title":"great little DVD player","review":"We purchased this DVD player for my son to watch on a four day road trip. The DVD player always worked, kept my son very entertained the whole trip. I have seen better pictures from more expensive units but I doubt that my son noticed.

I asked her about it a few weeks ago and she told me it only worked for a few weeks. Apparently it only had a 30-day guarantee and I am past that time frame. It would be cheaper for me to just buy a new one at a store brand-new from a reputable dealer where I can actually go in an speak with a person.

Also when hooked up to an external monitor, the image was too dark, and setting the brightness control to brighter didn't make the picture on the external monitor any brighter.I can't recommend this except for kids watching cartoons or something directly on the screen who aren't sensitive to the jumpy/freezy picture quality.

Probably the best of the Lonesome Strangers' albums, along with their excellent self titled album. This is fine rockin' country with a true 'new traditionalist' feel for the hillbilly roots, but it all new songs, no homages or covers, no rural corn and no rustic hokum.I'm tempted to call this alt.country. But thankfully minus the whole self consiously alt-iness that weakens the whole alt.country genre. In a way it is musically comparable to Robbie Fulks although where Fulks specialises in a cynical lyric line, the Lonesome Strangers follow a more traditional country lyric line.One of my favourite country albums, I think if you give it a chance it could be one of yours' too. I wish I knew what happened to these guys."},{"rating":"1","title":"A real disappointment...","review":"I knew I was in for a real disappointment when boredom set in within the first 10 minutes of the movie. It's a plotless flick where Seb, who was recently dumped by his boyfriend, begins a quest for a new mate. He meets Georgie at a local 'sauna' and starts a sexual spree where he procees to engage in encounters with nearly anyone who crosses his path. Totally absent of talent, the actors display a lot of flesh, however, strategic camera angles leave everything to the imagiation.All in all it's a pretty worthless film. I rushed out and bought it, and I'm sorry I did!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Could this movie possibly suck more?","review":"It's basically a porno that doesn't let you see anything. Plot: 7 or 8 ugly guys switch between telling a boring \\"true\\" story in monotones and scenes of sex. While they are all completely naked at one point or another, it's softcore, so you don't actually see anything. All the men are ugly anyway, so there's really no point. Rocks have better acting skills, to the point where you can actually see one of the actors reading his lines off a cue card.In the end, you're better off spending your money on a REAL porno that will offer hotter guys, better lines, SOME semblance of a plot, and actual sex."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game for Warhammer fans!","review":"This is the best thing since Warcraft and Starcraft.

I was going to buy this game because of all the hype I had heard about it... good thing I borrowed it.To start the game is too short to be worth my $50. And it's not challenging at all. The 12 missions that you get just don't justify the price tag. I can get WarCraft 3 (both RoC and FT) for about the same price and I have, roughly, 8 times the game as DoW. The only differences would be that WC3 would have a degree of challenge. But wait... WC3 doesn't have that nice camera that can go down to ground level so you can be in the midst of the action... and you can't forget the glitches and bugs that plague this game... isn't that worth the $50 right there? Nah.Bottom line. If you like RTS games, your money is better off somewhere else... actually, ANYWHERE else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good RTS","review":"When I saw this summer that this game would be released close to the release date of Rome:Total War (late september) I thought that I would buy this one first and quickly move on to Rome. Kind of like the appetizer before the main course. But it is December and I am still on the appetizer. This game is beautifully rendered and very fun to play. Some other reviewers were right to say this is what Starcraft 2 would look like if Blizzard ever had the guts to make it.When you zoom in to the action you marvel at the graphics. Just like everyone else has said already the highlights are the multiplayer and the skirmishes. I think they kind phoned it in for the single player campaign.

Also, they do not stand tall enough when the table is at the sharpest angle and whatever is on it (ie: books, pc keyboard) slides off so I have to use a piece of shelf liner.

Its C-shaped legs enable me to pull it up close to me while I sit back on the sofa. The table surface looks like wood grain but is really just plastic. Other sources on the internet say it can hold up to 50 lbs. May be it can, and maybe it can't. Judging by its sturdiness (or lack thereof) I am not going to try. The Table-Mate II works for what I bought it for, but IMHO I think it is a little too pricey, because of the low quality material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"I owned 3 Table-Mate II's before purchasing this one. My other 3 are all white and I decided I would get a wood grain one for another room. What I received was nothing like the other 3 I have.

My recommendation is don't wast your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this table. If you do, you will be outraged.

When I saw Table-Mate II in the description, I assumed it was a more advanced and better version of the table I already have. Flimsy doesn't even cover it. It barely stands up on its own. If you look at it, it will fall over. It is no exaggeration to say it is worthless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Table Mate II ripoff from Polaris E-Commerce Inc. (SOJITEC?) seller","review":"This item is a ripoff of the original TableMate II. Its materials are flimsy, lacks slide cup holder and large stamped TM II logo on front side of table top. The metal support rod used to adjust the table top angle doesn't latch into the hooks due to its thinness. I own three previous original TM IIs that have sturdy materials, a sliding cup holder and the TM II logo stamped on the front side of the table top; their support rod diameter is 3 to 4 times thicker than the one in this table. Note that the shipping box had a very small Table Mate II sticker, but a big \\"Made in China\\" label. The shipping invoice indicated that it was actually sold by Polaris E-Commerce Inc. (SOJITEC?)."},{"rating":"1","title":"New Table Model is Inferior to the Earlier Model of the same table","review":"I have purchased two (2) other Table-Mate II Woodgrain tables previously and am very satisfied with those. However, this one has been changed by the manufacturer. The support bar for the underside of the flat surface has been downsize in diameter. The support bar will not stay in place if the table is lifted as is the case with my previous tables. This makes it very awkward and un-safe when you try to relocate the table to different locations. Can the support bar be replace with the larger diameter bar like the one on the earlier models?Regards,kwm55@mediacombb.net"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrid Piece of Import Trash","review":"Our therapist helping grandma had a table mate II and it was perfect.

Not many TV tables are going to be as stable as a kitchen table probably. I like this cause it pulls up close to me on the couch for using the computer.

The one thing I don't like for what I do with the computer is the lip around the edge, but for other things it would probably be nice so stuff doesn't fall off.

If you don't have that sort of agenda when watching a movie, however, you might want to stay away from this one. It's deliberately obscure in many places, to the point of self-indulgence and beyond.

Your only choice is to return it as defective or buy a thin chain to replace the cord (defeating the \\"pink\\" look).

Some of these tracks I don't care for -- the more lightweight stuff by Tamba Trio, for example, but for a taste of artists such as Carlos Lyra or Dick Farney, this is definitely worth it. Also has the superstars, and the super songs. The liner notes are the clincher -- they're rambunctiously affectionate and enthusiastic, random and sloppy. It's like reading a really great DIY zine on Brazilian pop, with little articles on artists, producers, styles, etc. Definitely recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Basic intro to Direct Draw and Win 95 Game programming","review":"A good book if you already know windows programmingThe sample code compiled w/o difficulty under VC++ 4.1 and ran fine. The example game is a 1st person role playing game with 4 points of view (not DOOM like ).It concentrates on Direct Draw and only spends a bit of time on Direct Play, Direct Sound, etc...The author leads you through the chapters, building each portion of the example game until complete. Along the way, he introduces you to various Win 95 Game SDK functions and game theory. He takes an object oriented approach by creating a set of classes to encapsulate the major pieces of the SDK ( Direct Draw, Direct Sound ). He also develops some game creation utilities like a map editor to assist with game development.It assumes you know C/C++ and know Windows programming. I found it to be a good book if you've never written a game before. However, if you're looking to build high speed, multi-player, net games, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Satisfying","review":"No information on Direct3D, DirectPlay or DirectInput; The included game is slow and turn-based.

The charming stylized pen and ink illustrations which accompany each biography help to \\"give a face\\" to the lives retold. What makes this collection of saint's lives unique is its approach of presenting the spiritual heroes and heroines in the light of a particular Catholic doctrine or moral teaching which was most apparent in their living of the Faith. This volume would be a blessed complement to Christian education in the home or at school, as well as bedtime story-telling.

As with other purchasers of this awful awful slide, getting the tube through and the caps to stick on was nearly impossible. I did succeed, but only after significant contortions and more than a few curse words. I've never cursed over putting together a toy. Never. Even the bike from China with the poorly translated instructions were easier than this.Little Tikes, here's a few suggestions:1. Don't ask the customer to hammer the end of a pliable plastic tube in order to jam it into a cap and then expect the tube to remain straight enough to thread through six holes.2. Spend the $0.50 and provide the stupid wooden block.3. Change the order of assembly so that first thread the tube of frustration, then cap it on both sides, then attach the stairs. Trust me, it would have been easier that way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible assembly","review":"I agree with all who complaint about the assembly. It is one of the worst product to assemble.

My daughter is 2 years old and love the slides in the park which is even higher than this slide. So I decided to buy something that she can play around in the apartment knowing that winter is coming and she won't be able to play in the park.We have a playground area in our aparmtent and it has a stable cushion and child safe area. My husband install this slide and put it in the \\"playground\\". My daughther tried it several times then she was smack on the floor with her lips bleeding and swelling. Remember there is a cushion. But the slide throw her hard that even with the cushion, she got hurt. I hate this slide. Nobody should invent something or sell something like this.Of course I called Amazon! They will refund everything and even pick up the item here for return. But they or little tikes company cannot fix the damage they did to my daughter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sliderific!","review":"The little Tikes indoor outdoor slide is an absolute delight. This is the answer to not being able to visit the playground in the winter. If you have a busy toddler with lots of energy, this slide is a great outlet. It's steep, durable, and easy to assemble. Be mindful the slide accumilates lots of static electricity after excessive use. Periodically wiping the slide down with a fabric softner prevents your little ones from being shocked everytime they zip down the slide. I highly recommend it to parents who are looking for a safe and fun recreation for their little tikes!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for kids","review":"Great toy. Unfortunately my youngest son is almost 2 & he doesn't support himself well when going down the slide. He suffered abrasions to his lower back area along his spine. When he lands, his bottom hits the ground and his back scrapes the bottom lip of the slide. Could be because he is a petit child and the bottom of the slide sits high off the ground.

I wouldn't recommend this same slide to anyone- not even my worst enemy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"This slide is a peice of junk. I spent over an hour on Christmas eve trying to assemble this slide. Just like the other reviews the plastic tube that connects the slide to the stairs is horrible. It bends so we haven't been able to get the end caps on it. The wholes don't line up so my husband had to hammer it through to connect the 2 pieces. My daughter desperately wants to use it but I think we are going to return it considerign we can't get the end caps on. Plus it just doesn't seem like it will last. Garbage for a Little Tykes toy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Assembly is not that difficult","review":"I was able to assemble the slide within 20 minutes, as other reviewers have. I can't imagine anyone needing four hours and a drill. When putting the rod in, I put a wire coathanger (unbent with a small hook at the end) in the rod to both guide it through the holes and tug it. Worked like a charm.Our 21 month old daughter loves the slide. At 5 feet long, it is twice as long as the slides on other climber playsets (i.e. the Step2 Woodland Climber).Like any outdoor play equipment, we put a good six inches of soft wood chips on the ground surrounding the slide for safety."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad, Buy the Step 2 slide","review":"This slide was not at all up to Little Tikes standards...It was very difficult to assemble. The hollow tube used to keep the slide attached to the stand was the worst. The end caps were difficult to attach to the tube, the tube bent under the pressure of trying to attach the end caps and guiding the tube through the stand and the slide was extremely difficult because the tube was bent. In addition, the cross bar that holds the slide to the stand never stayed hooked. After several attempts, I got the slide together. Within minutes the end caps fell off of the tube and the crossbar unhooked. We repacked the side and returned it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk!","review":"I have to agree with the other reviewer on the assemble of this slide. Putting the red caps on the end of the plastic pipe is impossible. The pipe bends and becomes so deformed that the end caps are impossible to put on.

Assembly was not difficult, but hinge rod at top of slide was about 1\\" too short and we had to really press the sides of the slide together to get the end cap fasteners on.Slide was delivered in a box that was almost completely destroyed in shipment. Luckily, no parts were missing and slide was not damaged."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Advised For Children or Adults","review":"I wish my wife had found these reviews before buying this item. Our experience mirrored precisely what others have complained of here. The plastic tube that is meant to join the ladder and the slide portion, serving as the top hinge, does not easily tap into the caps that are meant to secure it in place at the ends. Instead, the plastic tube splinters and shears at the end that makes contact with the first cap; it then flattens as you hammer it to increase the diameter further at the other end (making it less likely that the second cap will ever seat). It's nice to know that Little Tikes hasn't responded to customer complaints about this and that they continue to marked the same ill-fabricated junk. They should've done right by the consumer and used a metal connecting rod."},{"rating":"1","title":"Assembly Nightmare","review":"I got his slide thinking it would be easy...wow was I wrong. It took me 4 hours and a trip to Home Depot to by a drill. My slide didn't have holes drilled where the support attachment goes, so I had to drill my own holes, which turned into a nightmare. I can not for the life of me get the caps on, but the slide works without them so far. I will have to work on them some more though. I still don't know if it is together properly because the base is leaning forward, however that is the only way I could get the support arm to attach. I would have promptly returned this, but I live pver an hour from Toys R Us...I made the mistake of not reading reviews before purchasing. For the price I pai ($80) it should not have taken 4 hours to put together plus additional expenses for a drill. The instructions need written directions too and just not pictures."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great slide","review":"I got this slide for my 2 year old son's birthday and he loves it!

All too often those who do not work in the schools are eager to offer solutions that are impossible to implement with limited resources. It makes great reading, but that is as far as it goes. The truth is that the attitudes and skills of teachers, administrators and Board members are critical. If the Board of Education can speak with one voice, instead of encouraging individual Board members to wander about making statement that do not reflect the sentiment of the entire Board, and offer clear guidance and support for the staff, leadership can be nutured. In Building Leadership Capacity in Schools Linda Lamberts demonstrates her thorough understanding of these dynamics. It's an important primer for building leadership in the public schools.

It really is all her thoughts on a variety of topics. In a sense it is a sequel to Ghost Brigades, and really should only be read after that to make sense of what Sagan is thinking.

To make much sense of this work, one would need to be familiar with the other books.I can see how this might have been useful as an internal work to flesh out the character of Jane Sagan for the novels but as a stand alone work for the reader of those novel, it is boring.Some may like this book.

It's not just introspection, it's boring introspection. I listened to the audiobook, and this is the first book I've listened to at 2x speed. I kept hoping something would happen, but it did not.I will grant that the author wanted a departure from the action of the prior two books in the Old Man's War series, and if it were well done that would be fine. Sagan writes a love letter to the protagonist of book one explaining all she is giving up to be with him.The problem is that I don't think Sagan is the horrible poet she is made to be. The book is full of poor verse.

How lucky to discover her wonderful writings. I recommend it to all,"},{"rating":"2","title":"Foreign Correspondence - an Australian childhood.","review":"What does the world look like from a backyard 2000 miles belowthe equator? In Sydney, Australia, Geraldine Brooks grows up longingto find out. This is her memoir of how she did it with a little help from her global pen pals. That's the short of it! The long of it is a lively, humorous ever-so-familiar memoir of a girl's family life in a working-class suburb Down Under during the 1950s & 1960s. Absorbing & thought-provoking. As a life-time pen-pal this book brought back many memories!..."},{"rating":"1","title":"just stick to the bass","review":"straight up larry graham is a music legend.his bass style of playing was ground-breaking.back with sly&the family stone.his 70's grooves still rock.that was as good as it would get.this album showcases his talent but isn't good at all.prince can't do nothing for him musically.prince should try to get with Sly and then you might get results.u move me is a cool track that prince should have kept for himself for something catchy.but this album is boring and the production is weak.larry graham is not a lead vocalist.if you want a bass player that gives you something all thru an album then check out bootsy's straight out of p' university."},{"rating":"1","title":"EL STINKO!","review":"Larry Graham was(and probably still is)one of the greatest pluck bassists of all time.(They say he was the first bass player to pluck)I own a majority of Graham's albums, and this has got to be the worst ever! Alot of old school artists tend to rely on some of the new artists to help them produce their new projects. NOT! I think these artists should just find it in themselves to create the good music they used to make or just call it quits. He had some help from Prince on this and it still sounds wacked! This is $11.99 plus tax that I will never recover."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disgrace!","review":"Prior to the release of this album, there was a lot of talk on the Artist's web site. I was really looking forward to a new GCS album, but was utterly disappointed. It seems that all the great funkateers of the good old days have traided the funk for R&B/rap/hip-pop type of stuff and have traided their original instruments for synths and drum computers. Larry Graham is no exception. I must admit I am actually in no position to review this album as I have only listened to it twice. I couldn't take more. I think that about sums it up. I suggest funk fans to buy Release yourself or Now Do-U Wanta dance or Aint no bout a-doubt it or the early Sly and the family stone stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Belushi is the man","review":"Man if you ever thought you were SOL, watch this movie. Belushi totally kicks rear end as Rick Latimer, a take-no-crap motorcycle riding teacher who is assigned to Brandel High School, the worst high school in the city, which even offers rape and weed as majors.

James Belushi is a solid actor and can be very funny at times. This is an interesting role for him."},{"rating":"2","title":"A gunny classic","review":"This is a top notch book, and a gripping thriller. The central dude, Barney Rivers hits on a scam to make a small amount of money. Enlisting help from his mates, it all seems to go very well- until the dude from whom the money was stolen comes looking for it, leaving him and his friends with seven days to prepare for the final confrontation.Written in tight terse prose, and progressivly getting more exciting, the last few chapters are virtually unputdownable. The final fire fight is told in a gripping style, and is most enjoyable. You even get the odd flash of humour and snappy one liners.If you like thrillers, or books about guns, this is the way to go.Grade:A"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ehh..","review":"I admit. Wait, we can all admit.. we've all watched the Power Rangers before. In my case, I was addicted but that is another story. When I was little, this used to be the music we'd 'jam,' to. At any rate - Now when I listen to this CD, the music is a bit tasteless and it wouldn't be an everyday album you'd pop in and listen to. All in all, you have to listen to it for about 4 years inorder to chew it all up. In that case - you'll enjoy it much more."},{"rating":"2","title":"go turbo rangers go","review":"turbo the movie is the stage for thenext verson of the tv show /power rangers turbo/im a big fan"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good decorations, awful snacks","review":"Yes, these Peeps have been around forever, but I do not know how they have managed to survive when nowadays there are way healthier, and equally as fun snacks. The main ingredients are sugar, corn syrup (they do not use the \\"high fructose\\" now), and colorants. Nothing very good for children's health, plus they do NOT taste good. Sure, their colors catch everybody's attention, but most people (children and adults) will put them down after a couple of bites. The one star is for their decoration merits. They indeed cheer up any Easter buffet table."},{"rating":"1","title":"Monster able M1000 Component video cable","review":"This was a colossal waste of money - thoroughly unusable!
