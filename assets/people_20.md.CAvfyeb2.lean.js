When Miss Julia smacks a bad guy with her hand bag and notes something like, \\"I had a bottle of Metamucil in there and it made a nice impact when it hit him in the head,\\" I cracked up. The author delivers some excellent contrasts in characters; between proper Miss Julia and P.I. Pickens and the racetrack figures and the Baptist preacher and the cops and the lawyers, she writes 'em the way we all can see 'em and it's just so good. A bit of commentary on the legal system in there, too: I liked what she said about the law and how anybody can say anything they want and cause the police to come to the door to \\"snatch and grab\\" a child, and it's so WRONG.

It claims to be based solely on the Bible, but Fugate takes verses out of context. The rod verses were never meant to be taken literally. When you look into the Hebrew meanings of the rod verses of Proverbs, it's clear that they mean to discipline children, but not spank them. Read Matthew 18:1-15. It is clear Jesus does not want us to hurt them and actually gives severe warning to people who hurt children \\"Beware lest anyone cheat you through philosophy and empty deceit, according to the tradition of men, according to the basic principles of the world, and not according to Christ\\"[Comment: The consequences for these believers are graphically described in 2 Peter 2:18-22.Check out [...] for more info on the true meanings of the rod verses.

This of course concentrates the same force on fewer sqauare centimeters of skin, concentrating the pain and the liklihood of causing bruising and subcutaneous bleeding.It seems more like a tome form the 1500s, the Dark Ages, out of medieval England, where children were chattel. It ignores all principals of child development, and the \\"advice\\" in it could get parents in trouble with the law -- except that he instructs that these punishments must be meted out in secret, for the \\"safety of the parents.\\" It made me shudder."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trash","review":"This book is nothing but techniques on how to hurt your children. If you actually love your children, you will stay far away from it. It should not even be legal with the abuse that is recommended in it. Other stores have already stopped selling it because of its violent nature. I would recommend a book that teaches how to raise children, not how to hurt them. You don't need instruction on how to hit a child anyway, but that is all this book teaches. There is nothing in this book that teaches someone how to be a real parent. It only teaches how to be just another child that hits and fights and throws temper tantrums."},{"rating":"1","title":"Child Abuse!","review":"When I browsed through this book at my local Christian bookstore, I was so upset that I had to leave the store. Millions of Christian parents and pastors have read the Bible, prayed, and have come to different conclusions than Mr. Fugate about how children should be treated. Just because an author says that his book is based on the Bible doesn't mean that his interpretation is valid. I tried to think of a polite way of saying this, but I don't know what else to say except that I believe that Mr. Fugate is a disturbed and cruel person. His basic philosophy of child rearing boils down to: hit your kids with sticks, beginning when they learn how to crawl, and continuing practically until they are adults. Fugate's idea of child development information is to tell you to increase the size of the stick you hit your kids with as they get older. He has stated that it is acceptable for parents to hit children until they are bruised.

Whipping an adult is the crime of assault and battery; whipping a baby is child-abuse. What would Jesus do? \\"Let the little children come to me.\\" Whipping babies is not love.

Saturated with biblical support, the book opens with the God-ordained concepts of creation, leadership, authority, and obedience. Fugate then links these concepts to parental responsibility and a child's obedience. The author then shows how a child's response to physical authorities(parents, teachers, government) influence his or her response to the authority of God and His Word.

Although, I guess the author might argue that he won't be able to hear himself scream.But chapter 17 is the most repugnant to anyone who loves children.

There IS another way--it's to treat our children the way God treats us--with love, guidance, teaching, gentleness, and grace. We are to treat others the way we want to be treated.

I wonder, in following the Old Testament, if the author advocates stoning someone for gathering sticks on the Sabbath, or declaring your children unclean if they eat pork?

It makes them feel important, powerful, authoritative, and in control. They take a secular position (physical punishment is good) and then thumb through the Bible for passages that seem to support their position. J. Richard Fugate is yet another practitioner of this kind of child abuse wrapped up in biblical launguage. Of course, one could choose the same method to posit biblical support for adultery, incest, polygamy, slavery, the rigid suppression of women, and infanticide. The truth is that Mr. Fugate's counsel has nothing to do with Jesus of Nazareth who would be lothe to hit children.

There is no demonstration of any understanding of child development. The entire goal seems to be to beat children into submission, using pain as the \\"teacher\\", all in the name of raising a \\"Godly\\" child. Fugate's Biblical interpretations are questionable and appeal only to the most rigid of authoritarian mentalities. This book describes a very effective way to turn children AWAY from God. It is very sad... so sad, and is dangerous to the well being of any child who has parents who accept the advice of abuse this book dictates. The Christian parent would find much better advice in the Discipline Book by Dr. William Sears (a pediatrician and a Christian)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Child abuse manual","review":"This is one of the most disgusting things I have ever read.

As a psychologist who works with poverty level children and families, I have been training parents to communicate, set firm limits, support and love their children. Our parents have been successful in helping change negative behaviors of children by changing their own negative behaviors. They are successful without hitting.I'd like to report the author and supporting reviewers to the authorities.

A recent study showed that the actual rate may be 40 times higher than the official rate. Many children, even babies, die from physical abuse. To tell parents, as Fugate does, that parents, in punishing children in such a way, are \\"carrying out God's judgment\\" (p.223) is to encourage a dangerous practice and cloak it in religion. Fugate says that beating a child with a rod is the \\"maximum expression of true love\\" (p. 21). This sends a confusing message of \\"love\\" and hurt. I fear this book may do much harm to good intentioned parents and vulnerable children."},{"rating":"1","title":"God doesn't spank babies","review":"How can anyone believe that God pulls baby's diapers off and whips their bottoms?

Fugate recommends whipping infants 6 months old and younger, and beating children up to 20 years old with wooden dowel rods. He doesn't spare disabled children either, describing beating a deaf boy and one with cerebral palsy. He also writes that \\"parents should not be overly concerned\\" if the beatings cause welts and bruises (p.174)!!Chapter 17, which goes into frightening detail about how to beat infants and children, is disgusting! This chapter pretty much sums up the nature of the book, beat a child from age 0 to 20 with \\"rods\\", for any \\"act of rebellion\\". They are \\"sinful, dirty and selfish\\", and the parents have the right to demand instant obedience and total control, whether the parents' requests are right or wrong!!How sad that educated \\"Christians\\" in our society actually believe this trash!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"This is a great book for your kids or grandchildren to read to at night.

The s-video cable from Nintendo makes graphics sharper and colors more vivid than the standard composite cable. The cost of Nintendo s-video cable is about ten dollars more than Intec, but the difference in the clarity of image is night and day.

This model TV actually improves graphics quality on its own with Progressive Scan DRC, but I know upgrading from the standard AV connection that the image can look better with either an S-VIDEO cable or a component cable. Seeing as how the component cable is now selling for $50-$80, I can't justify sinking that kind of cash into my Gamecube at this point. I'm going to go for the Monster S-Video cable for $15.

Far from being the scum of the galaxy, the characters are nice and polite to excess. Far from being a wild action-adventure, the plot involves mostly drills and chit chat.I think what went wrong is this. Robert Asprin is too serious to be funny and too nice to be nasty. \\"Phule's Company\\" is not really funny. The jokes are few and they fall flat every time. There's not a single real laugh in here. Asprin likes Phule and his crew too much to really mock them. As for plot, there's no there there. We can't really cheer for the characters because they have so little to overcome.

Upon looking at the other comments, I don't understand what people see in this book. Obviously it is character-based, which I'm not used to, but I think there's something more than that.

Miranda reminded me too much of myself, and my frustration about being \\"trapped\\" in this book only grew as I read it. I became so utterly frustrated that it was difficult to read this book at all for me.

While this book pretends to be science, SURVIVING GALERAS is a better book. It is a true life adventure with science and history to supplement the story.I was distressed by what I felt was the lack of critical thinking and the acceptance by the author of one theory over another without the kind of thoughtful critical thinking needed.It is still not known exactly or even inexactly how to predict eruptions.

It is a book that has obviously been carefully researched and documented by a very competent geoligist. Victoria Bruce should be congratulated for presenting complicated scientific information and facts to a lay reader in a manner that makes them understandable. At the same time she has woven the information and well-documented facts into a fascinating account of a fateful expedition into the crater of a volcano that is about to explode. Ms. Bruce, when will you write your next book? I can hardly wait."},{"rating":"2","title":"The volcano eruptions at Nevado del Ruiz and Galeras.","review":"There are two stories in this book. The first is about the eruption of the Nevado del Ruiz volcano that resulted in the deaths of 23,000 people. The second is the death of six scientists and three Columbians in the Galeras eruption. The scientists killed were led by Stan Williams, who also substained very serious injuries. The three Columbians were local hikers in the area.If the focus was on numbers, Bruce should have concentrated her studies on the Nevado del Ruiz eruption that killed so many Columbians because of the mud slides. This was not done, but the focus was on diminishing the egotistical Stan Williams who led six of his companions to death. Both stories are worth a book of their own."},{"rating":"1","title":"apparently all knowing","review":"As an amateur geologist and full time scientist I was very disappointed in this book. The science of volcanology is very imprecise and there are many unknowns. The author seems to feel that the scientists on Galeras should have known the eruption was imminent. The very nature of our knowledge of volcanology is that we don't know when eruptions will happen. Has the author ever been to an active volcano? To people with only superficial knowledge this book may seem to be very authoratative but I found the omniscient attitude very unscientific."},{"rating":"1","title":"no apparent understanding","review":"The author looks back with 20/20 hindsight at the Galeras tragedy and second guesses the leading volcanologists in the world. Her credentials are suspect. She seems to be cashing in on the much more authoratative Surviving Galeras by presenting the author Stanley Williams as a vain maverick. Williams addresses the controversy visible now after the eruption but Bruce presents all the volcanologists as either good or evil. She does not seem to grasp the nuances of science,particularly a young and very imprecise science like volcanology. She also discredits the other scientists who went to the crater. They were experienced researchers, capable of deciding the risk to themselves. Bruce portrays them as pawns in Williams ego games. An insult to the memory of the dead by a person with no obvious firsthand knowlege."},{"rating":"1","title":"nothing apparent","review":"This book seemed to be intellectually dishonest because it takes events that happenend and second guesses the scientist who were there at the time. Volcanology is a very young science with a lot of uncertainty. A truly scientific mind is able to see all the shades of gray in scientific study. The author here sees only black and white. She makes some of the scientists into devils and some saints. I liked Surviving Galeras by a genuine survivor much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Banal and Repetitious","review":"If you already have spiritual practice, this CD will likely offer nothing new.

However than I was trying to show them the different features the keyboard could do and I made some to the petals fall off. That wasn't the biggest problem. One of my daughters dropped the keyboard on the floor and not only did the petals fall off and break, but the plastic cover came off the flowers exposing the metal underneath. This I was unable to snap back on.. This product is not worth the money and not good for little toddlers. This toy was a only kept in my house for a month and than I trashed it!!!

I even thought that there wasn't a third Critters movie 'til I seen it on SyFy years ago and watched it. Then I wasn't sure what to think but now I think that it's good, the writing seems to be a little improved over the first two movies but it still has that cheesy feel to it and of course the Critters still have their sense of humor in this movie. The effects of all the movies so far have been good for their time and if they were done today I think that these movies would probably look better visually. Though there are some that may not know that with this movie was Leonardo DiCaprio's film debut and I think he done well for his first film, even if it was either a television movie or a straight to video release.

And there is little to no gore, and maybe 3 Adult Terms, through the hole film.For the third film, \\"Critter 3\\" there were many changes. Namely different hero, different setting, differnet production company, and a guarented sequel (this and part 4 were filmed back-to-back). This film trys to have more comedy than the other films, which I hate to say doesn't really work well.A young girl returns home after cammping, with mysterious eggs under her families camper.

Yet for some reason, I love this movie, and have seen it three times in the week I've rented it. Molly Shannon is absolutely brilliant, and her performance is genuinely funny and at times, touching. Even though this movie does rely on Hollywood conventions (like mawkish, one-dimensional romance) and is silly beyond its own goal (that ridiculous God spectacle that \\"guides\\" Mary), it redeems itself through the hilarious tree-smooching scenes, which are priceless, as well as many others. I'd recommend this film to anyone who wants to chill out and have a laugh -- even if you think Hollywood comedy isn't for you. This is a keeper."},{"rating":"2","title":"the Good Ole days.","review":"Superstar! Ah The good ole days of SNL.

Will Ferrell isn't very funny in any endeavor I've seen and this movie was worse than normal. This is a two joke movie and neither of the jokes is sufficient for more than about 20 seconds of material. The rest is just a cynical, derivative mish-mash that watches like it had a dozen writers, none of them willing to put any effort into the project.The parts that were supposed to be scintillating and over-the-top were instead just so much boring filler. I was going to watch the movie a second time to give it a chance to grow on me, but I just couldn't get through more than a few scenes.

The writing is awful, the acting is worse, and the plot is just plain stupid! Do not waste your time watching this movie! I wish the SNL producers would learn their lesson by now: 10 minute skits do not translate well into 90 minute movies, especially when the skit is not funny in the first place.

Mary Catherine Gallagher (Molly Shannon) is a very unpopular, and unattracive girl who is deeply in need of someone to kiss her. That is all she has wanted for all her life. She finds this person in Sky Corrigan (Will Ferrell), the most popular guy in school, who's girlfriend happens to be Evian (Elaine Hendrix), Mary's arch rival and the most popular girl in school. Along with her newfound friends in special-ed, Mary goes on her quest for Sky's kiss, and also enters a talent show to get Sky like her.

Well, I have no doubt it's just a full-blown version of a SNL skit but since I haven't watched SNL regularly for quite a while, I actually found the humor quite hilarious.

But, if you were one of the kids that even the outcasts stayed away from, then this is the movie for you. Mary Katherine Gallagher is my new hero.(As a side note, I related to this movie in almost the same way as I related to Susana Kaysen in \\"Girl, Interrupted.\\" Completely different movies in tone and substance, but the main characters are very similar in the ways they are set against the world)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Biblical??","review":"I found this book in a used store and was very excited by the title - yes I would love to learn more about the women in the Bible! Lo and behold, it wasn't very Biblical - at all. I just read the first chapter about Eve and had enough. From a Christian perspective the idea that Eve gained wisdom by eating the fruit of good and evil, and how it helped her to become a wise woman, to the fictitious story by the author of her life after the garden just sets of alarms. There is no mention of God giving Eve wisdom, helping her, and it even mocks \\"the boys\\" (Adam and sons) for their inability to grasp concepts Eve could.This book is basically just the author writing her own make-believe version of how things were, how it applies to the modern woman and telling her experiences.

The band has sacrificed some of the retro honky tonk feel that made Tired Of Drowning such a great CD, for a grittier, slightly more rock oriented feel. But the songs are so good and the playing so enthusiastic that it seems like a natural progression rather than a band changing its sound just to keep relevant. This is a 'great leap forward' in terms of recording quality, song structure and lyrics. Elizabeth Ames is confident and brassy without ever oversinging. Steel guitar player Peter Burak seems under-utilized, however.It's almost pointless to name highlights, although 'After Your Gone' and 'Kind of Funny' are really, really top notch, melancholy country pop.

I'm sure Cowan has some interesting techniques for healing through plant spirits, but he fails to share them with us in this book. Warning: This book is NOT about plants. This book is about Eliot Cowan and his (boring) pop-psychology, bumper-sticker approach to the human psyche. The book literally has quizzes to tell whether or not you are fear-dominated and lacking in earth or water or whatever... His long chapters on human psychology are not even insightful! Certainly nothing you couldn't find in the self-help section. I really recommend \\"Sacred Plant Medicine\\" by Buhner instead if you can find it. Otherwise, you'll learn way more about plant spirits by walking in the woods and having a chat with some plants instead of reading this book.

Eliot Cowan shares his own fascinating journey of discovery in a way that also offers to the reader ideas for how to do the same.

It reads like a novel with Eliot's experieces and the stories of other shamans. I study the Chinese art/science of Feng Shui and the relationships between the five elements are crucial in Feng Shui. Eliot has a profound understanding of the five elements and describes them with such clarity, you can't help but look at the world around you differently. He is a true healer, and has a wonderful connection to all beings great and small. I should know, he's treated me for twenty years with both acupuncture and plant spirit medicine. I recommend Eliot Cowan's book very strongly!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gotta Love the Rankin-Bass-masters!","review":"I was shopping this Holiday season and this CD was playing on the store's sound system. I tried to get them to sell it to me (It belonged to an employee) but I finally tracked it down. It was such a wonderful place to be: Out and about in the Christmas Season with this Rankin-Bass-fest filling the air with memories of a (now) thirty-something's childhood (1970's) Christmases. An absolute delight and despite the fact that it's thrown together from various Christmas specials, is more cohesive than most \\"mainstream\\" albums. Also, I now want to be a dentist!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I Love This Christmas CD!.","review":"This is a great CD, the songs are fun and they bring back good memories of listening to the songs when I was little and really I still love to listen to these songs and always will. I also have fond memories of watching the Christmas specials that these songs are from! All the songs on the CD are good but the best are Rudolph the Red-nosed Reindeer, Frosty The Snowman, Santa Claus Is Coming to Town, Holly Jolly Christmas, Jingle, Jingle, Jingle and Silver and Gold. I very highly recommend this CD for both the young and the young at heart!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Vintage Rankin Bass Christmas Hits","review":"Terrific presentation of some childhood favorite tunes from the Rankin Bass holiday specials of yesteryear. All tracks appear to be pulled straight from the actual specials (as opposed to stand alone studio tracks), and sound brilliant and crisp (especially for music dating back to the late 60's and 70's). Exceptional tracks include 'Put One Foot in Front of the Other' from Santa Claus is Coming to Town' and 'The Most Wonderful Day of the Year' from the epic animagic special 'Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer'. The only obvious deletions to this Sony collection are tunes from 'The Year Without a Santa Claus'. The Miser Brothers tunes are sorely missed, but perhaps there were licensing struggles to grab music from that particular special. However, for those who long for childhood memories rekindled of warmhearted Christmas specials from Authur Rankin and Jules Bass (and the mighty music of Maury Laws), this album is phenomenal and a must-have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"Ever since I was little, I always liked these Christmas favorites. When I saw there was a CD, I purchased a copy. I love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been so much better","review":"Good album for the kids, I guess, but it gets old real quick for the adults. First of all, it's so LOUD. I mean, the way it's mastered. I made a mix CD for my Kids for the car and the songs on this disc are waaaay louder than any others. I also don't understand the love for \\"The First Toymakers to the King.\\" I wouldn't have included the song at all, as it's not very good, and not very Christmassy, and yet they have two different versions here. Also, why couldn't they have used any songs from \\"The Year Without a Santa Claus?\\" This would have earned a five-star rating if they had included the Heatmiser song. They would have benefited as well from some material from \\"'Twas the Night Before Christmas\\" - the one with the mice and the clock - another Rankin/Bass production."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute and Fun!","review":"The CD is wonderful, the songs are so cute and so much fun to listen to, and it is so nice to have a cute Chrstmas CD like this mixed in the CD changer with the more traditional Christmas CD's!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as the other...","review":"I really hate to be the negative one, but this CD isn't that great, COMPARED to the one that is a much, much better find: the Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer soundtrack (you can find that one here on Amazon.com for cheaper). I bought this the other day hoping it would have the good songs from *all* those old shows, but what it did have was all the good songs from \\"Rudolph\\" and then some others which I really didn't find that appealing. I *highly* recommmend getting the Rudolph soundtrack. Its so much better, and probably what you'd enjoy more. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Less effects, more realistic, thus SCARIER","review":"First, I have not read SK's novel, so I therefore cannot evaluate this based on the book. It is good though because that way, I would not be disappointed if the movie fell short from the book's story.I have seen the remake though & here is what I have to say. Kubrick's version is simpler, uses less horror effects (maybe technology constrainsts too or maybe his own option), is less gory but it comes out scarier than its remake version. The scenes focus on the actors' expressions instead of filling it up with cinematic gory effects thus leaving more room for the viewers' imagination. I commend the kid's acting as I find it extraordinary for a kid that age to express utmost fear as if it's real."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scary scary!","review":"All those years, you thought you were married to a fairly normal guy with a few problems here and there, then all of a sudden, you find out he's a NUT!

THAT alone was the scariest part of the film. I had the same scared reaction to WHAT LIES BENEATH. For me it's the whole psychology thing, not the bloody violence and \\"Oh there's an axe murderer after me\\"... It's the realization that someone who was so close to you, that you OBVIOUSLY thought you knew turns out to be a first class freak...AND wants to kill you to boot..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blu-ray of THE SHINING the Best Version of This Film","review":"I won't go into the details of the plot of the picture. I just want to mention that the Blu-ray version of this film is the best I've seen it in years! The HD picture quality is amazing -- more clarity, depth, and richness of color. The Blu-ray also retains the original theatrical aspect ratio. (Even though the film was shot at 1.33:1 it was matted at 1.85:1 for movie theaters.) In the full screen version presented on VHS, Laserdisc and DVD, helicopter blades can be seen at the top of the screen during the opening credits. Obviously that was accidental.Most of the extras are from the older DVD version, but there are a few new extras on the Blu-ray too, like the commentary from the cinematographer. Overall, if you're a fan of this film, the Blu-ray version is highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"classic!","review":"The Shining is one of the most classic creepy, Stephen King stories ever written!

The sharpness and crisp colors just blew me away. WOW! I saw this in the theatre when it came out, and it was nice to finally have it in the widescreen format again. Note - it is 1.78:1, not 1.85:1. It fills the 16X9 screen entirely. I can't recommend this one any higher! Buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Horror movie","review":"I loved this movie it is one of the best horror movies out there today. It had it all horror/shock/supence and a good look in to the human mind and what happens to some people when locked up in a house together and that feeling of lonelyness and isulatetion. What really made the movie was Jack Nicholson\\" performance plus Shelly Devall as the suffering wife. If you want a good movie then rent or buy this movie and watch it you will not be sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maximum Suspense!","review":"Kubrick made this a masterpiece. More times than not, Stephen King's books are made into a joke on the big screen. This adaptation was definitely not. Kubrick was thought to be a genious... The Overlook Hotel somewhere in the hills of Colorado - what better place for Nickolson to strut his absolute best work. Shelley Duvall was an excellent choice to play the scatterbrain wife with the wide popping eyes at all the right times. The flashbacks and things little Danny sees really set the stage and without being graphic or gross - totally horrifies you. A few memorable scenes... 1. The Interview, 2. Nicholson is interrupted by Duvall while typing, 3. Nicholson chasing Duvall up the stairs and cornering her in the bathroom, and 4. the chase in the snowy cold garden labyrinth. Do not watch this film alone at night. Classic horror/suspense film that belongs in any movie buff's library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry - this one misses the mark","review":"The Shining remains my favorite Stephen King book because I still think it was the scariest book I ever read. You can imagine my excitement when I heard that S. Kubrick was making a movie out of the book. I was so disappointed I felt like crying. First of all: Shelly Duvall is so irritating in her sniveling, weepy acting I ended up WANTING Jack Torrence to kill her and end the suffering (of the audience). Secondly, Jack Nicholson seems a bit creepy in real life so he probably didn't have to put much extra effort into the role to be Jack Torrence, the maniac. It was further frustrating that Scat Man Cruthers was killed in the movie (his character in the book does not die) after traveling all the way back to the Overlook Hotel to save Wendy and Danny and then dies as soon as he walks in the door. The little boy who portrayed Danny did an excellent job of acting. Too bad he didn't have a better script to act from. Sorry - big disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie classic","review":"A must have I love this movie total classic! I recommend any buying it and watching it its worth it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent extras","review":"First of all 'The Shining' is one of the best horror movies of all time. Terrifying and chilling. What makes this DVD even better is the extras. seeing the original advertisements and trailors brings back memories. The documentary of behind the scenes by Kubrick's daughter who features Shelly Duval, Scatman Crothers, Danny Lloyd, and Jack Nicholson on the set in between scenes and during rehearsals is very rare and very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is old school horror, the way it should be.","review":"One of the creepiest horror films, Stanley Kubrick (The Clockwork Orange) brings this masterpiece of mental madness. Nicholson is enthralling with his famous \\"Heeeeeeereeeees Johnny!!!\\" line.

This is old school horror, the way it should be."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic","review":"Digitally remastered, this film has never looked or sounded better.

Some of the scenes in this movie are truly haunting and the movie is all together beutifuly pieced together. Jack Nicholson is wonderfully insane and terrifying.

Without Jack Nicholson and the character of Delbert Grady, the film would be a disaster. A mindless, bloody, violent film, failing to live up to the expectations of true horror movie lovers. The only famous actor in films I can think of who would play this part just as brilliant or more brilliant than Jack Nicholson is Robert De Niro, who excellently portrayed the role of pyschopath Max Cady in \\"Cape Fear\\". Anyways, this movie is all-in-all great, if you don't compare it to the book or miniseries. I recommend it for fans of horror."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite good..","review":"Yes, this was a wonderful flick. I love it. Nicholson and Duvall were superb in this one, the atmosphere was AMAZING, and it was delightfully creepy. I must say, however, I like the made-for-TV version that aired in 1997 better. That one I give 5 stars to. It follows the book precisely, and I believe that's vital to this story-line. King had more of a handle on that one, and, if you can believe this possible, the remake is even creepier. Nevertheless, the original Shining is well worth watching. You won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Shining is an excellent modern horror film","review":"I am a Jack Nicholson freak, and I thought that The Shining was, maybe not one of his BEST, but definitely a great achievement.

This is manifest in the poor quality of the DVD transfer that shares none of the attention to detail for which the director was renowned. Much of the visual artistry originally created by the director has been lost with the outrageous 4-by-3 TV framing. In a slapdash attempt to redo the opening titles, the film loses several minutes of the dramatic opening helicopter sequence, transforming a perfectly orchestrated build-up into a happy-go-lucky made-for-TV movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Shining","review":"This was a great movie!

The direction is so utterly unsettling it will have you on the edge of your seat and leave you cold at the end, the true elements of any horror film.

Kubrick shot his last three films in full-screen, apparently his preferred format, so why not release that version along with the widescreen in one set? And I know he shortened the movie for its British release, but why not relelease the longer one?

As you see the main character's VW Bug driving to the hotel during the opening credits, there are several great helicopter shots. In one shot, you can see the shadow of the helicopter on the side of the mountain. It makes the film appear cheap and not well made. If they would fix this short shot, and edit that out, then the film would be wonderful.

Jack Nicholson brings to the screen an unforgetable performance as the possesed psycho who is overcome by the spirits that stay in The Overlook Hotel that he decides to look after with his family over the winter peroid. no one else could have played the part any better than Nicholson himself. Watch out for the unforgetable scene where his character eventually begins to snap and the camera slowly zooms in on his face as he glowers out of the window as his family play in the snow or when he smashes his way through the bedroom door with the axe. The original book that the film is adapted from is more complex and carries a lot more detail but Kubrick manages to deal with this problem and condenses the film while still making it enjoyable and make sense.

I loved the cinematography. And the music is pretty engaging as well.

The film version of the tale may be more a product of Kubrick than King, but it is in its own way a good psychological thriller.Whereas the novel encompasses far more of the supernatural nature of the Overlook Hotel's ghostly and evil residents, the film instead chooses to see Jack Nicholson's descent into madness as just that rather than largely the product of phantasmal touches. Nicholson's performance is masterful in only the way he can deliver such a role; one might really wonder if he ought to be in a straight jacket at times.Purists and fans of the novel might resent Kubrick's reinterpretation of King's novel--and the film is indeed the lesser of the two in comparison--yet still the Shining on video is a shocker to terrify and thrill and a requisite title in any fan's video library."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Shining (Original Version w/Jack Nicholson)","review":"As with all movies based on novels by Stephen King, they are very suspenseful and keep you on the edge of your seat. Jack Nicholson is the best at playing his part in the movie. I couldn't think of a better actor for the part.

The acting from all of the actors was above par and worth noting. But what really grabs you is the feeling that you get from the house and settings in the movie. What you get is a chilling desprate and despared haunted house in which portrays the emptiness of the main characters in this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"What?","review":"Not scary at all.

I don't know if I'm the only one that's noticed the nearly complete overhaul Kubrick did in writing it, but I can't be the only one that saw how much better the dang ABC version of it was. I could barely last through the slow and monotonous 2001: A Space Odyssey, and I surely hate lasting through this. Kubrick needed to let someone else write, direct, and produce his movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST HORROR MOVIE EVER!","review":"This movie is very boring and is quite pointless. Why does he write 'All work and no play makes Johnny a dull boy'? It is very very slow moving and not many will get the whole plot, as they might forget most of what happened before the movie is over and will have to watch it again to 'get it'. Kids 11-15 will be bored out of their wits! This is definately a movie directed at older auidences, as they will understand the plot better. I was not scared at all! I've seen bunny masks scarier than this sad excuse for a movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"I just didn't care.","review":"I didn't care one bit about anyone in this movie. I found myself not caring about someone going crazy and killing his family...because I didn't care about him or his family. I just didn't care...ever. And I didn't find it the least bit scary. I couldn't wait for it to get over. I like most King movies...but this one just dragged on forever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst movie of all time","review":"I would rather watch a litter of puppies being thrown into a wood chipper than this abortion of a movie. Other than the names of some of the characters and the setting of the Overlook, there are no similarities with the book, literally none. How could King give the okay for this version, it makes me sick. I haven't seen the miniseries yet, but it's hard to believe it could be any worse. What a waste of some good acting, too. Nicholson playing the real Jack Torrance would have been terrifying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Least scary movie EVER made","review":"I went to rent the remake of the \\"Friday the 13th\\", but the cashier told me to check out \\"The Shining\\" instead for some quality horror. I was skeptical but approached it with an open-mind, even though I knew it wasn't going to be as good as the Friday the 13th remake. Boo! This movie sucked! The things in it were so random, like the bear suit guy and the blood spilling down the stairs. They didn't even have to do with the plot. The acting was horrible, too. I was hoping Wendy would've been axed already so she'd finally shut up and get back in the kitchen! This movie is so un-scary that I thought I'd never be scared again. Then I saw gems like \\"Orgy of the Dead\\", \\"Dead End Road\\", \\"The Dentist\\" and \\"Turistas\\" and realized that good horror films do exist, just skip this Shining crap!"},{"rating":"1","title":"the shining","review":"This is in Regular DVD format not in Blu-ray ,maybe its in a up converthion ,do not pay for this DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jack for real!","review":"I have come to realize that some DVD revisions come and go and then it can become impossible to get them. So I wanted to get the best version of the Shining before its too late. I believe this movie is best in 4:3 so if you are an addict of this movie I would get this version. I actually now have all 3 versions. Amazon got me my copy quick and in good condition.The Shining is in my top 10 movies I like of all time. So that means I can rewatch it to an uncountable figure. I would not consider it a Horror movie by todays standards. I have my own genre I put it in. The \\"Psycho\\" genre. That means any movie that has a really good character playing a really good psycho killer. Jack is one of the best at this type of acting. So if you find yourself liking psycho movies then the Shining is a must have and I would say watch it at least once a month. Dr's Orders."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic horror film, but truly not very frightening","review":"I love The Shining and I saw it for the first time when I was 9 or 10. It scared me back then. Now, being 24, it still creeps me out, but as a whole, it really isn't a frightening movie. Thats not to say it isn't a good one. It is. The 2 little girls in the hall...There is no scarier image. It has been ingrained in my mind ever since I first saw it. The tense atmosphere certainly helps the movie out and the climax is quite suspenseful. The true reason this movie is rated so high is because of Jack Nicholson. He created this perfectly creepy character and people still quote him years later. He is the reason the movie succeeds in being a horror/thriller. Great actors make great movies, well mostly. Obviously over 20 years old, the movie look dated and bland at times, but it still stands the test of time and that is the most important thing. If you are looking for real scares however, look somewhere else."},{"rating":"2","title":"check screen ratio","review":"as far as the movie goes, faultlessjust note that this particular DVD is not in widescreenand this being such a beautifully shot movie, i wouldhighly recomend the widescreen version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Essential","review":"The main criticism of this movie seems to be that it is not very close to the book.So what?!?Stephen King himself was so irritated by it that he insisted on making the far inferior TV version a couple of years ago.Get over it.

Read the book and see why all the real horror did not make it to the screen. The movie had way too much lighting in it to be scary as well. When I saw this in the theatres everyone booed the anti-climactic end. Kubrick never learned how to make a great horror film. Jack Nicholson over-acting all over the place does not make a great film.

What a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"STANLEY KUBRICK'S BOMB","review":"The ShiningAn ugly, hard-to-stomach horror movie, from Stanley Kubrick, whose sense of taste and feeling for his character have somewhat dulled. His source: Stephen's King's novel, was a horrifing tale, too, but King evokes a sence of concern for his characters which has totally eluded Kubrick's work here. Jack Nicholson is suitably menancing but Shelly Duvall is almost ludricrously weak."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Movie Ever!!!(Next to Rambo2)","review":"In this movie, Jack ownz the screen by conveying true family murdering insanity! This movie makes me laugh and cry at the same time. Stanley Kubrick is the best director ever hands down. The ugly wife and kid(whoever the hell plays them)were convincing.

This is my favortie movie and I was SOOO excited. We have tried it in 5 DVD players at my house and had friends try it in theirs and nothing.

Now it has been 13 days since the seller said they would send a replacement and I haven't even gotten any else. No email and no DVD. I would recommend buying this from someone else.

Definitely wait for a better version."},{"rating":"2","title":"MUSIC","review":"I'm not going to repeat what pure genius this movie is, but as a corollary to that obvious fact, my first reaction to \\"The Shining\\" was how stunning the choice of music was. Most of the music in this movie was concert music written by modern 20th century composers such as Krzysztof Penderecki, Gorgy Ligeti, Witold Lutoslawski, etc., all of whom are Eastern European composers, all of whom have personally witnesssed Nazi and Soviet crimes against humanity, which has made their music desperately haunting, as if one were looking into the abyss of human evil and despair. Kubrick, besides being a visual genius, has an unbelievable musical sense, and chooses the music in his movies VERY carefully. The soundtracks to his movies (which often include music by his daughter, Abigail Mead) are just as interesting as the films themselves. Check out the soundtracks to Full Metal Jacket, 2001, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Shining","review":"Excellent movie classic, beautiful scenery, and takes the effects of the winter doldrums to an extreme."},{"rating":"2","title":"REDRUM, REDRUM","review":"This is the only movie that scares the literal wits out of me the same way it did when I was a child.

It had a chilling soundtrack, and had some very good camera work. In the case of the Shining, a movie has finally exceeded the book upon which it was based. Things that would normally make a movie terrible have made the Shining a spellbinding movie. For example, the dialogue throughout the entire movie seems forced and unnatural. Another example is during an argument between Jack Nicholson (who performs incredibly well throughout the entire movie) and Shelley Duvall, after which Jack storms out of the room and glances at the camera as he goes by. If you're a horror fan, or just into movies, this is definetely one to see again and again and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Improved DVD","review":"Just because I'm such a helpful sorta fellow I wanted to make sure people were aware of the improvements to this upcoming release of \\"The Shining\\". Everything that previous reviewers have said about the last release of \\"The Shining\\" is true. The picture transfer and sound are horrible. However, the upcoming release of this edition corrects all that. It has a brilliant transfer and a 5.1 Dolby audio track. Just too bad Kubrick didn't want it released in widescreen. So, if you love \\"The Shining\\" don't let the limitations of the previous edition stop you from purchasing the new one."},{"rating":"2","title":"again?","review":"Yes!For those expecting Warner working at their best here is Johnny!!THIS movie is not the 144 min.It just got the old well known115 min.we all have seen.How the hell do you get the REAL long version?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Scariest Movie Ever","review":"Awesome movie that freaks you out from start to finish. I read the book after seeing the movie and have to say that the movie is much scarier. The dead women in the bathroom scene is the most haunting. The final scene where Nicolson is chasing after the kid with an ax through the snowy maze is one of the most intense scenes ever. The awesome music creates half of the fright throughout the film. If you do not find this movie scary then I must ask you what would you call scary?"},{"rating":"2","title":"good film, new transfer looks and sounds great","review":">A very good film, but a rather bad DVD transfer.Warner's replaced the old, bad transfer with a terrific new one some time ago, so my old negative review does not apply anymore. All of the Kubrick stuff looks and sounds MUCH better now than it did a few years back.This film has been the subject of a long-running contraversy about the proper aspect ratio. SK shot it open matte--that is, full frame--and reportedly prefered full frame (at least for home viewing in the VHS era) even though he knew it would be projected in the US at 1.85:1. As a result, there's some ambiguity about which ratio is \\"original.\\" Plausibly, BOTH are (and SJ's symmetrical compositions generally look fine both ways). The DVD is full frame, reflecting the original negative, with \\"extra\\" image at the top and bottom.--SRP"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Shining","review":"The smartest thriller I have ever seen.

I don't know why since it gets worse each time I watch it. Jack Nicholson is unbeliveable as Jack. In the book you sorta feel bad for him but the moive makes him unllikeable. The plot should have followed the movie more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"5 stars? One of the greatest horror films ever made? Please. This so-so adaption of one of Stephen King's best novels, for all the time and craft Kubrick spent on the film, is only mildly scary. Some of the scenes have a certain creepiness, but story-wise this is totally lame. Nicholson is of course, excellent, playing a twisted caretaker who slowly goes mad, but unfortunately, it comes as no surprise as he seems ready to go off the deep end from the first scene. Or how about the so-called 'suspenseful buildup' of having Scatman Crothers travel up the mountain to save the family, only to immediately get an axe in the chest?! And the maze was only a mild substitute for the topiary as described in the book. I love Kubrick, but have to admit, he should have let someone else help with the screenplay. I first saw it when I was 14 years old, and I still feel the same - disappointed, and not scared."},{"rating":"2","title":"Widescreen Please !!!","review":"The Shining is the best horror film ever! It gives me the chill everytime. Jack Nicholson's porformance is over the top. The modern classical soundtrack is so creepy, building tension upto the end. It is a pity that the director only allowed fullscreen version to be available on DVD. This movie deserves better treatment than that. Maybe we can get enough fans to rally for a widescreen version of it. Hopefully, the studio will listen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love This Movie, Hate the DVD","review":"Ug. This and the other Kubrick DVDs are probably the worst DVDs produced by major studios. And considering that the Shining is one of the best horror films of all time in terms of popularity and in content quality, one would wonder why Shining would get such a crap treatment on DVD. The fact that it's fullscreen doesn't bother me because this is relatively the aspect ratio Kubrick shot the film in, it's the abyssmal picture quality the lack of supplements. The transfer Warner used here looks to be the same transfer they used for the very first VHS release around 18 years ago. The compression job is just a gasp. Even in broad daylight the compression artifacts are very apparent. I guess this is my cry for help to get Warner to re-release the movie in it's deserved Special Edition mode. I thought that this was an easy candidate for special edition treatment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality video","review":"with about 45 minutes remaining, the video began to stop.

I loved the film and I stayed at the Stanley Hotel where it was filmed and that too was a great experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"The ghost of Kubrick","review":"It's a pretty good measure of the boredom and disengagement that befuddled the last half of Stanley Kubrick's career that he would stoop to filming a ghost story. Having disposed of topics like nuclear war and the fate of the human race in \\"Dr. Strangelove\\" and \\"2001,\\" it must have been well-nigh impossible to come up with a story that satisfied his appetite for big projects. \\"The Shining\\" dodges Stephen King's usual imbecilities as long as it can, holding out the hope that the title character is just going mad and isn't being plagued by ghosts. But eventually Kubrick gives in and turns loose the spooks. With or without them the whole thing is way too slow. Kubrick must have sensed how bad it all was: he reportedly lost his temper repeatedly with Shelly Duvall's awful performance, and the kid is terrible, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Shining","review":"Brilliant, creepy horror from Kubrick, with mesmerizing camera work and bizarre, arresting set pieces. Nicholson is a marvel to watch as his character evolves from a slightly odd but functioning adult to raving psychopath. Scatman Crothers is also memorable as the hotel's only other resident. Based on Stephen King's book, the film has Kubrick's slightly twisted genius all over it. Look for those wild tracking shots as Danny rides his tricycle indoors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oldie but Goodie","review":"I wanted to own The Shining because it is such a classic - Jack Nicholson at his spooky best! Seeing him young and starting out in that style that is all his own is a good way to preview his persona in future movies. And Shelley Duvall is great too - what ever happened to her? This movie will always be a Jack Nicholson/Steven King classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"WHY NOT WIDESCREEN?","review":"\\"The Shining\\" is one of my favorite movies and is especially enjoyable late at night in the dark because of its isolated setting and Jack Nicholson's increasing mania. It is a must see for anyone who is a fan of either Kubrick or Nicholson (his finest performance other than in \\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\\"). My only displeasure at watching the film on DVD is the fullscreen format. Why can't this film be distributed in its original theatrical aspect ratio? I feel that we are missing a lot. I saw the film in a theater in 1980 and I think we are missing out on Kubrick's intent in framing each scene so eloquently. The 5.1 soundtrack is awesome, though, and ten times better than the mono video track. i highly reccomend this video, but beware: IT IS AVAILABLE IN WIDESCREEN FORMAT."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality...","review":"For all of you who may be wondering, I think they transfered this DVD copy from my old used and abused VHS copy from the 1980's.

Highly disappointing if you're a King fan, but if you're another robotic Stanley Kubrick worshipper you will probably love this thing.There's nothing scary or terrifying here, except Danny's constant spastic shaking and drooling, unless of course you're one of those people that has a habit of looking under your bed at nite to see if the boogeyman has paid you a visit. Boo!And if I was stranded on a mountain in a haunted hotel, no doubt that Scatman Crother's would be my first choice for a rescue. haw haw Some semi-haunting and nifty visuals as you might expect but the story doesn't gel, and people...you'll want Shelley Duvall to be disposed of in the most gruesome manner possible.

But it is Stanley Kubrick's version of The Shining not Stephen King's. Kubrick took what he needed from the book and created a genuinely frightening horror movie. From beginning to end Kubrick does a masterfull job on the cinemtography and succeeds with keeping the suspense and atmosphere throughout the movie. Jack Nicholson's performance is one of the greatest ever captured on film. Much better than the miniseries. Would've gotten 5 stars if only the dvd transfer had have been widescreen. Aside from that though it has the trailer for the film and a documentary directed by Kubrick's daughter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Unbelievably Brilliant","review":"Great to see all these amazing reviews. When the film came out, everyone hated it. Way, way ahead of its time. Completely awesome from first shot to last. What is so interesting is that the film has lasted the test of time. If you type in a google search of The Shining for artwork, you will see some amazing renditions of the film by current artists, which are both sardonic and absolutely brilliant. The movie has surpassed pulp art in every way, due to the incredible genius of Stanley Kubrick. Own it. Enough said."},{"rating":"2","title":"ATTENTION: For those who want The Shining in widescreen","review":"Stanley Kubrick did not film The Shining in widescreen format. He intended it to be seen at the 1.33:1 aspect ratio. As well as his later movies like Full Metal Jacket and Eyes Wide Shut. If you saw The Shining in theaters and it appeared to be widescreen, it was because the top and bottom of the frame were cut off. When you watch the DVD or VHS tape, you're seeing all Kubrick intended the viewer to see.\\"Regarding the full-screen format of Eyes Wide Shut on DVD, the official wording on the DVD packaging is as follows: \\"This feature is presented in the full aspect ratio of the original camera negative, as Stanley Kubrick intended.\\" As with the DVD formatting of The Shining and Full Metal Jacket, Eyes Wide Shut was matted in the 1.85:1 aspect ratio for theatrical presentation, but the director composed his films in camera to accommodate television broadcast and home video viewing. The official aspect ratio of Eyes Wide Shut on DVD is 1.37:1.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"A great Kubrick!","review":"It's much more than a great horror film, it's a wonderful work of art!

Without question my favorite horror film ever. The picture quality is about as great as you can expect from an old film like this. The bluray has some interesting special features that are worth checking out as well. I have not read the book(planning to soon). So i cant comment on the \\"the movie disgraced the book\\" arguement that you hear alot. As a horror film, its one of the most pulse pounding experiences ever. You know what is going to happen, but as Jack's gradual mental breakdown is terrying to watch.

Filled with and thrills and plenty of chill, the Shining is sure to creep you out. I recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Full screen?!! Are they insane?","review":"Can someone please illuminate me on this perplexing situation? I'd heard that this was to be a Kubrick-approved collection of his films on DVD. Is it possible he decided to have it released full-screen? Is this just penny-pinching by Warner execs who took the scan off some old Laserdisc edition of the flick? Was the top and bottom of the film cropped to create a wider aspect ratio for theatrical release? Or is this just an unfortunate typo by Amazon.com?Unless the cropping scenario is true or this turns out to be just a typo or miscommunication on Amazon.com's part, I'll save my cash and live with my memory of the film as I originally saw it(okay, I saw it full-screen on videotape the first time -- I was one when it was originally released in theaters -- but memory makes great films widescreen in retrospect).Any information pertaining to these questions would be delightful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Run away.","review":"Considering this is an iconic horror film, it was awful. Jack was terrific and so was the cast, but the movie was slow and draggy. I cannot understand what all the fuss was about. My wife told me we'd love it. And it had its moments. Perhaps it could be that both film and production values have gotten SO much better, that this seemed out of place. Nope, that's not it. I can watch a Hitchcock film and enjoy it as much as I did back in the day. But really, rent or buy something else. Unless you just need sleep. In that case, it is perfect."},{"rating":"1","title":"BLURAY new scenes","review":"Don't get me wrong, the Shining is one of my favorite movies. I love Kubrick. But I'm sick of the new features that the studios feel they HAVE to include to justify the UPGRADE. In the case of classic movies, the improved video and audio is just enough. If they incluye a new documentary or long lost interviews is ok, but as the disc extras, not, please, as part of the feature film. Or al least, please put the option to play the movie without these escenes.They include here i think at least 2 new disc chapters. These extra footage is not in the DVD or the theatrical version of the film. In result, the film lost of its timing and rythm. It's now a little slow paced and has lost some of the mistery of the plot, because of this extra information depicted.Even Kubrick after the premiere of the film decided to remove all this footage to make to improve the picture. Why the studio decide to incluye these footage after all?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful DVD","review":"I had never seen such an incompetent job as that done by Warner Bros. when creating this DVD. The image is not much better than you get in an ordinary VCR, and the sound is absolutely terrible (which was a big turnoff for me, as I was looking forward to hearing the awesome piece by Wendy Carlos and Rachel Elkind booming in surround sound against the stunning background of the mountains around the Overlook.)This DVD does The Shining (a truly good movie that turns a run-of-the-mill horror story into a subtle psychological-supernatural tragedy) a big disservice.The movie is a five star one; the DVD, a one star one (and that's because I am not allowed to give no stars.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice but somewhat disappointed I suppose","review":"I think the blu ray does this film alot of justice. I did enjoy finally seeing it this way. But have to admit disappointment in that I was expecting to see something along the lines of an extended cut or deleted scenes. This release has none of that which considering the brilliance of this film. Is probably for the better.I found the new documentary(s) a little on the tedious side. Listening to Hollywood people spout on and on about how brilliant Kubrick was gets to be pretty annoying after you've heard it a dozen times. It's like, yeah... we got it people. Tell us something we don't already know."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Shining","review":"Brilliant film. Got this one from America because it is half hour longer than the English release.

I think that the facial expressions and irony in the movie are one of the greater aspects, rather than the actual storyline itself. Kubrick is a great director, and for the time, some great directing going on there ... Ten thumbs up for this horro/thriller classic.. whoaaaa ...Mel"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not At All Wonderful!!!","review":"Good movie??.. No way!!.. This is a horrible adaptation of one of Stephen King's greatest novels. This movie isn't scary at all and it completely lost the creepy, twisted Stephen King touch. The second movie, that was played in multiple parts on television, was a lot closer to the book and was much much better. This movie wasn't at all what I expected. It was a lot worse, I don't recommend it at all, unless you're completely bored and want to watch a very bad movie. Jack Nicholson was the perfect choice for Jack Torrance, but Shelly Duvall??... she looked like a lost and very awkward giraffe running around that huge hotel in the end scenes. She's not at all what one would expect Wendy to be like. Bottom line: MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Do Not Disturb...","review":"To me, THE SHINING has to be looked at from several different angles. First, as a horror movie THE SHINING is a classic in the same league as THE EXORCIST, THE OMEN, and ROSEMARY'S BABY. Then, I look at how it stacks up as a Stanley Kubrick movie. In this regard, it's also a classic, with it's isolated / desolated atmosphere, and cold, vast set-pieces. Next, I judge THE SHINING against other Jack Nicholson films, and yep, his Jack Torrence role is up there with his take on the Joker in Tim Burton's BATMAN and his version of Satan in THE WITCHES OF EASTWICK. This is malevolent, crazy Jack at his best! Lastly, I ask myself how good THE SHINING is as a Stephen King movie. Well, it's right along-side of CARRIE and THE DEAD ZONE as far as I'm concerned. I loved King's novel and have read it many times. I just see the book and the movie as two completely separate entities that can be enjoyed on their own merits. So, I give THE SHINING it's due as a chilling masterpiece..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak Adaptation","review":"In spite of Kubrick's impressive and unmistakeable style... In spite of Nicholson and Duvall's remarkable performances... the weak novel's flaws are magnified rather than minimized in translation to the screen. There is little here that will frighten you--and, unlike most other Kubrick films, still less upon which to ponder."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jack Nicholson","review":"This of course is an older movie but still one of Nicholsons best.This movie keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Tour de Force from JACK!","review":"Jack Nicholson has always been considered one of our generation's greatest screen actors. And \\"The Shining\\" goes a long way to proving why this is still the case. In a lesser actor's hands, his character would have become a joke - yet Nicholson infuses him with a calibrated presence that makes him stand out in an otherwise so-so film. Shelly Duval can't compete with the legend, nor can Scatman Crothers - they are both out-\\"shined\\" by Jack in an almost forgettable way...in other words, its hard to even care for them because we're so busy trying to figure out what Jack'll do next. Scary through and through, though far from being a great adaptation of a Stephen King novel (see \\"Shawshank Redemption\\" for the best of the lot there), \\"The Shining\\" still works. Its a testament to the actor Nicholson more than anything else."},{"rating":"1","title":"FULL-SCREEN?","review":"I have enjoyed this movie ever since I can remember. And years later it's finally available on the best (so far) video format around. And it's in the FULL-SCREEN format?! I don't understand why Warner Brothers would bother releasing such a classic and it not being in it's orginal widescreen version. I give the actual movie five stars. But the lousy full-screen version drives me nuts! I'm glad I rented it! I just hope they re-release it like they did Willy Wonka. I'm pretty sure you know what I'm talking about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass on this one. Go straight to the real one.","review":"Pass this one up. Go straight to the newer one shown on TV a few years ago. Stephen King had total control over it and it does justice. It's the proper film to his book. It's long but very impacting. It creeps in slowly. But it seems as though it wasn't released on video like his other made for TV movies. Let's hope it is soon. I recorded it off TV back then and I desperately want an official release."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would rather watch a movie that makes sence.","review":"This movie disapionted me. The novel is much scarier than this. The acting sucks and sometimes you will be wondering if Stanely Kubrick made the film without even looking at it. Tust me on this one, read the book, it's scarier than the movie. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. The only thing that scares you is the music."},{"rating":"1","title":"The dullest [and most boring] horror movie I've ever seen.","review":"\\"The Shining\\" is a film that I had high expectations for, and after seeing it, I was so disappointed. I had heard so much about how extraordinarily scary and terrifying it was. What I got was an extraordinarily dull, deadly, and hypnotic experience. The film is way too long and slow, relying on Stanley Kubrick's dull visuals and long shots to scare you. There were a few good things in it, like the two great actors Jack Nicholson and Scatman Crothers. But Shelley Duvall and Danny Lloyd are different stories. Duvall looks like a walking-dead skull, and Danny is mostly just a blank-faced zombie. What made me more angry was that I never really felt he was in danger. I was almost ready to slap him because of his dull presence. This is one time that I agree with Leonard Maltin on a movie. In his review, he said \\"Some eerie scenes to be sure, but the film goes on forever.\\" And believe me, it does."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ignore this release.","review":"Don't get me wrong, I love Stanley Kubrick's The Shining very much. It is my favorite adaptation of Stephen King's works. But this DVD just sucks. The Shinning was shot in full-screen, so this DVD is cropped. Also this DVD is missing over 20 minutes of footage. I repeat: Steer clear of this crappy DVD.Stick with the last release, because it does the film justice.P.S. The only one of these 5 new releases of Kubrick's films that is worth buying is 2001: A Space Odyssey. The rest are not worth buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"UNBOX IS TERRIBLE!","review":"If you've ordered from Unbox before, maybe you've had better luck, but mine has apparently run out.

He relishes the opportunity to get his marriage back on track and to jumpstart his writing career. Instead, the isolation causes Jack to lose his mind, see flashbacks of the previous caretaker's family murdered, and to set out for a repeat. His family suffers from the isolation just as much and that causes further strain in Jack's marriage.I haven't read Stephen King's novel so I can't make a fair comparison but the movie was done quite well and Nicholson, as always, played his part so well that you feel as though you're losing it along with Torrance.The late Stanley Kubrick may not have faithfully translated King's tale to the big screen but it's pretty good, nonetheless."},{"rating":"2","title":"the greatest film ever","review":"I am only ten but this film is exelent a exelent director one of the most succesful actors and some great scenes truly exelent"},{"rating":"2","title":"One Of The Spookiest Films For Years To Come","review":"This Movie Has basically everything a movie requres in order to be a classic. It includes A great actor, Jack Nicholson, A Great Writer, Stephen King and a great director, Stanley Kubrick. What makes this movie spooky is that that the hotel is always empty, danny always sees things. Jack Nicholson looses his mind throughout the film. In the movie Nicholson tries to get the new job at the hotel. He is warned about cabin fever, which he eventually suffers through. While he becomes more ill his wife is going crazy, his son keeps imanging things that happened in the hotel in the past.

The story is great and the movie really delivers. You will enjoy this movie. It is ten times as good as \\"The Sixth Sense\\" (still, a good movie). The only problem with this particular presentation of the DVD is that it is poorly done. It was part of a Kubric collection that was done without any touch-up work. You would expect dobly-digital and widescreen format for such a classic film, but you get a mono 4:3 format. The DVD is pretty bad. Thankfully, a new DVD release will be coming out that will fix all these problems. So, unless you need this right away I'd wait for the new one. Otherwise, an outstanding film."},{"rating":"1","title":"The scariest thing here is the transfer","review":"This full-screen version looks like the print was dragged up the mountain behind a truck. It's shocking what a lousy job Warners did here. Avoid it at all costs. Supposedly the only decent DVD trasnfer in the Kubrick collection is 2001, and that's not done by Warners. The DVD is actually a repackaged MGM DVD.

No way anyone in their right mind would pay over a hundred dollars for this and I believe that's what the list price was before it went out of stock! I think this one is just going on the shelf as an emergency backup unit when my other brand-X fails because right now my Brand-X is a better unit then this one.

Flavorless Coffee","review":"I recently received this coffeemaker, anxiously awaiting a flavorful, quality cup of coffee befitting of the Cuisinart name. I made a pot. It was watery and flavorless. I figured I must have done something wrong. So I greatly increased the amount of Starbucks coffee I used in the filter. The result? Not much improvement. What appears to be the problem is that the machine brews super-fast, (much faster than my last one which made great coffee, but died) not allowing time for the coffee grounds to be fully saturated. The result is flavorless, weak coffee - and no way to extend the brew period.I got a great deal on this machine - but in this case you get what you pay for. Pass on this Cuisinart, unless you enjoy drinking diluted, weak coffee."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst belt I've ever had....","review":"Will never order this belt again....At least I was given a prompt and full refund.

The rocksteady crew are pure ledgens and for them to be in this movie is just a major bonus.

I wish they had behind the scenes on this DVD and some of the battles they had off the camera - that in itself would have been better than the movie ! But i read somewhere that the cameras were always turned off when they had battles during the filming of this movie (probably didn't want people to bite their moves). Anyways, I watched this movie at the theatres a half dozen times back in 83', and when it came out on VHS i was stoked. It's a shame that the west coast equivalent (Breakin' and esp. Breakin II) was made too hollywood, but I guess back then it was rare to be on a TV or movies so no one could complain.

I looked for them on the internet and they are the best. NO more bleeding fingertips and no more half cut nails.

And then for lack of a better answer to this impossible question, I would answer PULP FICTION. In anycase, anyone crazy enough to point a gun at somebody while asking their opinion about what the best movie of the 90s is might not like other answers I might come up with as much.I think it is the funniest movie I've seen that actually doesn't go in the comedy section at the video store. There are no flaws in it. It's perfect. Quentin Tarantino cannot ever top it and will probably never even come close. When he dies they will refer to him first and foremost as the director of PULP FICTION. His place in history as one of the great directors of cinema is secured with this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"stranger than fiction","review":"Funny, entertaining, creative and thought-provoking are words that best describe \\"Pulp Fiction.\\" The movie moves around in many different directions and there isn't a centric plot or theme. Instead it's like little plays woven together to form a work of art. I especially enjoyed Bruce Willis because he gave an exceptional performance that was both unique and meaningful. John Travolta was also a lot of fun to watch. The man is a true professional and always gives a wonderful performance in movies, but in \\"Pulp Fiction\\" he is even more fun to watch because he put so much life and energy into the role that he plays. If you try to follow the story you'll probably get lost, so don't. If you don't take things too seriously and don't mind mindless violence with a little bit of crude language thrown in for good measure than this movie is assuredly for you. This movie deserves to be on blu-ray."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bammm","review":"This movie is just outrageous and over the top.

I love Quentin Tarintino's films he has a unique twisted touch that no other director has in the film industry. Never before have I seen a film like Pulp Fiction, a funky collection of differnt goings on all involving a cast of very diverse characters. This film has action,comedy and some revival of catch phrases from past generations. One of my favorite scenes would have to be the dance contest, and then the scene in the car where the gun accidently goes off.

Only screenplay is good enough,but nothingelse. Tarantino does not have skill to complete a movie(So he can't be a master,auteur) He can't make intelligents to be involved in his movies emotionally. See what he wanted to show in the movie.\\"Fargo\\",\\"Goodfellas\\" are really good movies made in 1990's in this country. Feel the difference between those movies and \\"Pulp fiction\\"\\"Pulp fiction\\" is good(not great),though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not all it was hyped to be","review":"First of all, let me state that I'm a huge fan of crime movies from Goodfellas to Menace II Society. And Quentin Tarantino has scored some major hits as a director, this being one of them (moneywise). And the actors here like Bruce Willis, Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta have all displayed more than a little talent. I felt this movie was grasping at something, as in Samuel L. Jackson's philosphical discussions, or the use of Biblical passages before murders. But it never really got a chance to develop. The car ride back after the first set of murders was a chance, but they blew it by having the guy in the backseat killed, etc., there was a lot of potential for development. Also, the Bruce Willis aspect was preety pointless, and the scene in the gun store was funny in a way, but still did not contribute. While attempting to connect the stories, and illustrate a certain point, Pulp Fiction does not suceed, and that is what hurts this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"UNACCEPTABLE PACKAGING - A RIP OFF","review":"First off, the film is 5 stars. The package it comes in however is an utter disappointment. Upon opening you will find a soundtrack cd which is barely held in by a cheap plastic molding. Not only that, but the soundtrack is nothing but an 18 minute \\"sampler\\", featuring only 6 songs! This is NOT the same soundtrack (2 cds) which was recently reissued to coincide with the dvd rerelease. There are no descriptions of the special features in the accompanying booklet; the tray which holds the 2 dvds (on a single spindle, making them susceptible to popping out loose and getting scratched) easily falls out of the box. For this set to retail for [...] is outrageous. You are far better off purchasing the Buena Vista edition. This is a slipshod production and is a complete abomination package-wise."},{"rating":"1","title":"McDonalds, the Finest Restaurant","review":"As a beginning screenwriter, I am dismayed at the popularity of this movie and its four-and-a-half stars average rating on Amazon. Poor dialogue, little surface and less beneath.... But, as I have been reading most of the reviews here, I have come to the realiziation that most who like this movie would also claim that McDonalds is one of the finest restaurants one can find in whatever community they live in. The reviews of those who rate Pulp Fiction only a star or two consistently have their reviews rated as not helpful. And that is one of the poorest qualities of our society, and of Pulp fiction cultism: everyone likes to jump onto the bandwagon, without much thought (as went into this movie, beyond the cheap borrowings from others more creative), and then, again without thought, react negatively to those who don't agree.

I am confused how Quentin Tarantino can simply glorify these social ills in a perveted fantasy, and then be annointed as a cinematic genius. I can not appreciate how this trash can be put on film and still be mistaken for \\"talent\\". The vulgar lifestyles of the main characters are sickening. Two common thugs murder while mocking religious scriptures, then they accidently murder another and are more concerned about the stains in the car upholstery? What kind of story is this, and why is it considered entertainment? I'm no prude and I'm certainly not a saint, but this is the kind of rubbish that give the US and Hollywood a black eye. This is a distubing film and a sad commentary on the decline of the audience values. One of the year's best films??? Sorry, I don't get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"the roman colosseum in 20th century garb.","review":"It was comforting to read a few negative reviews of this vile film...I truly thought I was alone in my assessment of this moral mess...but what was most disturbing was the audience reaction.

Yes, we can explain it in the \\"only a movie\\" terms..or \\"don't you get a satire when you see one\\"..heh, I guess not. Young people really don't \\"think\\" about the trash they allow themselves to digest. Even my own daughters enjoyed the movie.

Usually there is some kind of point to a movie, good guy verses bad guy, she loves him, he loves her, may the force be with you, etc., but the point of this movie totally escapes me. It's THE most pointless movie I have ever seen. When it was done I felt like the trapeze artist who swung out to meet the person on the other trapeze and he wasn't there. I was also amazed that someone could make a movie where 90% of the dialogue consists of 4-letter words, the same 4-letter words.

The start was disjoint and did not really follow. I put up with it hoping it gets better but it did not! Just stayed boring and lame. The violence does not make it any more interesting because without a plot there is nothing to add to. What a waste of a good couple of hours. I guess this is standard Hollywood.

Other reviewers may be as useful as a brain dead vegetable and assume people just go online browsing for movies to buy that they've never heard of before, but I give a little more credit than that. This is a review of the actual product. DO NOT get this version of Pulp Fiction if you are looking to buy a nice collector's edition. It does come with the extra disc; however the packaging is nothing like in the picture. It's in a normal DVD case with one of those duel disc flaps. So the discs aren't touching one another, but there is no nice casing or extra pictures or anything that the advertisement for this product would lead you to believe. I suggest you just save your money and get the normal version (it's only about a $5 difference so if that doesn't matter to you then go for it)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sick","review":"This movie is disgusting.

Yet another Hollywood attempt to glamorize the pop-drug culture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute Garbage!","review":"This is one of those films that just goes to show people will call you a genius if you do something original whether it's good or not. Tarantino should be proud that he went from working as a cashier at Blockbuster video to a successful 90's flash in the pan director. Frankly I think he should still be working at Blockbuster. His success is classic proof that anyone can make it if they try hard enough. Original or not, good cast or not, this is just another violent bloodbath full of torture and rape. Hardly an excuse for entertainment. And as for his attempt at making it funny, comedy should be left to comedians. The biggest shame of all is that this film inspired so many rip-offs which were even worse. If Tarantino wants to direct and be in front of the camera, why doesn't he make another Revenge of the Nerds movie? He'd finally be perfectly cast and maybe then there might be a reason to laugh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strike Down With Great Vengence","review":"This was such a great movie to watch.

I've watched the movie 4 times since getting the DVD, and each time it was slightly different because of the surrounding Rom features! Besides the \\"Open Mic\\" feature, there's also a trivia game, pop-up info, and interactive screenplay. If you have a DVD-ROM drive in your computer, definitely check this out! Miramax should market this disc as computer software!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overlong, overstuffed, overrated","review":"Each passing year emphasizes what a gimmicky, overblown, ultimately empty mess \\"Pulp Fiction\\" is, especially as it becomes clearer what a one-trick pony its director is.The handful of strong, funny, provocative scenes in the film are undone by others that seem to go on for days. The Travolta-Thurman sequence seems especially forced and tedious now, and the set-up of the Bruce Willis-Ving Rhames showdown is shamefully flabby. And the closing diner sequence is beyond anticlimactic.Tarantino seems so determined to display his own prodigious cleverness that he refuses to impose any economy on the story or how it's told. As a result, what might have been a fast-paced, dizzying thrill ride with some judicious editing is instead a leaden, 160-minute valentine from Quentin Tarantino to his own perceived genius."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome movie!","review":"This is one of my favorite all time movies and I could not resist having it in blu-ray.

Why I am not sure since most films that are shot in or take place in Los Angeles I usually enjoy very much. I thought the part towards the end with Harvey Keitel in it was great, yet some of the drug scenes were just not interesting. This movie reminds me of so many other films that are based out of LA like 'crash, from 2005', '2 days in the valley', in how the movie was developed and plays out. Must be the atmosphere that Los Angeles brings to the movie making process and that it is the nicest place I have ever been to in this country. Overall, the film is very popular and has a great cast to it. Maybe a little less drugs for me and I would give it 5 stars.Peter J.

Whenever you find yourself laughing at something that you shouldn't find amusing, you know you are watching a good movie. This was also John Travolta's resurrection. He is incredible as Vincent Vega. Sam Jackson is also hysterical as Jules. Overall this film keeps you wrapped up and interested. You only see all the significance if you watch the whole thing intently.

When Pulp Fiction came out in 1994, it not only caught people's attention, it blew up in thier face! Tarantino became an instant genious, and the movie, a classic. The film is one story about three stories, showcasing a brilliant cast, with John Travlota, Sam Jackson, Uma Thurman, Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, and Bruce Willis. The brilliance of the film lies in Tarantino's ability to create likable characters doing very unlikable things. The strong suit in the film is the dialogue, which is hardly ever related to crime, showing that even criminals have real lives. Named on AFI's 100 years, 100 movies as one of the best films in the last 100 years! It truely is a must see, and a movie to be watched a hundred times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painfully overrated","review":"Fargo, The English Patient and Pulp Fiction; the three most painfully overrated films of the 90's.

There were quite a few memorable lines, but even they could not redeem this atrocity. This film will go down as the perfect example of 1990s \\"style\\" - ugly, disrespectful, violent, colorless and disordered. And don't chalk up this negative review to the age of the viewer; I am a man who was born in 1970.In addition, how many of you parents out there have noticed that this movie was released by a DISNEY subsidiary (Miramax)? Walt must be spinning in his grave at how subversive his organization has become in the last two decades. For every family feature it produces, Disney/ABC/Miramax/etc. is now putting out ten productions akin to Pulp Fiction.

Well, I can confidently say that this movie is nearly a piece of wasted film. Aside the over the top bad language used (more than needed) what this movie really seems to do is to numb your mind to the extent that killing other people is just a cool thing to do. As far as deep meaning or constructive message to the public there are none. Also the beginning and end of the movie are looped togheter, however the overall plot development feels like reading only the middle chapters of a book with no true direction. The idea that this movie is liked by so many clearly shows the direction that society seems to have taken. Overall: PURE GARBAGE."},{"rating":"1","title":"SLOP FICTION.....","review":"Everyone seems to like this movie but me. I just can't develope a taste for it. Even after seeing it on it's release in'94 I still hate it. I don't like swaggering attitude and this film has it in spades. There's a lot going on in it and it all comes to ....what? Samuel L. Jackson is good as a Bible spouting hit man but John Travolta is awful. I nicknamed him John Revolta after seeing this. The only interesting set piece was the 50's diner. That was cool. Watching Travolta and Uma Thurman dance was not. The intertwining stories are unpleasant and violent to the extreme. There's a lot of name association here. Like everyone HAD to be in a Quinton Tarantino movie. Tarantino thinks that by dunking the audiences' head repeatedly in a stinking garbage can will entertain them. Not me. \\"Pulp Fiction\\" is by far one of the most overrated excuses for a movie I've ever seen.

It is hypocritical that the movie lampoons socalled white racists as ferries while the same directors and producers endorse the \\"rights\\" of ferries. Quentin Tarantino must eat a lot of junk food to look like that. He certainly spews out junk when he directs a movie. The pulps I'm familiar with were well written.

Yes. Pulp Fiction is a case in point. At the core of each story fragment is an emotional vacuum that gets glossed over by the clever use of filmmaking gimmickry, self-consciously devised cartoon violence and quirky writing and acting. Tarantino uses these devices to distract the viewer from the fact that his film is emotionally and spiritually pointless and hollow. Could that be the point? To be pointless? Perhaps so, but if being pointless and spiritually hollow is the aim of a film or any creative project, that's a sad commentary on the creator. For a similar effect I prefer to watch Warner Brothers cartoons. They are funnier, more inventive, more artistically satisfying, and there is no element of self-consiousness in the violence. In other words, when I see the violence in a good cartoon, I don't think \\"Oh my God that's so funny.\\" I simply laugh. See the difference?"},{"rating":"2","title":"An absolute favorite!","review":"This is a fun, wild ride! Violent and not for children but full of perfect filmaking moments.

The acting is superb, ranging from the John Travolta to Steve Beusemi. This is the most terrific screenplay, with intriguing dialouge, twisting plot, and hidden innuendos. Quentin Tarentino is an absolute \\"Mastermind\\" when it comes to directing and screenplay. It is no wonder why it won an oscar for best screenplay and all the main actors got nominated. If your looking for the greatest work in the movie business, pick this movie up right away. It has dark comedy, interesting characters, great plots, and magnificent directing. The negative reviewers can't help it to give it bad reviews, they can't help it that they are not smart enough to understand the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best film I've ever seen.","review":"I've seen this film somewhere in the ballpark of 100 times. It never stops being entertaining. I never leave the film without picking up something I missed. It has taken on it's own persona for me. It's like a really dysfunctional old friend.

Perfect.Tarantino may be God."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie","review":"I've enjoyed nearly all of Quetin's work.

I later watched it on DVD and it went up a notch. Then when I saw it on HDTV I had to own the Blu-ray. It is now one of my favorite Tarantino films (behind the Kill Bill series).

It disgusted me the first time with crude and often dump jokes, many things thrown in just to be thrown in like gay rape, drug use, and a near overdoes of violence. In fact, if you took all this out of the movie, it would be a blank tape. I would prefer the blank tape.

Tarantino shows us that he has been to places, or that he at least knows what he is talking about. The script is phenomenal, and the storylines are tangled up in a way i've never seen before. The one-liners used in this film are already classic. It's also nice that you can give the film your own edge, f.i. by considering that Jules was right to stop being a gangster, and that if Vince had only seen his point he'd still be alive. But what could be a better way to go than to be blown away by Bruce Willis, after you've been on the toilet, and you get caught with your pants down.

It is way way way way way too in love with its own cleverness. Occasional bits of brilliance (in particular Samuel Jackson's performance), but nothing to justify all the hype. It has absolutely nothing to say. There is nothing in this movie that has not been done before, and better, by other directors who have a vaguely adult sensibility. Tarantino is trapped in his own sophmoric universe, giggling at how cool he thinks he is.

The overlapping, and mixed-up order of storytelling makes it interesting but confusing for the ADD (Attention Deficit Disorder) crowd. Acting is real - real good.

If you can sit through the first hour or so (despite a brief kill-scene, this is basically just various characters talking), it becomes a never ending cycle of pop-culture references; borderline random violence; language; awesome, jaw-dropping dialogue; and scenes that shock you, catching you completely off guard. Characters that you learn to love will be killed in horrible ways, major screw-ups that shouldn't have happened will set whole plot lines in motion.

You know you're a respected director when u can release an independent film packed with world-renowned stars who will do anything to be in your movie. The structure, plot twists, script, and acting are all unique: Tarantino does an excellent job in taking all of his talents and letting them go on the screen. And Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson (who gives his most commanding performance; his presence alone frightens you), and Thurman along with each other cast member gives Tarantino all that he needs to work his extraordinary script.Although this film is not for the faint-hearted, you'll feel like you've taken part in something extremely special after watching it. A definite must have for any DVD collection!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite movies of all time!","review":"This movie is amazing! It has everything! It has action, drama, comedy. The actting is great & so creative. All the characters were so well developed. You just felt like you knew all the characters so well. This is by far the best job John Travolta has ever done. Samuel L. Jackson is very funny & creative as well, so is the rest of the cast. Quentin Tarintino has introduced us to a different kind of film-making. The main reason this movie was so well liked & enjoyed by so many people is because of the creative dialog it has. The way Tarintino told the story & mixed things up is just amazing film-making which isn't seen very often. Even though some of the content is rough, this movie is so smart & stylish that it's worth everybody viewing."},{"rating":"1","title":"A cheap rip-off","review":"Tarantino's only accomplishment is that he steals most of the techniques from much better Hong Kong directors and inserts some of his unique dialogue. Hence, it is only the dialogue in this movie that is commandable. Otherwise, it's terrible. If you like maverick filmmaking, see anything by Jean-Luc Godard, Wong Kar-Wai or Ringo Lam.

Pretentious camera angles and dialogue, mangled pacing and another bad performance by the tremendously under-talented Bruce Willis made this film difficult for me to watch. As for the use of the \\"N\\" word, I wonder what Tarantino would do if Spike Lee made a movie where Italians were called nasty names, and I think there are plenty. You don't get to use the word sir - you ain't a member of the club.

There is nothing likeable about any of these characters and there is no redeeming quality about any of them either. At no point in the movie are you given a reason to care whether or not any of these characters die. At no point does the movie reveal any aspect of the human condition. The only redeeming quality of the movie is the cast and some of the dialogue. There is even some good acting (but don't look to Uma Therman for it). At the end of the movie I was left with a profound feeling of...\\"So what?\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing has to be said","review":"This movie is a classic, start to finish.

He always cameos in his films - playing the weed that he most likely is in real life - and loves putting so much apparent drivel into the dialogue that you wonder if you're watching an R-rated Seinfeld episode. Yet the bulk of the actors he chooses to deliver these sermons are so charismatic and talented that you're still thoroughly entertained while waiting for a point, if indeed one exists. And when that point invariably emerges it's full of unmistakable insight and humour, which makes it all worthwhile.So as much as I'd like to, I can't deny him the bulk of the credit for some great films, and Pulp Fiction stands out as my personal favourite."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Movie!","review":"This is definetly one of the best movies ever made.

We hear about the re-emergence of John Travolta as a sleeping giant of an actor, the remarkable performance of Samuel Jackson, and what can only be described as borderline idolatry for Quentin Tarantino etc.. We hear about all the extras (interviews, behind the scenes stuff etc.) that appear on the DVD and then there's the sound track, but no one ever bothers to convey to us what the movie meant to them!What, if anything, is the message here? I have been watching movies, foreign films included, for forty years and I wouldn't add this DVD to my library if you gave it to me for free.I can only say that when some call this a 'great' movie, I have absolutely no idea what they mean."},{"rating":"2","title":"You either like it or hate it.","review":"My son brought over \\"Pulp Fiction\\", a movie that he loved, and I sat through this thing shaking my head (a strange and seedy flick, to say the least). Although I did see potential (this movie was not uninteresting, and the acting was top-drawer all the way), I just wasn't used to this type of direction. He left me the tape, and a few months later I viewed it again (at his urging). It was on this second viewing that my mind totally changed. I ended up really enjoying this film and its unique perspective of direction. I certainly realize this film won't be to everyones' taste, (it is very offensive) but sometimes one has to give a movie with potential another chance. I am glad that I did. Between 1 and 10, \\"Pulp Fiction\\" gets a solid 7."},{"rating":"2","title":"A film full of little things.....","review":"I first saw Pulp Fiction when I was working in a movie theater. I was young, just in college, and I might just as well have seen the movie flying by me across the parking lot, a lingerie ad floating toward the trash dumpster.When an earlier reviewer brought up the concept of the film unfolding not in the viewer's sense of reality, but in the characters' reality, I thought of the second time I saw the movie, in a motel room with my uncle. Chain-smoking and debating, we saw the core of the film in those small revelations, the \\"bits of flesh\\".Yes, the film is flawed. John Travolta, I don't feel he's a killer. I don't. But isn't any story out of the reality of the one telling it? As my uncle says, maybe that's the only reality that matters.And watch Bruce Willis' face, the whole time he's at the pawn shop. The humanity of the film rests on his shoulders, and he delivers.A man who respects his enemies has no enemies.Viva storytelling."},{"rating":"2","title":"a PUZZLE IF I EVER SAW ONE","review":"This, I have to say is one of the most realistic, exciting movies I have ever seen! The entire movie fits together like a puzzle. It would not fit so perfectly if the stories weren't out of order. Travolta and Jackson play two hitmen, Vincent and Jules, Vincent takes Mia, their boss' wife on a date that goes horribly wrong. While on the other hand, jules decides to stop doing hits and live his life pure. Then thurman plays Mia, Marcellus Wallace's wife, their boss. Bruce Willis plays Butch a boxer that was payed to throw a fight by Marcellus Wallace, but doesn't. Harvey Keitel is the wolf an expert on disposing of dirty little secrets. Confused? Don't be. Quentin Terrantino did a great job of writing as well as directing. The directing although unorthodox is superb.

The thing about it is this: by the time I walked into the mess that was going on, there were things in this movie that I needed to know. That does not mean that everything I did was right. I do not claim this. What I do think is that some folk had some of what happened to them coming to them. It does not make violent acts right, but this situation is really screwed up. That is why people need to come forward to the police and federalis more. Yea, I know they're crooked, but faith and some honesty can really screw wicked men's plans up. Samuel L.

While some of his stories dwell on cruelty and weakness, Idriss also has stories that illustrate the human capacity for tenderness and forgiveness. Overall, the short stories in this book provide a kaleidoscope of images and characters that left me wanting to read more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Reference Guide","review":"A very good book.

Meaning I saw parts coming.The end was gratifying, the middle pretty good. The beginning was a little slow or rather a little predictable, but not bad.I liked it, which shocks me more than you know.In the end, reading the reviews from other users spoiled a little bit of the movies path, but I recommend this movie. It is about 3.5 to 4 stars, and had a good message."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a family movie","review":"The movie was just ok.

This movie will keep you wondering what is the point but it's not until you almost reach the end of the movie that you understand the whole story. It truely has a good plot and you will not get the plot until you see the whole movie. Enjoyed it. If you want to see some of his fast talking, and serious moments this is the movie. I recommend it for a delightful yet serious side of Eddie as he take you on an adventure. You want be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eddie Fans will be satisfied...?","review":"There are many excellent review for this movie so I'll just add a few words of my own. If you are an Eddie Murphy fan, I think you will be satisfied with this film. His antics and timing are right on and he manages to rescue this film from obscurity. I took off one star for the New Age gobbledygook that has little to do with the real world and detracts from the story. Another star removed for the basic concepts of this film being repeats of Jim Carrey's \\"Liar Liar,\\" \\"Yes Man,\\" etc., and one more star for the notion that a father raising a child with his male partner could ever be considered cute. How could denying a child the love of a mother be in any way humorous?Enjoy the flim, then rent \\"Beverly Hills Cop\\"..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gotta Love Eddie","review":"Not a bad movie for the money.

Poor, poor unhappy people they must be. As you read their reviews, it's as if they purchased the CD expecting virtuosity (actually, there really is some good music behind this). How can people so completely miss the point of an album? This guy is out there, rockin' his --- off and having a good time. Fortunately for us, he cares enough to share the fun.

Hopefully they'll loosen up and smile."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Dark Day in Music Indeed....","review":"Oh God they call this music? How did this guy get a record deal? I mean the lyrics are bad (Party Hard? C'mon!) and I couldn't stop laughing during the video for the Party Hard song (lol with WK headbanging while the words \\"PARTY HARD\\" are being strobed behind him that was hilariously bad) This is boring, tasteless music, and it brings back the days of the 80s. Pass this up, but I must say it makes a great coaster."},{"rating":"1","title":"if you buy this you suck","review":"this is the most vapid and pathetic cd i've ever heard. EVER. The only reason I am reviewing this is to prevent any self-respecting music fan from the humility I am experiencing right now as I listen to this cd at work. DON't let anyone EVER see you in close proximity to this cd! Any cred you've no doubtedly spent years on building will be blown instantly! the best part about the album (beside the end if you make it that far) is the cover, i have a feeling that it was taken immediately after good ol' andrew handed the master tapes over to his record execs at Island. I woulda popped him one too! Unfortunately amazon doesn't have anything less that 1 star, because this cd is definitely beer coaster fodder. This guy is so bad he's the next Crazytown.

Really dont buy this album, you will regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"You can tell how bad it is...","review":"By the fact that nearly all the reviewers of this CD have an 6th-grade grasp of grammar and punctuation.In response to the many comparisons drawn between Andrew W.K. and various hair metal bands, I would say that such comparisons aren't fair. Andrew W.K. is far less talented than any popular 80's metal band. I'd go so far as to say he's less talented than Britney Spears. Power chords aren't that impressive if you don't have anything to say."},{"rating":"1","title":"What does pop puke up once it has eaten itself?","review":"It pukes up Andrew WK of course.There have been lots of novelty acts in the history of rock.. let's hope this one doesn't last too long.This music is flacid, uncreative and unimaginative.. it's no wonder it appeals to the current generation of rock listener's who have been duped by the marketing genius behind Andrew WK.Anyway if it like his stuff then you should really do yourself a favor and throw it away and listen to KISS as they truly knew how to Party All Night Long and were doing it way before this jerk was even twinkle in someone's eye. Of course they are old now and the kiddies can't relate to anyone that is so \\"5 minutes ago\\" let alone ten or twenty years ago... what with the attention defecit disorders and ritalin that they are on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy IT!

His music fuels my every desire. It's melodies are so positive, they do nothing but make me smile, and be happy. This music is heartfelt Rock N' Roll at it's finest. If you don't own it, you must buy it, you will never think of life in the same way."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a joke, right?","review":"One of the most repetitive albums I've ever heard.

There is NO WAY to listen to this stuff without cracking up. I Love NYC and Get Ready to Die are especially funny."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!!!","review":"This cd is the best purchase i have made in years. The grinding organs and whaling vocals keep on rockin'from begining until the last beautiful note. By mixing the sultry lyrics of \\"She is beatiful\\" with the post punk lyrics of \\"Party 'till you puke,\\" Andrew w.k. has created a masterpiece of this generation. Every once in a great while a cd is made with such mastery of rock, if you do not purchase this cd, you have missed out on a rockin' and rollin' schooling in rockin' and rollin' that you may never find again."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME","review":"This is one of the best investments (cd-wise) that I have made in a long time. 'I Get Wet' brings back the joy of rock and roll. No rap garbage, nothing that makes you go \\"What's happening to music these days?!?\\" Just good old fashioned kick you in the a&* rock.

You never know when he is going ot blow. And he does. Several times and loudly. His music is just the same as his personality, Loud, bubbly, hard, fast, and crazy. Excellent.Maybe you have heard that the same guitar riffs are in every song, maybe you have heard that he does nothing but sing the same song over and over. So what? That same song, with the lyrics changed into 14 different ones rocks my world and will rock yours as well. The album is about living life your way, not anyone elses, and about living it to the fullest degree possible.The album features great songs like ready to die, the most entergetic bouncy song he has to date, that showcase the enigma that Andrew W K is all about. Get ready to die people. You are going to die. Go out and live."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kick Back, Relax And Turn This Baby All The Way Up!","review":"When its time to party you WILL party hard when you turn on this small piece of pricless material!This album is so full of power and energy and was made not to disappoint, After one song finishes then next one is already full steam ahead and banging its catchy tune into your head! NOTE: TO all customers that have bought or are going to buy the album 'Andrew W.K. - I Get Wet' and have experianced a shiver down there spine when listening i urge you to go and see Andrew W.K. in concert.

I haven't found a CD that I can listen to from the first track to the last without having the urge to skip songs since The Descendents put out \\"Everything Sucks\\" several years ago.As for the sound... imagine the Bosstones ditching the horns and having a bloody run-in with Springsteen circa \\"Born to Run,\\" with a little Europe and Meatloaf thrown in, and some oi style gang vocals to make sure you're singing along and having a good time.I actually jones for this CD when it's not on sometimes... listen to it a couple times to get my fix, then have to turn it off so I can come down. Good stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"A breath of fresh air","review":"Us hard-rock lovers have gone quite a spell without anything to be happy about. Recent rock radio has swamped us with pretentious, whiny, touchy-feely bands such as Creed and Staind and Puddle of Mudd. Andrew WK comes along and blows them all away. He has but one goal with this record: to have fun and invite us all along for the ride. Sure there's a healthy dose of pop music in the mix but fans of loud, crunchy guitars will be more than satisfied with the offerings here. Andrew seems to be heavily influenced by 80s metal since you can hear the Bon Jovi, Def Leppard, and even Iron Maiden influences on the record. If you need a more modern reference point, think Rob Zombie without the occult references and a little lighter on the synth. It's not high art by any stretch but all in all, Andrew WK's 'I Get Wet' is a fun little hard rock record."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Got wet when i heard this.","review":"This cd kicks some major A** its just some headbanging good time. its a wall of sound that you break through and its such a rush the first time you hear it you feel like partying."},{"rating":"2","title":"SAVIOR OF ROCK","review":"i first heard andrew wk a few months ago through a friend and within a few days i was hooked, he is absolutlty amazing, every song on this cd is amazing and will keep your energy up 200 percent with their amazing wall of sound for the length of it. my personal favorites are \\"get ready to die\\" and \\"she is beautiful\\". and after you buy this cd and know every song everyone should try to see him in concert, he puts on an amazing show and if extremely friendly to the fans after the show. 5 STARS. this music is pulling us out of the musical slump we are in and have been in for quite a while. i recommend it 100 percent, it will stay in your cd player for weeks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Party and Party over and over again","review":"this CD are really Powerful. When I played it at a no-too-hard Party, my friends and guest started that jump-like-a-crazy-freak Dance. Then, that Bored-Hardless party became to a really Freakin' Party-HARD. AWK is a new-born singer in Mexico.Whe he came to mexico a week ago. I went to the concert and it was powerful. AWK changed that 'I love NYC' song to 'I love MEXICO CITY'."},{"rating":"2","title":"get it","review":"For everyone who enjoys nay-saying Andrew W.K.'s debut release \\"I Get Wet,\\" my reply is simple: get it. Andrew is not trying to do anything radical, new or lyrically challenging on \\"Wet,\\" he is simply trying to have a good time and maybe even puke while he is doing so. While the music is FAR from a joke, it also not meant to be categorized with the angst-rock of Limp Bizkit, the Christian-rock undertones of P.O.D. or the the pop-punk sounds of Blink-182, all of which (unfortantly) dominate the airwaves on this side of the Atlantic. The reason most critics and a handful of lucky, open-minded radio listeners are so into Andrew W.K. is becuase it's DIFFERENT. It's not angst-ridden, it doesn't have Christian undertones, and it doesn't come off the Drive-Thru Records label (as most pop-punk albums over here in the US do). Keep an open mind when listening to it, grab a drink, sit back, have fun, and Get Wet."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Attack Against Poser Metal","review":"OK, This CD is amazing. It's like finally someone stands up against stupid metal bands with only a couple of good songs like Slipknot, Mudvayne, with poser teen fans who wouldn't know music if it kicked their[behind... So I highly reccomend this CD from songs like Party Hard to Don't Stop Living In The Red. I GET WET from Andrew WK is the re-evolution of rock music. Damnit I'm sick of all this screaming... with enough band members to start a marching band and the hypocritical lyrics. Why would somebody where a mask any way. KISS wore face paint but weren't afraid to show their face. You must be one ugly bastard to spend your day in a rubber mask. Andrew WK, thumbs up you crazy S.O.B."},{"rating":"2","title":"Andrew, Thy Saviour","review":"I'm gonna have to say that the reviewer at the top of the page missed the point of this album.

Get it, you won't be sorry!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"FUN BUT REPETITIVE","review":"Yes, this is a fun record, and reminds me of the 80's music, but I kinda like to here some variety within a record! The songs on Andrew W.K.s' I Get Wet, all sound the same, and it's like one long song, with only a few speed variations! I like \\"party hard\\", and is why I bought the c.d., but all the songs sound like this, so I guess I like all the songs? I also like to hear some sort of vocals, this is all chanting, like a football team or something. Other tracks that I like are \\"she is beatiful\\", and \\"I love N.Y.C.\\" Hopefully Andrew's next record will be titled \\"I Get Variety\\"!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice and lovable CD cover. But not the music.","review":"Contrary to my tendency to buy an album after hearing it patiently and carefully, I must concede that I bought this CD because of the violent impression that gave me its cover depicting Andrew WK's face covered in deep red blood. While I love the cover, I just can't say the same about the music, which seems to me that is a new, pumped-up version of bands like Bon Jovi, Cinderella or Poison: a boy-band silly, beat-repeating danceable music with a little roughness in its edge. And add fried keyboards to go, please. A pity of an album, considering that Andrew's voice is really wonderful. So, if you're the Slayer type, don't waste your time like I did. Just enjoy watching the CD cover."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes, it's crap, but it's the best crap ever made","review":"Look. I'm well aware of how inane and stupid this album is. And it's the exact atithesis of every jaded 1990's everything-sucks band I've had to put up with as I grew up with the letter X stamped onto my forehead by the Baby Boomers. This album is our revenge. Take it or leave it.Combine 80's bubblegum with Operation Ivy's anger and Def Leppard's polish and listen to it all at Motorhead's volume and you've got this album. It's never been done before and never been pulled off as well. That reason alone makes this album important regardless of how trite and meaningless the content is.Believe me, I've got high standards regarding music. If someone as snobby as me prefers Autechre and Pete Yorn over garbage like Motley Crue and New Kids on the Block, yet STILL likes Andrew W.K., it should say something about this poor guy."},{"rating":"2","title":"It really is...time to party!","review":"On December 10th, I went to go see Aerosmith perform.

I just don't see how this album can be claimed to be anything other than rubbish.He also sounds like he is Swedish/Norwegian with a none to clever grasp of th eEnglish language. His lyrics are horrendous, repetitive and extremely childish. I could very easily mak a better attempt. Seriously please listen before you buy. I should have !!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BUY THIS!!!","review":"Wow, this is so cool. Especially because I hate all other music. All other music is whiny nu-metal, and anything with emotion is stupid. I think these guys have skills. Gotta love how every track sounds the same, and how the drumming never changes in any song (bass-snare-bass-snare-bass-snare). I can't wait until Andrew goes home one night and blows his brains out just like Kurt Cobain did.

Sure, \\"soulful\\" bands like Creed and all the rest have some cathy tunes, but come on, are any of those discs likely to get stuck in your CD player and just left there because it makes you feel GOOD to listen to the music? That's what Andrew W.K. offers. Pure, simple, make your toes tap and make you feel good about the world music. Forget the bubblegum and forget the deep lyrics being foisted on us a rock these days.

While cynics can dismiss it as derivative, obnoxious, mindless frat-rock, I feel like they're missing out. This album is the most visceral expression of joy I have ever heard. It's triumphant, vibrant and elating. Exploding with hedonistic zeal, this is an album about being alive and present in the purest sense. Whether one enjoys it ironically or sincerely, the feeling is the same: delighting, uplifting and intoxicating. And in case anyone is wondering, I'm being dead serious."},{"rating":"2","title":"Party 'till you Puke!","review":"He's one of a kind and if you can find another like him, be sure to let me know. Andrew W.K. may sound frivolous to the untrained ear, but ask yourself what kind of qualities make up the music that matters [to you] and you'll find that for a Fun Night, Andrew W.K. only wants to help.

There's no getting around it, the album just totally kicks ass and the fact that it's so upbeat makes it even more fun.I've heard people say it sounds like a throwback to the 80's. Well, I've never heard any 80's bands rock as hard as AWK. The man writes the dumbest songs in the world and doesn't care what you think about it. But, as allmusic.com said, you'll either hate it because its the dumbest thing you've ever heard, or you'll love it because its the dumbest thing you've ever heard. I for one love it.And, if you ever get the chance, go to one of his concerts. There's a good chance you'd get to meet him, since he loves talking to his fans.

In an age where boy bands and rap dominates the music scene, Andrew W.K. captured the essence of hair metal. With loud guitar riffs, slamming drums, and , oddly enough, classical piano. I think the way A.W.K. incorporates his talent for piano into rock and roll sets his music apart. \\"I Get Wet\\" is a breath of fresh air from the generic rock of today and should not go unnoticed. So do yourself a BIG favor and pick up a copy of \\"I Get Wet\\" today.

With classic tracks as READY TO DIE, I LOVE NYC & the infamous PARTY HARD! we will always party hard, with andrew w.k."},{"rating":"2","title":"andrew wk, the future of all that is good.","review":"i heard about andrew wk from some friends who were visiting from england. he was already fairly big there evidently before \\"i get wet\\" started making a commotion here in the states.and i truly have to thank them. right as i was getting bored with everything that was being put out lately in the music world, i heard \\"i get wet\\" and was amazed. the album is fun, energetic and lets you know that you should really be having a good time no matter what.metal influence but poppy in the best kind of way, you can't help but sing, pump your fists in the air and dance around like there is no tomorrow. if you haven't yet heard any of his music you must check andrew wk out. as terrible rock rules the airwaves he is a breath of fresh, fun, air."},{"rating":"1","title":"every song on this album will be in a commercial","review":"uggh.. this is the silliest thing i've heard in a while.hearing this stuff makes me think i'm in the middle of a beer commercial.. and seriously.. i fully believe that the whole album was made for no other reason than to provide a soundtrack to beer and truck commercials.complete and total garbage. don't even waste your time listening to the audio samples."},{"rating":"2","title":"ha.... ha ha.... i don't get it.","review":"after listening to this album, you're left asking yourself... what the hell? how could you possibly classify this? it sounds like nothing else. it's... uh, hair metal, played with lots of synth, only, much more up to date, and heavier. and... HAPPY?! this is one odd duck. yes, many of the songs sound the same, but if you like it, you won't care. andrew w.k. sort of proves a first-time point- it's okay to bash the hell out of everything, and be HAPPY about it. it's pretty weird. and certainly not \\"cool\\" by any means... but everyone has a different definition of that. either you're going to like this, or you're going to hate it. yes, it's a parody. yes, it's okay to like this.listen to the samples. if you like what you hear, get the record and you'll love it. if you don't... listen to some RAMMSTEIN."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ironic 80's rock or just unimaginative?","review":"Wow. This is really awful. Reminds me of the Reagan era. I don't know what else to say.No...wait; yes I do. Andrew W.K. MAY be making this music in earnest, and make no mistake that this is PAARRTAAAY music, but it is terribly boring party music. Full of bombast, but it doesn't stick and it won't last. I think back to some great dancing/drinking/sexy music, and this don't doesn't hold up under their grooviness. Think of Jerry Lee Lewis, the Meters, Jackson Five, The Cars, Prince, KISS, Funkadelic, even the Bee Gees...will you remember these Andrew WK songs in light of these others? I'm betting not. Then again, if the sonic equilvalent of Mc Donalds is what you are into (read: filling, but ultimately empty), this may be your thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outdated 80's Glam Rock","review":"I dunno, so far I've only heard two sound samples from this silly guy and he sounds like outdated 80's glam rock. Not only that but quite frankly if your looking for just plain old rock and roll there are far better artists out there then freaking Andrew W.K. Just to name one of them Local H. Besides, can't he write about more mature themes then partying? Why do I ask that? Because anyone can write about partying, it's not a hard subject to tackle... Oh yeah, also saw him perform on SNL, meh... Nothing all that great about the performance there. I dunno, for what your money is truly worth there is better stuff to spend it on. Is your 15 dollars truly worth a 40, maybe 45, minute cd about partying all night?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A lame attempt at hard rock","review":"To compare this cd to anything other than pop is an outright lie. I bought this cd after reading so many great reviews of how hard this guy rocks. Get real! I am mostly a metal fan who will listen to any hard rock or metal genre as long as it's good. This is none of the above. The mixture of synthesizer and guitars just doesn't cut it. This is top 40 bubblegum music to me. This guy made music fun again? I doubt that. And when did music cease from being fun? If I would have played this junk at a party I would have been thrown out. Party till you puke? No need to, just listen to this garbage and you'll get the same outcome."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a joke, right?","review":"I can't even believe this album seriously exists. Can this be for real? It's almost like a parody of itself! Now, I don't want to come off as some snob who only listens to cerebral music, I enjoy AC/DC, Van Halen, and some hair metal, but with all due respect, most of their lyrics make me want to hurl. I can handle dumb party lyrics to some extent, but this is just too much. Really, this guy makes AC/DC look like Rush. Plus, the music is way simple, and they go overboard with \\"catchy hooks\\" to the point where it's just annoying. I can stand to listen to just about anything longer than this.I can't imagine how anyone can hear this and honestly say it's good. If you want some fun music for a party, go crank up Quiet Riot's \\"Metal Health\\". If this dude is the savior of rock, then rock doesn't need to be saved."},{"rating":"1","title":"Obviously a joke","review":"True, Andrew W.K. is obviously a joke. But I do have to respect anyone with the guts to release an album with songs like this. Ode to partying? Alright, at least Andy W.K. is having fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"The WOLF","review":"I am excited about the release of \\"the wolf\\" tomorrow. AWKs original album has been in my car CD player since i got it. \\"Party Hard\\" and \\"Fun Night\\" are my 2 favorite..I have heard his new album and it seems to fill you up more than a hearty meal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Andrew WK is an honest man...","review":"I award this album 4 stars for high excellence in the field of music. It's just plain fun. Andrew WK is a cool, fun-loving guy who makes kickass party rock music. Just listen to this album and you'll feel like you're a teenager again. And if you still are a teenager, you'll love it too! Check out \\"Ready To Die\\" and \\"Party Hard\\"; they are excellent songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent rock -pop-party album- don't miss it!","review":"This album has it all- great riffs, melodic choruses, like a good combination of Abba and Motorhead! Noisy fun for all, the perfect party album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"Can I just say one thing? Andrew W.K.'s new album \\"I Get Wet\\" is fist pumping, hard rocking, crazy partying album. This has to be one of my favorite cd's. It combines Heavy Metal, 80's Pop, and Punk, and there's even a piano, all in one cd. It redefines the meaning of the word party, into a whole new headbanging genre. This is a real find in these days of so called misery rock. There isn't a song on this cd I don't like. Its about having as much fun as you possibly can and getting wet in the process, that is partying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Relentless Fun Pure And Simple!","review":"This album is consistently loud, fast and unapologetically darn good fun! 'I Get Wet' is an all time classic as far as I'm concerned and I would not care if everyone else on Earth hated this man and his music- as the lyric to 'Fun Night' goes \\"We've got just one concern and we're gonna get dumb!\\" Let go for 35 minutes and enjoy a brainless full on party album!'It's Time To Party', 'She Is Beautiful' and the title track are the highlights of a record that helped to shed my shyness skin and make me the confident lover of life I am today.'I Get Wet' is my favourite Saturday night warm up soundtrack!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Party Music","review":"Andrew WK has come out with the absolute best party music I've seen since the 80's hair bands. It picks you up and make you wanna dance. I highly recommend this album. I stil haven't figured out why they haven't released the song 'I Love NYC' as a single, that would be great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rockin and a rollin","review":"This album is the most fun and rocking thing ive heard in a very long time. Its one of the only CDs I own that I can listen to the whole way through without skipping anything. Its just that good. This album is heavy, fast, furious, and fun all at the same time. I would suggest it to ANYONE who wants to expand there horizons and listen to something new."},{"rating":"2","title":"I don't know why but I LOVE this CD","review":"This CD ROCKS.... Don't know why I like it. The songs are simple and not complex at all. They rock hard, but for some reason put a smile on your face. Can't stop listening to it. Buy this CD pop, it in your car and rock.... Andrew wears dirty white jeans and doesn't give a $hit. You should buy this CD and crank it loud.... Like you don't give a $hit either"},{"rating":"2","title":"The New Bubblegum Tastes Like Gasoline...","review":"Born of big-hair speed-metal bluster and early new wave, Andrew Wilkes-Krier goes for the visceral slam of punk with a message of positivity designed to melt the irony and any sense of \\"guilty pleasure\\" out of the listener. This album will kick your ass around the block. Some of these songs are infectious and although you can at times sense both the calculation and the earnestness fighting beneath the sonic assault, the earnestness ultimately wins out, mostly through the little touches like that goofy piano/synth hammering out quarter notes throughout the mayhem. Best track: the title song \\"I Get Wet,\\" a 21-st century gospel song which seems to be about a holy fool getting the best kind of baptism, a state of grace which can never be lost, because how can you lose something you don't even know you have?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I get wet is right?","review":"I get wet when your dying? What the hell does that mean. This is they worst thing in rock music right now. Not to mention it has some wierd twist of hip hop culture. I heard the British press thought this was a good album, but they also thought Coldplay was the next radiohead. So lets not get a party started."},{"rating":"1","title":"is this a joke?","review":"Just buy the single and save yourself some money. Which single? Any single of his will do. All of these tracks sound identical. The CD begins to get repititous after about 1 1/2 songs. Is party even still a verb? I guess so according to this Einstein.Horrible, horrible CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why???!!!","review":"I am having trouble understanding as to why this is getting such great reviews. I mean true, this is the funniest thing to come around since Prince, but [what the heck]. The minute I saw this clown on MTV I was shocked back into 1984 and wondering why if I was supposed to be PARTYING HARD, I was more compelled to leap out the second story window. That and I had to jump on the innerweb and try and find who this guy was. Don't you usually have to be someone in the music industry to call your band your name. Make it big with a band like hmmm Black Sabbath. Look at me I'm Andrew W.K. I'm ready to [stink] from day one. Well, I'll do one thing and that's follow the big W.K.'s advice and party till I puke, but more likely it's from hearing this music and laughing mid sip of booze."},{"rating":"1","title":"The poor man's post-Black Flag Henry Rollins","review":"I can't even begin. For one, the lyrics are as simplistic as I once was inclined to believe humanly possible. I mean seriously, I could pull better writing out of the exact place Andrew W.K's personality represents. Number two, who told this kid he could dance? Or sing? Or have talent? That man who lied to him, my friend, is the reason for capital punishment. But if you come away with anything from my review, remember this...DON'T BUY THIS FLIPPING CD. DON'T!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Seriously","review":"I saw the video for \\"Party Hard\\" and thought it was a joke - I mean if you watch it with no volume, you think it's some death metal band, and then you turn up the volume and you just want to swallow your tongue. I've read reviews that say \\"Just give this album a chance.\\" How do you listen to an album that includes the word \\"party\\" in 3 titles? Someone actually created a song called \\"Party Till You Puke,\\" and it WASN'T Adam Sandler. I just don't get it. As far as the music goes, Andrew WK should be locked up for crimes against piano loops. Some Amazon reviews claim this album shows brilliance in its \\"stupidity.\\" When I read something like that it makes me hate myself for being alive. Maybe it's just my ignorance of the album's attempt to make fun of itself, but the lyrics are perhaps the most moronic collection of...I can't even find the right word. Imagine Sepultura hired Britney Spears' songwriter. It's just that bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst of 2002","review":"Childish. Real childish...then again, maybe I've just grown up. Glam rock of the 80's died for a reason. Andrew W.K. didn't quite get the message. To all you Motley Crue, Cinderella, Winger, and Ratt fans - this album's for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is really bad...","review":"This is seriously the worst thing I have ever heard. When i hear it, i usually laugh because its so bad that its funny! I can't emphasize any more how dumb and terrible this is..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Andrew W.K Rocks!","review":"Andrew W.K is an amazing cd! It makes you wanna get up and party. Unlike alot of hard rock bands and artists, this cd has a positive attitude while still maintaining the heavy sound. It's a great album that keeps you head banging but cheers you up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"When it's time to party, we will party hard!","review":"So as you may or may not know by now, Andrew W.K. doesn't have the most complex lyrics around, but for his style of music, it doesn't really matter. The only thing you need to think about when listening to him is that \\"It's time to paaaarty!\\". So yes, every song is an anthem about feeling good and partying hard. And it's all done to the music of simple but awesome keyboard melodies, frenzies guitar chords, stadium rock drums and masculine vocals. From the playfulness of the opener \\"It's Time To Party\\", to the blazing opening guitar solo in \\"She Is Beautiful\\", this album is a great summer party album! It's all melodic hard rock with lots of energy and fun, and to me, that beats out a double-meaning political song anyday, even though I'm quite the Liberal, but whatever. Get it, rock out, and, like Andrew W.K. would put it, party till you puke! Thanks for the time, and peace."},{"rating":"2","title":"Believe in Andrew W. K.","review":"Andrew W. K. is here to save rock n'roll, with I Get Wet we hear the anti-Kid A, and it is massive. With a sound that has been described as Slayer meets Abba, Andrew W. K. tears down Neo-Grunge and Nu-Metal with a fury that surpasses all. The only fault of this disc is the ommission of We Want Fun, other than that the disc is flawless."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Time To PARTY!!!!!","review":"andrew w.k. is a genius. he writes smart songs about living life to the fullest. lyrically, anyone can understand his music, and relate. he speaks straight forwardly about his beliefs and backs them with full, catchy, and definitely rockin' tunes. i do not suggest continuing your life without owning this record. itll show you how to live. on full volume. CANT STOP LIVIN IN THE RED!!!!rock'n'roll"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just suck it up and buy it.","review":"This is a just a great album--what a fantastic break from all the melodrama out there today. ... if Richard Wagner and Anthrax had given birth to a kid who hung out with early, ska-core Mighty Mighty Bosstones and tried to imitate Bobcat Goldthwait as a youngster, we'd have gotten an album close to this. It is a blast of good-natured fun which admittedly consists of the same ... song repeated about ten or eleven times.I got it today and have had a stupid grin on my face for hours. This is a formidable kick ... that will knock you out out of whatever angst-ridden tree branch by which you happen to be hanging. Happy listening, and don't be embarrassed. It really is good stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was really psyched... but...","review":"I was really psyched that power metal is back. I love this genre. I love the way \\"Party Hard\\" sounds... I love the hook. I love the use of the one-chord pulsing piano and the major scale melodies in that song.Except... I was a little disappointed when...The whole album sounded the same way!!!These guys are talented... but they copied \\"Party Hard\\" a dozen times! The same one-chord pulsing piano is also in \\"She is Beautiful\\" and most of the other songs! The same major scale melody (and in most cases, even the same notes) are used! The same structure is used for all of the songs, the same formula.Doesn't the phrase \\"Let's get a party goin'..\\"sound extremely similar to:\\"She is beautiful...\\"? That's what I'm talking about!If you know nothing about music theory, then let me put it this way:ALL OF THE SONGS SOUND THE SAME.They all talk about the same thing. It had wonderful potential. But Andrew WK lacks a LOT of diversity. A LOT."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for what is...quit complaining","review":"This is a mindless bob your head up and down album. All those who hate it don't get it. It's meant for a person who wants mindless good time. It's that simple."},{"rating":"2","title":"The New Kayak Shop","review":"I wanted to buy a kayak, but when I saw the prices for a light, sea kayak ($2000 and up) I couldnt beleive it.

Well, with the help of this book, the answer is a resounding yes!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing advertisement","review":"This book did not meet my expectations. It does offer good wood working advice, and basic instructions of how to build a kayak, but the \\"complete plans\\" \\"for three new boats\\" listed on the cover consist of only three to five pages of tiny drawings for each boat. The author also encourages the reader to \\"buy the plans, or kit, before building any of the kayaks. If I bought the kits, I would expect the directions to come with them, and I feel a bit hosed for paying $15 bucks for a collection of little more than advertisements."},{"rating":"1","title":"dont buy this book for the plans","review":"Hii bought this book for the plans actually , but as other pepole said the plans are pretty useless , everything in them are very tiny .if i read the reviews before i probably wasnt buy the book"},{"rating":"2","title":"Take it for what it is","review":"Yes, this book relies on CLC kits, and is tied to CLC. No, it does not provide stand alone plans. On the other hand, it is a good read, and provides a clear, concise overview of the assembly process for these boats- which is why I bought it in the first place."},{"rating":"2","title":"Building Kayaks","review":"This book has excellent illustrations which aid in comprehension of the instructions. The text is very clear and easy to read. I hope the author will write more in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Basic but by no means simple","review":"This book does exactly what it says on the cover being comprehensive outline of the basics of Buddhist philosophy. It is laid out in methodical fashion, you might say in a way that is typically Japanese. It is not a beginners' guide and will be of more interest and benefit to students of Buddhism who already have got past the introductory stage."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful","review":"I just loved it, cannot get enough of the duo, I bought the whole series.

The book progresses from the fundamentals of the writing system to \\"Liberalization Plans in Foreign Trade Exchange\\" and \\"The Forms of T'ang Poetry\\" in less than two hundred pages, leaving little room for explanation. As a result, this book might be a useful textbook within the context of an advanced class, but it's not of much use to students studying on their own. It's also worth noting that nearly all of my Japanese books, including everything from novels to popular texts on psychology, are easier than even the 'intermediate' articles in this reader; this book is more liable to scare off students (even relatively advanced ones) than to provide either education or interesting reading materials."},{"rating":"1","title":"Small print","review":"Although it is true that some of the material in this book is old (conversations about rotary telephones), my most serious complaint lies elsewhere and has to do with the fonts used in the printing. When the book was reprinted, a smaller format was chosen which means that the kanji are very small and difficult to read. In the advanced section, there are newspaper articles where the print is so tiny it becomes unreadable. It is almost impossible to count the strokes in the characters to look them up in a dictionary. In short, you need a magnifying glass to use this book once you get out of the elementary section. That is a pity. Learning Japanese is great but not at the expense of one's eyesight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid....outdated","review":"One of the problems of someone like me, and probably you, is finding a Japanese reader that wasn't written over 40 years ago!The Japanese government established a standard set of Kanji, around 2,000 in 1981 (? not positive about the date) so anything written much more than 20 years ago will contain Kanji that you won't find in a dictionary, and that are not used.Also, not only are the Kanji no longer used but the expressions are antiquated.So a suggestion for an alternative?

Reading it, I get the feeling that the publishing company let the author down in the editing process. The enthusiasm is there, a basically decent plot line and character development emerges from its pages. But Offutt is repetitive.

However, they created two fatal errors that seriously hampered play. Firstly, the background scene with its space detail makes an excellent camouflage, obscuring the action. Secondly, there is no adjustability with the key board control settings. This would normally not be a concern except that the placement of the controls (as they are permanently set) does not flow at all on the key board. I guess what I really was hoping for was the original fun with modern improvement.

It is clunky and heavy. For some reason the turbo light goes on and stays lit on one of the controllers but stays off on the other two no matter how many times it is pressed.

It stopped responding and now i have to junk controllers that sometimes work on some games. I highly recomend the wireless wavebird controller instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I got this controler as a present last christmas. [...]. If you really like gamecube you won't be a cheapo and will buy a better controller than this one and it will be VERY worth the extra few dollars.

It's really a very terrible experience I got! Cause the same problem I have had with another company--I got another broken cd from Hemera.

Get to know the band get the music and make your ears happy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quite","review":"Ben Folds Five to me are like a note that is ever so slightly flat - all the more annoying because it is so close to being right on the money. The hit song \\"Brick\\", for example, is a brilliant pop tune, cleverly arranged and straightforwardly recorded. The vocal performance and words, while attempting to be serious and world-weary, brings it to earth with a thud, as does the remarkably poor metaphor upon which this series of numbing images revolves - \\"she's a brick\\"?! Brick is a clunky word, and describes the situation well enough I suppose if we can call a person such a thing, but the clunk is at odds with the flow of the music. No cigars here."},{"rating":"2","title":"cool","review":"i think i've fallen in love with this album all over again. maybe there were subliminal messages added or something, i dunno"},{"rating":"1","title":"Weaker than I expected","review":"I bought their debut album (\\"Ben Folds Five\\") and Ben Folds' solo effort (\\"Rockin' the Suburbs\\") before I listened to \\"Whatever and Ever Amen\\", and I have to say that this album looks worse for the comparison. The \\"catchy pop\\" songs on this album don't have the frenetic rookie stylings or strong hooks of the first album. With the exception of \\"Brick\\", the deep character introspections aren't as strong as those on \\"Rockin' the Suburbs\\".\\"Whatever and Ever Amen\\" seems more like an attempt to create saleable radio tracks than a sincere effort, with a lot of modern-rockish pop mix techniques but not much feeling. There are 2 or 3 standout songs, but the album didn't work for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful...Boring","review":"Sorry, but the only song I can deal with is \\"Brick\\" and that's about a girl who has an abortion and can't deal with it afterwards.

That was, of course, until a friend of mine convinced me to borrow this CD. I listened to it once through and thought I was done with it, but songs like \\"Kate\\", \\"One Angry Dwarf...\\" and \\"Battle of Who Could Care Less\\" had me hooked by the end of the week. After buying the CD I began to relaize that there is not ONE bad song on this CD. Top to bottow is sweet, pure bliss put to music. Not only does Ben write beautifully, but his singing can go from graceful and emotion-laden to exciting with a rocking \\"edge\\". The songs all have a \\"reality\\" to them, as if they are all beliveable stories stemming from Ben and not just lyrics. Although \\"Brick\\" earned this album its success, it is only the beginning of the goodness this album contains. It was enough to make me a huge BF5 fan after all! Buy it, you won't be dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Holy shnikes... this is fab stuff","review":"It was about 2 years ago that I first heard BFF. It was \\"Battle of Who Could care less\\" that I heard, and I was hooked. I only bought Whatever and Ever Amen in May, but it's still sitting on my heavy rotation list. There isn't a single song on the CD I can say that I don't like. In fact, \\"One angry dwarf...\\" is my theme song here, uz I'm so short and tired of being made fun of. \\"Kate\\" makes me laugh just because of how nerdy it sounds. \\"Steven's Last night in town\\" is fab and fun to dance to.

I think you should buy the DVD of Ben Folds Five too - it's better than the CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"a rediscovered classic","review":"so, in 8th grade my favorite band was ben folds five. why? because i was a geek/slacker, so was he. so there was a level of being able to relate. i eventually lost interest(as most 14 year olds do) & moved onto all sorts of music. 5 years past & about a month ago i was in my sisters room & noticed she had this cd...so i took it from her(she doesn't deserve it & i dont even know what happened to my copy.) i listened to it & my god it's just.....good. great song writing & Ben only further proves how great an instrument the piano is. & it's sad that all the 1 star reviews are simple pissing & moaning about how the rest of the album doesn't sound like 'Brick' which, yes, is a good song, but there are better tunes on the album. if you don't own it, stop wasting my air."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ben Folds Is My Big Love Daddy","review":"Ben Folds Five make me smile. And cry. And laugh. And hurt. And any other emotion you can come up with. As a hardcore fan of at least 3 years, I have finally decided that Whatever and Ever Amen is my favourite of their albums. They have the ablility to combine grace, humor, and heartache into every single note.It's one of the few cd's I own that can make me both cry and dance. Oh yeah, Ben Folds is my big love daddy."},{"rating":"2","title":"This one will stand the test of time","review":"Wonderful music! This is a CD which will be treasured as a classic well into the next century. Nothing else is quite like this - Folds' instrument prompts the obvious comparisions to Elton John, Billy Joel and Randy Newman. These are apt, but listeners who aren't fans of those '70s stars may still love this."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best CD's you can buy!","review":"Ben Folds and his pals have a winning sound. For a three-piece band (yes three, not five), they make and awfully big sound. Ben is an amazing piano player. The kind that has huge callouses on his hands from banging on the ivory. I heard a couple songs from this album before it was released and anxiously waited for it to appear in local stores. I think it was one of the best music purchases I have ever made. Every track is excellent!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Give it time. It grows on you","review":"When i first bought this album, i only like a couple tracks (1 angry dwarf, battle of who could care less, brick) thinking that the rest of the album was [junk]. But upon more and more listening, some of the more meaningful songs (Fair, Selfless cold and composed) really started to sound great. All in all, this album is a perfect blend of punk, rock, and pop and wothy of 5 starts"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must have CD","review":"From the first moment I popped this record into my CD player, it became my favorite, leaving me a hard time finding a favorite song. There's a wide range of emotions on this CD, from up-beat tunes such as \\"Battle...\\" and \\"Steven's Last Night\\" and slower, deep songs such as \\"Brick\\" and \\"Evaporated\\". I like every single song on the album, something I could never say before finding this great band. It's a definite must-buy, and their other albums are amazing too."},{"rating":"2","title":"A more funny fatastic style of lyrics in the 90's!","review":"I bought this CD only for the whimsical song \\"Brick,\\" and yet I was quiantly suprised by the comedic tone of the over-all compact disc! \\"Steven's Last Night in Town\\" will certainly put a smile on any face and the strong tones in \\"Brick\\" will bring back memories! The inspirational scales that this singer brings to market are more then just musical quips, they bring feeling to what I feel would be a rather dull song sung by almost anyone else!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not what I'm typically in to... but I love it.","review":"I rediscovered this album about a month ago and I'm currently hooked. It's great. Ben plays the piano with tremendous style and skill. The band's harmonies are wonderful. I think the quality of the music on this CD spans genres, this certainly proves true for me. The tunes are bright and easy without being empty or cheesy (I didn't intend for that to rhyme, sorry)."},{"rating":"2","title":"You have to hear this song!","review":"I can't pick a favorite BFF album, but I think this one encompasses a wider range of emotions than either their first or their newest CD. My favorite BFF song of all time is definitely \\"Selfless, Cold, and Composed,\\" a gourgous, bittersweet account of the end of a relationship. EVERY SINGLE SONG on this album is great, but I would have bought it for this song alone!! People who have only heard \\"Brick\\" have no idea what they're missing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the album to start your BFF collection with!","review":"This should start your BFF collection and at the same time, assure that you'll never stop collecting!

Consummate musicians that put rocking first. They're infectious!"},{"rating":"2","title":"modern- day tembourine men","review":"We all had one in high school. That one album that reaffirmed your belief in something greater and helped you get through the acne- scarred tribulations of growing up. Similar to Oasis with a hint of Dylan's lyrical power, Whatever and Ever Amen is a staple cd essential for any typical American's wonder years. Their signature song \\"Brick\\" drips with feelings of youthful anguish and uncertainty that anyone- teenager or not- can easily relate to. Listen to this album, and you may find yourself asking, \\"How does it feel?\\" Like Dylan's masterpieces, it feels good. Damn good."},{"rating":"2","title":"great cd","review":"This cd rocks.

Not only is that song extremely depressing, but ben sounds like a grandmother on her deathbed trying to sing some idiot song about a brick and drowning slowly. When I hear that song i feel like im drowning slowly. Its just not for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its pretty bad","review":"I love the song brick, so i thought i would buy the album. Bad choice. The song brick is nothing like the rest of the songs on the cd.

One of the girls that worked there saw me looking at it and said this cd was on her list of top 5 cds...so being that i knew i liked \\"kate\\" and that this girl loved this cd i bought it. This is the worst (money) i have ever spent in my whole life. I give it two stars because they have good lyrics, and i still do like the song kate.

I couldn't give it a half star and only two songs on this album keep me from burning it! Whatever Ben Folds Five think they are doing, it is not music.First of all, Ben Folds cannot sing worth a flip. The only song that he shows even a smudge of talent is \\"Brick.\\" I will admit \\"Brick\\" is an awesome song. Its beautifully written and it conveys a great amount of emotion. The only other plus on this album is \\"One Angry Dwarf and 200 Solemn Faces.\\" This song is just fun thats the only reason I like it. Ben still can't sing on this one but the words make it fun. Other than that, songs like \\"Fair\\" \\"Song for the Dumped\\" and \\"Smoke\\" really make this album the piece of crap that it is. Ofcourse, \\"Brick\\" will make this one sell. In this day in age, you don't need a good song; you just need one hit.

The songs are mindless, and they irritate me to death. I tried to force myself to listen to it, thinking I might change my mind.. It can't be done. I listen to punk, and emo, and alot of other music, but the sound on this CD is just horrible. Read some of the songs titles- the songs really are as stupid as the titles imply.

Fortunately, the piano-led trio deliver an assured and catchy follow-up, balancing the anthemic (Kate, The Ballad Of Who Could Care Less) with the more studied and heartfelt (Brick, Smoke). Folds sensibly avoids peaking too early, leaving the sublime ballad Evaporated till the close."},{"rating":"2","title":"Serious Musicians with a Sense of Humor","review":"This album is incredible. We've owned it for 3+ years, and still enjoy it as much as when we first got it. Ben Folds is a master pianist, and the supporting rhythm section rocks. This album combines high-energy tunes (Angry Dwarf, Song for the Dumped), with more melodic thoughtful tunes. All the songs are solid, particularly Smoke, Fair, Battle of Who Could Care Less. While the musicianship and arrangement is impecable, the lyrics are wildly entertaining. A very solid CD from a great band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ben Folds","review":"Proof that a Jazz trio can accomplish anything. Whatever and Ever Amen is one of the most beautiful albums I've had the honor to listen to. The music and lyrics are supurb and are nearly unsurpassed in today's world of tripe.

Although the additional content on this reissue content was best saved for a LP cause it's kinda sort of buying a nice steak and getting taffy and cotton candy on there too.

Take a chance and buy this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure, fun, and heartful","review":"Oh I just love some of the songs on this album. So beautiful, so heartful. Brick is beautiful. It will forever be pathetic and painful and beautiful. \\"Selfless, Cold and Composed\\" goes in that category too. \\"Battle of Who Could Care Less,\\"\\"Stevens last night in town,\\" \\"Battle of who could care less\\" are also favorites. \\"Missing the War\\" will always stay with me. The song just makes you wanna cry.So good, this album. Pure and heartfelt."},{"rating":"2","title":"3 Wacky Guys - 12 Perfect Songs - 1Amazing Album","review":"Perhaps the biggest detriment to the mainstream success of Ben Folds Five is the mainstream success of Brick. Move past this and you will find that Whatever and Ever Amen is easily one of the best albums of the nineties.

It arrived in perfect condition and was very easy to put together. The craftsmanship on this table and the matching chairs is excellent. Further I am amazed that there is no warping or other deformation considering these made the long journey from Vietnam. The size on this table is great too, as it does not take up much space but will fit 6 comfortably and you can squeeze 8 around it.

Thanks to previous reviewers who gave excellent advice regarding assembling the pieces. Very easy to put together, but will require tightening from time to time.The set is gorgeous on my back yard deck. While cracking in the wood was reported by previous reviewers, I too observed this in my set. I think this is just superficial and will not effect the life of the wood. I think the cracks give the wood some character.I also ordered the chaise cushions--would recommend going with different cushions vs. those offered with this set. They are mediocre, at best.I am very satisfied with my purchase and well worth the money spent.

It took absolutly no time to read and it kept your interest. The book was also very interesting to read from a mermaidstory-lovers percpective.

You only began to understand and create feelings for the characters in the last thirty pages and the last part was so jamed-packed that you didn't really know what was going on. I definatly recomend this book to anyone if you want a good, fast read.

I was much more impressed with \\"Snow\\" -a similar book in this series that re-told Snow White with many more parallels.Midnight Pearls wasn't a terrible book, but it wasn't very good either. It is written for teenage level readers, in that there is little in the way of descriptive writing. This is fine when it is expected, however, there is still a need for a faced paced interesting plot to compensate for the skimpy writing.I am going to continue to read this series of re-telling of famous tales, and i suggest you do the same.(See \\"Snow\\" and \\"Beauty Sleep\\")However, save this book in the series until midnight, so you have something to fall asleep to.Relic113"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"Rescued from the sea as a small child during a vicious, ravaging storm, Pearl grew up in a spendid small cottage, with a gorgeous view of the ocean, and the castle in which the King and Prince live in.

But Pearl's secret friendship with the Prince gives her solace, as he is misunderstood just as she is.

I started it and finished it in one night...a clue that the book could have easily been much longer. Just as a started getting into the storyline, it was over--with a way too rushed ending. I didn't get to know the characters very well, and the love seemed way too rushed between them.I have to say that the ending dissapointed me, because two characters that i really wanted to end up together didn't. Of course this is just my opinion on the plot, and no one else has seemed to mention it, so it's probably just me. but it was so upsetting!all in all this is a pleasant read and i recommend it, but be prepared for it to to rush things!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It could have been so good!!","review":"But the author, as the title suggests, \\"screwed it up\\". The first half of the book is very, very good. But as soon as the two other mermaids come in, the book goes in a completely different direction. One that I didn't exactly like. Both Pearl and Prince James do things that are completely out of character, and it left my head spinning, and swimming with angry thoughts. I could see that the author wanted to have a \\"happy\\" ending, with everyone left alive; but honestly, I think it would have been better, and more BELIEVABLE if it had been done differently. It could have been very emotional, and powerful; and more satisfying.So, read this with caution.

I find this CD to be overrated, and overhyped. Basically the music is lathargic, boring and had that kind of heard that before kind of sound. This CD isn't bad but it's just boring and forgettable. I do give this like a 2.4 for effort in trying to branch out from most other R&B acts but it comes off as uninspring and boring.

I recommend buying the singles \\"Oops (Oh My)\\" and \\"Call Me\\" instead of the whole album.Tweets voice is sweet and smoky, but the songs on this CD are really bad. If she writes her own lyrics, she shouldn't. They're too simplistic even for mainstream pop. I'm sorry Tweet.

I couldn't wait for the CD to hit stores, but when that day finally came, I was very disappointed and confused! Since Timberland and Missy Elliott was Tweet's producers, I was thinking the album was going to be full of rock the house beats and catchy lyrics (boy was I suprised.) I had to fight the urge to wrap it back up and send it back the store. I like Tweet, but her first album was garbage, but that's only my opinion! Missy's bonus track is good thought!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Diamond In the Rough","review":"I am very impressed w/Tweet's debut album. Although, there were a couple of songs that didn't impress me, over all it's an excellent freshman album. My favorites are Oops! It's such a sexy song to me, it's about self appreciation. Beautiful is another favorite of mines. It's such a eloquent song and the melody on it is off the hook. The chorus just blows me away. A couple of other favorites of mine is My place & Smoking Cigarettes.She definately stands out among all the other R&B; female singer/songwriters out there in radio land.

Ur much better than Ashanti!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent CD!!","review":"I listened to Tweet's CD yesterday for the first time and I really enjoyed it. She has such a beautiful voice. The CD was kind of mellow and laid-back, which I like. I love every last track on her cd, but my favorites are 4,7,10 and 11. I hope to hear more from Tweet in the future. It would love it if she did a gospel album. If you haven't bought Tweet's CD yet...buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"TWEET-Destined Talent, Disappointing Album","review":"Missy Elliott is a great woman for her creativity and individuality. She does have an eye for talent when it comes her way. But she didn't quite mold this beautiful and unique woman into doing a great and quality album.The album has its ONLY great songs like CALL ME, OOPS...(Oh My), MOTEL, and BEAUTIFUL. Everything else is a ear-drowner. MOTEL is a straightforward song that Tweet wrote and produced that is basically in the midst of confronting a lover in reference to being cheating on. The acoustic guitar sets the mood for the song's tone. It's a great song. BEAUTIFUL is your typical slow song. Tweet adds a jazzy-like flow to it with her sensual, homegirl R&B;/Hip-Hop vocals. Songs like SMOKING CIGARETTES, COMPLAIN, and MAKE YOUR MOVE are just ear-drowners.RECORD FOUR SONGS OFF OF SOMEONE ELSE'S COPY OF TWEET'S ALBUM AND LET THAT BE!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This has got to be the spring sleeper","review":"This CD totally. . . I mean TOTALLY took me by surprise. If you fell into the radio hype of Oops, you might have said, \\"Why buy it?\\" But guess what?? You would have missed a treat!! Tweet's CD is smooth, dramatic, sexy, soul stirring, and at times gets you up and moving. You pop it in the player and just let it go. Smoking Cigarettes and Motel are two tracks that have started much discussion in my circles. The lyrics are great. All I can say is YOU Go Girl. The CD is a refreshing change:)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Soulful indeed","review":"Tweet came out with a terrific album. Its so soulful and smooth. Thanks to Missy and Timbaland, Tweet came out with this excellent piece of work. Ooops oh my and Call Me are one of the more upbeat, faster songs on here but the majority are slow and beautiful. Tweet did a great album and it truely shows."},{"rating":"2","title":"This bird will have all of you humming these tunes!","review":"OK, now I'm not the biggest R&B lover, but Tweet rally proves herself on her debut!

He enjoyes it a lot, the alphabet songs are very interesting, and I can not wait for him to be able to understand the songs ( now he only can say few words). It is recommended for other Kids that are not watching TV because despite being audio only, it can transfer the image of the scene to the listener very clearly."},{"rating":"2","title":"ABC - Sesame!","review":"This CD was purchased on the strength of my toddler's (2yo) love for this disc, which we borrowed from the local library for FIVE months, and which I figured I had to buy, so some other kid could have a chance at getting a listen. This is a totally addictive set of songs, classics which my husband remembers from back in the 1970s and the usual mix of eclectic musical genres for which we know and love the Sesame Street crew.

The songs are catchy, very upbeat and enable a child to have fun while learning at the same time. The songs go in sequence, highlighting each letter of the alphabet individually. The entire cast of Sesame Street puppets are on this album, icluding Big Bird, Elmo, Oscar, Bert & Ernie, and Grover, which allows for great variety and interpretation. While it may have to grow on parents, this is definitely a selection your child and you can enjoy together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sing the Alphabet","review":"This is a cute cd for your child to listen to while learning the alphabet... My son enjoys hearing the characters sing their songs. The only thing missing was the actual ABC song."},{"rating":"2","title":"I've been looking all over for these songs!!","review":"My brother had these songs on 45's when he was maybe 3 years old (late 70s) and I can remember singing along with many of these songs. Definitely a great find!! I hope my kids will enjoy these as much as I did as a child."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best CD's I've ever bought!","review":"My daughter loves this CD! She is 23 months old, and sings along with quite a few of the songs. The CD has a separate song for each letter of the alphabet. The songs are catchy, without being annoying. This is a CD I don't mind listening to over and over, and I don't mind her listening to it over and over because I know it's teaching her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Here is a different perspective.....","review":"I read the other reviews and was really looking forward to reading this book. I was very disappointed. After you have read one chapter, you have read the whole thing. Let me summarize for you: Dean is super talented and didn't like to, or need to rehearse. Greg Garrison is a genius. All of the guest stars were wonderful and were amazed that Dean did not rehearse. All the women loved Dean. The end. I just saved you several hours."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book review","review":"Excellent but sad chronology of the end of the variety era. Very well written, insightful and seemingly accurate portrayal of the times. Worth it for the Dean Martin fan. It certainly was for me. Devoured it in a few days."},{"rating":"2","title":"Respighi connection","review":"Note that the first track is clearly related to Respighi's Ancient Airs and Dances. I don't know if Respighi drew on Uccellini directly or if they both have a common source, but the relationship is unmistakeable. The Antal Dorati recording of the Respighi suites is quite good."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Classic Environment\\" is code for \\"It won't work on Macs anymore\\"","review":"I didn't realize that.

The game has an interesting plot. Basically, you have to kill every Strogg (alien) you see, so you can win the war and get off the planet, Stroggos. The interesting thing is, the AI is almost alive. The Strogg really want to make sure your giblets are safe and sound in their bio-vats! Some of the Quake III characters have references to the \\"war on Stroggos\\", so this game has, and will, make a lasing impression on the gaming community."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely NOT made in the USA","review":"Although this brush worked excellent after two showers...the wooden handle actually cracked almost in half, making it unusable. I was soo disappointed! I absolutely loved the frizz free shine and velvet feel it gave my hair, gripped hair well, too! ...The dream brush...or so I thought? I would love to have another brush, but for the price...I can't justify spending the cash, if the quality of the brush is inferior...My mistake, I accidently threw away the receipt...this company does not have a \\"good\\" return policy either....Buyer Beware, Keep Your Receipt, and Read Return Policy by Seller... :) Good Luck if you decide to purchase, like I said brush works wonders...best I ever had...for 2 blow drys!

There is one witty line. For the most part Steve mcqueen looks out of place with his un shaven face. Everyone else is clean shaven and has a standard issue rifle. The ending has fantastic explosions and I love it. It almost makes up for the lack of content for the rest of the movie. I'll say that it becomes comical when Steve Mcqueen is faster then a speeding bullet. Its surprising he needs a motorcyle in the next movie the great escape."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good acting can't save cliched, shallow script.","review":"This will be brief - as the body count rises, what might have been a suspenseful film becomes numbingly repetitive. The characters are types with very done to develop them (and make us care about what happens to them.)The direction is no more than adequate - the two stars are for the work of the actors, who are all good with very thin material.Pretty much a waste of an hour and a half of your time (and it seems longer!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"One of Bobby Darin's worst movies--but not his fault","review":"This is one of Bobby Darin's worst movies, but he's pretty much an innocent victim here. In the first half he's given a lame comic relief role, which he tries to breath life into like a trooper (no pun intended). Then in the second half even that lame task is taken away from him and given to Bob Newhart.In both halves Steve McQueen pretty much steals the show as other reviewers have noted. Even with McQueen's powerful presence though it seems like a directionless and pointless effort.Strangly it was one of Darin's most successful films at the box office."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bob Newhart (the radio operator) said it all","review":"I saw this movie one night on late night tv. could not make heads or tails of it. You would think it was a classic right, with McQueen et al? Big stars. There was this one comedy bit with Newhart on the phone trying to reach command that was funny, but very out of place.Years later I saw Newhart on the Carson show, with Johnny, after he had made it big on two TV series. It was one of the great funny interviews as Newhart explained the worst professional experience of his life was the making of this movie, which he viewed as wretched, was a box office bomb and according to Newhart had no direction and no script!! They eventually ran out of money, spliced in some stock footage. Stopped filming and released it. so skip the movie, get the interview."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth buying very poor value for money","review":"A dreadful script not worth watching this very dull film. It must indeed be Steve McQueen''s worst film but with a script as dull as this one is perhaps he did what he could."},{"rating":"2","title":"epic WWII drama","review":"For those War movie buffs who liked Saving Private Ryan, Full Metal Jacket, Apocolypse Now, dont miss this 1962 brilliantly written and acted combat film. The dark cinematography and symbolism have been overlooked by some critics, who have focused mostly on McQueens great portrayal of the burned out Reese. If your old enough to remember the tv series Combat, this movie stands like the movie pilot for that series. Combat scenes are as grim as anything in Saving Private Ryan........."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"The movie is one of the best WWII movies I have ever seen, it always had my attention. Steve McQueen was perfect for his role.

It is what you would expect from a 1960s Steve McQueen movie, action, etc..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy film !!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"A TERRIBLE MOVIE, especially considering the caliber of talent involved in making it. Steve McQueen plays a type of \\"man with no name\\" character, who joins this unit at the beginning of the movie with a troubled reputation. And it goes downhill from there. There are far better WW 2 movies out there, such as Von Ryan's Express, Bridge on the River Kwai, or McQueen's own Great Escape.....see one of them, and don't waste your time on this gooseegg."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the all-time greatest War movies! Not to be missed!!","review":"I was born in 1954 and went to see this one when it first came out. I was all of eight years old. What an extremely profound impact it would have on my life. I eventually went on to serve as an officer in the USMC, partly because of the heroism depicted in this movie. Each time that I watch it now, I sympathize with the characters that are sent to cover a sector of the Sigfried line and one morning wake to find that the rest of the company has pulled leaving only their squad to defend the company-sized front. How desperate their reaction! They do the right thing - they go on the offensive! I won't spoil it for you. It is an excellent movie well worth adding to any collection. No war movie collector would be without it. Great performances by Fess Parker, Steve McQueen, Nick Adams, Bobby Darin, James Coburn, Bob Newhart, Harry Guardino and others who also went on to become famous character acters. Well worth owning at any price!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the best visual record of Kate Wolf.","review":"This is the best visual record of Kate Wolf in concert we have.

It's clear illustrations are a strong point. I wish I had a chance to be in on editing the next edition of it. I would elaborate on the indexing--instead of \\"hats\\" followed by a bunch of page numbers that leave the reader to look up search the book for what they need to learn about hats, I'd add many subcategories--hats:shaping; blocking...etc. It's a REFERENCE afterall. I would also make the book a little more impersonal--more information, less Montse Stanley. Nothing personal against her, I just think she might write a book of her own techniques, projects, opinions apart from this reference, and then there'd be more room for a comprehensive index. Still, I chose this over other references for clear directions and technique illustrations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Special","review":"I did not like the way a lot of the directions were written in this book.

It is a must-have addition to any knitter's library."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Ultimate Knitting Book","review":"Briefly, I am just learning to use this book. It sat on my shelf for quite a while, until I realized I couldn't find information I needed in Vogue Knitting, The Big Book of Knitting, or any of the other popular knitting books. After learning the basics, when you need more complex information on an unfamiliar or obscure technique, this book is more likely to have it than the newer, flashier, and more expensive books. The number of options she offers for any given technique is astounding, and once you get over the feeling of being overwhelmed with too much information, you begin to appreciate the differences and are able to make an informed choice. This is rapidly becoming my primary resource. I can get the basics out of Vogue, but for more advanced techniques, this is my first choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where had this book been all my life?","review":"The Knitter's Handbook has quickly become my go-to resource for comparing, learning about and refreshing myself on various techniques. Despite owning several other books and having the internet at my disposal, Stanley's tour-de-force truly is a comprehensive masterwork. While some of the illustrations could be updated, the explanations as to *why* and *how* things are happening more than make up for it. I've yet to run across a technique that is missing from the book and I find the explanations to be easy to understand and follow.

Along with an extensive editor, the game has various modes, ranging from championship to training mode. The game even features a retro mode, which allows you to relive the dream of the 50's grand prix.Playing the game without a gamepad or wheel is downright difficult. The cars are very hard to control at first, however one will get used to it after a while. The in-game graphics are beautiful, with the cars shining with detail even with the worst 3d card. Other graphical features include rain, and light effects. The game does slow a bit when other cars are on the race track.Monaco Grand Prix is by far the best Formula One racing simulation out there today, and I recommend it for race fans of all ages."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice intro to the period","review":"Argues that the central feature of the Jacksonian period was its forward-looking quality, how hopeful and optimistic people were about the future.

When he finally comes home, he is given a bath, but he is fine with it, because he is HOME! And home is where the heart is.What child can't related to hating a bath, liking to get dirty, and not having to do what your parents tell you. But in the end, feeling most loved and happy at home.There are very few people in this book. It's all about Harry's adventure. It's not didactic, simply a sweet story.

This book tells the story of Harry, who hates baths. He hates them so much that he buries his brush and (temporarily) runs away from home. He plays and gets so dirty that his family thinks he is a different dog entirely. The story is sweet and simple enough for my 2 year old to enjoy, but not so simple that it's boring or babyish."},{"rating":"2","title":"A CHILDHOOD CLASSIC","review":"Harry the Dirty Dog is the quintessential children's book for young readers. With its eye- appealing illustrations and simple text, it is the perfect transition from guided reading to independent reading. A delightful trip back to the 50's (sans the conservative vibe and racial/ misogynistic stereotypes of the time), Harry the Dirty Dog is the story of a little dog who is so opposed to getting a bath that he takes matters into his own hands... Er, paws? Harry buries his scrubbing brush in the back yard and takes off from home. While he has a day full of fun adventures, Harry not only gets himself dirtier, but also realizes that while he doesn't like taking a bath, there are many things about his family that he misses."},{"rating":"2","title":"harry the dirty dog","review":"I like harry the Dirty Dog because he,s funny.He can do funny stuff.

But really, the book is fine.Unless you have to read it 5,000 times because your kid fell in love with it. If you're the parent of a toddler, you'll know that repeatability is a huge trait for the parent's enjoyment factor and this book DOES NOT pass the test. I have essentially hidden this book from my child because I am so tired of reading it. It becomes uninteresing after about the 10th read, and downright gnawing after read number 100.Otherwise, I'm sure it's fine. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love, love, love this book!","review":"The entire family loves this book!

The acting is impeccable, the story both gripping and a deeply insightful take on our society. Set among the Amish of Lancaster County, Pennslvania we see the truly startling contrast between 21st Century America and the Eighteenth Century society preserved there. Detective John Book discovers corruption in the police department for which he works in Philadelphia and becomes a hunted man. He flees and is hidden by the Amish. The action and the human relationships that follow are completely absorbing."},{"rating":"2","title":"fantastic silence","review":"An older film worth watching again. The thing I find fascinating in Witness is Peter Weir's, the director, use of silence. Lengthy secenes where there is no dilalect and yet everything is communicated as clearly as if there were the spoken word. My favorite scene is when the Amish boy, looking at a trophy case, sees a picture of the killer and is able to convey what's happening to the detective, John Book.

So I was so glad to see it offered in the DVD format - unfortunately when I received my copy I was extremely disappointed. The transfer was grainy and too dark in places. The extras were few. I was surprised that Paramount - who usually does a good job - offered such poor quality. I would not advise you to purchase this - keep your VHS tape - it's a better quality.

The low rating is for this version of the film.It's been a long time since I last saw this movie, and that was an old taped-from-TV version. But I'm certain there was at least one scene that was in the original that was not in this DVD. Why would they do that? Take out scenes from a movie? Makes sense if it's on TV, need to edit it down for space. But why on DVD?

The story is that of a small Amish boy that while traveling with his mother, witnesses the murder of a police officer. When he identifies the murderer as being a narcotics officer, Harrison Ford, playing a cop realizes that the police chief probably is involved too. He goes into hiding with the Amish boy and her mother in their Amish village where he poses as an ordinary person. But, things obviously don't go as planned.The movie has some nice comic moments and is great for understanding better the Amish culture, their work, how they build things, etc.. It's a chance from days in the rest of the U.S. as there are no cars and no electricity in Amish towns.It's worth watching just for that, but behind that, you've also got yourselves one good thriller."},{"rating":"2","title":"Riveting","review":"If you love Harrison Ford and are a fan of police drama and suspense - this is one for you. A little different flavor which is a refreshing change of scene from the shot-em up variety (although it's got some of that too). Concentrates more on plot, and character development than most cop flicks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb Police Thriller! Succeeds on many levels at once!","review":"This movie is inmensely entertaining, with a great script and great acting (which earned Harrison Ford his only Oscar Nomination). The film succeeds as a romance, drama and police thriller. The action-packed ending is great and the forbidden-love relationship between Kelly McGuillis and Harrison Ford is provocative. Very realistic and entertaining. This is a real winner!"},{"rating":"1","title":"How Bizarre!","review":"20th October 2008.

An excellent adult movie, the graphic language and violent content would make this something to be viewed by adults prior to deciding whether younger members of the household be allowed to see it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect acting by Harrison Ford.","review":"This may be the best acting performance in the career of Harrison Ford.

Steve is the name a family gives to a special tree in their yard. Over the years it holds swings and hammocks, turns jump ropes, acts as third base, appears in family photos and shelters their home. The tree watches over the family as the children grow and change. Steve's \\"last trick\\" will make you gasp in dismay. There is solace for the family (and us) as Steve's spirit lives on.David Catrow was exactly the right person to design this book. His illustrations are a perfect balance of humor and pathos. I love the dog. Alan Zweibel is a gifted television comedy writer but this is his first children's book. He must be congratulated. He has crafted something quite wondrous and fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Keeper","review":"I bought this book for my little sister and found myself enjoying it as much as she did during her story time. Explaining loss to a child is never easy but the author has found a way to do so using language a child can understand. The book focuses on the memories that we make with the important people and things in our lives and reminds us that they are never really gone. The book also reminds us that every act, whether it is a family barbeque or a simple game can help bind a family together.

Outstanding. I often hear that Alekhine was a great annotator. Bah, humbug! As far as I'm concerned Keres is the model of a perfect annotator, at least for a player below expert strength. The variations provided are plentiful and deep enough to provide food for thought without being overwhelming (unlike say Kasparov's MGP series, which has encyclopedic annotations of some games, which overwhelms the non-master). Beyond simply citing moves, Keres delves into the intricacies of the positions, explaining plans and strategies. This book will help anyone's game improve.

I passed all the sample tests therein with a very comfortable margin but was not able to pass the REAL TEST. Inaccuracies are one thing but the major omissions really killed me. Examples include specific subject matter related to LOB columns, partition joins, explain plan, Dimensions, post-8i CONNECT command, v8.1.6 features, transportable tablespaces, etc.The book isn't a complete waste of time.

The rake, shovel & helmet are perfect for her, too. And if you are wondering if it is durable - like the original TONKA trucks... The answer is YES!! My daughter sits in the bed of the truck, and pushes herself around (backwards) in it, and so far, it has held up!

Surge, the Gym Leader of Vermillion City. Getting past his Electabuzz won't be so easy. Also, Red enters a race, which leads him into many comical hijinks, including a run-in with Snorlax, one of the largest Pokemon that ever existed.

Let me also point out that the Z button trigger, dual vibration motors, and camera sticks are ALL featured in your regular-average- joe Nintendo controls.

It may look good in the packaging, but it is very top heavy and the back is bigger than on the nintendo controller. The turbo button isnt compatable with super smash bros. melee but for some reason the turbo light stays on, no matter how many times the button is pressed.

I took it to another fellow student at school and informed me to never trust third-party Gamecube controllers and go with genuine first-party ones.

(Samarkand remains my favorite.) Odyssey is an appropriate word in the title. The protaganist makes a journey and quest with real philosophical issues. This is a Candide story, with skepticism. It is hard to put the book down at night when reading. Balthasar faces many challenges both in his quest for the book, and in love, but also about life. The reader feels for his concerns. One of the nice details is that whenever he came to a town/city he looked for and visited the local booksellers, this was in 1666. His companions on his journey help him struggle with issues. This is a book about fate and life and well worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Publishers Weekly has it right!","review":"I had high hopes for this book when I read the inside cover. Unfortunately this novel meanders all over the place.The conclusion of the book left me empty as if Balthasar took a wrong turn on his journey and never quite got back on track.

You would be far better off purchasing the components separately and making your own system. You end up needing different electrical connectors, plus the tubing that comes with the system is almost unusable. It's impossible to straighten, and cracks in extreme cold. A rubber hose with your own fittings would be far better suited for running the hose to your tank. However, you still need to use some of the small tubing if you plan on using the Viair gauge/switch.Overall, I'm really disappointed with this. For 100 bucks including shipping, I would expect more. I ended up spending about 50 dollars more just to make this adequate for what I needed. I will say, however, that the Viair gauge/switch is pretty decent quality and looks great once installed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Viair onboard air kit 20052","review":"Very disapointing, poor fittings, on off switch should be momentary, tubing unstraightenable, comes with pressure switch that can't even be used with a system unless an air tank is purchased (doesn't need an air tank), does not come with a pressure bleed down, wire furnished is actually good and long enough.

It is surprising that so little account is taken of penile anatomy or the rights of the subject (most often an infant) of this surgery. In the case of baby boys, no notice at all is taken of circumcision as the surgical removal of significant healthy genital tissue from healthy baby boys.

The romantic tension between the two main characters- Marlo and Spencer- is intense, and I was looking forward to seeing where it went. However, I couldn't make it past 200 pages of the book, and even that was a struggle, because London's writing style is seriously lacking. She uses awkward dialogue to explain every detail about the characters. This alone kills the novel. People in the real world do not speak even remotely the way the characters speak.

I have never read such terrible writing. I am literally forcing myself to read this book because I bought it. I can't seem to get into this book because of her writing style, something is missing. There is no flow to her writing, its like a jigsaw puzzle with pieces missing, wacky characters who make no sense, namely, Cherry. Marlo fighting her feelings and seeing the color red, Spence, tough guy whose so full of guilt over everything, enough with guilt trips.

And it was delivered really fast, even as media mail. Great buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Visually Interesting","review":"for the most part. I would have preferred more natural landscapes and fewer urban scenes. The Phillip Glass score, although repetitive, usually matches the images without being distracting. I was amazed to learn this footage was captured between 1975 and 1983.

I like the so called weird, flaky stuff. Koyaanisqatsi, however, made me want to gouge my eyes out. This movie is just an example of what people do when they have too much money. Nest time, give that money to me, and save the world from a horrendous waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"An abomination","review":"This film is a tumor. This film is the ultimate expression of everything wrong with \\"art\\" films.This is the ultimate triumph of \\"message\\" over substance and story.A million dollar compendium of glorified stock footage that ends with a slow view of an exploding rocket ship that seems to almost mock the deaths of those involved.This is a film illustrating pure and utter contempt for human life that exists beyond a primitive tribal state.This film is Anti-Life, its like art made by the friggin Anti-Spiral.If you think this film is good, and not just parroting the usual tripe of modern film criticism, if you think this film is good by your own honest opinion you are either a sociopath or a hipster. Or maybe you were just mercifully misinterpreting into something less soul-crushingly bleak."},{"rating":"2","title":"In defense of the film's age...","review":"Looking at previous reviews, I thought it appropriate to mention the comments on the film being \\"dated\\". Well, it is. So is Casablanca. In fact, so is that milk you have in your fridge. What's important is the chord the film strikes in you (if any), and whether that message transcends time. I believe that it still does. Oddly enough, as our cultures and styles are ever-changing, the items that people tend to think date this film now appear to be more fashionable again.The simplest review that I can offer to you is to simply watch this film. Even if, having sat part-way through it, the images have not provoked thought, at least watch the film to its end. Then, reflect back on it as a whole, and how it built action and tension as it meandered through our existence. Like all things in life, not everybody will like this film; but again, like all things in life, do not judge until you have given it a fair chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressive film/unimpressive DVD","review":"I love this film. One of the most moving works of art ever created, however the DVD transfer is underwhelming. DVD can use up to 10 MBPS. When surround sound is used up to about 9 MBPS. I work preofessionally with video (shooting/editing) and spend a fair amount of time authoring DVDs. Why they chose to stick to 3 - 5 MBPS is appalling. For those of you who do not know MBPS = Mega Bits Per Second. MBPS is similar to Megapixels (when speaking about a digital camera). The higher the Mega Bits used per second the more information used to store thie picture and thus the higher the quality the picture will be and the better it will look. I would still recommend this DVD...only because this is as of now the best way to see the film (outside the off chance it will be shown in some art house theatre). Beware,however, it will not look great...good maybe. I can't wait until Kayaanisqatsi is remastered for Blu-ray."},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterful fusion of visual and auditory art","review":"Call it a statement. An analysis. Fine Art. A masterful fusion of visual and auditory art, i.e. Philip Glass at his best. Koyaanisqatsi shows us the ills of our modern world in a new light. It contrasts the beauty and grandeur of our natural world with its destruction. Despite the date of production, the film is applicable to the state of humanity today.It is an artist's, a monk's view of our hustling-bustling lives. A fresh world view is presented as if seen through the eyes of first century monk transported in time to the current era. It speaks to you at a deep subconscious level. This film leaves you with new desires, a reason to help make changes, and an urge for a more peaceful life. Koyaanisqatsi is unforgettable."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent","review":"How come it is not available and so many seem to require it? Fortunately we possess several VHS copies bought from stores years ago and many more copied on my own. Will cling on them yet, hope VHS and DVDs comes out soon! If the problem is that the release of powerful visual messages with a high content of truth could be felt to be socially de-stabilizing, (perhaps we are naive) we do think they are not. Hence, It should be freely seen for the many to think about so as to know that at least something is been done about those things such as: a)letting the movie be available and b)that there are places where the problem is very seriously addressed to so as to see a clear way out of this potential quagmire......."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reggio/Glass collaboration is genius","review":"Reggio takes common scenes out of normal context by framing, slowing and speeding effects which produce moving, disturbing and touching images that are perfectly punctuated by Glass's thematic shifting patterns of notes. If my copy taped off PBS hadn't been stolen in a break-in, I would be viewing it again and again still. We_must_have_a_ release_of_this_work!!! Those who know the film will understand: desert, strip-mining, urban life, loneliness, terminal, hotdogs, destructing missile. Can mankind retain respect and compassion for nature and the individual in an increasingly impersonal and technological world of their making -- is our feeling of control an illusion? Can we continue expending resources exponentially fighting against natural balances and survive? When/How will this end?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally..","review":"I'd never seen this movie before, so I can't echo the complaints of those who say the movie has been cropped in some way..I had been waiting almost 2 years to see this movie, having heard the Philip Glass soundtrack and instantly falling in love with it, especially \\"The Grid\\".In spite of my high expectations, the movie still blew me away. Yes, its anti- modern society is repetitive and its presentation of that theme one-sided, but that doesn't mean it can't have an impact. I have never seen a movie like this (except the less striking Powaqqatsi), and the only thing I can compare the climax to is Requiem for a Dream.. it is absolutely gripping and horrifying.I'm not sure some of the images of this movie will ever fade from my memory.. a challenging film (the beginning, let's face it, is a little boring, but necessarily so), but an unforgettable one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Miracle of Beauty Come True","review":"No words can express the bundle of feelings and emotions that stem from watching every single image and breathing every individual melody from the music score of Koyaanisqatsi. I happened to see it fifteen years ago and it's still in my mind. The film also works as a reflection of our relationship with nature and the way human beings are dramatically changing the planet for the worse. A piece of art worthy to be revisited once again to revive our internal child and look inside ourselves. Please, release it on DVD as soon as possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great movie, low quality","review":"The movie is great.

He loves that the playing area is larger and the quadruple score letter and word spaces make this version even more fun. The only drawback is that it can take quite a while to play an entire game (on average, it's taken us anywhere from 1 1/2 to 2 hours!) so it's not something we get to play often. And, if I had my druthers, I would LOVE it if they made a deluxe version with the non-slide grids so that the board could be turned without the tiles getting jostled out of place."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite pasttime","review":"After receiving this game, my friend and I, who are avid Scrabble players decided that it is too much to play with two people and have saved the game for when we have four players.

More tiles, More premium squares, Higher scores, More FUN! If you always wished there was more space to the left, right, on top or on bottom of that word you could capitalize on ...your wish has come true. I recommend getting the Deluxe version because having the board with the grid makes it easier to keep the tiles in place. Other than that, I say this newest version of Scrabble is the BEST. You'll love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Scrabble","review":"If you like scrabble a LOT--you will probably like this game. IF you're into scrabble tourney's probably not. This is great fun for the whole family and allows you to become more creative because of the extra tiles.

Overall I enjoyed it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unusable board game","review":"There are no indentions on the large board to hold the tiles in place as they are played. With a board that large and that many tiles after a very short time it turns into a tile skating rink with a great deal of time spent trying to keep the tiles in their original position.One game was enough.We will never use it again.Our present standard scrabble board has an indented surface to hold the tiles in place and had we known that the new one did not we would never have considered buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I love this game, but...","review":"I had originally bought the 2002 edition, which was positively wonderful. It was so wonderful that I decided to get a second copy. That was a big mistake, because the second copy was the 2010 edition. What was wrong? Nearly everything, except the game itself:The tiles are no longer wood, but some composite plastic, which not only stinks, but the printing of the letters is blurred - they aren't even an even size. I guess we need BPA-free games!The tile bag is cheap, and doesn't even close properly.The board is thinner, and of poorer quality. The only thing holding the two sides together is thin plasticized paper.Everything is cheap and plastic. This went from being a joy to play to entirely too obnoxious to use.So I guess it's possible to wreck anything."},{"rating":"2","title":"fun for hours!","review":"We had a lot of fun playing the newest addition to the Scrabble family! Here are a few facts:It does take a lot longer to play this game! Know this going into it! Also, we are used to playing on the Deluxe model, so going back to the basic board is no fun! Having the tiles slide all over the place stinks! But it was GREAT having so many more E's to use, that alone is reason to try!! The amount of 7 letter words we were able to play was unbelievable! The first game we played I ended up with a score of 784!!! WOW! It is a great game and is a lot of fun, just as the other was! Highly recommend!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Takes too long","review":"I love Standard Scrabble but Super Scrabble has gone too far. The games last forever which is frustrating when you play in a large family gathering setting. The marathon games make it easier to come back from being behind but everyone I've played with is just bored at the end and wants to get the game over with.

After I purchased 4 D batteries, I put the thing together, with a very eager 4 year old by my side. What a bummer it was to have it put together, and have it do hardly anything. The baseballs were very, very slow to come out. Not to mention this toy is LOUD! But back to the actual function of this toy. It's horrible. The balls are slow to come out, if they came out at all. Or perhaps one will come out, but then it would turn itself off. It also appeared to shut itself off if the 4 year old was too slow to add the balls back to it. Overall very disappointed with this, and it's going back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun for boy and dog.","review":"We got this toy for our son's 4th birthday and he loves it.

Purchased this for my wife for Xmas from Costco. 1st one had a stuck button, so had to return it. 2nd one I got was Very unintuitive on screen menu with very poor documentation. No AC adapter, so only way to charge it is through the car charger. The maps themselves look ultra low tech with jagged lines and odd color schemes. On a trip from Orlando, system locked up and had to be restarted. Very cheap plastic feel. Only positive I found was a very good GPS antenna - always had a strong signal. Returned it back to Costco.

While it does have room for a small tablet this causes the case to be too tight on the PDA and as a consequence it is always on. Adding credit cards and other forms of ID exascerbate this problem further. There is also nothing to hold a writing utensil in place. There is one elastic loop meant to hold the stylus and nothing else will fit.I finally gave up and went back to using the case that came with my Visor."},{"rating":"2","title":"No, Virginia, this isn't Windham Hill!","review":"Well, I guess the title and cover art are sufficient warning, but this is a truly wild, over the edge guitar treatment of Christmas music, and I wouldn't bring this CD with you for Christmas dinner with Aunt Minnie or Uncle Joe.But if you are into this style of guitar, you'll love this. It may well be the one and only Christmas album you have, and the sheer dissonant, loud energy of most of the CD might well upset traditionalists. But this is Christmas as expressed from the perception of the guitarists, and therefore is more than legitimate. Standouts? \\"Joy To The World\\" was my personal favorite. Poor Rudolph practically gets slaughtered in the first cut, but I don't say that in a mean spirit.

I reccomend this to anyone because you dont have to know how to play the guitar, or be into shred guitar or anything of that nature. If you like christmas music and are getting a little tired of the choir thing or the manheim steamroller stuff then you owe it to yourself to check this cd out.

James' thesis of cricket as a determining factor in the development of the West Indian psyche is interesting and well presented.

Otherwise, most of the book is about trying to tell the reader what an intellectual James is. I'm afraid this book is less about cricket and more about James.

Love sells is really smooth and relaxed. Never has he collected a better collection than this one here. In other albums, some tracks would rock and others would be soft, and the rest of them would be kinda groovy, well this one is almost all groove. The lone exception being 'Pull the Wool' which is a ballad, but allowed because it's a good message, it just happens to be too repetitive. My theory as to why this is such a consistent record is that the majority of the songs for this album were written by the members of the band while they were broken up and in other bands. So they channel all of the groovy feeling of all the bands combined on this CD. The other bands even guest on the album giving them a bigger sound.

Felt like the author was trying too hard to be 'funny'.Almost felt like the author was trying the conversations with God kind of format, and it just didn't work for this apologetics book.There is nothing in this book that is really too enlightening, any Christian is taught these basic things in their church, in their Faith, and the bible.The book tends to treat one as being totally ignorant of what is in the Bible or about God, and well I don't think anyone who is not already a believer is going to pick up this 'handbook to God'.The book has an almost juvenile tone to it, as if the author is explaining things to someone very young or ignorant of anything of the bible.If you want a \\"God for Dummies\\" book this is the one."},{"rating":"2","title":"PERFECT for BEGINNERS!","review":"Exploring Spellcraft is the perfect beginner's guide for those who are new to the art of spellcasting.

I really liked the author's writing style and that she didn't \\"talk down\\" to the reader or preach the Wiccan Rede like some others do.

I agree with the other reviewers that the book doesn't provide enough on the visualization or energy concentration aspects of the spell casting or development.

I set my phone alarm to go off so I wouldn't miss it and dropped everything when the alarm went off. Then I stayed up late to watch another episode come on later. Then I went on YouTube and watched every episode they had posted (which somehow was skewed since I missed episodes at least three episodes, as I found, thanks to episode-numbering problems).I can't wait to have all the episodes in Blu-Ray quality at my fingertips!!

This series is a welcome change. Although still a kids show it has a much darker tone to the series than any of the previous series. I mean... transformers actually die! Something which never happened in the original series (aside from the 80's movie where... all of them die in the first 5 minutes). Part of what gives it the darker feel is the fact the Autobots are vastly outnumbered and even into the second season can't seem to find any more allies against the seemingly endless supply of bad guys.Hearing both Megatron and Optimus with the original voice actors is still great and the visuals are quite good (although the quality from scene to scene can vary on this Blu-ray release)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Transformers","review":"Christmas gift for my son who put it on his Christmas gift list this year.

I shouldn't have. Cleaning it is really a pain in the neck. Besides all the nooks and crannies where the grinds accumulate, the grinder needs cleaning after each use, as steam from the brewing makes a sticky mess of the grinder. Furthermore, be aware that the cup capacity is based on 6 oz. or smaller, and the coffee measurements they recommend produce a very weak brew. If you like a rich brew, the grinder might not have the capacity needed to make a full pot. I still use the thing, but wouldn't buy it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Machine!!!","review":"First of all I think it makes great tasting coffee. I read the negative reviews about some problems (read the manual and follow the instructions!), but at this great price for a reconditioned unit I went ahead and bought it. And I am sure glad I did. I have had no problems whatsoever, but I follow the instructions and clean it after each use. It takes a little bit of time but it is worth it for what it does - grind the beans and then make a great pot of coffee. It is noisey when grinding but what grinder isn't?

I did find a difference with the brands of beans I had used. Dunkin donuts makes very weak coffee but Starbucks or Cosco brand that is bagged by Starbucks makes the best, it comes in a green bag and is very inexpensive. I get compliments on my coffee all the time. I can't say enough about how great of a machine it is. It is so great that many of my friends have bought one.

My biggest problem aside from having to mop up coffee, is removing the grinder basket. I have resulted to removing the filter basket turning the coffee maker upside down trying to remove the blades and was forced to run hot water thru the grinder basket down thru the screen because it was clogged,(HUMIDITY!) and this while trying to keep the filter door and sliding mechanism open...I have the Owners manual and it only says remove the grinder basket....Does ANYONE have any help!?????"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I purchased this coffemaker brand new in December 2008.

I don't think I like super strong coffee, but when I filled the grinder as far as the instructions allowed for, and added water up to the 10-cup line ... it was weak coffee. So, to make up for that, I make only 8 cups, with the grinder filled to capacity, and I use a darker roast. I've gotten used to it, but am definitely looking for something better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"I received the coffee maker as a gift.

I used it daily for approximately 4 months, enjoyed the brew but then reality set in. Started noticing the excessive water condensation and messy clean-up. At about 10 months the pumping cycle began to shorten therefore leaving water in the reservoir. I was up to three power cycles before producing a full pot of coffee. I contacted Cuisinart - no response. It was put out to trash. Christmas roles around and whats under the tree.....yes, same model given to me by a friend.

Today I even stood by while it ground the beans and held the basket shut. After it started I left, and it still managed to open. I am putting my BUNN back in service. The other Cusinart I had was a blender and it started leaking. Save your money. Do not buy this or any of their products."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd rather grind my own beans","review":"Not all that it's cracked up to be. I thought, How cool, a machine that will do it all in one step. It does. But then if you want a 2nd pot, what a pain to clean out the grinder so that you can load another pot. I finally quit using the auto-grinder and returned to my old Krups grinder to do the job and get going.Second beef... the machine leaks. I don't where it comes from. It doesn't do it all the time, but way too frequently. I turn it on and have learned to babysit the brew cycle or else get ready to clean up a hot wet mess all over my granite countertop. Sometimes it leaks clean water. Other times it pours out the grinds, the hot coffee...it sucks. And it does a big mess at least once a week.The good news...well, it does look pretty and the coffee once it is brewed is good, but I'm tired of the \\"coffee roulette\\".

I did not realize that it required cleaning (of the ENTIRE unit) after each brewing cycle. The grinding portion of the unit is an absolute mess after brewing as moisture from the brewing cylcle combines with the grounds. It is more than a simple rinse to clean.I also have experienced frequent grounds in my coffee and occasional leakage as noted by others. I will be seeking a new unit soon.Overall I am dissatisfied and would not recomend this unit to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"amazing machine but unsatisfactory coffee","review":"Unfortunately, this machine can only make weak coffee. I tried loading up with extra beans (using top-quality beans) without success. Mechanically, it is a wonderful machine and I experienced none of the problems reported by others. I would have liked to keep it because it is great to wake up to the aroma and freshly ground and brewed coffee."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great coffee/BIG problems !","review":"I've had my Grind and Brew Coffeemaker for a year and a half now. While it makes superb coffee, I am fearful everytime I use it. I went through the initial problems with the filter door popping open, but that was easily solved. NOW, for some reason, the coffee won't be sucked into the pot each and every time, so just when I begin to trust it again, BAM, hot coffee is all over my brand new maple hardwood flooring ( now WARPED where the coffee spilled onto it). I have kept the parts clean; I run a special coffee maker cleaner through it once a month, but to no avail. A coffee maker as expensive as this one should last much longer than 18 months."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor engineered coffee grinder","review":"Makes good coffee but grinder lid breaks very often and has to be replaced.

We bought the ugly round Cuisinart, which lasted for 5 years until it just quit working. Way too expensive to pack it up for repair, so we decided to try this attractive chrome job :(it is difficult to clean, often drips and is altogether unreliable. Because it has a thermal carafe, I expected it to keep coffee hot for more than one hour, but no luck. So I have to force open the lid right after brewing (apparently is gets vapor lock) and transfer contents to another thermos. I am on the prowl for another grind and brew (probably a Melitta)and ran across this opportunity to review this ill designed Cuisinart, so decided to save some other folks the grief we have had with it.

We only use the 'grind' feature on weekends and for occasions, but this machine brews an excellent cup of coffee, and the keep warm thermal carafe works amazingly well, because I can take it downstairs with me while I am working and use it most of the day without it becoming thick syrup from overwarming. I also like the program settings, and the 1 to 3 cups setting is amazing.We especially appreciate the sturdiness of the carafe with multiple children in the family.

However, it is important to keep the grinding unit clean to insure proper operation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thumbs up","review":"I have had a Cuisinart for two years now and just love it. Nothing better than waking up in the morning with your coffee already perked and waiting for you. Add the fact that the coffee stays warm in its caraf without continuing to cook and there is nothing more to ask. That is why I bought this particular machine for my son for Christmas. He has an old Cuisinart which works beautifully but he has to grind his coffee separately. And, since he likes to drink his coffee all morning, it gets to tasting pretty old. I have been a victim of his \\"could hold up a spoon\\" coffee. So, did I get it for me or for him? Good question. I'll never tell.He loves his new machine. So do I."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good machine","review":"I've owned my Cuisinart Grind and Brew for over 3 years and have never experienced any problems. The door has never sprung open during brewing and my hoses and tubes don't leak. Cleaning is a breeze - yes there are several different parts to clean but it never takes more than a minute or two to rinse them out. The only negative comment I have is that the carafe is so well sealed to keep in the heat that it does pour slowly. The simple solution is to unscrew the lid, pour your cup of coffee, and screw the lid back on. No trouble at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this machine!","review":"I just got this yesterday for Christmas and it is very easy to use and clean.

Right until it stopped working 2 weeks after I started using it. It just wouldn't draw up and heat the water. It ground the beans, the timer worked fine, I could hear the heating elements coming on, just wouldn't heat the water. There is no way to open it and see what's wrong inside. HIGHLY DISAPPOINTING on a Sunday morning. Better run out and grab the old coffeemaker out of the trash. And of course I threw the huge box out, since it did work at first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Four years old and still performing","review":"My wife and I use it everyday of the week, sometimes we pass on the weekends; it still performs as good as it did when we bought it four years ago. The only problem is that the grinder sometimes gets stuck to the spindle when we need to take it out for cleaning. But it's not really a hassle. It does have a lot of parts to clean but hey... it's a grind and brew for crying out loud. We recommend this product and brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish It Were As Good As It Looks","review":"I like the coffee this machine makes, and the \\"grind and brew\\" idea is a great one. Unfortunately the basket door pops open while brewing about every tenth time you use it, leaving a huge mess to mop up. As a result you can't leave it unattended.Cuisinart will tell you that this problem only occurs if the machine isn't properly cleaned, but that's simply not true; no matter how well or frequently you clean it, it will happen. They need to improve the latch, and isolate the grinder area from the steam; as it is now, the steam creates coffee ground muck that spreads throughout the machine.It's a shame that rather than make improvements to the design Cuisinart has decided to play the denial game, and blame customers for a well-documented design problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous","review":"Though I will readily admit that this isn't Mainframe's best series (That honour goes to Reboot) Shadow Raiders did shape up to become very strong. In fact, I will go so far as to say that these last five episodes were the best of the series.The last five eps involve Graveheart, Cryos, Jade and Femur getting stuck on a long lost world from their system known as the Prison Planet. They're absence leaves a power vacuum in the alliance, and who better to fill that vacuum than King Mantel? Much chaos ensues and it takes all of the final five episodes to resolve the various conflicts.SR, like other good series, shows that people are mortal. I won't say who ends up dead, but it's fairly shocking none-the-less.And there are a couple of new characters in the mix, including the extremely cool Sternum.All in all, an excellent conclusion to the series. We can only hope that more episodes get made, though that seems doubtful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great series","review":"I purchase all volumnes to this series.

This has got to be the weakest of the nature-against-man films which came out during the 70s. The frogs did nothing but ribbit and jump around the estate where most of the movie took place. I wasn't scared at all and I don't think the actors were, too. On the other hand, they may have been a little concerned about getting paid for their roles in this flick, because anyone can see it would've been an instant flop in the theaters.Ray Milland does a great job playing a grouchy old millionaire. Sam Elliott also did a fine job but it seemed these two had to carry the other actors performances just to make the movie bearable to watch.In the end, I recommend you avoid this one like the plague.

The CD is broken into two part: Phase 1 and Phase Two.Phase one is magnificient! The 9:56 track called Fire Garden Suite is flawless. Phase 1 is all instramental. Steve Vai shows guitar prowess, emotion and exceptional proficiency. On this part of the record he is hardly topped by any player of the 1990's for accessable hard rock.Phase 2 was kind of a let down for me. To be honest, I am just not that into rock vocals and while this is still very proficient, it lacks staying power for me. Compositionally it IS almost as good as Phase 1. Excellent spin!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Guitar licks, great voice. What more can you ask for?","review":"The singing tracks are awesome. Best lyrics I've ever heard"},{"rating":"2","title":"More compositional and technical brilliance from The Vai","review":"I was fortunate enough to see Steve's tour promoting this CD (Mike Keneally's band opened) and whether he's playing it live or in the studio, this material represents just another expansion of his creativity. Unlike so many guitar heros who've kept a certain sound and compositional style over their many years, Vai constantly grows in the directions he takes his work. It's clear to me as a huge Zappa fan that his many years of working with one of the greatest composers of the 20th century has given him the edge of other guitarist-composers. As someone who loves keyboards nearly as much as guitar, \\"Fire Garden Suite\\" is the standout in terms of scope, passion, richness, technically ability and th balls-to-the-wall shredding of the third movement. God love you, Steve!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good guitar player","review":"Very good cd from Mr. Vai, with great guitar playing and a pretty good sound. If you like electric guitar and rock music, you can't go wrong with this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mind Boggling","review":"Any true musician will tell you that one of the greatest keys to great music is diversity. In this album Steve explores the many different instruments, sounds, and effects the world of sound has to offer. From the first gunshot in \\"There's a Fire In The House\\" to the last guitar note of \\"Warm Regards\\" Steve shows the world he is not afraid to take on extreme variations of tempos, rhythms, and sounds. This album displays Steve Vai as he's never been seen before. His vocals are right on pitch and key. This album is for you whether you appreciate a good song about life or just a masterpiece of guitar and other various intruments. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"don't listen to the others...","review":"The writers of the other comments are obviously lacking in taste. This is an excellently written book with sharp images and intriguing characters. The concept is as original as you will get and very well executed.

This band is one of the rare instances that has one incredible song, and the rest of their entire body of music is just, not good at all. And this is coming from someone who loves funk-metal (311, Red Hot Chili Peppers, even Primus). I don't know, maybe it's just me, but this album is awful. It could just be the album cover, maybe, which is disturbing."},{"rating":"2","title":"You won't forget this book!","review":"This was the first book I read for fun after I finished college, and I was hooked! Following Sarajean from kindergarten through adolescence is a trip you'll be glad you took. It is suprising, interesting and even a little disturbing to grow with Sarajean. The characters that surround her are just as interesting and help the reader experience, not just read. Don't miss this novel!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Well written, but boring!","review":"This book just goes on and on and on with the life of Sarajean.

It has captured the minds of many young people everywhere. It has a feeling of home and abandon. New thoughts come out of the book as you read and visualize what Joanna Rose paints in her mind. The first few chapters opens you up to a new world, a diffrent world where the young and old are united. Some parts of the books were graphic, but that was only the realistic veiws of inspiration. Other parts of the book were confusing, but it became clear later. The book itself was VERY wonderful. Personally, I think Joanna Rose should have contuined it as a series."},{"rating":"2","title":"a light and delightful book!","review":"\\"Little Miss Strange\\" is a very interesting book. One of the most casual but yet funniest book that I've read in awhile. This book is very detailed about the atmosphere, emotions, and thoughts. From Sara Jean's clothes to good transitions on her family situations in the 70s. This book didn't keep me in my feet and isn't much of an exciting page turner, but it is a good book to read at your leisure because it has a lot of heart in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read it about every four years","review":"This book is wonderful to me, to the extent that I don't understand some of the tepid reviews. I get something new out of it every time I pick it up, about every 4 years. It is completely from the perspective of a small girl until she is around 14ish. I think, I'm remembering that right. Unless you have lost touch with how you saw the world during those ages - realizing certain things about human nature for the first time- you will like this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"beautiful guitar with a beautiful sound","review":"I've been playing out with this instrument for about 2 years now. I bought one on sale with a crack in the top, immediately got it repaired, and it is now my number one guitar for fingerstyle and folk playing. The quality and projection of the tone is incredible for a guitar with the 000 body style. I've also installed a Bband pickup and couldn't be happier. I highly recommend this instrument over a cheaper model in the martin/taylor category. In my experience with epiphone acoustics, this one is by far the best, acoustically and aesthetically."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Surprisingly Good Read","review":"This book was incredibly inspirational in addition to being objective and filled with many interesting stories about Americans serving in the \\"far flung areas\\" of the Middle East. The book starts with the humble begginings of US-Arab diplomacy through its roots with Protestent missionaries and ends with the failure of American diplomatic efforts in Iraq pre-1991.I was truly intrigued by the stories Kaplan describes such as the establishment by Protestant missionaries of AUB in Beirut, the succesful evacuation of Americans from the Beirut embassy during the bloody Lebanese Civil War, the rescue of Eithiopian Jews (Falashas) and their deliverance to Israel, etc.Kaplan has done a marvelous job and if one was to have a book concerning US diplomacy/diplomats in the Middle East this would be a must have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Well Done","review":"This is actually a really good movie. It's a made for T.V. movie. I saw it for the first time on Lifetime, which isn't a station I would normally watch. It's a movie based on alien abductions. A mother and daughter are confronted with this. At first, it starts with the daughter's loss of time and memory. Later on in the movie, the mother goes to counceling and finds that she was abducted as well. The plot thickens, but I would really hate to give it away. This would probably be a good movie for anyone interested in aliens. I'd say for the price of the DVD $$$go for it. There aren't any extras on this DVD, but I would assume there would be on the one that will cost you a little more $$$"},{"rating":"1","title":"After all these years...","review":"This movie scared the living daylights out of me when I watched it as a child. A word of advice: don't watch this movie with young children around unless you want them to develop a phobia of extraterrestrials. To a five-year-old, this is one terrifying movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very creepy","review":"Okay I taped this movie a long time ago and the end got cut off. I know it got scarier and scarier. This is the creepiest movie. If anybody could please tell me what happened at the end of this movie, I'd like to know.

I could never watch it again but, I really want to know what happened!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"love it","review":"If you're interested in different parts of the country and you enjoy statistics, this book is awesome. Obviously it's not 100% accurate; how do you seriously rank 300+ metropolitan areas? But taking it with a grain of salt, it's fascinating to see what crime is like New Orleans, or how depressed people are in the Pacific NW. How cold is Anchorage in January? Does Charleston, SC have good restaurants? (it does) It's even more interesting if you're considering moving. Mine is falling apart I've looked at it so much."},{"rating":"1","title":"INACCURATE!","review":"If you analyze the ranking and ratings of this book, you will find very serious misrepresentations! Try to Compare two of your familiar cities one has low crime rate and the other much higher. What you will find is that they are about the same!! Try San Francisco and Oakland, San Jose and Richmond, CA. When you are looking for a safe place to live and raise your kids, you are likely ending up with a crime hovering place. I don't have any bias against rich or poor, but just the nature of the book--it is inaccurate and misleading!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Resource Guide","review":"This 2007 publication is based upon 2006 data and is an update of the 2004 edition.

We purchased two copies so we could each explore cities and then compare our ideas. Having recently made a moving mistake, we wanted to do some serious, extensive research before our next move. Cities Ranked & Rated is the perfect resource for the job! The ten main categories are critical to the comparison of cities, and the numerous sub categories rounded out our need for information.

This of course was nonsense. He was just trying to be the oldest punk in town. The Trio work is Fahey at his most noisy, tuneless and experimental. Some of it just sounds like roadworks outside your house. Guitar, keyboard and a ton of effects, plus at times JF intoning very funny parts of liner notes to previous albums. It's fairly excruciating to my shell-like ears, but I'm aware that some folks LIKE this kind of thing - there are dozens of noise bands out there. Fahey's favourites were Einsturzende Neubauten - so if you like those bad boys, this is for you. But if you love \\"Sunflower River Blues\\" or \\"The Death of the Clayton Peacock\\" then invest in a pack of Anadin Extra before pressing Play.

Gotta Get!","review":"This book is wonderful! The illustrations are superb and the book simply draws in the young listener. The book is suitable for ages 4 and up, and is the best book for young nature lovers that explains simply the lifecycle of the caterpillar. This book easily compares to the Hungry Caterpillar by Eric Carle, but is much more suitable for the pre-school and early elementary age child. It is better than books describing the Monarch butterfly, as the illustrations are just incredible. A must buy for the nature lover in all kids! Gotta Get! Gotta Get!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is awful~!","review":"If this is not the worst book i have ever read i dont know what could be.

This author is a horrible imitator of classic childrens illustration."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing the point","review":"I would have made it -5 stars had that option been available. The words are cute, the rhythm and repetition would naturally involve a young audience but this piece is an insult in its lack of understanding of the butterfly life cycle and its misrepresentation of the experience of creaures with which we share the planet--worthy only of a McDonald's advertisement or Barbie commercial. It is a money making venture period. Monarchs are popular today. Neither the author nor the illustrator tried to get to know any but the most rudimentary information about their subject or they would have known better. If it had been a similar handling of black people or cubans or asians, who are able to speak for themselves this book would have died a quick death on an editors desk. It speaks to how little we know or care about the natural world that it has gotten good reviews from Horn Book and Kirkus.

Also, the heel was not quite 4\\" nor was the shaft of the boot high enough to be called a \\"knee boot\\", it reached about 3/4 of the way up my calf (and I don't half exceptionally long legs).

The remaining disks are clearly not a continuation of the first disk and have the feel of cast offs from other software companies circa 1980 that were just bundled together. I was pretty amused by the vocabulary disk that seemed to be primarily the names of zoo animals (and cockroach!) Oh, the old version includes a disk on Human Japanese, pretty nice, but not in this version.

The string that comes with it is fairly useless, but I bought a multi-pack of embroidery floss at the craft store to go with it, and it worked out perfectly. I also recommend large safety pins instead of using tape when you start a bracelet--holds much more securely and you can make bracelets in many more locations :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Many words missing","review":"This book is a fantastic idea and has many useful synonyms. You can look the words up in Arabic or English which saves times. The author also puts each of the synonyms into sentences which is very useful. If you want to use this book to look up words as you read newspapers, novels, or other printed and broadcast media, it's less useful.

Some of the wood appeared to be Home Depot rejects (splintered, and chewed up). One of the legs was mis-drilled by 1/4 inch and had to be redrilled to fit. Cheap staples that weren't completely driven in (include a hammer in your tool inventory if you're putting this thing together). Instructions were sparse and vague and the diagram was too small to be of any help. I'm highly suspicious of the rave reviews for this frame based on the product I received.

Firstly, the other reviews were spot on. If you are handy (which I am) you will get by re-constructing this mess of a designed or flawed bed frame with just a couple curse words. 1/2 the frame came stained (which I ordered) the other was not. The bolts packaged by the company were WRONG sizes and kind. I went to my local ACE hardware store and purchased the proper kind and size. The slats were cut too short and required a screw in each slat on the center support to ensure proper weight distribution...WOW. It was a headache of a project. Shame on these idiots for zero quality control. I will say for the $$$ it is oak and after my constructing the frame it is solid, but still a pathetic attempt by Room Doctor at selling an incomplete, poorly executed bed frame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible service","review":"First I must say I've never written a review for anything I've ordered from Amazon including over 300 purchases but this one made me angry enough to write a terrible review for this companyit took room doctor three months to get this bed to meAfter a month and a half I sent them an email they responded on a Monday and said I should receive the bed on that Friday.it took three weeks after that Friday for the bed to be delivered. I received an email saying that they were waiting on a shipment of wood. And it wasn't till after I contacted Amazon and they were coming close to the maximum amount of days before the order be refunded by Amazon that I finally received an email with a shipping confirmationThe bed itself is fairly sturdy and have not had any issues with it although a lot of the boards were cracked and many were warped.Room Dr. sucks!!!!

Ridiculous plot, paper-thin characters. The much-hyped Solaris planet, which could have been such a great plot device is reduced to one remarkably un-astounding battle. Overall, a walking 300-page nightmare."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the better Battletech books, but the sequal is better","review":"Despite what some other reviewers will tell you, this one ranks right up their with Stackpole. Good character development, and tying together different elements of a character. The desensitization of war caused on Solaris is covered well, sometimes a bit too obviously. The battle is interesting, and the story of Turkyyaid shows a 'soldier's eye' view. The battle against the Clans is a little too easy towards the end, and I regret not telling a little more about Comstar. Some parts of the good old Order must be more nonsecular than others for him to be able to leave that easily. This is well-written, and is necessary to enjoy D.R.T., but the second one is better. I only wish their was a third Black Thorn story."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Turkey!","review":"I recommend you AVOID \\"Main Event\\" (James D. Long). This story is such a turkey I was cheering for the bad guys in hope that some miserable main characters would get bumped off (alas, no such luck).

With additional research, I discovered that I really needed a book to step me through the forgiveness process so that I could release my anger. If you also need to forgive(not forget or justify their actions) so that you can move forward with your life, try The Art of Forgiving by Lewis B. Smedes. It will step you through the process."},{"rating":"1","title":"No table of contents for the CD\`","review":"What a disappointment!

In Western society we seek to expel anger from ourselves. Yet, in Eastern thought anger is embraced and nourished as being a part of the whole of a person, and kept in check so as not to be unleashed to harm one's self or another. I highly recommend it.

Then, it's time to roll up your sleeves and get to work.I have found his techniques dangerously simplistic at times, feeling drawn to a sense of failure for not wiping my anger away after reading his book.I take it all with a grain of salt.Thich Nhat Hanh once wrote: \\"I know if a person does not make people around him happy, he cannot be happy himself. And this applies not only to monks. If you are unable to make the people around you happy, how can you be happy?\\" (from a talk given to children on July 23, 1997 in Plum Village)That's dangerous codependent teaching, in my view.I take from his writings what works, and drop the rest without reservation...but with careful discrimination."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing.","review":"If one takes the message of the book to heart, one would be better off reading a book on mindful breathing and living.

(We know from infrequent hints that he is, if not related to British Royalty, at least an aristocrat.)I recommend MYSTERY MILE unreservedly. If you love Dorothy Sayers, Ngaio Marsh, and Agatha Christie, you are in for a grand adventure with Mr. Campion and his ex-burglar servant, Magersfontaine Lugg. I particularly liked this book which was published by Felony/Mayhem, and I hope they publish more of Miss Allingham's work."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent plot","review":"Mystery Mile.This is a wonderful mystery which keeps your attention right to the end. The only drawback for me was the use of various British dialects and slang of that period, which was distracting. Ms Allingham has a real gift for creating a menacing atmosphere. She also is a master of character description; Mr. Campion, Lugg and the other main players are very easy to visualize. The BBC Mystery series of a few years ago which featured some of her books, faithfully brought her characters to life."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read!","review":"I enjoyed this book very much. It has an engaging plot, detective, hints of a love story, characters, and medieval-feudal English setting. The one thing I would quarrel with is: the detective Campion at first seemed just to observe what happens instead of protecting the people he's supposed to protect. Why allow an unknown itinerant fortune-teller to come in to the house at all? Seems like asking for trouble! Otherwise, enjoyed it and look forward to reading my next Campion book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely New Copies of a Vintage Mystery Series","review":"Thank you, Felony and Mayhem, for your new publications of vintage mysteries!

A bumbling, utterly inept group of crooks resolve upon a seemingly simple heist. They fail in spectacular fashion. The scene in which Toto demonstrates the different methods for cracking a safe is unforgettably hilarious. A tour de force of casting, including Toto, Mastroianni, Gassman and Claudia Cardinale in her first major role.As a shocked Italian media reported, \\"Welcome to Collinwood\\" is nothing more than a remake of this remarkable film. As is so often the case, the original far surpasses the remake.Strange facts#1 The actors play characters from all over Italy, yet almost none of them gets to play a character with an accent from the actor's own part of the country!#2 Can you guess which of the principal actors was, in fact, a barista in the bar where the director used to go for his coffee?"},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie will never get old.","review":"I just saw this movie for the first time about a year ago.

Western cultures, (especially American Western culture), has a history of avoiding this topic like the plague (or taxes perhaps). The book helps enormously particularly those in need of the transition-support to this difficult \\"place\\" NOW. For all the Baby Boomers out there - with beloved parent(s) in nursing homes, (just as one example): Isn't it about time that we all join the rest of the world and deal with the inevitable via all the pathways this author presents and explores for the benefit of the heartrending least and last?

It still has the typical hardcore ska / punk type of thing to satisfy all the die-hard offpsring fans but has songs such as \\"Gone Away\\" which can literally bring tears to your eyes. I'm also rather partial towards \\"Amazed\\" (song 13) as I feel it also epitomises this more \\"deep & meaningful\\" musical undertones like \\"Gone Away\\" does.. Of course, the remainder of the tract is what everyone else loves, From the high school anthem \\"Cool to Hate\\" to the drug-loving \\"Mota\\" .. And last but not least, let's not forget that catchy \\"Intermission\\", which just pleads to be whistled at any given moment :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweeeet","review":"This is their best CD by far, it's as good as smash but better, americana cant live up to it.

Ixnay is a great CD the first one i bought by The Offspring."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great \\"half-and-half\\" cd.","review":"'Ixnay on the Hombre' is one of those albums with some REALLY good tracks and some REALLY bad ones. For example: \\"Gone Away\\" has got to be one of the most intense songs I've ever heard; same goes for \\"Amazed\\" (as well as about 5 others). Then, songs like \\"Cool to Hate\\" and \\"Don't Pick it Up\\" throw any intelligent-themes out of whack.MOST of the songs on this album are intense, well-thought out, and musically amazing... there are just a few bad ones to skip through.Go ahead and buy 'Ixnay on the Hombre', there is some hardcore punk-rock on there... just be prepared to skip about half of the tracks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Underrated CD","review":"After Americana, everyone was expecting another great CD from The Offspring. This was the result. In my opinion, a great CD, but no one thought of it like that then. Some songs such as \\"Me and My Old Lady\\" and \\"Don't Pick It Up\\" differ from the usual fast paced punk of the old CDs, but make it work. \\"Leave It Behind\\" is a fast, hard hitting song that ends far too soon to get into it. And those aren't even the singles. All in all, it's a great CD. Go buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Straightforward and honest","review":"The only thing to say about this album is that you have to listen to it to judge it.

So should we, life is not so complicated after all."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Album Is Old...

Interesting...I'm finding all these weird inter-connected guitar riffs. \\"Come Out and Play\\" has the \\"Pretty Fly\\" thing going. The little riff in Come Out and Play was in Pay the Man. Change the World has the same riff as Genocide. Don't Pick it Up is a lot like What Happened to You? And Way Down THe Line sounds a lot like Why Don't You Get a Job. An overall stronger CD than Americana...but less outstanding songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"not their best but still great","review":"this album has its high points and its lows. it starts great with a cool intro and my favorite song on the album \\"the meaning of life\\" but the 4 songs following it really need to grow on you and even then they arent that great. the two singles \\"gone away\\" and \\"all i want\\" are great of course but you could just get the greatest hits. the only real reason to get this is for \\"meaning of life\\" \\"amazed\\" \\"way down the line\\" \\"dont pick it up\\" and the intermission is funny. it just seems like they were trying too hard to make another Smash. i would definately recommend it over their self titled album and conspiracy of one. so if you own ignition, smash, americana & splinter pick this one up"},{"rating":"2","title":"Inxay on the Hombre-Best album by best band","review":"1997's Inxay on the Hombre was easily the best album by the best band- the Offspring. The CD contains every style of rock there is. It contains two humorous pieces in \\"Disclaimer\\" and 'Intermission. Terrific punk songs include \\"MOTA\\", \\"Cool to Hate\\", \\"The meaning of Life\\" and my favorite \\"Change the World\\". It has slower but good tracks like \\"I choose\\" and the radio-happy \\"Gone Away\\". It also has a ska track in \\"Don't Pick It Up\\" and an REM sounding hit in \\"Amazed\\". The only song that is weak off this CD is \\"Me and My Old Lady\\".

(I gave Smash away to). My favorite songs on this cd are Mota, Cool To Hate, I Choose, and Gone Away. If you like this I also recommend Smash and Conspiracy of One.

Perhaps she felt her first effort was well received because of her pedantic anger over poor punctuation and sought out some other topic to vent about. But, sadly, her complaints about manners are excessive - but not in a cute way. Her reasoning is uninspired and seems to rely heavily on cliche. Perhaps, though, people who wish to physically injure those who walk through doors held open for them would enjoy it.

Many members of my family have suffered greatly from the disease that Ms Truss so cuttingly mocks in this book.But - if she sees the world as rude - it is not surprising that she herself also manifests rudeness - for apparently she is fascinated with it.But really - she's trying to be funny - but at the expense of others. Normally this is something we try to correct in kindergarten - \\"Don't mock the afflicted...\\"It is a rare humorist indeed who can bring a laugh without first stabbing at someone else. I hope Ms Truss can refine her style of writing and begin to create humor that is not so mean spirited."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"This is the worst book I have ever read.

The idea of bolting the door if it isn't, well, that's perfectly ridiculous, and her suggestions for coping are actually painful. She takes herself way too seriously, and her suggestions are a breeding ground for faulty thinking -- a recipe for really going nuts. Moreover, concerned with rudeness, she is being rude herself, inflicting the very pain she is complaining about on others."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I could give it half a star","review":"Have you ever bought a book that you thought you would enjoy, that a major magazine (The Boston Globe) described as droll and entertaining and received, instead, an at times whiney while at other times strident rant about the decline of manners in the world? While the author, in her examples, was as rude, albeit in a less physical fashion that, than the behavior of her subjects? Then you will understand my feelingsWhen she admitted that the book had no discernable purpose, I should have know not to purchase it. What troubles me is that I cannot return it, so she will get a royalty for my purchase (I bought it in another city and am unlikely to return there).While I agree with the premise, that some of the social niceties are being abandoned, I do not think Ms. Truss added anything to the debate, other than a book that reads more like a flame war on a public message board on the internet."},{"rating":"1","title":"rude, judgemental and lies.","review":"This book is the worst book I have ever read. The author presents in such a judgemental manner that her book may be the major reason you should stay home and bolt the door.

The freedom fought for in the past, has now run amuck in the oh so important everyday world of manners!! When the most superficial of social interactions is placed at the front of human communications, what the author is really saying \\"I'm lost and scared, please don't make me adapt\\" or \\"I don't understand you, I was told to do this, please fall in line like me\\" While it is nice to be nice, the problem is really a lack of human compassion for others taught as a general attitude, not that the big, scary \\"modern\\" world is filled with isolating technology. Ignore it, adapt, teach, move on, evolve and have a nice day."},{"rating":"1","title":"The author needs to follow what she says...","review":"The authos like someone has said earlier is a good observe of human behavior and practices. Each time she re-enforces the idea that people are extremely impolite about things... I just wonder if she herself does follow it. There is no notion of not ranting about one thing over and over again. This is \\"effing\\" joke for the intellectual mind. To summarize the author actually is very good with english, in that she creates an entire book out a material that is worth about a page and a half at its very best.This book as per me is a pointless cluster of words and nothing more."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISGUSTING AND IGNORANT","review":"I was appalled to read what an inconvenience those people with \\"gluten intolerance\\" are and how they choose to be awkward!!

How dare you write about this disease so flippantly with obviously no knowledge about it....at worst if this \\"faddy\\" diet was not followed the consequences could be fatal resulting in developing cancer.I hope you never have the \\"pleasure\\" of ever developing some auto immune disease such as coeliac as obviously it would be of great detriment to you....not wanting to cause \\"a fuss\\" about your special requirements!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"HOW DID THIS GET PUBLISHED??!!","review":"I read this book about half way through.

I mean, how much longer do we have to put up with that gluten crap?\\"Gluten intolerance better known as coeliac disease is a medical condition and not a 'FOOD FAD' as the author suggests.If she wants to go through something like the horrors those of us who are celiac go through I suggest she takes a packet of laxatives with every meal she eats for a month and then lets the world know how she feels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Educate yourself, Ms. Truss.

You'll be left thinking \\"Oh I -don't- act like that!\\", or seeing yourself. Truss's style is fast, witty, thought provoking and just might help to restore that marker of civilization, courtesous behavior. Along the way, there's the hassle of not being able to speak to a breathing person, lousy customer service, the scourge of modern commuting - the cell-phone, and the general ugliness of things. But there just might be hope. At least I hope so."},{"rating":"1","title":"an undisciplined rave","review":"I did not enjoy this book. It read to me as an undisciplined rave with no depth, few interesting illustrations, and no wider vision or philosophical comment to make. One might at least have hoped for some interesting vocabulary to redeem it, but one hoped in vain. Truss writes about rudeness, and yet I consider it an impertinence to bother us with such an uninformed rant. She was highly entertaining in \\"Eats Shoots and Leaves\\", and has assumed that she can write what she likes thereafter and still make sales.I was bored with her self-indulgence and couldn't finish it fast enough. She was trying to be funny and failing to succeed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brits-0 !!!","review":"Now I remember why we don't speak with a British accent. Even discounting the fact that I am Irish and don't like the uppity brits - this book stinks. I am sure that Lynne Truss sat with a thesaurus at her elbow and tried to be \\"extra\\" uppity so the Americans would buy this book. No one uses six 20 letter words in every sentence. Some of the points of rudeness are accurate but you spit and fume at her own rudeness while reading. If you have a bird - buy this book to line the cage.

Apparently she never considered that I didn't ask for, need or want her gift. She makes it sound like receiving a gift has strings attached, the expected thank you note.. just because some people are massive gift givers doesn't make us all want the gifts..we only accept them to not be rude...did she ever think that it could be considered rude to give the gift in the first place..."},{"rating":"1","title":"I bailed by page 86","review":"Familiar with the author's 'Eats, Shoots and Leaves', I saw this small book in our library's new release section. While there are a few thoughtful passages, the book mainly contains inconsistent rants about the decline of polite society. These include a puzzling, embarassing attack on the gluten and lactose intolerant and a passage comparing online banking to 'doing you own dental work' (sic) and 'DIY funerals: the modern way'. Truss laments our lack of 'please' and 'thank you' but then disavows 'the enforced perkiness of American service workers'. She acknowledges the empowering effect of the availability of choices to modern women, then complains that too many choices exist in today's society. My outrage at the $20.00 hardcover list price for 200 pages further contributed to the low rating, especially considering each page barely contains a half-dozen sentences."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Bad, But Not as Good as Her Previous Book","review":"This is Truss' followup to her immensely successful \\"Eats, Shoots and Leaves. According to the cover it's also a New York Times best seller, but I'm sure I hasn't done as well as her first book. She was ranting about poor punctuation in her earlier book; in this she's ranting about poor manners. And I will agree with much of what she says. The book is a delight to read and she still has a lot of humor in it, but it doesn't measure up to her earlier book. Her writng style is quite similar and she is still fun to read, but perhaps she's a little more angry in this book and that takes the edge off it. Nevertheless the book is worth buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ms. Truss is the rudest one of all","review":"The Utter Bloody Rudest thing of all in this book is Ms. Truss and her ignorant bigotry on gluten intolerance, i.e. celiac disease. Guess what, Ms. Truss? 3 million Americans, and a little over 1% of Britons are genetically gluten-intolerant (and probably similar percentages for the rest of the world), and this life-damaging disease KILLS an unknown number of people each year. So you don't like dealing with gluten intolerance? We don't either, but we don't have a choice. Get over yourself, and quit slinging gratuitous insults at people dealing with serious medical issues."},{"rating":"1","title":"Talk about rude behavior!","review":"I am truly offended by the author's comment on lactose and gluten intolerance. People do not choose to live this way. She should do some research before making such comments. As far as her feeling like she is \\"missing out,\\" I don't know many people who want to feel what it is like to be so sick that you don't want to get out of bed all because of something you ate. And who wants to pay 5 times as much for bread that doesn't even taste good. I have no respect for her and it doesn't say much for the publishers of this book either. I would never purchase or read any of her books!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Played well this side of the Atlantic too","review":"Though Ms. Truss writes from the point of view of the Brit she is, I found her perspective on the state of manners in at least the industrialized, \\"civilized\\" Western societies to be quite accurate, at least from my observations of the world around me. Her presentation is very witty but at the same time quite succinct. Along the way some of her observations and descriptions were very much worthy of a good laugh. No regrets reading this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where Have the Manners Gone?","review":"There were a few UK terms I had to guess at, but for the most part Truss has again written a highly entertaining book. This is an especially good read for anyone who's already read 'Eats, Shoots, and Leaves.'While manners may not be quite as dead as Talk to the Hand would lead us to believe, there are a good many points to consider...one of my favorites being the current lack of respect often seen in children. Acknowledging the problem may be the first step but laughing at it can lead to taking ourselves a bit less seriously. If it doesn't help society it will at least brighten your day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Puffery","review":"This 'book' would hardly contain enough material for a good article. Clearly LT is cashing in on her previous success, Eats, Shoots and Leaves, which was excellent reading.Nearly everything worthwhile was said in the Introduction which has a section that asks \\"Why am I doing this?\\" To which the answer is, obviously, to make money.Don't buy this book.

If the book is talking about the demise of manners, as the title seems to imply, it would appear that the author is happy about the prospect and doing her best to hasten it. I found little cohesion, and can only conclude that Truss (she doesn't like honorifics, I gather) produced this current offering in an attempt to cash in on Eats, Shoots & Leaves.Well, aside from making this reader resolve to leave Truss strictly alone in future - which appears to be the aim of this book - it didn't work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work with Windows XP!","review":"Don't get fooled by Amazon.com's listing which says the software is compatible with XP.

It did have minimal and somewhat ambiguous instructions. Come to find out, you have to have a Schwinn bicycle to use their bottle cage. That is totally ignorant.

However, they are losing sales of Schwinn accessories to non-Schwinn owners, not to mention losing money on the product returns which can't be resold.If they made a universally installable bottle cage, or at least an adaptor for other bikes, that would make a little sense. Having Schwinn accessories on non-Schwinn bikes is advertising in and of itself. The current design only creates ill-will among non-Schwinn owners.

Am now living in Paris so it makes it even more appropriate to read but I think anyone with an interest in this amazing city and its impact on visitors will find much to treasure here.

Unfortunately, so much of contemporary \\"women's fiction\\" seems to center on ditzy, semicompetent (at best) heroines, and this book is no exception. The back story is handled clumsily, with a lot of dialogue that would never occur in real life but which the author uses to sum up the previous books in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not perfect (some may say) but very useful.","review":"At times you, as someone using this book to start your journey into medieval latin, might wish for more footnotes or vocabulary, or find some choices strange (at least on first inspection), but this is a very good intro reader. Of course this is only a reader and you must already have read Wheelock's or reading latin or some such thing, also you may find Harkness or Schmitz handy, and likely Woodcock. This book is not as in depth as Betts and Franklin's poetry reader (which is good for in class instruction) but it is a very good value. It has a lot of passages to read in it and is well organized. There are also english intros that give background details on the poems or passages. So over all, it could be a little better but is worth buying, and if you take a medieval latin course in university, this is the book the passages will likely be from. The more you read this book the more you will like it (and it has the loch ness monster)."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT A AUDIO CD as the description states","review":"The product states in the title it is an unabridged audio CD.

It is one of the worst excuses for a novel I've ever read, and I would have preferred that the author remained in the realm of nonfiction. Nevertheless, it did provoke one charming comment, from one of the computer geeks in the company, to all of us English majors in the technical writing division.

I find that in corporate america, people contribute mostly in their assigned role. \\"I am a business analyst so I don't give my 2 cents when solutioning\\".

And a hundred heads are even better. And a thousand are almost perfect. Watch the asymptote as it approaches infinity... You are getting veeeerrrry sleeeeepy...This is a very interesting concept, fleshed out into a very boring book. It seems like a graduate thesis that got stretched to book length for publication in hopes of drafting the popular slipstream of writers such as Malcolm Gladwell.The premise is fascinating, and the first chapter delivers. After that it reminds me of papers I wrote in high school, where I'd state a proposition and then strip-mine all available research materials in a singleminded quest for [only] supoorting information. It feels very one-sided.Overall, as I'm sure you can tell, I found it a bit of a disappointment because it could have been a very enjoyable article or even a book if it wasn't so heavy-handed in pursuing the thesis's applicability to every aspect of human endeavor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious, shallow and meandering","review":"Interesting premise; tedious, shallow and meandering execution. Surowiecki explores a number of promising leads but doesn't really close the deal on any of them. Too many anecdotes and related conclusions are left as fiat, without real exploration, exposition or more importantly credible documentation that the author's conclusions are merited by the studies he cites. Worse, every conclusion is promptly followed by a laundry list of caveats and counter-cases. Since the author does not truly develop an organizing theory or tightly woven explanatory narrative (leaving his only attempt to do so until literally the last several pages), the reader ends up being subjected to a barrage of interesting, but often contradictory, just-so stories. The end result is more frustrating than enjoyable or enriching."},{"rating":"1","title":"Little more than a collection of anecdotes","review":"Intrigued by the relative frequency of citation of this book in the new \\"web 2.0\\" universe, I was disappointed to find only a sequence of factoids on social experiments and little in the way of analysis. From the very beginning of the book the reader is invited to agree with the central thesis (that a crowd of independent individuals does better than a smaller elite group) and it very much feels like evidence is carefully selected to reinforce the author's argument. The book could have been twice as thin without losing much of its substance. I would qualify it as a light business read, entertaining but not quite convincing if you're not part of the choir."},{"rating":"2","title":"PEARLS","review":"Unlike in his New Yorker column, James Surowiecki takes far too long to support his thesis in practical terms--but when he does the details, insights and perspective are nothing short of breathtaking.

It is argued that the great inventions and innovations were made by individuals, and next, it is the crowd that supposedly makes the right decisions. Outbursts against large corporations have no reason to be in this book, and just dilutes the message. Reconsidering the excellent presentations of the weight of the ox and the fall in the price of Thiokol after the Challenger explosion, there are not enough of such examples to assure that these phenomena were not a coincidence.

The U.S. economy wasn't built upon 'lagom', it was built upon 'can-do', which arose from brilliant ideas.......from individuals!!!

Besides, they believe that the above truth is not widely known.This book will show you that other opinions should always be taken into account and, more importantly, that a larger group of ordinary people may produce more meaningful thougths than a smaller group of more qualified people.

I will not pay more for an ebook than the real thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"The title of this book says it all. The book mostly proves the opposite. There are a few cases where the author does demonstrate the wisdom of crowds but mostly it shows the stupidity of so called crowds (the author considers some really small groups as crowds). You are drawn in by a couple of actual examples of groups doing some amazing things. He mentions some interesting markets where people buy shares concerning elections and which prove to be rather more accurate than polls in the end. He mentions a case where a submarine was lost and an individual pulls together a diverse group (not much of a crowd), each of whom guesses where the sub is and on the average they come within a few hundred yards. Most of the rest of his examples are not only weak but prove the converse. Like I said don't waste your time reading this garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pseudoscience","review":"I didn't finish this book, cos I thought it would be a waste of my time. I was not convinced from the first page to the last page I read. While the idea is interesting, the overly varied examples don't prove much except sloppiness. If I missed the point, then the author has obviously done a very bad job at explaining his concept. He tries to pass off aggregation, independence and one other thing as basic conditions as though there is some science involved here, but the meaning of all three are not defined, so I find them useless in understanding the examples raised. The arguments are not structured in a way that would convince a skeptical reader. Interesting idea though."},{"rating":"1","title":"no experiments please","review":"This book uses too many controlled experiments to make its point. Perhaps it is just my aversion but when I read about professors doing experiments with htiwer students or some other controled group, I tend to read quicker to get over the mush quicker.Books for \\"intelligent laypeople\\" like this seem to be better when they make the reader do some work to grapple with the issues ocvered. However, I found it a tad patronizing: the crowd, as Shakespeare and others showed, can be just a rabble. And the fact that Francis \\"Sepreamcist IQ\\" Galton, a false statistical prophet if ever there was one, came across a group of amateurs correctly guessing, \\"on the average\\" the weight of a pig at a fair proves little beyond that anecdotes like that are not the best building blocks for serious books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing pages","review":"Beware!

James Surowiecki exchanges complexity, precision and eloquence of language and concept in the interest of mass-consumption. I suppose that is due to his training as a journalist, but I caution anyone against reading a science book not written by the people who devote themselves wholeheartedly to the science.Wisdom of Crowds is not entirely unworth reading, especially if you're looking for a light treatment of the subject and you appreciated Mitch Albom and Po Bronson's style. But if you're looking for an engaging introduction to the subject, keep looking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can I please give negative stars?","review":"This book has actually made me so angry in reading it that I'm having trouble writing a fair assessment of it. The authors developments for the \\"wisdom of crowds\\" was judged by the fact that if you average people's guesses at the numbers of marbles in a jar, it comes to be rather close; fine for guessing marbles in a jar, but real world applications of this type of thinking is flawed and arguments for it are left wanting. A good half the arguments he develops in the book are about the stupidity of crowds; leaving me wondering why I even bothered with his trite analysis of \\"funny and amusing sociological data\\" The author's world is a sterile and joyless place where the reality of his ideas are about as exciting as this read. The last time I checked \\"crowds\\" haven't written any great books, created any symphonies or inspired me to any level like an individual could."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't know the meaning of the word \\"wisdom.\\"","review":"The author writes a book on the erroneous concept - probably because he is unable to adequately determine and correctly define \\"wisdom\\" in his concept. \\"The wisdom of the crowds.\\" more accurately titled should have been the \\"The forces of popular opinion.\\" There is no real \\"wisdom\\" in the book. He fails to acknowledge the contradictions of his title and the entire concept - individuals who have advanced far beyond the crowd, their peers and all current paradigms - da Vinci, Columbus, Gallilleo, Darwin, Einstein, and many others that didn't listen to and were far wiser than any crowd. If the \\"crowd\\" truly had exceptional wisdom - then there would be no consultants and no distinctive terms like \\"wise men.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast-Food for Thought.","review":"I give the book 4 stars because it stimulates your thinking NOT because its thesis is correct; it isnt. The book is filled with many examples of how groups fail.A better thesis would be: Groups function best in situations where there is little or no change and life is simple. Groups are status quo animals. Surowiecki misses the boat when he assigns intelligence to information that is clearly statistics. Information isnt intelligence. A group is a collection of life forms without a collective intelligence.Surowiecki alludes to the influence of leaders but never explores just how influential leaders are in shaping the actions of groups.But the bottom-line is, I'll buy the book for my library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book on human behavior!","review":"If you want to know more about the importance of shedding all political alliegences and affiliations, read this book.

It was my first exposure to them and I listened to it several times a day for the first week. Great guitar music and vocals as well. TBS is not the typical band and it's got a different sound than most, but it's awesome. I like to say they are a mix between Blink 182 and Dashboard Confessional. Very good stuff. If you have never heard them before, go with \\"Tell All Your Friends\\" before you get their newer one, \\"Where You Want to Be.\\" This one just has a better sound and all of the songs are good as opposed to just some.Best song on CD-- \\"Cute Without the E (Cut from the team)\\"Worst Song-- \\"Head Club\\" (This is the only bad one on the entire CD)"},{"rating":"1","title":"That rating should really be ZERO!","review":"This Band blows my ass!!!

Secondly, the lyrics are, at best juvenile and uneventful - once you pass the age of thirteen they have no relevance whatsoever!

And after watching for like one minute i realise how great the song was. I download the song right-after and it quickly become one my favourite song. The lyric feels like it's slicing my heart!!! But i gotta say my fav song in this album isn't Cute without the E. But Ghostman on third. It's a song about getting drunk i guess, and it's just amazing!

These guys are compared to Thursday and Jimmy Eat World. Rightful comparison. I think if you put Thursday and Jimmy Eat World into a blender Taking Back Sunday would come out. Don't get me wrong, TBS has an original sound, lyrics, and etc. But there is a definate similarity to Jimmy Eat World and Thurday, but this isn't a bad thing! It works really well for them.

The lyrics are honest and true to about everything any person has felt at least once in their life. Heartbreak, deceit, lonliness, uselessness, and overcoming all...it all comes together in this one little cd. On top of it all, unlike droning sad rock, it is upbeat, giving it a bit of attitude. The harmonies are beautiful and the music is something original enough to hook new emo/punk lovers, but have the veterans appreciate equally. I recomend this to anyone who truly listens to the words in music, for you will be very pleased. I give this Five out of Five. This will not leave your CD player!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stellar Recording","review":"This is one of the best releases Victory Records will ever put out, 2nd in my opinion, to anything by Thursday.

By the way, they put the pop in there at just the right times to actually improve the sound. TBS has their own unique sound, and some songs might hit you the wrong way, but after about 4 listens to those songs, you will love them just as much as you love \\"you're so last summer\\".

Sometimes it just seems it can get a bit pop-punkish and many of the songs end up sounding very similar. TBS basically has one tempo when they play: fast. Not that it's bad, and it's not even that fast, they could just tone down, speed up, or do something to make the album a bit more varied. The lyrics are great, however, and #3 is an incredible track.

I hate comparing bands and labeling them. You could call this screamo, screamcore, hardcore, punk, or anything else you want. This record is smooth, slick, well produced, and it sounds great. Most songs are upbeat and catchy, with the screaming/singing dynamic that is being done more and worse these days. A band that does well is a breath of fresh air, and TBS are just that.

TBS was another average (generic) punk band until Victory Records took control, then bastardized them. TBS has nothing in common with Thursday (minus the backup vocals, which are a creation of Thursday that the producers decided to push onto this as well), the lyrics are horribly predictable and generic. The guitar work leaves much to be desired and the song structures are about as predictable as the lyrics. Oh yes, this is not \\"emo-punk\\", it's just straight Victory Records carp pop punk. The only thing that saves this album from getting one star is the nice artwork on the cover of the cd.er... actually, nah."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's okay, but haven't I Heard This Before?","review":"This whole new wave of emo has really dissapointed me in terms of originality and ingenuity. Thursday, Finch, The Movielife, and Taking Back Sunday all seemingly sound...THE SAME! There is nothing by Taking Back Sunday that I haven't heard before. Heck, TBS used the same producer that Thursday did.It's the same vocals, same structure, and same lyrics. There are some stand-out tracks like \\"There is no I in Team\\" but even that sounds like someone has already made it.For those that would like to try something different check out Recover, New End Original, Jets to Brazil, or even Mars Volta.

I see a tear..."},{"rating":"1","title":"TBS Opener","review":"I didn't enjoy this CD past the first couple of days. I bought the CD after hearing it in a friend's car. I listened to it for a few days and then I didn't pull it out of my case for a long time. When I pulled it out and listened to it again, I thought it was awful. The music isn't very good. The lyrics are not well written, and they're incredibly emo (just a personal preference of mine not to go too far into emo thoughts). The screaming was good at first, but then it was the same sound the whole CD, and it gave me a headache. Overall, if you want a CD with screaming on the same tone almost constantly, and below average guitar and drums, pick this up. Otherwise, avoid this CD and don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY good cd","review":"they deserve a 4.5/5. just saw them live opening up for the used and blink 182. they were AMAZING in concert. they are VERY emo, so if you like bands like the used, dashboard confessional, and the get up kids, you'll DEFINITELY be into TBS."},{"rating":"2","title":"great job","review":"this Cd is one of the better punk cd's i own, and i own a frikien ton of cd's. i recomend this cd to anyone who enjoys emo/some screamo. the highlights of hte cd being #3 , #4, #7, all those songs i listen to daily."},{"rating":"2","title":"cute w/out the e","review":"This is a great song.

Are you kidding me?! Even in this same genre there are so many better bands. What we have here is pretty much a emo blink-182. The vocals make me gag as they absolutely destroy the whole dual-vocals thing. I also saw a reviewer say they have \\"deep, meaningful lyrics\\". Hmmm, ok...and I guess you must also find the expose about the letter 3 on sesame street deeply thought provoking. I can't help but think of high school (even jr. high) when I hear this cd. \\"And you're so guilty it's disgusting He's been sneakin underneath your sheets and your hands have been in places that they probably shouldn't go but don't worry sweetie cause I already know.\\" - That's directly from \\"The Blue Channel\\".

Most of it anyways. This is one of the best cds in the genre that I own thanks to its clever lyrics, catchy melodies and then it throws in some screaming for good measure. Dont worry, there isn't too much of that on here but just enough so that it works really well. Like most, I was first introduced to Taking Back Sunday from hearing You're So Last Summer, still the best song on this album in my opinion. The lyrics in that song, as pointed out by a reviewer below me, are genius and are indicative of what the rest of the album is like lyrically. I'm not a hardcore emo fan but the stuff is growing on me, and from what I know so far this nicely exemplifies the genre. A lot of people will not like it but thats okay too. Anyways a few of my favorites are tracks 3,4,5 and 9. Overall it is a pretty good album I recommend hearing."},{"rating":"2","title":"How can you not like this!","review":"What a debut album! People say they sound like Thursday. I personally don't hear the similarity. TBS has a more punk influence to emo while Thursday is emocore. My favorite songs are Bike Scene, Ghost Man on Third, You're So Last Summer, and Head Club. I've read some other peoples reviews on this and they didn't seem to like Head Club, but I sure do. It just rocks! Everytime I listen to it, I just keep making it louder and louder. Trust me, get this album. I love it and I'm sure you will too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Taking Back Sunday Bridges the gap between emo & pop-punk","review":"Taking Back Sunday is described as an Emo band, but that doesn't do them justice. They have a very unique blend of pop-punk & emo that make this CD a must-have. I especially love the song \\"There's No 'I' In Team\\". Their songs have a great deal of emotion and intensity, and if you're a fan of emo or pop-punk you should buy this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tell all your friends","review":"Everything about this album is average. I love the vocals, and the lyrics are all right. Certainly, I've heard better, but it's worth your money.

It showed some signs of breaking down a couple of days before it completely went down - like failure to mount 1 out of three times, weird starting sound, etc. - and I regret that I should've backed up my data at that time. Anyway, I continued to use it ignoring the premonitions and all of a sudden it completely blacked out.I set it aside for a couple of months after its failure, and wondering if the hard disk itself was still alive, I took it apart - it's so hard to disassemble the unit that I had to use brutal force to crack open it - and took out the hard disk. Using a SATA-to-USB connector, I hooked it up to my desktop Windows machine and voila! it showed up alive and I was able to back up all my precious data.All in all, it was the enclosure problem, not the hard disk problem after all. I guess LaCie needs to make the controller board strong enough for this kind of repetitious stressful jobs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Failed after 14 months","review":"I bought this drive to backup my iMac.

Today, just after our six-month anniversary together, I lost all my movie/video files, amongst others. Never had much notice (besides the heating/humming that I had experienced since day 1), until I heard loud clicking when I turned the drive on this afternoon.I do not recommend this drive.

The LaCie is not only silent, beautiful and cool (thermally speaking), it has a very unobtrusive power-on light. Some external drives have LEDs that can light a room, this one is very subtle.

I decided to purchase it, even though it was \\"lst years model\\", whatever that means! I am sorry, but the \\"newer\\" LaCie was quieter, could be stored vertically, but it was also $70 more. For what? I don't think this drive is loud, and it sits on top of my desktop box. Sohorizontal or vertical is a moot issue. It is fast, and works great. And I have $70 more in my pocket.

The research I've done tells me that this is indicative of a failed board in the case, so the case is totaled. I'll have to extract the drive itself and put it in another enclosure.So yeah, Epic Fail for Lacie. Big pain in the posterior for me, since now I have to do surgery on this box to get the drive out and hopefully recover my files. However, it's good to take a lesson away from every disappointment.

Now when I plug it in the light turns on to show it has power. Then it smells like something's burning. Pressing the power button does nothing. My computer can't see the drive.

I took it apart (being a bit of a geek) and attached it to a laptop using a special adapter cable kit; it worked fine so I recovered the data. What failed was the electronics in the enclosure, not the drive itself so I can re-use the drive in a new enclosure.

Not knowing what the problem was (enclosure SATA interface vs. power supply cable problem) I debated with getting a new power supply cord ($20+$10 shipping) from Lacie website or just buying a new USB SATA external hard drive enclosure ($20). I opted for the 2nd option, removed the Seagate 500GB drive from the Lacie enclosure & fortunately all my data was recognized & did not have to reformat. Lacie Porsche was a nice looking enclosure but what's the point if it doesn't longer than a few years?"},{"rating":"1","title":"LaCie, great drives with terrible power bricks","review":"I'm done with LaCie drives. The power bricks are the Achilles heel of Lacie peripherals. I've had 2 hard drives and 2 optical drives at home. The power bricks have all failed within 3 years. At work we have a backup server with 6 Lacie 1TB drives. We have gone through a dozen or two power bricks. Every time one goes bad the drive unmounts or has errors and the server hangs. That is totally unacceptable in a mission critical system. Sometimes the drives get data corruption when the power supplies fail. I would advise everybody to avoid Lacie products like the plague, unless you can find a more reliable power source. Their products look cool but power bricks are low rent. A proper drive has a built in supply and an IEC power cord. Not a cheap power brick. I'm spending the extra money for Glyph drives in places I can't afford frequent failures."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Perfect, but Lacie stands behind their product","review":"Coming from a Mac publishing environment where only Lacie is used, I purchase Lacie at home, too.

I purchase Lacie because they have a two year warranty on their product, great tech support, and they stand behind their product. These 500 GB drives have a problem with their power supplies, but Lacie will be happy to ship you a new one. Their drives work great with both Macs and PC's. The true measure of a company is not how perfect their product is, but how well they handle things with something goes wrong.

But LaCie has other thoughts. Put some cheap hardware together and sell it. I have been using computers since the Radio Shack Model 1 days. And in that time I have never ever had a hard drive fail. Even so I thought a back up would be a good idea. My system using the LaCie would back up once a week at 6am. After three months the drive fails, turns into a door stop. Now I know I can send it back for warranty repair but all they are going to do is put the same undependable hardware back into it. So, whats the point. Look for another product and read the reviews which I didn't do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dusty-----","review":"I can't get it to do anything.

It was amazing! I never had a single problem, except that I ran out of space. Upgrading to LaCie, the thing took 30 hours, (count them, 30!) to transfer 100 gigs of music. The power button is a stupid feature. If you're plugged in, I want to use you. Also, the chords that come with it are flimsy. Plus it's loud, and makes my desk vibrate. If this is made by Porsche, I'd never buy one of their cars! Go with Maxtor instead, even if it's more expensive. Everyone I know swears by Maxtor. I do too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buen disco / Un poco calenturiento!","review":"Me parece una muy buena adquisición, a un precio más que razonable. Creo que es agradable, el tamaño es excelente, lo he usado poco pero creo que tiene buen rendimiento, en él realicé el backup de 5 equipos que tengo. Funciona perfecto con mac OSX, pues no tengo PCs y lo he conectado en todos ellos y no he tenido problemas. Lo único que me preocupa algunas veces es que cuando trabaja mucho, se alcanza a calentar un poco, nada de que asustarse, pero alcanza a ponerme a pensar. Me gusta mucho su aspecto y su tamaño. Lo recomiendo y creo que es una buena compra, aunque últimamente he pensado en comprar a la próxima uno en versión FireWire, pues los 2 eMac que tengo tienen USB 1.0, pero FireWire 400 así que me iría mejor con la transmisión de datos, que estoy seguro será mucho más eficiente."},{"rating":"1","title":"STAY AWAY!

I was looking for a drive to hang off my new Airport Extreme, to share files between multiple Macs and PCs in my home office. First, I connected it to a Mac and reformatted the drive (Mac OS Extended/HFS+). Then, I hooked it up to the Airport. Then, I copied about 90 GB of files from my XP SP2 Machine. Later that day, I powered off the Airport, then I powered off the Porsche. Next day, reversed the order, and the Porsche had exactly 0 files and 0 bytes. All files. gone!I don't have time for that. Porsche indeed. I should have known better; I've always found German cars unreliable too.I wish there was a USB drive out there that was reliable.

Not this drive. I actually LIKE looking at it on my desktop. Sure it's not lightening fast but what USB external backup drive is? I didn't buy it for speed. I bought it to back up my files which it does just fine. I have now purchased three of these drives and I'm happy with every one of them.Yes, if you want to store files larger than 4 Gb the drive must be formatted to NTFS from FAT32.Other than that, the drive worked just as it was advertised and it's one of the most elegant pieces of hardware on my desktop.I bought it through Amazon.com and the price was very competitive. I feel this drive represents a good value if you're looking for a large, good looking backup drive."},{"rating":"2","title":"overall fine","review":"Overall it's a good product except for two things:1. the USB is way too short, a little bit over 1 foot. LaCie, what areyou talking about? it probably costs you only one dollar to add someextra length. The whole point of an external hard drive is itsportability and a short cable doesn't give you that.2. USB interface, dc power, and power switch are put all one side, butthe LED indicator is on the other side. Again, dear designers, haveyou ever tried to work with your own stupid design?

I got a quick response, within 24 hours, over Thanksgiving weekend. Turns out it was just Time Machine (Mac Backup) doing something odd (backing up the whole drive every time).

I paid just a few dollars more to buy this springform with the carrying case (or, as I use it, as a storage case for my cheesecakes in the fridge). It's very handy and guests are always curious when I pull the cheesecake out and take off the top. Nice presentation for an informal dinner! I was a little worried about the glass bottom in this springform, but it's very sturdy and so far has held up great. It's also easy to slide the cheesecake from the pan. All in all, this is a good purchase and looks to me like it will last for a long time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good form pan for transporting cheesecake","review":"The only problem I have is that I had a minor crack in my cheesecake with this pan and this has not happened with my other metal Kaiser form pan.

The multi-colored pictures are stunning and I can't wait to see what he has up his sleeve next."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leftovers","review":"As Royo's work goes this book does not live up to his usual standard.

The images in it are incredbly beautiful, but the text seems to be a little bit over the top, and ever silly at times. This is a nice book of illustrated erotica, but I usually find myself ignoring the words and just appreciating the artwork."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could be much better","review":"The artwork that is in the book is interesting but the number of larger artworks is disappointing, most are small. The book itself is thin and small.

You would know, or else why check out the reviews to 'double-check'? His finished pieces are amazing, as you can see on covers of his books, but is it worth getting? Hmm... Well I bought it and liked it for the first 5 minutes, but afterwards regretted owning it.It's a thin book without much paintings. You see sketches and ideas that was flowing through him at the time, but not much to be satisfied. It's not something you would carry and impress others with.Just be prepared to be impressed and ending up ebaying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really like Royo, but this left a lot to be desired","review":"I've been a big fan of Luis Royo's work since I started purchasing his books. I like his style of fantasy art and I think he's very talented. That being said, I was rather disappointed with this album and would just as soon not have it as part of my collection. There wasn't much to this book, the pictures were small, and although I like seeing some of the starting sketches progress to a more finished product this book seemed to be nothing but what I wasn't looking for. If you're new to Luis Royo, I would not suggest this book to start. Start with Dark Labyrinth, Subversive Beauty, Visions, or Malefic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Black Face for the 21st century","review":"This figure is pure Americana and in the future will be a sought after action figure that says a lot about the times and our involvement in second gulf war. I can't be offended but I could see how others would see this as offensive. Personally I think it's cool and reminds me of the highly sought after black face dolls and memorabilia from the turn of the century. This figure is sculpted with a look on his face of pure hatred and as if he is yelling. I've never seen another figure like it (except for the other Modern Military Eastern Warrior figure by the same line) and don't expect to see any others like it, they do make two different figures of an Eastern Warrior. If you are an action figure collector, you need this for you collection, it's history and dates the time in which we live in a way that shows how little we've come over the last one hundred years, in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great.","review":"Very hard to keep the guy's hat on his head and the rifle in his hands.

When her life is uprooted and she moves to Texas with her money hungry mother, she learns the hard way how things are done in the Coleman family. This book concentrates on how the many trials in Billie's life shape her as a person. I agree that this is a very intense emotional romance, and although I was left crying and sad, it was superbly written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing!!","review":"I don't know why I even finished reading this book!

I really think this book has given me a mood of depression!!\\"I can't believe there are books in the series that follow.

And of course scenes from season one repeat every year in best moments from old shows episodes--I guess the writers ran out of perfect murders in the plot that week.

Bree considered cheating on her unfaithful husband as payback... but didn't. I wish she had.

The majority of the women have been cheated on by their husbands (Susan/Karl, Bree/Rex, and it's implied that Tom cheated on Lynette at one point) and none of the women have enough self-respect to leave the husbands.

But from what I've seen, the opening title sequence really is fantastic artistically. And I can see it in my head like it exists already what the DVD packaging SHOULD look like: the same kind of clear plastic as \\"Sex & The City\\" where it folds. And it should be covered with the Adam and Eve-type of art from the opening, like Hieronymous Bosch's art (Garden of Earthly Delights). It should focus on the large apples and the nude figures with the figs/bushes/trees. This would be fantastic packaging. Don't you think??"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disgrace to America","review":"These women Desperate Housewives give real life women a bad name and also a bad influnce on them. Shows like this is the reason why women don't respect men right now. It's such a sad world that women do nothing but stab men in the back and not show remorse for it. As far as this show goes the only time I see brief nudity is when one fo the wives was locked out side of her house naked and the other wife who is latin was in the bath tumb with a teenage boy.

First Season is a Gem...","review":"When a new show with fresh new ideas come out, it's reason to Celebrate! In the same way \\"Moonlighting\\" and \\"Northern Exposure\\" broke a mold, so does Desperate Housewives. Each episode is so well crafted and the dialog so witty, you can watch again and again and still find new stuff to enjoy. The mystery surrounding the neighborhood is only the beginning to this story as every housewife have their own comical lives to deal with. It's also not a cream-puff show as murders are shown with shocking clarity (Paul kills the meddling neighbor by smashing her head in!) and dark humor weaves itself in each episode.The magnificent cast is perfectly tailored for each wife. From the ditzy Teri Hatcher to the wonderful Marcia Cross, each lady brings a certain something to the screen.Part Soap Opera, part Dramady and all fun, this show is a winner.

I had missed a lot of episodes and this filled in the gaps. The show is hilarious, witty, intense and dramatic all at the same time!The commentaries by Marc Cherry are excellent as are the other bonus features.

I find that as much as I love the episodes on TV, I enjoy them even more on DVD. The episodes flow well, are ten times more enrapturing without the commercials, and are of a high quality. The extras are fun, especially Bree's multicultural dinner party where you hear the characters talking in a variety of languages, and I love the extended episodes. It's interesting to see what you've missed with cut scenes, and the extra scenes add a whole new dimension and further your understanding of the sordid goings-on of Wisteria Lane. They've also done an excellent job of packaging the DVDs, and while there may be six of them they're easy to keep track of. I'd recommend this DVD set to any Desperate Housewives aficionado, or anyone who's seen an episode here and there and wants to get started on the series.

(jewel casing coming off of the cardboard, broken disc holders - the discs kept falling out).. maybe they should rethink their marketing strategies, not to mention pay a litttttle more attention to product detail and quality. because whereas this is a great show, they're bumping down my enthusiasm about it with crappy products."},{"rating":"2","title":"The women of Wisteria Lane.","review":"Desperate Housewives - The complete First Season is delightfully wicked. Creator Marc Cherry (The Golden Girls) is a genius, what a fabulous show he has created.

Boy was I wrong, I decided to give this \\"watercooler\\" show a chance and I was hooked from the first episode. I love the second season just as much. Marcia Cross's brilliant character Bree Van De Kamp is a hoot. Bree is so complex and desperate to be the perfect wife and mother but she fails miserably of course. Felicity Huffman is outstanding as well as Lynn. Great cast even though I am not a big fan of Teri Hatcher, otherwise than that, Desperate Housewives will have you begging for more.

Totally worth buying if you like a well written show, with a lot of mystery; love; comedy, drama and action. The cast is amazing and work very well together. It was a pleasant suprise to see that the acting was very good. This show is not how it appears or comes off. The comedy springs from the fact that it is written similar to a soap opera at times.

This and \\"Lost\\" were my two favorite new shows of the year.However, when the press release came out, it indicated that, although this was filmed in HD Widescreen(aspect ratio: 1:78:1), it was indeed being CROPPED to a lousy and inexcusable 1:33:1(Fullscreen.

The factory packaging was inadequate to protect the pump, but the worst part is that the oil fill plug installed by the factory was cross-threaded and loose resulting in a serious oil leak that saturated the box and instruction manual. A call to the factory resulted in returning the pump to Amazon; the factory rep told me that the pump was tested prior to ship, but that because of the loose oil fill plug the pump likely had water in the motor housing. Poor factory QC - Shame on Zoeller.As for the Amazon packaging - another example of poor packaging for heavy items. The factory boxed pump shucked around in the Amazon box because of inadequate box filler.

It is pretty heavy and the impeller and casing is all steel. VERY high quality and worth every penny. It's still chugging away in my basement since I bought it with no problems.

The climactic chase scene (SPOILER ALERT!) features an overweight, alcoholic detective lumbering after an 80-year-old senior citizen, and STILL takes up two pages!

What a lucky break - this book is character driven and even though you immediately realize that this is an ongoing series the book stands alone.

Flip is the daughter of a prominent London banker, so as with any high profile case, the police are under intense scrutiny, and there are many leads to follow. Add to this a tiny wooden coffin containing a doll found in a place called The Falls. The author started up several different storylines and never tied them together. The different storylines contained the same cast of characters, but there didn't seem to be any particular order or focus to the story. I found all the characters very dreary (including the protagonist and his comrades), which made for a very hard to read book.

Highly Recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Interesting","review":"A very readable translation of the Volsung Saga by the distinguished scholar Jesse Byock. An important source for considerable later work, notably Wagner's Ring Cycle, the Sage of the Volsungs is enjoyable in its own right. Featuring considerable supernatural and mythic elements, and a strong sense of fatalism, the Saga of the Volsungs is different from Sagas like Njal's Saga which feature Icelandic society around the time the Sagas were written down. Its also interesting to compare this Saga with the Nibelungenlied, the medieval German epic based on the same story. Many of the differences reflect the differences between the social world of medieval Iceland and feudal southern Germany. This edition features a nice introduction by Byock providing the history of the text and historical context. The footnotes and glossary are excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"better choice available","review":"My original review still stands. I am amending it in the following manner:There are better translations and better introduction volumes. I would recommend Kaaren Grimstad's translation from the Icelandic text. It has benefit of being a duo language volume with the old Norse and English translation side by side and the introduction is WAY better than Byock's. Further, the translation seems smoother and more correct from the Norse.It maybe a little bit difficult to acquire but Grimstad is the volume to work with for both advanced and beginning students of this saga. It includes genealogy charts and notes.Get Byock used if you can."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tip of the iceberg","review":"This book is essentially a paraphrased summary of everything involving the Volsung line that appears in either the poetic and prose Edda. It contains a number of stories about a number of family members in chronological order. This particular saga seems to have been one of Tolkien's favorites because all of the basic elements of his famous Lord of the Rings series are here. The cursed ring of power, the broken sword reforged, the corrupt line of kings with their heroic descendant, even the slaying of the dragon. Well worth the read through. VERY SIMPLE language but still entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Translation","review":"Jesse Byock's translation of the Völsungasaga manages to be both faithful and readable (not as common a combination as you might think), and it strikes a nice balance in its use of only the most important footnotes (a little more than 100 over the course of the saga). These are usually etymological / onomastic in nature, which was very much to my liking. I would have preferred them to be actual footnotes rather than end notes, actually, but that's just a quibble about having to flip back and forth while reading. Not a big problem, really. The slim volume also packs a great deal of essential historical context into a small but excellent introduction. There's also a nice glossary of most of the proper nouns, and this connects the Anglicized spelling with the original Old Norse forms, which can be helpful for those readers unfamiliar with the orthography. A great edition of an Old Norse classic!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Regrettably Bland Translation","review":"I have discovered that Mr. Byock's translation is regrettably bland. It appears that he translates word-for-word, which gives the English prose a clumsy, \\"summarizing\\" kind of a feel.The translation lacks a beautiful, flowing quality that might emerged had he tried to portray the spirit of the work through his own personal, subjective experience. Said again, he should have taken personal \\"ownership\\" of the story and written it in modern English according to his own inner feeling -- richly imagining the events and meaning, and then writing a faithful, but new story.Instead, he rather logically translates word-for-word, with seemingly little care for the poetic quality of the tale. Thus the reading is bulky and unimaginative.I believe that portraying one's own inner experience of a story is more \\"valid\\" than a scientifically-accurate rendering of it. Although the text is clear, to a fault, I was disappointed with it.I recommend a different translation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless","review":"Bought this to try and remove two hard to reach nuts on my car.

Marie of the Trinity tells many stories about Therese not recorded elsewhere, and the study of her relationship with Therese is itself endlessly fascinating. Insights into daily life at Lisieux Carmel; interesting account of life at Carmel from 1897-1944. Read about the dream Therese had about 1896 which she confided to Marie of the Trinity; she dreamt of a celebration for her in a field, like a cemetery, yet festive, and told Marie that sooner or later they would find out what the dream meant. In March 1923, the solemn translation of Therese's relics from Lisieux cemetery to the Carmel took place, and Marie realized the dream had foreshadowed that event, in which 50,000 pilgrims followed the body of Sister Therese in its return to Carmel. It is easy to see why the testimony of Marie of the Trinity was important at the Process. Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Transformative indeed!","review":"I think that the non-religious who reads the things that Therese said and did with her sisters in community at the Lisieux Carmel may occasionally be intimidated. I know I am from time to time. Sometimes I am even confused, for there are some pieces of advice and counsel that would not do for a secular woman such as myself. But I thoroughly enjoyed this work, and the translation was superb. Through the compilation of the reminiscences, I was able to better see what it might have been like to follow Therese around, listen to her, go to her in tears, question my vocation. I am grateful for this glimpse and I believe I have a better understanding of the way Therese taught.

Having been taught the embracing the tree posture by a teacher who learned it in China, I can say that there are aspects of doing this posture that probably can only be learned from someone with significant experience in China.

In fact, it reveals many truths about how to see the world and live in it - honestly, lovingly, etc.There are a few references to servitude, and the book definitely puts men in charge, but if you read it as everyone being servants (to God, Jesus, fellow man, etc.) and masters (of self), you can view it in another light.Anyway, this is a deep read and is recommended for anyone who wants to understand themselves better.

I have only turned one small, lidded box, thus far. Already, I love the lathe! The lathe is extremely quiet, smooth-running and well-built. It has plenty of power for its capacity. Well, the lathe isn't perfect. I would prefer the on-off switch to be on the left side and I would rather have the Jet's belt-changing access door located on the front of the machine, but neither of these minor ergonomic shortcomings would keep me from buying the lathe.

The recipies are kinda long, but it's easy enough to follow. My fav in the book - 'Pock Marked Ma's Bean Curd'. The one recipie that opened my eyes to the fact tofu can be really, really tastey when the dish is well spiced and given the time to absorb the flavors around it (I think its even better and hotter the next day.)The hot and sour soup is also excellent -- more like a stew and completely unlike anything I've had in a run of the mill 'chinese food' place.My sister picked this book up first and one thing she regularly altered was cutting the oil in the recipies, about in half in most instances. Also, for recipies that ask for ground pork, grinding pork loin steaks (fat trimmed) gets you excellent flavor but less fat.When a recipie asks for fresh water chestnuts, I'd suggest not using canned. The flavor is completely different. Fresh jicima might be a better substitute if you can't get fresh water chestnuts."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING!","review":"I absolutely love this game!

It only took moments and I was able to check out all of the programs.

I've tried many variations on that routine, all with the same result. It will work only while plugged into a wall socket.I've searched the documenation, thinking maybe there's another part needed. I found no answers. It's certainly not portable in this condition.2. Connectivity. The USB hookup is extremely unreliable. I can get it to hold for only a few seconds at a time. It is impossible to synchronize it with either the desk top computer or with an on-line source such as Audible.com.3. Memory. I tried 16MB, 64MB, 128MB. The device would recognize none of them.4.

The voice recorder works pretty well in recording lectures in my classes. However, taking note with the IPAQ is a pain, with its limited sized screen and difficulty in erasing or editing parts of the handwritten note. The other thing need to be awared of is that IPAQ need to be cleaned with care. If you clean the screen too hard you will get dusts in the screen and it would require you to send the unit to the Compaq service center to have them clean it for you. But it is all free. If you ordered the carepaq warranty service($49 per year, $99 for 3 years). You will receive a brand new unit shipped to you overnight if you ever need to have your IPAQ serviced."},{"rating":"1","title":"Energy Crisis","review":"The iPAQ is a great machine if you only need to use it a few minutes here and there. Anything more requires frequent recharging. There's no going on business trips without the charger. Frankly, for the price I expected better. The screen is pretty, but I can't say I'm thrilled with the tradeoff... I'd rather use a monochrome device that still has juice when it's needed. It's embarrassing to whip out this hi-tech gadget only to have to borrow a scrap of paper to write down a phone number.I'm sticking with it for now, but I'm definitely on the look out for something that suits my needs better. Toshiba has just announced a Pocket PC that might be worthwhile if the battery life beats the iPAQ, Palm is planning on moving to more powerful ARM processors, and Compaq itself will have to keep on the move to compete.For now, if you're looking for a handheld that'll fit in your pocket and run all week on a charge, you'll need to look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"i like what i got","review":"what i needed i got it there..i had a limited amount of money so i got this one...and it gives me satisfaction...i use it to play mp3s or WAM files beside using it for workrecieved it on time and the packaging was good"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great pocket PC.","review":"The Ipaq is in my mind the top of the line PDA.

I have already subjected my unit to a battery stress test by using it for 13 continuous hours. Usage included several alarms at full volume, and 2 continuous hours of backlight opperation before the low power warning was issued.This is a CE unit that will not require steady use of the charger!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Buy in PDA's Available","review":"I have recently purchaced this great product.

At first, I was concerned that having a black and white screen would bother me, but it works great! Also, to get a similar color version you would have to spend a good amount more and all those I could find had problems with battery life or something similar.

(I also discontinued web access on my cell phone after trying it for a while, but that's another story.)I'm back to my Palm V and very happy-- it is extremely fast and proficient at the stuff I do want with me-- my schedule and my contact list.

Eventually, it runs out of memory, and themachine crashes, requiring the machine to be reset. It isentirely unrelated to any add-ins running (I uninstalledthem all). Honestly, I can't tell if this is an iPAQ erroror a Microsoft operating system error (it is vaguely reminiscentof an Excel error a few years back), but it makes no differenceto me, as the result is the same.

It's been a portable gaming system, a MP3 player, a movie player, an electronic notebook, and more. The organizer that comes with the iPaq is great, though I am using a 3rd party software organizer which I purchased and downloaded online.If you couple the iPaq with a large CF card, you can put movies on them and watch your favorite Simpsons episode or even a DivX movie if you re-encode it to a smaller size.

I have a lot of friends who have Palm devices and my Ipaq seems to have more capablities than their Palm. The only problem I have found is that finding software for the Windows CE operating system is very difficult. As well as the fact that if you can find software for Windows CE it is not compatiable with the Arm processor. I am assuming with time this will change. The only other thing I would love to have is a color screen, but you can't beat what you get for the price.

However, beware that, since this is not an official Bruce Springsteen DVD, there are no original Springsteen interviews and no Springsteen music. There is one pre-recorded interview with Bruce from the 80s. A few of Springsteen's closest friends, including Vini Lopez, are interviewed, and they provide good insight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip it","review":"Cheap doccumentary, that's the truth here.At least it's a honest merchandise, because it makes it clear that this is totally unauthorized.

There are a few good spins but most of the book is a waste of paper. The author clearly didn't have enough substance to fill up a book, so he used extra large font and lots of empty space between things to make the book span enough pages to call it a \\"book.\\" The entire second half of the book wasn't even about drumstick spinning, it contained stupid jokes about drumsticks!

The problem for the researcher is that it is long out of print and used copies are difficult to find and very pricey. This book, published in 1976 is essentially a scholarly presentation of the Venetian Index,with comments,that is more accessible to the amateur historian. I'm very glad to have it as I prepare for my visit to Venice in September of this year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the price just to see La Fenice, restored!","review":"This is an excellent series to gain basic knowledge of Venice. I've searched for several years for a documentary that shows La Fenice, in detail. For that reason alone, this series surpassed my expectations. It's well photographed and very good. My only major complaint is the sound balance - I listened to the DVD's both through a stereo system and through a 5.1 sound system. In both cases, the music drowned out much of the dialogue - so I missed some of the commentary. Also - I REALLY didn't need to see footage of the stiff looking Peter Ackroyd, limping around Venice!"},{"rating":"1","title":"inaudible!","review":"although the footage is quite pretty, the narrator's voice is barely heard..the background music is so loud, it drowns him out! also, his accent is very thick, and it's tough to understand him..his books are probably better."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING","review":"It was a suggested reading from school...I read it with my 8 year old.

It didn't. Poe could have done the first 3rd of the book in 3 pages. Nor did I find the riddles engaging.I found it to be a adolescent male fantasy unredeemed by any but the shallowest reflection.Romance - I don't think so. I, who long to see the Greek Isles, found no charm in the descriptions.Relationships - Not. The only relationships in the book are with one's self. There was no honest communication with another in the entire novel. Was that the point?The novel suffers terribly from its 1960's setting. Yea, I know it was post-war, but it has 1960's all over it."},{"rating":"1","title":"rip off","review":"This book was old and why did it end up costing me $11?

This being the last book we read, I thought it would be the best. WRONG!!! It makes no sense! It is total crap, especially the last chapter. If it had ended with chapter 61, I would have been fine with it. I think Nicolas would have turned out alright then. But no, it didn't, and now he's messed up.

The reader is invited to play a psychological chess with Conchis and Fowles."},{"rating":"2","title":"The modern classic","review":"Having read The Magus at least ten times, it remains the most complex, thought-provoking, essential book, constantly requiring the reader to adapt his or her approach and perceptions with every reading. It is a cliche of the classic to say it has many levels, attainable depending on the emotion, background, gender and intelligence of the audience; yet for this book it is no more than the truth.I urge every lover of literature to buy and dedicate themselves to reading The Magus. It quite simply doesn't get better than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Weekends At Bourani","review":"\\"Do you drink the water or the wave?\\" This is one of my favorite books of all time. Do we control our lives or not? And why do our hearts behave the way they do? What really is the balance between heart and mind? Odd things happen when we travel to unknown places, and in fleeing a London love affair to a remote Greek island, Nicholas Urfe learns more about his personal morality than he ever wanted to know. Classical music and art, all the implications of the Tarot, and the search for a true definition of love figure largely. A very crude film of this was made with Michael Caine and Anthony Quinn. Time to try again. The novel is fascinating, maddening, and finally, truly liberating. You will feel cleaner than you have in many years after you read this, preferably in the summer, on a beach. I envy you the journey."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me","review":"I really disliked this book, which I found longwinded, pretentious, fraudulant and in the end silly. But I'm unreasonably bitter towards it since I stopped enjoying it inside the first hundred pages, yet continued to struggle through the remaining 500 or so pages towards the ending.Nonetheless, I know a lot of people who loved this book. They were more accepting then I was of the themes of space- and time-travel and mind-expansion that the novel touches on...If you are interested in a clever novel of ideas and history, and can put up with a lot of trickiness and would-be profoundity from the author, then you might enjoy this book. Just try to remember that \\"The Magus\\" is neither as clever nor as profound as it thinks it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"What?","review":"The first review on this page right now is one saying to read the original first, because the edited one makes no sense. Unfortunately, I read this review after I'd already read the edited one. I have to agree, it makes absolutely no sense. This book was recommended to me by a friend who said it was his favorite. Either he read the unedited one or he saw something I didn't!This book was mildly interesting for probably the first 300 pages or so, but I hate books that intentionally keep the reader completely in the dark. I kept reading, assuming it was going to eventually get to a point. Unless I completely missed it, there was never any point made. I wouldn't recommend this book to my worst enemy."},{"rating":"1","title":"first book this year I couldn't make myself finish","review":"I didn't care about the characters. The plot dragged intolerably. I always finish books, but just couldn't do it with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"magus revisited","review":"Perhaps the best thing about Fowle's revised edition of The Magus is his new introduction, in which he discusses the novel in some detail. Since its original publication 35 years ago, The Magus has inspired legions of fans and no small number of readers who are still asking, \\"What was that?\\" Having read both versions, I prefer the latter, but there is not a huge difference between the two. The new introduction, however, provides some fascinating insights into a novel that continues to amaze and perplex readers, including this one. If you haven't read it yet, I strongly recommend The Magus. But be prepared - the novel will lull you in with lush descriptions of the Greek Isles before blowing your mind with Urfe's bizarre encounter with intrigue, betrayal, and ultimately (perhaps?) redemption."},{"rating":"2","title":"My second time through","review":"The first time I read the Magus, I was in college. I thought the book was way too long and a bit confusing. Since my first reading however, I find myself referring to the book often. 25 years later I find myself reading it again, comparing my life, its joys, its miseries and wondering to what I owe these experiences to. For a young person, it is a great look into the future, and for an older person a great way to reflect upon our own lives."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Most Powerful Book I Have Read","review":"This book is not for everyone. As others have said, it is perplexing, and at times frustrating. But it is the most exciting, rewarding, and profound book I have ever read. At one point, Conchis explains to the narrator that the novel is a dead and worthless art form because a reader must digest numerous pages to discover a single kernal of wisdom the author wishes to impart. Yet Fowles dramatically disproves that perception. This book is magnificently rich in ideas and concepts, and challenges our approach to everything we perceive as the narrator learns that nothing is as he sees it. If you don't \\"get\\" the ending, just realize that life is a continuum and there is no ending; that is the beauty of The Magus. I have read this book in both its versions at least 20 times. However, I must say that I prefer the original to the revised version."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Novelist's Study of the Tarot","review":"John Fowles's early novel was rewritten later in his career.Each chapter of this novel is connected to one of the cardsof the Tarot. Fowles rewrote the novel and published it afterhe had had greater success with French Lt. Woman and similarnovels.Made into a rather strange film, the Magus is worth a studyboth by occultists and students of literature. The fact thatthe author rewrote the book later in his career, gives an ideaof the change in vision of one of the Better Authors of ModernEnglish Literature."},{"rating":"2","title":"You'll either love it or throw it away...","review":"Fowles builds an elaborate game for his characters and for the reader. He often leads you astray into deadends. Just when you think you have it all figured out, you find out that you're wrong. That's all part of the fun. For those who like a neatly wrapped up package at the end of a book, this can be frustrating. For those who are fascinated by the game, this book is worth re-reading several times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deplorable","review":"After hearing so much about Fowles' masterpiece, I plodded through the first few chapters with the hope that I would reach the final chapter feeling rewarded and satisfied. Enlightened,even. I wasn't.What has disturbed me on so many levels, months after shelving the book, is the assumption that Nicholas' punishment fit his \\"crime.\\"Not once did I get the impression that he was madly in love with Allison and not once did I feel that she was somehow entitled to his love. Are we obligated to love every needy, fragmented, and troubled individual who enters our lives and professes to feel true love for us? Is it justifiable for a woman to conspire to torture a man, both mentally and physically, because he leaves her?Throughout the book, I pitied Nicholas and abhorred Allison. In the end, when the legion of psychopaths had finally managed to brainwash Nicholas into thinking that Allison was - alas - his one true love, I was struck by a wave of nausea. The premise? Deplorable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware the Waiting Room","review":"I felt rather cheated upon the completion of this novel. I felt I'd been taken advantage of by having to slog through 656 pages to get to such a weak and anemic ending. Don't get me wrong the writing is rather engaging, however, the PLOT is so long and convuluted it isn't worth the time I invested in the book. In my edition, in the preface, the author even discloses (In so many words) that he never really cared much for this novel, nor understood peoples' ardent love of it. I can understand that.Upon finishing the book I went to see how other people reviewed it and was pleasantly surprised that many had the same reaction that I did. I then realized I was on Amazon UK so then switched over to Amazon US. To my dismay American readers had nothing but GREAT reviews for this mediocre novel. So much for American sensibilities. It appears that we are still nothing more than a cultural colony of England. In literature at least."},{"rating":"1","title":"SAD AND REPULSIVE","review":"I picked this book up at my local Chapters Bookstore because I recognized the name John Fowles - an ex-boyfriend had taken me to see the movie \\"The French Lieutenant's Woman\\" many years before. I needed some distraction and was hoping to escape into a good story (a fire had recently been set in my apartment building). What a mistake!!! I found this book to be a repulsive exercise in sado-masochism. I felt physically ill at times while reading the descriptions of the cruelty inflicted upon the book's protagonist - the point of which seemed at the book's resolution to be coercing him into resuming a relationship with his ex-girlfriend. Profoundly creepy and disturbing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Manipulate the reader! Does he think we are all idiots?","review":"I hated this book. I had to read it for a college course, goodness knows why. I never felt more deliberately manipulated by an author than when reading this book. It is a negative statement about humanity. When I was done reading it, I threw it across the room. Disgusted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware!","review":"This is a cruel book.Both the protagonist, Nickolas, and I could have stopped the cruelty. He, by tuning away from the masque run by Conchis and his sadistic band, and I, by putting the book away. But, driven by our own hubris, we didn't stop it, and, in the end we were both utterly debased.Was the debasement worth it? Nickolas seems to have conceded that it was, but I'm not so sure. Some days I think it was and some days I think it wasn't. That uncertainty is the essence of the problem with recommending or not recommending this emotional battering ram of a book.If you're a detached, critical, and analytical reader this book won't harm you, and you may even be able to give it an objective rating. If you're an emotional reader (like me) however, all bets are off. The book will probably hurt you, and you will either hate it, or, in some perverse way, love it.I'm giving it no stars today, just because I'm very angry with the book at the moment."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Book of All Time","review":"The Magus is by far my favorite book of all time! This mystery, set in the isles of Greece, is riveting. Fowles writes with mastery and plays tricks on the reader that parallel the tricks being played on the main character. This is a long book, but you won't want it to end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like Being Hit with a Wet Bag of Sand","review":"This ode to misanthropy makes Paul Verhoeven look like Frank Capra. In fact, to paraphrase Terrence Rafferty's review of 'Total Recall', this is the sort of book that leaves you feeling as if the life had been pounded out of you, and you never wanted to turn a page again.Characters in this book are either smug, cryptic, enraged or confused. Calling them 'characters' flatters them, however; with the exceptions of the main character and the pompous git of a title character they show all the complexity and realness of cheezy androids from a 'Six Million Dollar Man' episode. In fact I think there *was* an episode like this, only in the end the island blew up. I devoutly wish that this had been the case at the end of the novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"i found you","review":"I read The Magus... probably a year ago. I have been waiting since then to pass it on to someone \\"worthy\\". I realized today, a worthy person would find no soul, no piece of his/her self in the pages of this book which I have worshipped as a bible of self for the last 365 days, give or take. See... I realized that you are exactly who I should be passing this novel onto. You, who read amazon.com book reviews to assure yourself that the average john doe can relate, can find meaning, entertainment. Haha, I found it the same way. Read this book, tear your self image out and spit on it, realize yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fat, filler, ballast, chaff. Some wheat.","review":"Too many words, Mr. Fowles! And you ain't Mozart. I don't quite recall a text so larded with mediocre word-painted landscapes or dead-nature pieces. Must we know the condition of every piece of vegetation in the 100-yard radius, and the appearance of every item of clothing worn by nameless characters? There may be a decent short story hiding beneath all that, although, as the author started hammering out his message in the \\"trial\\" scene, I saw only a strained attempt at Jungian shrink-work, not at all a sharp and relevant choice about human freedom. Read this, if you care, for its few psychological insights, and a few memorable characterizations. The plot, the moral vision, and the prose all are negatives, I believe. Now, Master and Margarita is a different story..."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite book","review":"I love this book. I recommend it to everyone I care about. I think the journeys this book takes your mind on are incredible. I will always thank my old English teacher, Mr. Voorhees, for recommending this book to me, it's his favorite too. When you read it though, give it at least 100 pages becuase it starts out slow, and by about 60 pages starts to pick up the mental pace. Challenge the way you perceive reality, read this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fantastic journey though Greece and definitions of reality","review":"I read this book in philosophy in college 20 years ago. Recently it appeared on the San Francisco Chronicle's 100 best novels of the last 100 years. I searched everwhere and found it here on Amazon.com.This is truly an enigmatic foray into definitions of reality. The story unfolds as the protagonist moves to a Greek Isle ... that's when the the story truly takes you away on a really interesting path of twists and turns.I agree that this is one of the best novels of the past decade. Kudos to John Fowles for this masterpiece.Valerie Harris"},{"rating":"1","title":"An attempt at heaviness that shouldn't fool anyone","review":"This is one of the worst books I've read in 20 years. Maybe the symbolism and mysticism were too heavy for my intellect. Then again, maybe I demand that authors possess the basic skills to render complicated subjects comprehensible and, at the very least, readable. I can picture Fowles grinding out this piece of pretentious tripe utterly convinced that he was fashioning a work of depth and mystery. Nope. He produced a book devoid of engaging plot lines, interesting characters or believable scenes. If you loved Carlos Castaneda's \\"Don Juan\\" series, this is the book for you. Don't be fooled into thinking it's a great book because it leaves you baffled. That's the mark of a poor book, not a good one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Literature","review":"I have read this book several times as I never found another great story like this : bachelor meets stewardess, loves her but acts like an idot by lying to himself (and her). He takes on a teacher's job in Greece and gets to know a mysterious rich man, the Magus. The Magus tries - at great expense - to get the protagonsist's brain straight by exposing him to several layers of reality, you never know quite what is real and what not, kind of a male Alice in Wonderland. The end does not suggest the protagonist got the lesson but it's wonderful to read as John Fowles manages at ease to take you away from here and now."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Magus","review":"F. Scott Fitzgerald once described himself as the best second rate writer in the world. Of John Fowles, Martin Amis wrote in 'The War Against Cliche' that he is a middlebrow writer who sometimes hopes he is a highbrow. The difference is Fitzgerald wasn't equating second rate with middlebrow.I wouldn't put Fowles in the same category as a writer but as an idea novelist he warrants some merit for creating this original and ambitious psychodrama. Even when he employs artifice, Fowles is creative and imaginative. His descriptions of the islands of Greece are impressive.I recommend the hardcover Modern Library edition by Random House. It contains the new 1998 author's Introduction."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is a Roller Coaster Ride up a Mesa","review":"The entrance of Conchis is stunning, confusing. The inventiveness of the situation occuring on Phraxos makes one unable to put the book down, as a single question burns. \\"Why is the millionaire staging such a costly and elaborate event?\\" Is there a connection with time travel, other worlds, or another particular reason he must do this? The rollercoaster keeps moving UP and UP...... ....AND WE NEVER FIND OUT WHY! I invested a weekend in this baby, after seeing it featured on the Amazon front page. I don't think this book warranted the rave...neuh neuh neuh!"},{"rating":"1","title":"starts strong, ends lame","review":"The best thing I got from this book is some insight into the psyche of a selfish guy...Not much else. The first third of the novel makes big promises which fall completely flat at the end. Fowles manages to escape giving the book a satisfactory conclusion, and it's obvious that the lack of an ending is more artistic inadequacy than artistic technique.The descriptions of the settings are good and have some atmosphere, but it isn't really worth reading for that alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"668 Pages of Blah Blah Blah !!","review":"Arrogant, self-important, self-absorbed, delusional jerk goes to Greece, gets caught in a mystery, and finally learns punish people who wrong him.

Maybe if I hadn't had any expectations before starting it, I would have appreciated it more. But then again, maybe not. It does say on the back cover that this is considered a modern classic, which makes me despair about the quality of modern literature. The story is inprobable, the psychological analysis is mediocre. The book would have worked better with the original title, \\"The Godgame\\", which would at least provide a motive for the long 680 pages of reading. In other words, it would have explained from the start that I was going to witness the game played by rich, spoiled people with a lot of time on their hands. I don't watch soap, and this is hardly any better. If you're looking to read a classic, this is a waste of time. If distraction is what you're after, then it's an OK book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too long, no ending.","review":"1) Too long.

But is it worth reading? Although the prose was beautiful, it was too often bogged down at the worst times. Whenever Nick would find a clue or find himself in trouble, I'd get so excited and read on and on, but all of a sudden find myself reeling in heavy handed interior monologue. I've been told these rambling thoughts and run on descriptions are simply the author's way of showing the character's immaturity. Fine, but I started to get annoyed with Nick, and soon I wanted him tied up, flogged, and feathered. I found him to be a very weak foil used to point out human weakness; any well conceived character would've had a clue by the first 200 pages to hoist up the white flag and call it a day. For that matter the reader should too, or else skim the first 150 pages, read 100, skim 100, read some more to catch on, skim a bit, and then read the last five."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huh?","review":"This book is so annoying. It makes no sense. It gets 2 stars rather than 1 only because it IS interesting. Its like watching a train wreck. Sure, its disgusting and a total horror, however you can't pry yourself away. You get lured in by the promise of a nice story then you get stomped ALL OVER THE LAST 100 PAGES!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A lot of hot air in search of a story","review":"Even Fowles seemed to have been sucked in by some of his reviews, to read his preface to this novel, in which he compares himself to Dickens. None of the characters in this story are memorable. This is the first book I ever threw away. I got to about page 500 and this book ignores all the requirements of the code of the story. The main character is not only not especially likeable, he is no hero and undergoes no arc of character. Don't waste your time or your money. This is the first book Fowles wrote, and while he had the decency not to foist it off on the public until he had 4 or 5 best sellers to his credit, it is a total sham."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Magus","review":"The book was definitely in readable shape, and as that was all I was looking for, it was perfect, and a heck of a lot cheaper than a new copy !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Complex and enthralling","review":"I picked up this book based on the recommendation of a friend, and despite 2 false starts after getting past the 100th page I was absorbed and completed it in 2 days. It is amazing, I'm not going nay more in depth cause I just wanted to rate it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"Personally, I thought the book was not worth reading. Parts of the book were in another language with no translations, the ending was disappointing, and I had the feeling there was supposed to be some kind of a point to the whole thing but found none."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Psychological Mess","review":"\\"A man trapped in a millionaire's deadly game of political and sexual betrayal. . .\\" What the hell are they talking about? The only thing trapped in this long-winded, slow-motion, so-called suspense novel is the reader! (Did I mention long-winded?) The reader, dragged through hundreds of pages of meaningless innuendo accompanied by pretentious pseudo-eroticism, cries out \\"For the love of God, GET ON WITH IT!\\" Perhaps the most entertaining bit of this 600+(!) page tome is the setting - mysterious, bucolic, etc., altogether well-chosen for what Fowles was (presumably) trying to achieve in his novel. Nevertheless, a good setting alone cannot rescue this overrated work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me","review":"The very first pages had me thinking, \\"Hmm, this is pretty well written\\". Into the second half of the book I began to get frustrated with it. Some parts I liked. But it got to the point where I kept on reading just to find out what the hell this story, this book, was all about. At one point, things got so ludicrous, I was thinking \\"What the hell am I reading?\\". And the ending, when I finally got to it, left me dissatisfied and feeling deceived, and I was not altogether surprised by that.This is a book which sets you up, makes you wonder what is going on, keeps you turning the pages in search of answers, and essentially repeats this pattern ad nauseum, dragging you on, until, at long last you reach the end of the book, with nothing at all explained. A literary wild goose chase.I have a tendency to keep most books I've read, but this one is easily going to a second-hand bookstore. I felt the book and the author wasted my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Tour-de-force of Prolixity","review":"That many of the Amazon reviewers rated this book as a masterpiece makes me worry about the state of literary taste. Fowles does very well in evoking the Greek islands and their inhabitants, but his tale--I suppose it is supposed to be a moral tale of the punishment of a cad--tangles itself up. Fowles impressed me as unable to find a denouement and to have contrived in the last section to obfuscate that problem with bizarre, Jungian flim-flam. The book I found interesting segmentally; as a whole it did not succeed for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whoa....whatta rollercoaster","review":"To be honest it was a struggle to get through the first 100 pages...not alot happens and I was skeptical it would pick up but once Nicholas got onto the island the fun begins! Alot of twists and turns and not knowing who to believe and what was real and what wasn't was just a joy to keep up with...you didn't want to put the book down as you knew something or someone would change and you just had to know who or what it was. The ending killed me as well...not in a bad way but in a way as if I was Nicholas himself and had gone through this experience personally instead of just reading it. Great fun and one that I will likely read again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Completely Enthralling","review":"Have you ever been so utterly confused -- not in the sense that you don't know what's going on, but that you know TOO MANY THINGS are going on? That's the feeling that I get from The Magus. The best way to read this book is with a complete disregard for logic. Unfortunately, that's impossible, and so Fowles ensnares his readers in a psychological tug o' war that leaves one brainless and yet exhilarated by the end of the novel. The book, of course, is not perfect, but it still desrves five stars for its ability to completely change the reader while he or she is reading it.And if you think you can pick it up and put it down at will... well, let's just say it has more control over you than you over it."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW - What a ride!!","review":"I was not able to put The Magus down from the minute I started, and I think I may have to read it again sometime soon. What an amazing ride John Fowles has created for us. It's difficult to review this book without giving all the twists and turns away, but let's just say this psychological thriller has more twists and turns than a rollercoaster. My only negative for this incredible story is the relationship between Nicholas and Alison. I'm not convinced of Nicholas's love for her. Anyway, I highly recommend reading this amazing thriller - a story that will make you think about your own life and those around you. Who do you trust? Who do you really love? Who are you?

In addition to being wonderfully entertaining, it forever altered my perspective and outlook on so many things in life.

It does have quite a bit of information, but I find that it really is missing a lot. For example, there are absolutely no references given for all the supposed results of studies, and those \\"results\\" are mostly very brief summaries or interpretations by the author. In addition, some of the entries list a brief or confusing definition which leaves you knowing no more than you did before you read it.I would find this book much more helpful if it really was written more like a dictionary - with pronunciation keys, simple, clear definitions, and most of all, a significant increase in the amount of information on studies."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good reference book","review":"This is a good reference book to have on your shelf. It may not expound for pages and pages on every item, but it certainly gives a reasonably good yet brief definition of each entry.

After reading the reviews, I realised that you when you're severely allergic to foodstuffs, then it's not an axe to grind - it's pertinent facts you need.And sadly, this is what the book lacks. It's more a P.R. book of why the government legally poisons our food with enhancers and food colorings - to make them more appealing...This book is a good read for beginning information - but if you need real sources of allergies, there is abundant data freely available on the internet.Don't listen to publicity - listen to allergy sufferers.thanks for the information about citrus - I'm cutting that one out of my diet now. :os"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as I had hoped","review":"This book is less extensive than I had hoped.

The acting is not Oscar worthy, the premise and storyline has been done over and over in different settings, but that is okay, I still enjoyed this movie. I found it on Amazon Prime and have watched it several times (lots of dropouts and pixelation) and then looked to see if there was a Blu-ray version of it. Apparently not. May have to buy the DVD version of it. Amanda Schull's, Donna Murphy's, and Zoe Saldana's parts were good and I enjoyed them. The dance scenes were quite enjoyable also. I especially enjoyed Amanda's and Zoe's dance routines. Basically, this movie is just a bit of fluff. It has some talented dancers, who are not necessarily actors, acting the parts of dancers, but their parts are passable. If you are looking for high drama with Oscar winning performances, this is not the movie for you, but I liked it. Five stars!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent post-hardcore release","review":"The Foster Portfolio is the debut CD from northwesterners One Last Thing. The style of the songs is best described as post-hardcore with a mix of punk and emo. Most of the songs are great as evidenced by their single Day at the Beach (available at OLT's homepage). The music is similar to that produced by hardcore-influenced bands such as Thursday, Derail, Cursive, and Hot Water Music.I would highly recommend this CD to fans of emo or hardcore styles of music (as much as the two genres seem opposites of each other)."},{"rating":"2","title":"came on time","review":"got her quickly, it is on my son's AR list for school, he has not read it yet and has not yet taken the AR test"},{"rating":"1","title":"Freedom Train: A Boring Book About A Slave","review":"This isn't a very good book.

I went to see Hendrix in Cleveland, but was transfixed by the Soft Machine. This became such an unforgetable experience, I went to see the whole show again in Detroit. Recorded sound was a completely different thing. Gone was the frenetic, careening power, and so was the great voice of Kevin Ayers.

You can even put pieces of it on the inside of washing machine or dryer panels to make them quieter.It does have one drawback, and that's the fact that once you stick it on something, you will not be able to get it off without making a big mess.

There are a lot of arguments over whether this is cannon. Personally I couldn't care less. It has the wit and humor that Buffy fans love. the dramatic plot twists and appropriate character development. It's a good stop motion comic, and while there are things that seem a little off I thoroughly enjoyed it.

Watched it with him and we both had a headache before it was over. It's like telling someone in a third world country who has never seen Buffy or Angel, trying to describe to them the humor and nuances of the show, the essence of what made it a great show. Then you send them a list of the characters. Then it's their turn to write a script and perform it using people who have no clue the show ever existed. They fumble and stumble their way. No clue of the origin of the plot. BTVS ended after the best of the show had been done. The last season worked but was lacking. But to pretend that this wannabe comic book is a continuation of that show... There is not enough alcohol on the planet to make that a smooth segue. Nice try to rob people, but this idea stinks terribly. I hope that someday a real BTVS will be resurrected in a motion comic form, or even a live action film would be better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easier for me to follow than the comic","review":"The voice acting doesn't help to distinguish the female characters, but I found the dense plotting easier to follow and more compelling than on the page.

It was about an english teacher who is about to be married. After watching a former student on televsion give an acceptance speech he announces to the world that his former teacher is gay. It was truly funny to see Kevin Kline's character try to find out if he is gay or straight. His fiancee is played by Joan Cusack who is also hysterical in her role. I would recommend this movie to anyone who would like to sit back, relax and watch a cute, funny movie. There isn't anything to think about but watch and go for the ride. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Laugh Out Loud Funny","review":"This is extremely, funny movie full of laugh-out-loud moments. Kevin Kline gives a great comedic performance as the sexually confused high school teacher and Tom Selleck is wonderfully dignified as a gay TV reporter. The supporting cast more than keeps up their end of the bargain. Debbie Reynolds, Joan Cusack, Matt Dillon, and Bob Newhart all have memorable and hysterical lines. My biggest criticism of this movie is how it relies so heavily on stereotypes. Still, it wasn't made in a mean-spirited way and it can be enjoyed for what it is -- a light-hearted comedy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dumb slapstick humor that is darn enjoyable!","review":"I've seen this film about 5 billion times just because its light and fluffy and funny in that dumb sort of way that it can be watched over and over again because all it does is make you feel warm and fuzzy inside.And isn't that what you need sometimes?"},{"rating":"2","title":"In & Out","review":"I saw this movie several years ago and laughed 'til I cried, so I had to order it for my collection. The subject matter of homophobia and homosexuality is handled in a way that, in my opinion, won't be offensive. The characters are well defined and deserving of accolades for their handling of touchy subject matter in a caring, yet hilarious manner. I would definitely recommend this for an excellent 2 hours of entertainment with a message."},{"rating":"1","title":"Average.","review":"In & Out starring Kevin Kline is a pretty tame and predictable film. Kline is a talented actor so his performance is clever and memorable but the plot and jokes fall flat, everyone raved about this film when it was released in 1997, but I found this \\"coming out\\" story completely shallow and lifeless. Matt Dillion is also good in this, wish his character was in the film more. So-so comedy that left me bored, decide for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laughed and Cried","review":"This was one of the best movies I have ever seen. I love Joan Cusak and she was so fabulous in this movie. I've never paid much attention to Tom Selleck, and this is the first time I have ever seen him without a mustache, and he looks so gorgeous in this movie! It was great. Got a little preachy at the end, but the rest of the movie made that part worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great gay comedy","review":"This is a great movie for those looking to watch a comedy. The writers include many funny scenes that the audience will never forget. Though many stereotypes of homosexuals portrayed in \\"In & Out\\" are false, it still has many creative quotes. Kevin Kline magnificantly plays the role of an english teacher whose life turns upside down after watching the Oscars. His former student announces on national live television that his teacher is gay. Now, the teacher must do what he can to clear his name. In his quest, the storyline adds many twists and turns, frequently giving the audience the unexpected. Matt Dillon and Joan Cusack (in her Oscar nominated role) add to the comedy with their slapstick behavior. The entire remaining cast and crew also work great. \\"In & Out\\" will leave the audience mesmerized and inspired. This is great not just for a gay audience but also for a straight audience."},{"rating":"2","title":"From a comical standpoint","review":"Whether one approves the the theme of this movie is up to the individual.

Also I found this very racist towards gay people and wish I could erase all memory of my mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"not Kline's best work","review":"Although at times amusing, you may want to skip this film.

First of al, Frank Oz is a brilliant comedy director (seen \\"Bowfinger\\"?He directed it).Second, Kevin Kline is funny. Third, the concept(a highschool teacher in a small town who gets in trouble when the town thinks he's gay) sounded hilarious. When I watched the first part of the movie, it was funny. However, as the film goes, it gets more and more serious. But you know what annoyed me?Instead of keeping the movie funny till they end(like Tom Shadyac and the Farrelly Brothers), Frank starts showing compassion for homosexuality, and those feelings seriously affected the movie. Wasn't it suposed to be a comedy?Had I known that it was going to be a a compassion message, I wouldn't have wasted my time and money.Pros:*Some moments are very funny...Cons:*...but unfortunatley, they get fewer as the film goes on.Bottom line: look Frank: since you sold the film(through the trailer) as a comedy, then you should've kept it that way. ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hilarious film is ruined in the end","review":"I read all the various reviews of the film and some people are labeling it propaganda and attacking other's views. Well I have a negative review too!How can anyone put together such a great cast of actors and turn out such a stupid film. My views on homosexuality are very conservative but that is not the point. The film is very amusing at first but it ends up being just a pointless drama at the end. I mean the comedy just stopped and I felt cheated out of a film that could have been truly great if it kept up the comedy.Movies don't have to be so preachy. Especially when their comedies."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Actual Review","review":"I bought this movie because so many people reviewed it and said it was funny. And I like Kevin Kline and Tom Selleck. Well, save your money, I laughed once. This movie was totally predicatable and disappointingly unfunny.Could it be that all the people raving about this movie are raving about it because they are either gay themselves or gay-friendly, and would give ANY movie 5 stars for showing the gay lifestyle in a positive light?If you do not want to watch a politically correct propaganda piece from ACT-UP, then skip this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Propoganda","review":"Pro-homosexual propoganda film with Kevin Kline playing an English teacher who is \\"outed\\" on the eve of his wedding by a former student accepting an Oscar.

Preachy, sanctimonious and about as subtle as a drag queen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ok","review":"If you are a fan of Kevin Kline comedy, you should like this movie which is the main reason I gave it four stars, I consider it an at times movie: at times it's funny, at times it drags, at times it thought provoking, but ,Kevin Kline, Joan Cusack, Matt Dillon, Tom Selleck, Debbie Reynolds, Bob Newhart, and Wilford Brimley did enough to make this movie enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Funniest Movie Ever","review":"I have seen this movie a hundred times. I can't see enough about it. Kevin Kline is adorable. Joan Cusack is hilarious. Debbie Reynolds is amazing. You have to own this movie. It took what could have been a tragedy and made it the funniest movie. It's sweet and touching. It moves quickly and doesn't drag."},{"rating":"2","title":"A CLASSIC","review":"Kevin Kline stars as the soon-to-be married small town teacher who is outed by one of his pupils during a television appearance. these are merley the seeds to an energetic comedy where Kevin Kline manicially runs around in the film trying to prove that he's not gay. There is a superb cast here which includes a fine supporting role from Tom Selleck who plays an openly gay reporter, as well as Joan cusack, matt Dillon and Whoopi Goldberg. They all sparkle against Paul Rudnick's razor sharp scripts that bubbles with fast, furious wit. Kevin Kline puts in a sensitive, carefully conceived performance rather than settling for a stereotypical role. Consistently funny throughout - a classic. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lighten up!","review":"This was a light and very fun film! Very enjoyable! I'm surprised at some of the criticisms. But, then again, there are those with problems with their own ego-dystonic sexual orientation. (So, I think that explains some of the uncomfortableness.) Still, I insist this is not a GAY film. It's a comedy and a damn good one. In fact, the closest film I'd compare this to is The Philadelphia Story. (So, come on you closet queens. Just admit that you liked it and get over it.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"the eyes of Picasso","review":"Francoise Gilot had two children by the great painter andwrote an autobiography. Just because someone is a great singer, actor or paintercertainly doesn't mean they are going to be a nice person.And ex-wives mostly don't paint their husbands as angels?I have seen several of these movies about famous painters/ artists.There seems to be one theme in common:they are strangely driven peoplewho see the world through a different windowthan ordinary people.Many are manic in their intensity and mood swings.Picasso was a crowd pleaser who just was more than allfor Picasso. Anthony Hopkins even tried to get that intensity in his eyes thatPicasso was known for: that glow.There is little doubt that menlike Escher and Picasso have left us looking at the world differently."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Warning for Animal Lovers - Animals were killed for this film.","review":"Like \\"Heaven's Gate\\", animals were killed for this movie.

His looks and mannerism was so perfect that I forgot at times that I was not watching \\"Picasso in action\\".While many facts shown in this movie are based on truth, we must not forget that the script was based on the novel by Arianna Huffington, who dared (in order to make a name for herself) interpreting Picasso's life by adding a heavy feminist slant. Yes, Picasso was eccentric as an artist and as a man, he was a Spaniard, born in 1881, in the most southern region of Spain (Andalusia) which was under Arab rule for centuries. Understandably, the mentality of a male of his generation is beyond Ms. Huffingtons' comprehention. But nevertheless, even though somewhat distorted by her overly feministic interpretation, \\"Surviving Picasso\\" it is an excellent, entertaining and historically speaking, worthwhile movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Informative and eye catching","review":"John has put together a book packed with information and beautiful pictures.

The pictures alone make this a great book for the coffee table. Even non collectors will enjoy seeing the beautiful dust jackets from the books they enjoyed as children.Worth so much more than the price.

Lon Nolan has the potential of becoming a stellar action hero, if Mr. Shelly has the ability to make him so. The action scenes need more vivid and exiting or spellbindig segments, while the character developement is almost captivating it falls just short. Compared with the first three books in the series this is the better of the three, but still not up to writers such as E.Moon, and D.Weber.I will give Mr. Shelly one more try and then decide on further purchases."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major continues a mediocre trend","review":"Pity there is no option for half sstars, because Major is a marginal improvement over Captain. Another review of Major compares Shelley unfavorably to Moon and Weber; to me there is no comparison. Shelley's characters appear unmotivated, his plotting contrived and his writing is amazingly stilted. The technology seems awkward and bizarrely old-fashioned, compared even to the military today. The career success of Nolan, the protaganist,is inexplicable, as he never seems to do anything very impressively and always seems to react to opponents rather than drive his own opportunities. Let's face it; the idea of a mercenary planet like Dirigent is pretty absurd. But Shelley does nothing to make you suspend disbelief.

Ian Douglas has acheived my respect and admiration for his accurate potrayal of Warfare in space (hey, it sounded good!) Rick Shelly is a clown in the prestigious offices of literature. Hell, I'm suprised they let him in the lobby. He knows combat, and can write combat, but little more. The charactars (expecially the main one) are cardboard, static, and phony.

What left me feeling cheated was the sex scenes. For one, there weren't many. For two, the girl/girl scenes were terrible. I thought I was watching a shampoo commercial, what with all the hair stroking. There was no kissing, no excitement, and no heat.

It depends entirely on contrived and unnecessary camera tricks as well as cliched destructive patterns that are supposed to serve as warnings against drugs. Also, there is the arbitrary placing of symbols throughout, only enhancing the thick stench of pseudo-Freudianism that is brought by the ridiculously obvious oedipal anxiety that the Leto and Burstyn characters suffer (imagining his girlfriend in a red dress while his mother obsesses over a red dress).This film was apparently an attempt to manipulate trite patterns that attemtp to conceal an overall lack of creativity. That makes sense, since this film is patently uncreative. I finished this film knowing nothing more about the characters than when I started, and caring even less.

The only scene that was moving was when the mother played by Ellen Burstyn describes to her son how lonely she is, at a breaking-point scene in the movie. I also liked the way the T.V health-show was shown in the movie. How ridiculously and foolishly addictive people are in these shows. And what a let-down by Jennifer Connolly for doing such a role and appearing in all those nude scenes. I wonder what made her accept such an role.

It's just the movie goes beyond bad it's seriously vondarious.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"boring, nothing special","review":"I wanted to like this film. the trailer made it look good, and I thought \\"Pi\\" was at least worth a look. but this movie about bored me to tears.ok, ok I get it. drugs are bad. with some \\"cool\\" & \\"dark\\" music-video type imagery & a pretty girl. and drugs are bad. gee, uh, thanks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gripping?","review":"This movie was absolutely ridiculous. I thought it was a comedy, what with the fridge monster and all. The film really didn't bring much to the table as far as social commentary is concerned. That is to say that I've personally seen much worse...I guess living in Wisconsin, you get more livestock than you do real life experience, huh deadsummer?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Movie : 2000","review":"Requiem for a dream, in my opinion, was the best movie in Y2K. Sure, there are powerful performances, but what's makes this film even more special is that you actually feel for the characters. Also, I thought the score throughout the film was haunting, and all the editing (esp. the fast forward parts), was very fun to watch.This DVD is the unrated DVD that was shown in theaters. Basically, the film is rated NC-17. But you can also buy the movie in an R-Rated version.The only difference between the unrated and R-rated versions is that Marion's party scene at the end (which is explicit), was cut shorter. WOW, that's a really big difference, yeah right! One big difference between the two DVDs is that the Unrated version has a lot more features, and the R-rated only has theatrical trailers.I totally recommend this movie and DVD, and it ain't for the kids, but anyone who is addicted or plans to be, should consider watching this movie. It will definitely change your life."},{"rating":"2","title":"ghosts of things to come...","review":"This is one of the best movies Ive ever seen. It is also one of the most depressing. At the end of this movie you are left so inconsolable. I would definatly sugggest this movie to any one who's on drugs. Darren aronofsky did a great job filming thiis one. It also has a very very good sound track."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beauty","review":"This is not a tale of chemical addiction. To not feel that you have been destroyed and resurrected after it is finished is to deny tragedy. The lives of these characters are absurd, but so was the mother's life before her drug addiction and therefore so is any life. Their destruction is our destruction by the woe of this world. This is not a warning against drug use, but a cry from within the abyss that we can only, like Hamlet, remain stoic in the face of creation's grand atrocity.Its public face will remain, despite arnofsky's brilliance, a sad tale of addiction, but its truth is art, a shadowed doubt over whatever hope any life may contain and an acknowledgement that few if any can deal with life's menace with open eyes."},{"rating":"1","title":"warning!!!!","review":"warning amazon costumer!! do not buy this dvd. it is an edited, r-rated version of the original film, which is one of the gratest movies of 2000. the original cut features frequent drug use and a really creepy sex scene that freaked the mpaa out! if you are easily offended, you shouldn't be buying this movie anyway. if you liked the movie, or you didn't watch it but are in search of something totally new and original, buy the unrated version. this one is not good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ripped off by a &^*##@# edited version","review":"This IS one of the most brilliant movies I have ever seen. I am a filmmaker and Darren is, IMHO one of the monster directors of our time. That said, this version being palmed off to unsuspecting film fans is a travesty. To be clear, LOVED THIS MOVIE IN THE THEATER. I hate, hate, hate this abomination. Look for the NC-17 version if you want to see what the filmmaker wanted you to experience in this movie. This is an adult movie with very adult themes, why, why, why, gut it in the edit suite?? So you could eek out a few more sales to the kiddies??"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, pretentious, and moralizing","review":"Aronofsky uses every gimmicky camera and editing move in the book in an attempt to jolt some life into this otherwise leaden addiction movie. It doesn't work. Ellen Burstyn chews the scenery, Jared Leto commits an aural atrocity with his Brooklyn accent, and Jennifer Connolly just sits there--every now and then you catch her using one of the two expressions in her repertoire. This movie is pointless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gut-wrenching and difficult to watch","review":"Like many people who have reviewed this movie, I rented the DVD a few months ago with no idea what to expect. Suffice to say, it was quite an experience watching this movie. Some of the scenes in this movie remain in the front of my mind and are impossible to forget - like I switched off the DVD player a few minutes ago even though it's been a few months.Possibly the most gut-wrenching part of taking in this movie was the fact that my grandmother actually went through a similar ordeal as Ellen Burstyn's character. I seriously grieve for my grandmother now that I have seen what Aronofsky illustrated with unrelenting, pulse-pounding vision. Luckily, my grandmother had a support system to help her get through her ordeal, whereas Burstyn's character has no one. It's very troubling to think about what might have been.Bravo, Darren Aronofsky. This is a visionary film - one that should not be watched alone."},{"rating":"2","title":"The \\"Go Ask Alice\\" Of Out Time","review":"This movie is not like any other. Because in other movies, people use drugs and you never actually get to see the real truth behind drug use and abuse. Every movie teaches the audience of how \\"cool\\" and fun drugs can be. But not one movie that I have been witness to has captured the reality of addiction and other possible problems you encounter when involved with drugs. This movie was great. Specially because, unlike fairy-tales, the main characters do not live happily ever after. It starts with three friends that are trying to make it in the city. I will not tell you the details but the ending you will never expect."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best movies ever!","review":"Darren Arnofsky made a great movie with PI, but he truly exelled in his latest one. \\"Requiem for a dream\\" is an incredible movie, actually, more than a movie, its a masterpiece! The photography work is incredible, the transition to scenes is exellent, the music gives it a great feel, and let us not forget the acting. The acting by Ellen Burstyn is amazing, she completly transforms herself for the role. Seeing this movie makes you realize how badly this movie got jipped at the oscars. Julia Roberts doesnt deserve to have been in the same category as this amazing actress. Marlon Wayans suprises anyone who sees this movie with his incredible perfomance and seriousness. Jared Leno does an incredible job at showing his desperation throughout the movie, and Jennifer Connelly did a super job. The movie is a must buy, not a rent!"},{"rating":"2","title":".....","review":"I watched this movie not knowing what to expect, although since i had seen Pi before, i was expecting something heavy.Something about it made me feel emotions, but I didn't cry because something about it didn't seem right. It's more like something where I just have to sit and think for a while, but even that may not help.The idea of following a druggie with their addiction may be old, but the way it is done is wonderful. The intertwining of the stories only adds to the experience. Also it follows not only those who brought the addiction upon themselves, but it also incorporates those who became addicted innocently.This is definatly a movie you can't watch when down because you can't just walk away without being affected, but i suppose that is a sign of a good movie, isn't it?"},{"rating":"2","title":"best movie ever made","review":"This is no doubt the best movie ever made the cinematography story, beauty,editing is a masterpiece.Not a day goes with out me thinking about it. It is good to finnaly see a movie out there about the truth and done so well in this style. I have seen this movie 5 times in the theatre and recommend it to anyone out there tired of all these blockbuster movies out there that bore u from the start. I cant wait to see what arofonsky has next\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Breathtaking","review":"This film is revolutionary, a true revelation. The acting, cinematography, the art direction... you name it it is hallmark. The shining star of this film is Ellen Burstyn in what will be considered a truly unforgetable, oscar winning performance. The final sequence is an emotional culmination that no other film this year can compare."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 plus stars","review":"this movie is said to be about drug addiction, although after watching it multiple times u find the addiction of everything. The tv, love, chocolate, the diet, and the always wanting that little bit more (money or that last dropped pound or herion hit or diet pill) my life has changed from this movie go rent it right now and watch it and just experience reality first hand"},{"rating":"2","title":"reality is a bitch...","review":"INCREDIBLE! This movie is truely outstanding. Some may find it disturbing; I know I was freaked out when it ended. There are so many unforgettable images and scenes that will forever stick with you. If you're someone whos interested in \\"experimenting\\" with some drugs, watch this movie and then make your decision. Definitely a one to own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Feeding Frenzy","review":"I wondered as I watched this if anybody is capable of putting more into a role than Ellen Burstyn (Sara Goldfarb) did in this film. It seems to me that she pushed the envelope here. She did just about everything except evaporate into thin air as she portrayed the effects of speed addiction and electroshock therapy. The other actors performed very credibly, but Burstyn is what made this film special.As many other reviewers at this site have pointed out, this film powerfully displays the hazards of substance abuse. Drugs destroy one's ability to take care of one's self. The world is tough enough when you are strong and healthy; the sea is full of sharks who will consume you if you are not. This film could have been subtitled \\"Feeding Frenzy.\\"The script, direction, and acting (Burstyn) were all great. The musical score (Clint Mansell) helped drive it all"},{"rating":"2","title":"Requiem for my Dream!","review":"My God! Ellen Burstyn should really have won the Oscar! The Picture, the Score, the Actors and Actresses the whole thing is great! I'm not from america so I can't even explain this Movie! it is so great so breathtaking and fasinating! Oh My God I have never seen a such important and serious film in my whole life!The whole plot is great! Its really, realy spectacular indead! It teaches you what drugs are able to do to you! I swear to god that I'll never tuch any kind of drugs! It's a Movie you just can't forget! You will always think about it and the Score will always stay in your mind! I love this Picture I love this DVD and I love the Story and the Score! Oh my God I love it!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Two thumbs down","review":"My life is the poorer for having watched this movie. Yes, there are good points- it was wonderfully acted and the screenplay and direction were beautiful. But overall there is no reason for the film's existence. Watching the film was like trying to wake up from a nightmare- I kept wanting it to be over. I felt no sympathy for the characters. In the end they received their due. It is a movie about the evils of drug addiction. Well, that has been done before- repeatedly. And much better. It added nothing new to the entire addiction debate. There was no unique viewpoint. I felt physically dirty after watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"wrong version","review":"i was shipped an edited version of the movie not the directors cut version. fail on discriptionnot happy with purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"got charged but would not play","review":"I am sure this is a good movie, but I paid to rent it and it used to play on my Kindle. I can't even find anywhere tor request a refund for VOD. I have wasted the last 20 mins trying to find a way to do so, gave up so I am writing this bad review."},{"rating":"2","title":"Depressing","review":"This is a well made movie. However, I will tell you that buy watching this you are basically asking for a terrible experience. This is one of those movies where you have to force yourself to finish it. Its extremely depressing and will put you in a really bad/sad mood. I cannot watch this movie ever again. I give it 4 stars because the movie has the power to make me feel like that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disturbing","review":"This is one hell of a movie. It simply leaves you dumb-folded after its depressing ending. The performances are outstanding, the script is very well written. You're dragged into the movie's underworld and it's hard to forget it. Everybody should see this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware","review":"Dont get me wrong this is a great movie, but you want the Director\`s Cut not the Edited Version-thats what i got,,, so look real carefully and even contact the seller if its not Amazon because you might not get what you pay for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad","review":"Received the WRONG movie (got a cheap very old movie), apparently took him a week to find mine and ship out but that was 2 weeks ago. Very sad and hope I didn't get ripped off. Hopefully it's in the mail!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too disturbing","review":"I gotta say this movie was way too disturbing for me!!! It was well made, but I am having troubles getting it out of my head!!! Very heavy and not at all for weak people!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"A gret movie that is hard to watch towards the end mainly due to what happens to Jared Leto and his girlfriend. Not for the faint of heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spiritual Masterpiece about contemporary American culture","review":"Addiction has become an overused metaphor. However, here the title aptly names the work. The point is not to assume that this is just a story about four sympathetic characters succumbing to drugs. Rather, it is also about the American Dream and the arrogant practice of management with its shallow focus on getting the task done effectively without regard to those affected whether we are speaking about a doctor prescribing pills to achieve weight loss, a couple selling drugs to start a dress shop, or a television host promising an end to loneliness by an invitation to a game show."},{"rating":"1","title":"This wasn't that good....","review":"Unless you like movies that deal with just sex and drugs, then I recommend seeing something else. Yes this movie is dark, but that was the point, so I enjoyed that aspect of the film, and the ending was perect, but it just drug in to many places. See Pi instead, it is much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice movie, nice bluray","review":"I dont really know how to review this movie. It's weird but good. No purpose in the story, just the journey... Sit back and enjoy the ride."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Clever, Very Bleak","review":"The movie uses a lot of split-screen effects, like you see in those early Brian DePalma thrillers such as DRESSED TO KILL and SISTERS and so forth. This and the time-lapse photography make the picture very engaging visually. The characters and dialogue are fairly convincing, and the story moves along at a reasonably fast clip. All of which are good things because, while the film is not entirely without a sense of humor, it moves inexorably toward a very depressing, hopeless conclusion.I don't think the theme to the movie is simply \\"Don't Do Drugs\\". The Ellen Burstyn character's amphetamines are doctor-prescribed. An interview with the novelist/co-screenwriter Selby explains that the story is really about human suffering (hard to argue with that). Most stories about suffering indicate that there's a point to the suffering, or at least that there's light at the end of the tunnel; but this one does neither.So, entertaining and technically impressive, but also a real downer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie","review":"Looks like this movie got the review it deserves 5 stars. At first the movie gave me a headache with the crazy sound effects and camera tricks. But it was all part of the movie and till the last very scene it had me speechless.Go see this movie if you haven't you won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW what can I say very very depressing","review":"After my brother died of a speedball mix I had to watch movies like this to see what drug addiction was really like as I had only got into pot when I was a teenager 20 yrs back. Anyway, this movie was very real and depressing but I was glued to the TV and will now buy it a yr after viewing it. Awesome acting really not a movie you will ever really forget like the new movie Spun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Um...dear sweet Jesus...","review":"If nothing else, this movie is without a doubt effective. Aranofsky systematically brings up our hopes and then bashes them to a bloody pulp. By the end, like the characters, I felt deflated and...well, depressed. If you like movies with sad endings, and I mean REALLY sad endings, then this movie will definitely tickle your manic depressive bone. But do not look for anything uplifting in this film; there is nothing but the utter destruction of the characters lives."},{"rating":"2","title":"hold on to your seats ...","review":"I am never going to become addicted to heroin, cocaine, coffee and food thanks to this wonderful cinematic and depressing PSA/movie/masterpiece/work of art/anti-drug campaign.No president, no government agency, no school activity comes close to doing what this movie does for drugs and the inherent evils of addiction.The acting is ridiculously awesome. All the faces are recognizable all of the names are known but they are all so different in this one movie. Ellen Burstyn, Jared Leto , Marlan Wayans, and Jennifer Connelly all transform into their characters and never relent. Down the spiral of depravity and loss they keep everything sympathetic and real.You may know these people in your life you may have a friend that has this problem. This movie although heavily stylized and at times too reliant on hyperbole of the situation, really does draw you in and never let you out.don't go to sleep after this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"requiem for a dream","review":"this movie is one of the most incredible films i've ever seen.

I watched this film as it was soooo highly rated! What a joke! This movie was a way for men to keep a little porn around the house and callin' it an \\"artistic masterpiece\\". If I wanted to watch porn---I'd rent one!...I dont care if its producers wanted it RAW, we arent so stupid we have to be literally shown EVERYTHING. WE GOT THE POINT without it. And if you like happy endings...... skip this flick.....This is more like an educational say no to drugs film than a masterpiece meant to entertain---and isnt that why we watch movies? To be entertained and be removed from the headaches of daily life? This is NOT IT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"just another bizzare movie","review":"Just another movie where the writer/director/producers are trying to pass off their bizzare nightmares as something meaningful. Wish I could give it 0 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"No thank you","review":"This movie was very beutiful, but it was just too depressing. I have better ways to spend two hours than to watch something so sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Art Maybe, Disturbing Certainly","review":"I saw this film on the recommendation of a friend, and I admit that it does relay an extremely strong messege but it is not worth enduring the 102 minutes of disturbance. The frightening and often grotesque images combined with haunting music does more than simply relay the director's message, it forces you to come to a relization of general disgust for society. If you enjoyed \\"Pie\\" then you will probably enjoy \\"Requiem\\" but if you are not familiar with either movie or the director then I would advise you to take caution when choosing to watch this movie, especially around children."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snore Fest","review":"I saw this film a while ago, and still have nothing good to say about it. I almost didn't bother even watching the whole thing, it had me yawning. The music is repetitive and annoying. The focus was on the character's downward spiral thanks to drug use, and didn't accomplish portraying the tragedy that is the death of dreams well at all. The characters failed to move me. It seemed to me they never had anything going for them to begin with, and thus not really anything to lose. It just seems like a film you'd show someone to scare them away from drug use."},{"rating":"1","title":"...SO BAD","review":"I watched this movie with expectations of something good and deep but was left bored and really uninterested. The movie seemed to made with the idea that nobody had ever made an addiction movie before, nobody had ever said that drugs were bad and that not everything addicting is illeagal. The form takes a precedent over the content in this slick tale of 4 users and with rare exception really do much but make me wish I was doing something else like watching Drugstore Cowboy or Trainspotting. Those movies are at least funny and have a better pace.I can't say anything good about this one, sorry. This review isn't meant to be helpful just honest."},{"rating":"1","title":"A LITTLE SOMETHING TO OFFEND EVERYONE!","review":"I'm a broad minded, artsy person. I thoughr this film was the most offensive thing I've seen in years. And it wasn't even interesting. Which is kinda strange! It was \\"boring - drugs - boring - offensive sex - boring - drugs, etc.\\" Yuch! If you do watch it, check out a second tape to clean you out. I picked Sense and Sensibility and it worked."},{"rating":"2","title":"All I can say","review":"All I can say is that this film is nothing more than an after-school special done really well."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the most interesting movies","review":"Well, you might like or not like this movie, but not a single person can watch it and pretend that it did not strike something deep inside. It is one of the strongest movies i have seen, and it made me feel things no other movie has made me feel. I strongly recommend it, as well as the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"disturbing,disturbed","review":"this movie should be used in a \\"say no to drugs\\" campaign for kids.it shows in an extremely unsettling manner how even the most minor usage of drugs for the strangest reasons can lead you into a complete downward spiral in no time at all.this movie really shows us how things can start off minorly messed up and end up in the worst situations possible.very scary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe this is not my type of movie","review":"I feel that this is like a movie that was shot in the 80's. I don't know why but it seems old and past due for me. I have tried watching it on five occasions and have not gotten past the 25 minutes. Too bad. I expected more based on the reviews on here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bourgeois carnival view of addicton.","review":"RFOD is fun to watch for its music video, remember those?, hyper-style fireworks, but the film just uses Selby's novel, which is truly bleak and which actually gets under your skin, for a bourgeois carnival ride into neon addiction hell that never even pops your skin...at all.This movie is simply MADE for frat boys who want to feel \\"deep,\\" as was PI and as is BS, oh, that's BLACK SWAN. Nothing against DA, I'm not a hater, but he needs to get a bit of real-life experience or SOMETHING else that actually engages him, the artist, with his material in a genuine way. Great performances, though, especially by Burstyn, Connolly & Wayans."},{"rating":"1","title":"PRETENTIOUS DRIVEL","review":"[insert quaff about \\"MTV-style editting\\" here][insert clever quip like \\"depressing = bad\\" here]"},{"rating":"1","title":"A pretentious hack job convincing the world that its \\"art\\"","review":"Ten billion cuts with the same in-your-face imagery, possibly the worst acting job of all time (Leto, et al), and a self-indulgent sense of its own alleged \\"brilliance,\\" this worthless tripe was possibly the biggest scam in cinema over the past several years.I have never finished watching a movie in a such a state of anger at having been duped, conned, and beaten with the pretentious stick so mercilessly.

It's not for your \\"average joe\\", blue collar, working class kind of person. But if you have what it takes to watch and get this movie, it is one awesome movie. I love movies that make you feel, make you think, and this is definitely one of those movies. Like someone else mentioned, it's not about addiction per sea. It's about hope and dreams and how easily they are lost. It's about life and how it can sneak up on you and destroy all that you thought you were. It's about how easy we can get lost and how those around us don't even see it happening until it's too late. If you want a mindless, dumb movie, don't watch this. However, if you want a movie that will make you think, make you feel; a movie that will stay with you even after you are done watching it - then this is the movie for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"Requiem for a dream is an amazing look at the development of drug addictions. Unfortunatly, these problems occur as a result of people trying to accomplish their dreams through the use of drugs.Although the story line in this movie may appear to be slow, Aronofsky is careful not to rush to the ending that the entire movie builds up for. He allows plenty of time for the characters and their respective problems to develop, which is all presented at the perfect pace- starting as petty and getting progressively worse. The character development is something overlooked but mandatory in a movie such as this.I must give specific mention to the music too. The music is the perfect compliment to the specific scenes and really displays the attitude of the scene as well.Overall, this movie is very depressing becuase it doesnt hold anything back and is made more depressing by the fact that incidents such as these are all too common."},{"rating":"2","title":"Misunderstanding a Classic","review":"Many people have watched this movie and come out a little non-plussed. \\"I know people who are on worse drugs,\\" some have said, \\"and they haven't come out that bad.\\" They have obviously missed the point of the movie.This movie was never a \\"drug\\" movie, nor was it intended to be. It was simply about the state of addiction, and drugs are an easy metaphor for whatever may addict us. In fact, pills are not the only device the movie uses to make its point. Note Sara Goldfarb, addicted to TV and food. As she turns on her TV, it is shown using the same methods Aronofsky uses for shooting up. Could he be saying that the two are one and the same? He could, and is, as he states on the DVD.That said, this is a movie about addiction and despair, and how it is easy to fall into a self-destructive trap if we don't face our lives head-on, instead of running.And it's the best, most disturbing thing I've ever seen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Nightmare","review":"Never have I seen the subject of drug addiction and the attendant descent into hell depicted so artfully on screen.

For example, the scene where the mother receives shock treatments. Nice bit of horror, but completely unrealistic - they don't treat people that way-- they put them to sleep-- and showing it as if she'd be awake and aware is cheap theatrics that reflect poorly on the director.

Yeah we all know a small percentage of users end up completely destroying themselves. Yes, long term use of stimulants like diet pills and amphetamines leads to temporary psychosis. Let's see some films about the long, successful lives many addicts lead and here's a radical idea - how about showing the reality that the majority of drug users live long, happy, fullfilled lives? The movie is well acted and well executed, but it is a pretense and a distortion of reality which would be fine if it was openly so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying...","review":"I guess I'm in the minority on this one, but I think Aronofsky once again missed the mark with Requiem. Like Pi, what could have been a better movie was ruined by the heavy-handed directing and a story that just doesn't hold together.This movie was filled with way too many idiots for my taste. That much stupidity and tragedy in the story just made it seem ludicrous and over-the-top...I also got very tired of the high-speed montage sequences.To it's credit, I thought Kronos Quartet's music added an interesting facet to the movie. Burstyn's and Wayans' acting was also very good. The tragedy of this movie is that in the end, it really didn't have anything convincing to share with the audience. My advice is that Aronofsky should work with a good director before attempting to make another film on his own. Please, people! Don't encourage him. ;-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Like jabbing a needle into an open wound","review":"This film, in a word, sucks. For those of you who don't know, heroinwill consume your life. There, I saved you from having to endure theassault this film provides in the form of a two hour funhouse ride into the bowels of hell. If you enjoy watching people destroy themselves and have nothing better to do with your time then watch this movie; you're probably dead already anyway. Otherwise, treat yourself to an ice cream and forget about the fact that people make some dumb-ass choices that eventually lead to their demise.

This is one of his best movies ever. Mostly about drugs and eating disorders. but as the name implies, it could be generalized to any extreme dream!

This is definitely one of those movies. Requiem for a Dream is quite possibly the most emotionally powerful, and viscerally disturbing film I've ever seen. Darren Aronofsky certainly proved his talent as an auteur. There's so much to say about this film. It's extremely well acted by everyone involved, very well written, the story is deeply tragic and poignant, the editing is crisp and inventive, and the cinematography is dark and unsettling. Fans of Aronofsky, or even Danny Boyle's Trainspotting, will definitely want to feast their eyes on this masterpiece."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please Read The Book","review":"As I have said in my title PLEASE READ THE BOOK, because the book brillantly breaks down the individual struggle of each character as they dive deeper and deeper into drug addiction. The book deals with alot of inward thought and emotions, which is hard to capture in film. Even though Hubert Selby Jr. (the original author) was involved in the making of this film I believe it could have been executed better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Acting skills..but boring movie","review":"Just saw it after a friend recommended it and hearing about how good this film is, the story is VERY lame. Bunch of high life kids doing and selling drugs..immature. Wasted my 2 hours watching this stupid film. Btw, I'm giving this movie away free to the next person whoever wants it, because I want this out of my hands. Maybe the next person will appreciate it more. I was about to give this movie a 1 star but gave two because of the acting. Overall, will not watch it again unlike some of the viewers here. This is such a depressing film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Muddled Mess","review":"This could be a good movie, but the choppy editing and uneven story made it difficult to enjoy.

It also shares the same downfall as \\"Magnolia\\". Requiem for a Dream is a much better film than Magnolia however in the sense that there is purpose and a statement in the film. Magnolia OTOH, was a beautifully directed terrible film with characters that nobody can hopefully identify with (\\"Magnolia\\" had no real meaning or plot to anybody but the self-serving director and a few others who managed to hallucinate some meaning out of \\"Magnolia\\". Traffic was an outstanding movie on addiction, while Requiem for a dream relied on too much hyperbole and SHOCK effect, as if it were an MTV video. I think it was worth watching once, perhaps, but it is does not have a lot to offer. Traffic OTOH was either 4 or 5 stars out of 5. This film does not deserve more than 2 to 3 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow, absolutly breathtaking.","review":"I watched this movie with some of my friends.... At the end of this movie we were completly, and utterly shocked. This is one of the finest films i have ever seen. This should be required viewing for any and all highschool students.

Excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stylized Anti-Drug Snuff Film - Pure Propaganda and Very Well Done.","review":"A disturbing fantasy that punishes drug addicts as if they were mass murderers.

He would exploit their pain instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utter trash","review":"This movie is overhyped, period. It's utter trash, just like David Lynch's \\"Mulholland Drive\\".

Maybe just because I can relate to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I never, ever want to see this movie again...ever.","review":"I saw this movie because I am a fan of Jennifer Connelly, and I had heard excellent things about it. And most of what I heard was true. This is a grotesquely brilliant movie. It touched me and disturbed me so much that, like \\"Schindler's List\\", I don't think I ever want to see this movie again.I am a squeamish person, but I was entranced by the visions of ugliness created by the director. However, this is not simply a cautionary tale about the dangers of drugs. I believe this is about pride, the pride that many drug users have that allows them to think that they can control their drug use, rather than the other way around. It's highly effective.I dare anyone. to watch this movie twice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aronofsky's Masterpiece","review":"This film was incredible! The editing, sound and direction was powerful and explosive. Ellen Burstyn gives the performance of her career as an aging Jewish mother and Jared Leto is her son; both fall into addictions that tear their lives apart. This film is not for the squeamish, but those who watch it will come away from it with great respect for director Aronofsky's massive talent.

In fact, I married a girl named Jennifer and forced her to have plastic surgery to look like Jennifer Connelly. No just kidding. I did buy this movie for her though as she has been so awesome in her other roles. She did a fine acting job...the movie just sucked! If you plan on buying it, at least rent it before you buy it. Of course, if you decide to buy it, drop me a line. I watched mine once and don't think I could stomach it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"I expected better from Aronofsky","review":"This movie is a 2-hour cliche. Detailing the downward spiral of heroine users is NOT an original, or even noteworthy, endeavour. These characters were losers when the movie started and they were even bigger losers at the end. Many reviewers will give accolades for the effects used here. Fast-motion, slow-motion, tight frames, split screens, etc. These were mildly interesting the first time they're used but quickly become annoying by mid-movie. And will someone take that harness camera away from Darren!! The only interesting element of this movie was Ellen Burstyn's character. Ellen deserves all the praise she has received for ther portrayal. Everyone else involved should apologize."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the greatest","review":"Well to start off this is one of my favorite movies. I think it has a amazing soundtrack. The camera angles are one of my favorite parts of the movie. I love the split screen and when the camerea is attached to the person(i use that in some of my flicks). It has great actors, Marlon Waynes, Jered Leto, Ellen Burstyn. I guess some people dont think its original, but who cares its a great movie that i can safely rate the highest ive ever seen. I even have the shirt and soundtrack."},{"rating":"2","title":"requiem for a dream","review":"Its not for kids. This film was one of the best film of the 2000 year for movies.

Aranofsky is the type of director who relies on visual gimmicks rather than connecting with the actors and telling a story. This film presumes to be a reflection of his own experiences. In some interviews, he claimed seeing first hand situations such as Connelly's underground strip club scene. The film has the feel of someone with limited life experience, or at least someone with no concept of storytelling. One of the longest ninety minutes I've ever spent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Traffic, minus a plot","review":"If you've seen Traffic, don't bother watching Requiem for a Dream. The story? A few people have dreams of living a better life, but are ruined by drug abuse. The End. Near unwatchable. And I didn't even get to see Jennifer Connelly's wonderful breasts!"},{"rating":"1","title":"wallows in the abject","review":"The film is a stew of stylistic cliches, unimaginatively employed melodramatic devices (ex: the heroine must sacrifice her virtue for the hero - to an enormous grinning black man, no less - this situation is both racist and tired), and just plain nastiness. Under the guise of realist high drama, the film wallows in the abject in a way that is at once pompous and sophmoric."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Of The Best Movies","review":"Wow !! This movie is awesome. The Director improves his work from Pi to this one.... I love the way he tells the story by gently pulling you into this world of chaos in such a way that you don't even realize what has overtaken you. He takes you into the world of these four characters and lets you see and feel things like they do. ...this movie is unstoppable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Destruction of Hope","review":"Do not buy/rent this movie unless you want to feel terrible about life. It has no moral value and is a POS in my opinion. 4 people all hooked on drugs with no real determanation to stop using but get more. It has a crappy ending that leaves you feeling terrible for those involved and put me in a bad mood for wasting approximately 2 hrs. of my time when i could have watched somthing different. So unless you enjoy terrible movies that leave you feeling sad/depressed do not rent/buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't do drugs or else!","review":"This movie is interesting and worth watching, but maybe a little over-hyped. I bought this movie just reading the reviews from here and thought I would be blown away. I did like the movie and felt bad for the characters sometimes and other times thought they deserved what they got for doing drugs. Overall it is a very tragic movie with no happy ending. I think the woman who plays the mother does an excellent job and I was really surprised that Jennifer Connely played the role she did. She played it well but I am suprised to see her like that. So check out the movie it is good, and don't do drugs."},{"rating":"2","title":"REWARDING IF YOU'RE GAME....","review":"I don't know what all the \\"love it\\"/\\"hate it\\" stuff's about. This is an engrossing and galvanizing film. Director Darren Aronosfky has achieved deserved recognition for this morality fable about the destruction of four lives by drug addiction. Wonderful performances put this tale right in your face. The stuff dreams are made of is heroin and diet pills. The characters write their own requiem as they descend into hell. Not for the faint-hearted or weak-stomached but well worth watching for the performances---especially Ellen Burstyn who was Oscar nominated for her work here. Jared Leto as her son, Marlon Wayans as his buddy and Jennifer Connelly as Leto's girlfriend all turn in fine jobs as the doomed souls who sell out for the \\"Dream\\". Sad, depressing but fascinating viewing if a bit heavy-handed at times. A damn fine film nonetheless."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm shocked","review":"You will be totally numbed with shock when you finish this movie.I don't know what more to write about the movie that hasn't already been written. You will be horrified by Requiem for a Dream but you absolutely must see it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh Please","review":"Like the director's first film, Pi, this film is a lesson in heavy handedness. Just like Pi, Requiem is tremendously overrated. Also, it is a great example of how to let an annoyingly hip soundtrack destroy a movie.Basically, we learn that drugs are bad. So bad in fact, that you will turn into a whore, your arm will fall off and appliances will attack you if you do them. Also, if you take what otherwise looks just like a Gap ad and do lots of close ups and quick cuts, the general movie going public will consider you \\"deep\\".Pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"REQUIEM FOR A DREAM -the edited version?!!","review":"Excellent movie but don't waste your time with this edited version.

I just got the video the other day, and let me tell you, it had a strong impact on me. I wasn't really expecting that kind of a \\"wham-bang\\" ending! The performances are spectacular, and ELLEN BURSTYN DESERVED THAT OSCAR! No offense to Julia Roberts, but Ellen's performance was the most powerful for the year 2000. I agree with the rest of the reviewers: This film should be shown all around high schools everywhere. It is a graphic, disturbing account of the effects of drugs on four different people and how it sent their hopes and dreams down the toilet. The end will leave you shocked. You will not be able to get this film out of your head for a few days. Believe me."},{"rating":"2","title":"a harrowing journey into the depths of despair","review":"My boyfriend and I were devestated after watching this film. For thirty minutes all we could do was stare at each other, and not say a word. I have never felt so emotionally drained after seeing a film as I was in this one. Darren Aronofsky introduces us to four flawed yet likeable characters, and then steps back and lets them do the damage all by themselves. A film about despair, lonliness, broken dreams, and people's inability to connect, even when they are right there next to each other. Eleen Burstyn deserves and oscar. And the rest of the cast and crew should stand up and be proud of one of the most amazing cinematic works I have seen in a long time. THIS is why movies are made."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazingly stimulating movie!","review":"There really wasn't the best acting in this movie, but the impressions, camera work, and direction were amazing! The use of sound and color really added something special to the direction. For anyone who's actually done drugs before, this movie is like a chemically-induced experience. It makes you understand and feel like you're involved with the movie. There was a lot more here than just Jennifer Connelly's pretty face (although she is the most attractive junkie I've ever seen). Check this movie out, it's great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A you must own","review":"An incredible movie, you should get it as your collection, this is a masterpiece requiem for a dream a great movie"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great movie!","review":"Despite of the raw content of the movie, I give this movie 5 stars because the director of the film is able to show the underground world where people may be left while consuming any kind of drugs.

Therefore, Requiem for a Dream is a highly recommended movie and its quality just awesome."},{"rating":"1","title":"As bad as it gets","review":"I can not imagine it being any more obvious and two dimensional.

Please don't preach about the directing in this movie, it doesn't take a genius to build up suspense with such a blantantly obvious plot. How could things not go wrong with a group of people all getting mixed up with drugs. This is like a childrens book mixed up with Shakespeare. The only reason it is so popular is because anyone including my 4 year old nephew can piece together the symbolism and themes of this movie. This movie reminds me of Romeo and Juliet, although a thousand times better than this movie, because it is so widely read and hailed only because it is the easiest Shakespeare to identify with and analyze. I feel bad even comparing Romeo and Juliet to this horrible movie because it has that much more meaning and storyline to it than RFAD. Only buy this movie if you are interessted in learning about the falsified drug world pictured here or you want to scare people into not doing drugs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rubbish","review":"There are compelling things about this film that others have commented on: more power to them. From an objective and pragmatic point of view, this film was rubbish. It's about drug abuse. So what? It's not entertaining, nor thought provoking. What it IS, however, is disturbing and disgusting: coming from a horror fan, that's saying a lot. There's absolutely no reason to ever watch this film again. Sure, people go through bad things like the events portrayed in this film, but having once seen it (regrettably so), I would not recommend it, nor watch it ever again. That is my primary means of estimating the rating of a film, on my desire to watch it again. 1-star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Emotional Sickness","review":"I am not weak and I like movies that can emote remote depressive feelings in me. Somehow this movie with absolutely impacting dark nature didnt manage to entertain me. Sometimes our sub conscious mind exerts extreme nightmares on our brain and there are times when we feel we just came out of the worst feeling ever.I have once felt the same feeling of drowning within yourself and yet everything being more unreal than comprehension. I have not seen a more dark film in my life. The best way to describe it is \\"black\\" owing to its extreme....A certain character in the film rots in the worst way. A fridge can be extreme torture. I really felt emotionally sick while watching those scenes. However I somehow could not contain myself in that period of time where I saw the film.PLEASE READ:However I noticed a lot of people liked this film but in my (not)humble opinion, watch this if you know what addiction can do and are willing to see something of as dark nature as this.Enjoy what works"},{"rating":"1","title":"No Idea","review":"My daughter says she loved the movie.

I watched it over 3 days in my health class. This movie really shows how drugs affect one. The drugs that people become addicted to are not always illegeal. Each one of my classmates left the classroom being moved by this movie. We have all been told that drugs are evil, but I think this movie made a real impact on us. Hopefully its message will last longer than 10 minutes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for a rental, but not for a buy","review":"Requiem for a dream is the greatest movie about drug addiction I have ever seen. It depicts the life of four individuals as they spiral further and further down from their addiction. It is so detailed and graphic in its depiction that it is truly frightening. Although it is utterly brilliant, buying this DVD for repeated viewing is overkill. If you watch it more than once, it is useless. Everyone, go out and rent this movie, watch it to get the experience, but don't buy it. You won't want to see it more than once. It gets four stars for being a brilliant film, but the purpose of buying the DVD is so you can watch it over and over again, which with this movie, you don't want to do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heavy-handed with nothing at all to recommend it","review":"While lonely widow Burstyn goes on a downward spiral to hell after becoming addicted to television and diet pills, her son, along with his friend and girlfriend suffer the same treatment through their addictions to heroine. Starts off with the flimsy hollowness of a sophisticated soap opera, then becomes nothing more than one long, heavy-handed, unwatchable drug trip, focusing more on creating heinously grotesque visuals rather than actually adding any new insight to the topic except \\"drugs ruin your life\\". Although this was celebrated by many, some may strike this as being Aronofsky's unforgivable excuse for making a purely ugly, shock-fest. Drug addiction depicted as bombastic and visualistic without creating any sense of true realism. Watch at own risk."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can see how some would rate this a 5! Very Depressing!!!","review":"I could easily give this film 5 stars. I didn't hate it and I didn't like it. I love horror and comedy. I never liked serious movies about the tragedies of life and I despise depressing. This movie was DEPRESSING! I am talking...it grabs you by the eyeballs and drags you 150mph into a world you'd rather not ever visit and leaves you there. It was also just a plain old damn good movie too. The actors were believable and the filmwork was superb. I felt like I was thrust into the minds of the druggies and it wasn't fun. Ellen Burstyn...my god...what an actress. I loved/hated seeing the deterioration of that poor woman. Bottom line...I had to watch the Exorcist right after this just to feel clean!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Before you watch this movie ...","review":"Before you watch this movie, here is something to think about ...Most people who watch it consider it to be bleak and depressing. Others, who were not moved by the plight of the characters just found it boring and annoying.So it seems like the very best you can possibly hope for after watching this movie is to feel bored and annoyed. Well, I'll give it 2 stars because I guess some people probably need to see it. I mean, if you're actually dumb enough to consider using, then maybe there's something in it for you. Otherwise, if watching a movie about people destroying their lives via drug addiction doesn't sound like your idea of a good time, I'd give it a pass.But if you still want to see this movie, I'd just rent it. It's sort of like watching a documentary about the Nazi concentration camps and the horrors therein; I can't imagine why any person who is not emotionally disturbed would want to watch it more than once."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some good basic instruction here...","review":"I believe this book is good for beginners as it instructs the reader on how to analyze pigments (transparent, staining and opaque)and how they will behave. Most beginners do not know about these pigment characteristics, so from that standpoint alone it is a good investment for your library.

I sent the book back to Amazon because it was so bad. I have only sent one other book back to Amazon and that includes over a hundred I have purchased over the years.This book offers nothing to the artist. The book is a presentation of the artist's work and not much more. All the glowing reports of teaching you how to paint negative space are fine, but that is about all the book shows the student. And you can learn a lot more about negative space in Drawing On The Right Side of the Brain and Keys to Drawing than you can learn here.If you want to look at paintings by this artist (Linda Kemp) go ahead and buy the book, but if you are looking for art instruction look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"ideas on negative painting","review":"this book has lots of new ways to use negative painting skills and helps you produce a different style of work.this is very exciting and encourages even the inexperienced painter with exercises to practise.the only downside is the large amount of space given to very basic and boring instruction on composition and page design."},{"rating":"1","title":"Before you swallow the hype read all of the reviews!","review":"I totally agree with the couple of reviews where the book was sent back to Amazon. Some of the reviews are positively glowing and just why is beyond my comprehension, The book offers (as do most watercolor instruction books)considerable sound advice about supplies and composition etc etc etc but the pictures SUCK! It is difficult for me to believe this is a professional artist (presuming making a living on this humdrum output.) She has a vey limited palette mostly autumnal browns and golds and mostly very small (8x8 and 12x12) pictures that are a hash and rehash of weeds leaves and branches,,sometimes a watercolor book is so astoundingly beautiful it is worth having just to admire the pics,,,well,,,not this one!

Yes, I can charge batteries in the charger I happen to have for my cordless drill - but that's not the point. Black and Decker no longer carries replacements, so you are stuck trying to track one down from a service center. The nearest service center is not that near at all (and I live in a major CA city). I tried, without luck. Now that the charger does not work, it is not really that convenient. It is pretty new too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only one complaint...","review":"Each time I would use this hand vac when someone was visiting, they would always comment on how strong of a suction this hand vac had. Everyone thought it was so amazing how well it picked up, and I agree. I also never realized how much of a convenience it would be to have the tools right onboard. That is a great feature that most hand vacs do not have. This is my only complaint: I had this hand vac for over two years and then the battery could no longer recharge. At first, I could get 15-20 minutes of vacuuming done at one time. But, slowly, the battery started to lose its ability to recharge until it wouldn't recharge at all. I could not find a replacement battery anywhere so I gave up and decided to get a new hand vac. The ONLY reason I didn't choose this same vacuum again is because I wanted to find a hand vac that had a battery that can be replaced."},{"rating":"2","title":"TALK ABOUT A MIGHTY MITE!","review":"There's nothing handier for quick clean-ups than this small wonder. I especially like the inclusion of a crevice tool and upholstery brush. As a cat owner, I've found one of the most daunting tasks is cleaning cat hair off our feline's favorite chair. This DustBuster does it in a trice. It seemed to me if it could do that, it could do anything. I haven't tried anything yet, but the crevice tool located peanuts that a guest accidentally lost in our sofa. Maybe best of all is its ease of use - I can whip it out and clean up in the time it takes an unexpected visitor to walk from the curb to our front door. It's one of our favorite appliances."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk, not made to last!","review":"My Dustbuster lasted a whole two years, but the last year it would only work for 3-4 minutes before the charge ran out. I found myself running like a maniac to quickly clean up a mess before the battery ran down. It also has low suction, so heavier things like sand don't get sucked up completely. This is one of several Black & Decker appliances I have been dissappointed with in the last few years. From the product lifespan, to the lack of customer service - they aren't the same company my parents loved. My mother had one of the earliest dustbusters which lasted 10 years, and charged like a champ. Oh well.Instead, I recommend the Euro-Pro shark. I have had one for a while now, and love it. It has a very long cord, it's lightweight, and it has enough suction to pick up small children and pets! It cost a little more than the Black & Decker Dustbuster, and outperforms it completely. And if you can't rely on your hand vaccuum, then the price is irrelevant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another piece of Dustbuster junk.","review":"Don't waste your money on this or any other \\"dustbuster\\" vaccum. This is the 3rd one I've owned, lukily it was a gift, so I didn't waste my money on it. The problem is that Black & Decker still uses NiCad batteries, which develop a memory if you don't completely discharge before you recharge (and when do you ever do that with a dustbuster?) The result is a vaccum that works OK for about 6 months, but then works for about 1-2 minutes before the battery goes dead. For a few pennies more they could use a NiMH battery pack, and maybe this thing would work. Until then, I reccoment a corded Dirt Devil Scorpion. Having to pull an extension cord is well work having a vaccum that actually works."},{"rating":"1","title":"PLZ!!!!!!!

After only a few months of having it (and cleaning it diligently) the motor stopped running. I tried everything--charging it, looking at the motor, and it's dead.

Previously I had been using the right-handed Trackman, but over the years my right hand has become sore when I use it too often, so I started looking at this type of trackball.The lack of the scroll wheel bothered me a bit so I ended up getting a Kensington Turbo Trackball which did have a scroll wheel. Big mistake that was!! Its design is so inferior to this Logitech, the ball falls out way too easily, and the scroll wheel is totally useless. What a waste of cash!I didn't hesitate to pick up one of these instead and I knew as soon as I plugged it in that I should have gone with this one right from the start. The size is perfect and it's very easy to use in either hand. Your hand will curve around the body very naturally, and little movement of the fingers is needed to control the ball. GREAT product, I'll be getting more for the rest of my comps soon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this trackball!","review":"I've always used a trackball because using a mouse drives me crazy trying to get the cursor in the right place. I was afraid they wouldn't make them anymore because most people prefer a mouse so I have one I use and one for a spare. I don't like the touchpad on my laptop so I use the trackball. This one fits my hand really well. Some of the other trackballs are so wide they are uncomfortable for a woman to use. It's especially good for use on a smaller desk because you don't need a mouse pad. I would recommend it to anyone...and I've used one for years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Discontinued","review":"This item is a discontinued item and if you have a problem Logitech will not help you. Suggest you get the less expensive one which IS still manufactured."},{"rating":"2","title":"Let the cat play with your old mouse.","review":"I hate mice..optical, ball, wheel or wireless. They all require you to have space on the desk to move them around. This optical marble takes up slightly more space then a tradional mouse and all you do is move you finger tips on the large ergonomically placed ball. Very responsive and a new feature the page up/down buttons make this a great little device for surfing the internet or getting around your Word documents.So chuck your mouse on the floor and upgrade (at a great price on Amazon) to the Logitech Optical Marble. You won't be sorry and your wrist and desktop will love you for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"removable ball","review":"i like the removeable ball a lot, its kinda fun just rolling it around the desk when im bored. also the product in itself is pretty useful. i used to have carpal tunnel syndrome in my left pointer finger but since you dont have to use that finger it helped a lot."},{"rating":"1","title":"None","review":"See other reviews.

I own an Apple MacBook Pro using VMWare Fusion. One of the problems with using a mouse that has software to control special functions is that it doesn't work very well when you move from one enviornment to another.I expected as much with this device, the software for the Mac would not work in the Windows enviornment and I would have to install the Windows version on the Windows VM. To my surprise, this was not necessary. I only had to install on the Mac. The transition from one enviornment to another was not a problem, I could move the mouse pointer between the two enviornments with the same amount of control and no loss of synch or speed. The scroll buttons work perfectly in both enviornments, again with no loss of synch or speed."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a good one","review":"This one works well for me; I like the large ball, the way it fits under my (average sized) hand and the smoothness of the action. It took me a while to get used to the little scroll buttons, but now I can activate them without thinking about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Returned it; couldn't get used to index finger trackball","review":"I had this less than a day when I returned the product and went back to a traditional thumb-based trackball. I couldn't get used to the placement of the ball under the index finger and just couldn't get the kind of pointer precision I needed. Plus it felt uncomfortable.

No wonder I have made a right choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Repetitive Stress Injuries","review":"I've been using this mouse for a few years and I love the layout of the buttons and the ball. I have tendonitis in my right arm and being able to use this mouse has saved my arm and let me continue to use the computer. I tried the other trackball style with the ball under the thumb but it caused as much pain as a normal mouse, so I recommend this mouse for people with any sort of mouse related repetitive stress injury.This mouse is also more accurate and smoother than a normal mouse.

I'm glad to see that Logitech is SMART and is continuing to make this. I am here right now because I'm about to buy a few for my Atlanta relatives.When I am forced to use a regular mouse, it is SO ANNOYING because half the time you have to move the mousepad and mouse all over the place just to get the cursor where you want it.NOT HERE. The mouse stays stationary and you roll the ball which moves the cursor. Simple as pie. The mouse never moves.Dump the traditional mouse and buy this mouse. You won't be sorry.

I'm still using it, even though my other computer died.My trackball has two buttons instead of the four listed on this one. But it still works great. The only thing that faded was the logo on the base from continual use. And unlike other *mice* you can very easily lift the ball out, get the dirt off, and pop it back on.I've tried other lazer mice without the ball on top.

I need a trackball mouse to use with my left hand. The Logitech Optical Marble Mouse caused stress on my hand within a couple of hours. From a design point of view, the trackball is too small and requires at least twice the rotations in order to move the pointer across my monitors. The shape of the mouse is too small for a man's hand to rest on. I just can't understand why Logitech stopped production of the Trackman Marble FX which is still being sold continuously on Ebay. So there is obviously a demand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for smaller hands","review":"Do not buy this mouse or other Logitechs with similar designs if you have small hands. The long sloping design will strain your wrist. Even with a wrist rest.

I find the marble much more precise than a mouse and it's great for our desk with limited space. Keep in mind that there is a bit of a learning curve with trackballs as you're manipulating the cursor with a completely different set of movements so it's bound to take some time."},{"rating":"2","title":"good trackball, but no wheel and drivers can be stupid on thinkpads","review":"The trackball is unbeatable. I love the feeling, but it has no scrolling wheel. That's the one star off.Now the MouseWare from Logitech is supposed to solve this by making you hold down both buttons and use the ball as the wheel, but it has some conflict with the ThinkPad trackpoint driver on my ThinkPads. I end up uninstalling Mouseware.But still, this is a great trackball. I am keeping it.

I don't know if this is an indicator of quality, but it really doesn't matter to me. I'd had the mouse for two or three years before that, and at $22, if I have to buy a new one every couple of years, it still seems cost effective. Mice don't last forever (I used to use a $99 Kensington TrackBall, and that lasted around five years or so).It works great with Mac OS X (Leopard).

This isn't it. Though it is similar to the Logitech Trackman wheel (for right hands), the scroll functions are put into two seperate buttons, instead of one wheel. So for any of you who have programs with functions built into pressing the scroll wheel, it just doesn't work. Also, the track ball in the center is not as ergonimic as it should be, as you use fingers instead of thumb to control."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but gamers may have to be careful","review":"This is a very high quality functional product from Logitech, with good ergonomics and configurable buttons. Most concerns about this product have been mentioned already but I would like to identify a few caveats:1. Gunk that gets on the trackball will accumulate in the ball \\"socket,\\" so clean it out every once in a while.2. You are using a completely different set of muscles and movements compared to a mouse. This may be good for some people and bad for others.3. The fundamental difference is that a mouse is primarily a wrist-controlled device, while is is a finger-controlled devices. Generally, the response and control with your wrist is greater, which MAY lead to problems for gamers. How you choose to adapt to one or the other is up to you, much like how some console gamers prefer joysticks versus control pads. Switching to a trackball will get you a huge drop in precision until you get used to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing a vital function","review":"I was dissapointed with this product. The main reason is that there is no scroll wheel which I use constantly throughout the day. Therefore I resold this mouse to a friend who did not mind the missing function.

You should know that the online help from Logitech is generic--so that it sort of covers all Logitech mice, including two and three button mice, as well as all types of trackballs. Therefore, you will find very little in the online help that is specific for the Marble Trackball.Someone on the Web has created a freeware download program that you install to make your Marble Trackball zoom in and out. If you already own a Marble Trackball, and need to zoom in and out, just keep looking on the Web until you find the download. Someone solved the problem that the SetPoint software from Logitech does not solve."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product!","review":"I have had this item for about 5 years now and absolutely LOVE it!

By that, I mean I can feel the friction from the three underlying tabs.It would help to have some sort of scroll bar too.All in all, this mouse has imperfections, but the enjoyment of using it surpasses the minor annoyances that are sometimes encountered."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sure","review":"If you like this kind of mouse, this is the best deal I could find online.

I had one like it that worked great for over five years before the buttons quit working smoothly. So I bought a new one but it hasn't worked properly since day one.

Junk!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Marble Mouse Not a Man","review":"This is a cheap trackball mouse and not as good as the Microsoft trackball mouse that costs much more. The small ball moves too easily, and it is hard to be accurate. Since it is cheap, I didn't bother returning it. I expected more from Logitech."},{"rating":"1","title":"This thing is HUGE!","review":"If your hand is very very big, like the size of a catcher's mitt, probably this thing will work for you as a computer mouse. Otherwise it's just another large blunt object, not even heavy enough to be a paperweight. And it's ugly. This thing is going straight back to Amazon. Yuk!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Possibly the best mouse ever!","review":"At first the track ball is a bit awkward but after about a day of use, you will never want to use a typical mouse again! There is no pad, they last forever, never skip or jump like dirty mice do and they can fit in a very small space on your desk and since the mouse isn't moving around your hand never bumps into things or goes off of the mouse pad.This is really a great improvement on regular mice!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant!","review":"If you're one of those people who get annoyed with the touchpad on your laptop, then you need one of these. It's so easy to get used to and comfortable to use. The only downside to it is that the scroll buttons aren't that well placed. Overall it's great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"We now have TWO of these","review":"I only rate it 4 stars because I would have to reserve the 5th star for the Microsoft Trackball Explorer. That thing is unbelievable, and alas they don't make it anymore. You can still get one, but it's $500 now.The Marble Mouse is superb, and good for both north paws and south paws. Unlike some trackballs, this one has the ball under the fingertip where it belongs. So many have them under the thumb, but that's just not as comfortable. As a friend says, you point with your finger not your thumb. The Marble Mouse has you pointing with your finger. Fits the hand pretty well. So much better than moving a mouse around your table-top. You will not regret getting this trackball. I recommend it without reservation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best controlling device, bar none","review":"This is the absolute best device for controlling your computer. I've used these for over 10 years, and have owned over 4 now. They are all *still* working. Of all my vast numbers of computer equipment, this is the ONLY thing that survives. I absolutely love this thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Little more than junk","review":"It has been years since I bought anything made by Logitech. Past experiences were that Logitech devices just stopped working after a few months, couldn't get support, and had to pay more for new drivers than I paid for the device itself. But I took a chance on this because I liked the feel of it and needed a new trackball after changing jobs. Well that was a mistake. After about six weeks the motion started getting jerky and then just stopped. Cleaning didn't help. I won't make this mistake again - Logitech makes junk."},{"rating":"2","title":"DVD Tray would not open.","review":"I started to use the marble mouse to give my thumbs a rest from a regular mouse.After recently installing the logitech driver, my dvd tray would not open from the keyboard button. I had to push the button on the tray itself to open it.I did not associate the two until after doing some research I found out that the problem might be caused by some software taking over control of the dvd tray eject function.I checked my keyboard properties and discovered that the keyboard driver was logitech. I knew this didn't come with my HP computer, so clicked on \\"rollback driver.\\" This rolled it back to the HP keyboard driver.DVD tray now opens from the keyboard button.Hope this helps anyone who has the same problem.By the way, Marble Mouse is still working fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting mouse","review":"I have never seen one of these before but decided to try it because I was tired of continually having to lift up and shake my old, plain mouse.Well, it was a little larger than I expected when I first saw it.

It cannot be programmed to simulate the Apple mouse's scrolling feature. Hence one star, BUT:Using it with a Windows-based PC it deserves 5 stars. I have been using the older ball plus two-button mouse for 5 years and was very disappointed that I cannot use the newer four-button one with my new iMac OS 10.5. A new driver called LCC 2.6 does not repair that defect, nor will Logitech reply to comments or complaints in this regard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible ergonimic design","review":"I bought this mouse thinking it would eliminate the finger pain I suffer in my left click finger. Although the trackball allows you to avoid using your left click finger it causes pain and stiffness in the rest of the fingers because of the poor ergonomic design. I find my self tensing most of my fingers to hold them off the right click button to avoid accidentally right clicking which happens quite often. This is because of its ambidextrous design. This was a waste of money. It may be good for a casual user of mice but not for someone who uses a mouse 8 hours a day as their profession. I've gone back to using my Evoluent mouse which isn't perfect either but causes me much less pain. Do not buy this mouse if your RSI problem is in your fingers. I am now looking for a foot pedal mouse instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Make sure you want a trackball mouse!","review":"While the product works well as a a trackball mouse, I found it lacking in precision compared to a traditional optical mouse.

I have several mice and trackballs from logitech and all function perfectly with the same setpoint software. Only this mouse gives problems and crashes setpoint. It happens consistendly on both my PCs.The ball is large and comfortable to use. Buttons are large. But in this time and age, you need a dedicated scrolling wheel somewhere on a mouse or trackball.Having to press both buttons to activate scrolling is definitely tedious.Try the wireless trackman instead or if you prefer using your fingers rather than the thumb for moving the ball.....the optical trackman."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smooth ball, but the software and shape is for the birds!","review":"I was used to using a Kensington Orbit - maybe I'm spoiled - but it seems crazy that this Marble Mouse doesn't let you assign a separate command for the pressing of 2 buttons at once. It's also crazy that you can't have different button configurations for different applications. Having to choose between 1X, 2X, or 4X mouse speed was kind of silly too, since even Apple's standard mouse driver gives you more options than that. Maybe the software is better for Windows and that's why people keep using these? I returned it the day after I bought it and bought another Orbit (which is also much more hand-shaped than this odd tall design). The Orbit feels like you are resting your hand on your knee - this feels more like youre resting your hand on a shaved rat with rigormortis."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite mouse","review":"Needs little desk space, never sticks, and my cat likes to chase the ball.

For someone that has little experience with finishing, the video allows them to see finishes being applied. Someone beyond the basics will be disappointed.The author shows you how to apply oil, water and alcohol finishes but spends very little if any time discussing the problems encountered with different stains/dyes. In addition, the video quality is poor which prevents you from seeing any detail.If you have ever applied a stain, or dye to a project and was not satisfied with the appearance (color or surface quality) you need to look elsewhere for solutions. A couple of good finishing books are \\"Understanding Wood Finishing\\" by Bob Flexner and \\"Great Wood Finishes\\" by Jeff Jewitt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Careful preparation = good results","review":"As a minor correction to another review, the video deomonstrates French Polish using padding lacquer, not traditional shellac. Other topics covered are stripping and refinishing antique furniture; spray lacquer; hand rubbed oil; staining; waxing and polishing; padded shellac; and brushed varnish. Quite some time, perhaps appropriately repetitively, is spent on surface preparation, both initial and between coats.

The actors looked uncomfortable with each other."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly prententious without delivering","review":"I was determined to make it to the end but I should not have been wanting the film to just be done. The writer seems to have forgotten where the plot was supposed to go. Scenes and actions and the choices that the characters make should be derived from the story's thesis---what was the writer's argument about life? The writer knew the answers at the beginning and then forgot.I was bored throughout. I got tired of staring at the main character's depressed and confused facial expressions.The main character had no direction in her life but plenty of commitment to self-centeredness. Worst of all, I did not respect her. Life just came along and pushed her into choices instead of her being a deliberate actor on her own behalf. Who was she? Where was her determination and sense of purpose? And, finally, as far as the plot conclusion goes, where were the inevitable consequences for her lack of self-determination and purpose?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nonsensical","review":"This film is annoying. I generally think Michelle Williams makes good choices, but I can't understand what she saw in this material. I didn't care for any of the characters, and the story is inane."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible, Terrible, Terrible","review":"This is strictly one of the worst films I have ever seen. The female lead in this film acts completely selfishly, which would be fine, but there is no real justification to her actions given or shown to the audience. This single bit of information is more than enough to make the main character instantly unlikable and therefore make the movie dreary, dull, and downright painful to watch.Avoid this non-sense at all costs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth seeing","review":"The story frustrates on the certain level - the main character might just have to get a full time job to fill all the free time she has to feel sad (not to be confused with clinical depression), though I can relate (remember having pretty similar feelings in my late 20s, being in the similar relationship). There is not a hint at any kind intellectual or spiritual activity, which is strange. But the movie is nicely shot, with convincing acting by very enjoyable Michelle Williams (I am a huge fan since her Brokeback Mountain role) and both male leads. It worked for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heartbreaking, wistful, pain-in-your-chest wrenching","review":"This movie made it hard for me to breathe. I was just so poignant and heart-wrenching that I found myself holding my breath so I wouldn't spontaneously burst into sobs. Then other parts were so adorable and cute and funny that you almost laugh but never quite come close because the sobs that didn't break out are still hovering in the background. That sounds dramatic but in truth, I could so easily relate to what Margot had to go through and what she inevitably ended up with in return...It's hard to say too much without giving away any major plot points. In any event, wonderful movie. I though the part where Lou was rocketing through the 52 emotions at the table was the only major poor spot. Way too forced and hardly believable at all. You'll see what I mean."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the WORST ever!","review":"If I could give the movie a (-) Star I would. Gloomy, too much nudity and explicit sex. Acting is terrible, too.

The dialogue was so completely unrealistic and forced and the main character was annoying. The interactions between both the husband and wife and the wife and the new guy were so unnatural and not what would really happen. The public pool shower scene put the nail in the coffin for us and we shut it off there.

If you expect entertainment....you might bedisappointed, but if you watch it without expectation you will find substance.

I just felt uncomfortably awkward watching most of the interaction in this movie. My fiance and I watch our fair share of movies good and bad. When we are listening to dialogue and are like \\"what?!\\", the movie isn't that great. At one point, we decided that watching other couple's inside jokes and silly, weird conversations just isn't as much fun as having our own together. I generally don't mind nudity in movies when it has a purpose, but the women's locker room scene was unneeded to me. It served no purpose to the plot of the movie but to only be \\"daring\\" and \\"artsy\\". I definitely won't be recommending this to anybody as much as I wanted to like it because I really like the cast."},{"rating":"1","title":"Turned it off.","review":"We could not get into it.

I can't say the same thing for Michelle Williams' character. Overall, this film was pretty weird but kept my interest throughout it's long running time. There was a weird nude shower scene with obese older ladies and a lot of the dialogue almost seemed improvised on the spot rather than off a script. Michelle Williams even made random weird facial contortions in one scene. I can't say I'd recommend this film unless you're a fan of either Rogen or Williams.

I hate the decision Margo made, and I really hated the end - pretty much everything after she made the decision, including the gratuitous weird sex part which, in and of itself, would have been fine I suppose, but I was still stunned by the aforementioned stunningly bad decision and it was too jarring and bizarre after that blow. The last time Margo talked to the Seth Rogen character made me cry, not because I was moved by the relationship or their connection, but because her decision was just so damned awful and it made me sad. I usually love movies like this, and I will say that it was visually beautiful and well-acted and a great vehicle for Michelle Williams. But I really wish Margo had listened to the Sarah Silverman character."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointless","review":"Kept waiting for a plot to unfold.

In fact, it ended quite abruptly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some really good acting squandered on this","review":"Odd, you know Seth Rogen's character is the only one that isn't two-dimensional. I would have given it one star were it not that the film does illustrate a good point, underscored by one of the supporting characters lines: \\"New things get old\\". If your happiness depends upon others, you are most likely headed for a long road of disappointments and despair.One other note I'd make is this film has a strange feeling toward the end that despite being overly long, a lot of important stuff has been edited out. You may walk away feeling like did - as if I had just drunkenly run over someone's trash cans, wondering where the hell did they come from, and what am I doing out here anyway?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Take This Waltz...and Shove it?","review":"Michele Williams turns in a nuanced performance, however, Seth Rogen love him or hate him is always Seth Rogen. I think this film misses the mark due to the lack of a credible agonist / antagonist which undermines the cadence and credibility of this film. She is in actuality torn be between two drones yet we are to believe sparks are flying? The trouble is no chemistry. It may be that the scripted characters were 2-D cut outs or possibly the actors brought no heft to their roles( I suspect a little of both) The female lead is reacting to dead space as though she were a mime and in the end you are left feeling that for all of her struggle there simply was nothing to be gained. It feels quirky, yet ultimately incongruent and unsatisfying....and lonnng. In the dead of space no one can hear your angst."},{"rating":"2","title":"More a drama than a comedy, but enjoyable","review":"This is definitely a Michelle Williams movie, not a typical Seth Rogen movie. It's nice to see Seth playing more serious role, he does it well. Michelle tends to take roles that involve a character who's not sure if she's happy or unhappy in her marriage, and this is no exception. She does it well, though. They do a good job of developing the characters and giving you a feel of who they truly are. The overall cinematography is well executed and keeps a fresh perspective. Don't come into this movie expecting a lot of laughs, it's definitely more of a \\"chick flick.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Don't waste your money.

I kind of like Michelle Williams and of course I like Seth Rogen and Sarah Silverman rocks, but, man oh man, this movie just inches along, driving me crazy. I'm sick of the babytalk between Michelle and Seth's characters and I don't think the neighbor is sexy at all and it's hard to believe she never noticed her directly across the street neighbor and Seth's character isn't developed at all. He sure looks hotter than in previous movies, though! Michelle's character looks like she is in existential agony all the time. I feel like hurling her or my own exhausted head against the wall!

The songs are hypnotic beats, very underplayed, with full jszz improvisation. This is not light jazz, believe me. It's jazz over house beats. One song even starts off paying tribute to the world wide DJ's of house. It is jazz, house, dub. That's the best way to define what this listen is. If you're a bebop purist, stay away.

I have never in my life yet experienced any sort of PC crashes, so I was more that shocked when the item i purchased to prevent the headaches and hassle crapped out on me after only 3 months. Emailing SimpleTech didn't work either as they don't have any way to fix the device, I'd have to shell out big bucks to get the data recovered and then mail it out to them to be replaced. No deal. Bye bye 75GB worth of video clips and pictures.Unfortunately, I wasn't around when my mom was shopping for another external a year later, and she brings home another SimpleTech 500GB.

Well, after months of trying to make it work and not give errors, I have replaced it. I am in the process at the moment of trying to retrieve files off the drive, and it looks like I am going to lose quite a few of my files.

There are no drivers (except for Win98), because they're not needed.Several hours of research later, I've learned that this is a VERY common problem with these drives. Try a Google search for \\"Simpletech not recognized,\\" and you'll find page after page of people who've had the same problem I have.

So I haven't really lost any data, just the money spent on an unreliable product. Should have paid more attention to the one-star reviews here. I wonder how many of the people writing five-star reviews have owned their SimpleTech drive only a short time.

I loved it at first, but soon started getting errors and notices the drive was corrupt. I put in a service request with SimpleTech, but have NEVER been contacted by them.

However, I will never purchase anything they make again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't trust your data to this drive","review":"Like others, I read most of the reviews here and took the negative reviews with a grain of salt. Big mistake. I have owned this drive for four months now and it worked perfectly for 3 months and 3 weeks. Now my PC won't recognize the drive. This has happened 3 times in the last few weeks - each time I reformatted the drive and backed up my PC again. It would work OK for a couple of days and then it failed. NOTHING !!! This drive is UNRELIABLE. Only purchase this drive if you don't mind losing the data you store on it - rather pointless. I completed an RMA on the Simpletech web site but based on other reviews here I will be surprised if they respond. I have absolutely NO CONFIDENCE in this drive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quick Death Guaranteed","review":"The first died after 2.5 months.

So I offloaded all I could and tried a format of the drive. Failed 7 times. No diagnostic software provided by manufacturer. It's as if they are relying on other drive manufacturers to provide it. Only a basic user guide is provided on their 'support' CD. Poor support.After downloading and running Seagate's Seatools, the long generic test FAILED. Why couldn't Simpletech have such a BASIC tool.I would NOT recommend buying this drive under ANY circumstance. Poor initial quality if it won't even format.

However, one drive didn't spin. (No vibration even though the power indicator was on.) Another drive didn't mount. I tried both drives on two Macs. No luck. I didn't want to risk opening the last drive. The person at the store's return & exchange department checked one drive, and he couldn't connect it to the store's PC.

It will make a chirping/growling noise, and your computer will not recognize it. So, after trying to make sure my data was safe after a harddrive crashed in my brand new laptop, I was stupid enough not to retrieve ALL saved data from the external, and now all that was not saved is gone forever.

I'd say almost the same about sailor's interviews.It would be a good book with an another title: the Complete History of Laser Sailing.If you're looking a way to improve your sailing technique, choose something else:RYA Laser HandbookorThe Laser Campaign Manual"},{"rating":"1","title":"There are better choices","review":"This book covers a lot of basics, but was not well-updated since its original publication.

The music is delightful - very authentic to that period of time.

It make parallels with a crazy time in American pop history when boy bands like in the film were the fixation of the nation. The Wonders(the band in the film) could be compared in some ways to the Beatles because the hysteria around the fictional band does match the real life band but there is one fundamental difference. The band in the film is a one hit wonder because they break-up before the film is over. Great music, love, and great star power make \\"That Thing You Do\\" a real fun-loving movie that captures a huge part of American culture as we see one simple band through fate and one awesome song go from nobodies to the most desired men in the country in a short time.

I bought it solely for the title track and figured the other tracks would be a bonus.Unfortunately, the live versions of the song in the movie outshine the slickly produced versions on the CD. As I listened to \\"That Thing You Do\\" (Track 2), I thought that maybe the \\"live\\" version (Track 15) would be more like the raw and powerful movie versions. Alas, it sounds just like Track 2 with some applause and screaming overdubbed. Even the version they played at the talent show (in the movie), mistakes and all, is better. Oh well.The soundtrack is saved by real gems like \\"Voyage Around the Moon\\", a poppy, surf-guitar-driven number and the catchy \\"I Need You\\". \\"Dance with Me\\" is a lot of fun, too!

However he started as a rock'n'roller, turned swinger turned cowboy country singer, and all periods are covered on this exellent cd. Though Darin's waek points were hsi ballad singing, but that isn't what thsi collection focuses on, most of the tunes swing weather they be rockabilly infused rock'n'roll, swingin' big band pieces, Ray Charles style r&b, or country and western. This cd includes the two most essential Darin pieces Beyond The Sea, and Mack The Knife, also included is a swingin' versions of Artificial Flowers, which sums up Darin at his very bast rockin' hard backed b ya swingin' band!!! Exellent compialtion."},{"rating":"2","title":"More Talented and Versatile then Elvis and Sinatra combined!","review":"If you're new to Bobby Darin, as I was just a year ago, this CD is the perfect introduction to his awe-inspiring talent. It demonstrates how he refused to stay confined to one genre of music, as so many of his show business peers did at the time. Whether you are into early rock 'n' roll, swing, jazz, country-western, or folk, this CD has something on it to satisfy everyone, although personally it's hard for me to choose my favorite. I just wish that he had scored more hit singles after 1967, which is when he started to dabble heavily in folk and late 60s socially conscious rock and roll. Bobby Darin was a genius, and this CD never fails to perk my spirits up. Thank you Mr. Darin and God bless you.

Horrible, especially considering that the word \\"Stereo\\" is plastered across the cover of his \\"That's All\\" album where Mack the Knife and Beyond the Sea were recorded.I suppose if you have one speaker, it would not make a difference, but PLEASE.

This set also includes the British top ten hits Lazy river, Clementine and Multiplication and the American top ten hits, Splish splash and Queen of the hop.

Not expected to live past age 16, Bobby managed to squeeze an extra 21 years and become a legend before hit 25, just like he planned.This 20 song collection of Bobby's biggest hits doesn't even begin to cover Bobby's wide musical landscape, which ranged from rock to pop to showtunes. But if you wnet a solid primer for beginning Bobby fans, then this disc is simply awesome. Every major hit from Bobby is included here. From the frnetic energy of \\"Splish Splash\\" to the tender longing of \\"Dream Lover\\" to the timeless appeal of \\"Mack The Knife\\" and \\"Beyond The Sea\\" to the folksy contemplation of \\"If I Were A Carpenter\\", every hit single Bobby scored is here, and in excllent sound quality and packaging.This is an affordable and easy to find collection of Bobby's biggest hits."},{"rating":"1","title":"JUNK!","review":"The screw holes on these hinges are swagged out on the wrong side (not as pictured) making them virtually impossible to use on any application that I know of.

Although Ms Walsh's additions are fictional, they are also extremely realistic, and I am sure much the same as Grace's were. Ms Walsh also captures her audience and keeps them in the palm of her hand throughout the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall, pretty good!","review":"Grace, by Jill Paton Walsh, was another one of those illustrious titles on my seventh-grade summer reading list. I bought it, and picked it up just 2 days ago to read for a discussion. Though I had heard things about it being \\"slow\\", \\"boring\\", and \\"confusing\\", I found none of these to be true. I whipped through the book in 2 days flat and was amazed at this heart-warming tale of heroism. Grace Darling, a 22-year-old daughter of a lighthouse keeper, was on the morning watch one stormy day when she sighted the wreck of the Forfarshire. She and her father rescued the survivors of the wreck, and Grace became a national hero. In this telling of the tale, the author weaves fact with fiction to tell a truly believeable tale of a young lady who, against all odds, saved 9 lives. The novel also tells the tale of Grace's life after the rescue- suddenly flung into the public eye of Great Britain. This book is a great read for young adults, and I reccommend it to all!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book for ages 10 on!","review":"I read this book for a school project, and once I'd read the 1st chapter I couldn't put it down!

One day Grace spots a wreck of the \\"Forfarshire,\\" despite the troublesome storm Grace abd her father set out to save the recks survivors.

Blue's Big Musical Movie Soundtrack has really taken me by surprise.

By the time it finally got to the part when they're going to put on their \\"musical\\" weall couldn't care less.

As a matter of fact, the images were so sharp, I could see the not-so-perfect compositing artistic errors on Steve's outline, which is something I could not pick up on VHS tapes.

The story is set around a musical that Blue will perform in. There are many good musical numbers throughout, including one with the voice of Ray Charles. Although this is titled as a movie, its really just a jazzed up longer version of the tv show with much better music and a longer storyline. As I mentioned above, if your kids like Blue's Clues, this is definitely worth buying for them.The DVD itself is okay, but since the home video cassettes for Blue's Clues are so inexpensive, I'm not sure this is a must have DVD if this is also available on video. The picture is full frame, the sound is dolby stereo but not 5.1. There are a few extras on the DVD such as music videos that are cute for the kids also."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Blues Clues production!","review":"I was having a hard time trying to find episodes with Steve for my 23 month old daughter who is a true Blues Clues fan! So I got this DVD.This is a fantastic movie which involves the regular problem solving part seen in espisodes and much more. Steve and the gang are putting together a show for the neigborhood and they need to get ready for it. Blue needs a singing partner so we play blue's clues to figure out who it should be. Side Table is too shy to say she wants to sing in the show as well and that part of the story is very well portrayed. There are many practical lessons for kids in this about not giving up, how being shy can prevent you from doing what you really want to do, etc. My favorite part is when Steve is trying to make his song and they explain notes, tempo, etc. Very well done!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Huge hit!","review":"For those of you with endless episodes of Blue's Clues on your DVR or TiVo, this movie is the perfect addition to your collection...not to mention, it's nice to have something different to play.

It's got everything that the 22 minute tv show has...just in an extended version. We are constantly signing the songs from the movie, which started actually out of the blue (no pun) by my daughter.

However, the prescription would not come under any insurance so take note that you still will have to pay it out of you own pocket. Anyway, since I have another toe nail starting to have the same looks of the fungus I had before I bought this product (even though the dose was less.)to avoid removal of the nail.

Bought off internet store, so didn't have high expectations. One review on the cover said 'For lovers of the macabre'. First off, it's written I believe by a British writer. So alot of British phrases are used which slowed up the read for me a little. 2nd, it's written like a diary. Totally in the 1st person. Maybe that is a classic style, but found it a very boring style. 3rd, he will say something in one paragraph and then the same thing in another paragraph just worded different. Didn't find the flow of the book to be very interesting. The ending, to me, went nowhere. The cover of the paperback and the reviews suck you in. But just found it to be alot of hype.

So we considered this Faberware 3 quart stainless steel saucepan to be appropriate. We were a little doubtful about its steel handles getting hot while cooking. But after the first use this doubt vanished. We are happy with its material which is quite thick, weight and also simple design. It does not have any unwanted fancy attachments and obtrusive handles and the flat base gives stability and fits well on the stove.We had seen similar sauce pans in Target for $20. So on Amazon we ended up saving $8. In addition since Amazon does not charge tax for our location there was a further saving of around $1.5, which is not bad, and the pan was delivered on the dot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Farberware Pot","review":"I love this pot. It cooks beautifully and cleans up in a snap. Since it's stainless steel you can scrub it but I haven't had to do much of that anyway since nothing seems to stick very hard and it always looks new. It's also the perfect size for sauces, beans, vegetables, etc for a small family. It's not too small, yet not tremendous. This pot only has one drawback and that's why I did not give it a 5. The handles are not coated in any way and are also stainless steel so they get too hot to touch. It's a bit annoying to always have to use a potholder when stirring or lifting the lid. I would definitely recommend it though. It's become one of my favorite pots."},{"rating":"1","title":"false statement, lid handle and pot handles are burning hot, not cool!!!","review":"This is the worst pot I have ever bought.

If I do, I'll do my best to forget I read the book -- even though Richard Price wrote the screenplay -- the better to judge the film on its own merits, rather than comparing it to the novel, against which no movie could conceivably compete. The time Richard Price spent immersed in New York's street-level drug culture translates effectively and persuasively here. The characters are fully realized and vivid. Their pain is palpable. In a world populated by murderous boy-men, a 37-year-old hustler is considered old. The story lines are rich and mysterious. There were at least five times at which I was sure of particular outcomes. I was wrong every time. Meticulous, knowing, and magnificently realized, this is a must-read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ultimately unsatisfying","review":"Like everybody else, I have to use the word \\"gritty\\" too to describe the realism and the colourful, detailed descriptions of the drug dealers. However, I am siding with the minority here who found the book boring. If a book for you must be more than about character, then I think you will also find this book tedious because the development of the plot is so slow as to be almost irrelevant. The characters are all unappealing and blithely accept the roles in which life has cast them seemingly without benefit of self-reflection or humanity. Maybe that's the way it is but it makes it difficult to empathise or care what happens to them."},{"rating":"1","title":"nice body, pretty face--but no soul","review":"This was a well-written book, with lively description, well developed characters and an interesting story. So why was I bored to tears? And why, out of the thousands of books I've read in my life, did this book not spark enough interest for me to finish it?

The movie is about Libby Parsons(Ashley Judd) who is framed for her husband's murder. While in prison Libby finds out her husband is alive. She is eventually paroled and begins to seek out the whereabouts of husband. Libby's parole officer (Jones) feels Parson cannot be trusted. Parsons eventually eludes Jones and goes across the country looking for evidence while Jones is hot on the trail. This movie had all the elements of the Fugitive. Tommy Lee Jones acting was subpar. The entire storyline was very predictable and hard to believe. Save your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just plain awful","review":"This movie is just plain bad. It starts out OK, grabs your attention, and the premise is somewhat interesting (wife convicted of murdering husband, convicted, but he's actually alive, wife breaks out...).But... it quickly goes downhill. Predictable, boring, hard to believe at times... this is one of those flicks that would go straight to video if it didn't have stars attached..You can tell Tommy Lee Jones is just going through the motions - if you look closely at the end you can tell even he thinks the script is terrible!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Premise...","review":"...Terrible movie. Ashley Judd holds your attention but the script has a lot of holes, Jones is playing his \\"Fugitive\\" role again as he has too many times before. There are a few well done action scenes, but that is about it...Otherwise this is one of the worst of its kind. Do not buy this film. There are too many other better films in this genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very entertaining flick.","review":"I didn't see this movie in the theater. It looked like it was just another mediocre action flick with a chick as the lead. But when I saw it on video, I was surprised by how good it was!Although it is pretty formulaic, there are enough scenes in it (like the ferry scene) that were done differently from how I'd seen them before that you are kept involved all through the movie. Also, the whole cast is excellent - even Ashley Judd who I usually don't like.Definitely watchable more than once."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie","review":"I would give this movie 5 stars except for a couple of reasons: First, when Libby is trying to escape from the ferry and accidentally pushes the 1st car into the water, nobody on that huge ferry even notices. Second, when Travis is looking for Libby, he just happens to find her on the tip that she's driving \\"an old truck\\".. I mean, how many old trucks are there in the world, and he just happens to see the one she's driving?? and Third, when Nick buries Libby alive, why doesn't he kill her? Given his past, that's what I would expect. Overall a good movie, though, and one I would watch again. Ashley Judd is amazing as always, and Tommy Lee Jones never disappoints, which is why it still deserves 4 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended","review":"This was a long way to go to get to see mother and son reunite. So many scenes that would make a great cartoon. For instance, leave the convict in the car with the keys? why do that? he may as well left the keys to the handcuffs also, if he did it would have lessened the torture of watching it. Judd should focus on other types of movies. she's not a super hero. The only saving grace was that Tommy Lee Jones was in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining","review":"DOUBLE JEOPARDY may seem a bit far-fetched in places, but Judd's performance make it watchable and entertaining. Judd plays a woman found guilty of murdering her husband only to discover six years on that he is in fact alive! Tommy Lee Jones plays her parole officer and is also entertaining to watch. There are a number of tense moments which help keep the film at a watchable pace (eg. the car going overboard, being chased by the police, looking for her son in the graveyard, ending up in a coffin etc etc. It's quite rare for me to want to see a film twice, but this is one of those films you can watch again and again. I was happy to add it to my library, and it is reasonably priced too.Australia's Bruce Beresford directed this film, and I would say he has done a very impressive job. The DVD includes a small featurette on the making which is enjoyable to watch. Beresford explains why he filmed some scenes a certain way (eg. Judd's anguish at discovering her husband is still alive)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Double Jeopardy","review":"This iss a top notch suspense thriller. This film has excellent suspense, surprise twists, and powerhouse acting (Ashley Judd in particular). A must see!"},{"rating":"2","title":"People just like looking at Ashley Judd","review":"Ashley Judd movies are their own genre of Hollywood filmmaking: Pissed Off Beautiful WILL shoot you dead and get away with it in the movie and with the audience. With super pointy eyebrows and a frown, she's still today's answer to Ava Gardner/Vivien Leigh. It's always a treat when she flashes her all too rare shiny smile and uses her Southern charm in New Orleans. That was my favorite part of this particular movie. Also, Bruce Greenwood is a much more pleasing and entertaining opponent to Ashley Judd than than sweaty Ewan MacGregor or the completely suspicious Jim Cav-something aka Jesus Christ Superstar whose name escapes me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumbest movie ever","review":"The entire premise of the movie is not merely ludicrous or far-fetched, it is actually completely false. The concept of double jeopardy has nothing at all to do with WHOM is murdered (or is otherwise the victim), but WHAT you did, in distinct criminal incidents. Even if you were wrongly convicted of murdering someone, if you go back and murder them \\"again\\" then that is a new incident, and double jeopardy does not apply.In movies intended to be fantastic, diverging this much from reality might be OK. But this is a mainstream legal thriller. It's like having a mainstream romantic comedy where the men wear lipstick and the women don't, for no apparent reason.But the producers of this movie either have no idea what the law actually says or means, or they just (accurately) banked on the general public being too ignorant to notice how ridiculous it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Something must be done about Ashely Judd","review":"If this woman is allowed to make another movie, then it will be confirmed: there is no justice in this world.

It is absolutely jaw-dropping that some casting director saw this lady and said, \\"Now HERE is an actress that we need to have in a major Hollywood production!\\" I'm not an overly emotional person, but it's almost enough to make you sit down and cry, isn't it?

The entire premise of \\"Double Jeopardy\\" is based on the assumption that Judd's character would be able to kill her husband without fear of being tried for the crime since she had already been convicted for his murder. That is flat-out wrong. Since the facts and circumstances of the \\"second\\" murder would be entirely different from the \\"first\\" murder, double jeopardy would not, repeat not, apply.

As an actor, she doesn't hold the viewer's attention or create any interest. Who cares if her husband set her up? Who cares if she spends several years in prison for a crime she didn't commit? It doesn't seem to bother her, so why should it matter to me?Given a real actor like Ellen Barkin the movie might be worth at least a rental fee, but not with the present female lead.Give this one a pass & watch Sea of Love again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting!","review":"I really enjoyed this film.

Escapist movies aren't supposed to be realistic, but the entire premise of this movie is based on a spectacularly erroneous misunderstanding of the law (yes, I'm a lawyer). Double jeopardy would, yes, WOULD have applied if Judd's character killed her husband after she jumped parole, because the facts and circumstances of that crime would have been completely different from the earlier \\"murder.\\" Only if the facts and circumstances were identical would double jeopardy be relevant.

Judd eventually gets out of prison and starts tracking her husband down; under the law, she cannot be convicted of killing him twice.There are many things to like about Double Jeopardy. Judd does well as the heroine. There is some beautiful cinematography. There is also several good action scenes. Double Jeopardy will keep you interested throughout its 105 minutes.I thought that the movie had a few flaws.

This is definitely a good action flick despite the all too well known formulaic tricks that may make it seem predictable; It's still fun !On the downside: Although Tommy Lee Jones turns in a pretty good performance , I think his typical arm of the law chasing the \\"fugitive\\" role is reaching it's expiration date.Also, the film felt more like a typical NBC Movie of the Week project with its somewhat predictable story, plot, and ending; It felt as though I had seen t.v. actresses like Lindsay Wagner, or Jaclyn Smith play the very same role as Ahsley Judd..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Movie","review":"I will not spoil the movie's story line for you but I will tell you that this movie is similar somewhat to the Fugitive.

The real treat in this film is Ashley Judd. Her charisma is amazing. But Tommy Lee Jones is, despite his talent, mediocre in this film.

Probably the strongest moment experienced is when (in prison) Libby discovers that her husband is alive and that she has been double-crossed... Gripping stuff!

In reality it would take at least two years before a trial was held. Also, the scriptwriters aren't aware that Washington State abolished the parole system about ten years ago.It gets sillier by the minute, with car crash chase scenes reminiscent of the Blues Brothers. Of course all is well at the end, but you knew that, right?Not a bad rental if you're in the mood for some slickly photographed silliness, but otherwise a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"One big Cliché","review":"I found this movie to be a big cliché. It stole from every thriller ever made. The actors did a pretty good job but Tommy Lee Jones is always playing the same charcter. It can get a bit tiresome. The script as I said is full of clichés but strangely enough the movie was an okay entertainment if you can stand all the clichés."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Film Ever","review":"Not only did they get the concept of double jeopardy wrong - Ashley Judd's character actually could have been tried as the murder of her husband would not legally have been considered the same crime - but they also made a terrible movie. The ending is a movie cliche that was used to get the writer out of a bind and tie up the lose ends."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING! (Need I say more?)","review":"Ok, this movie looked very very good, and then i saw it. If this movie isn't one of the worst movies i have ever seen, then i don't know what it is. Tommy Lee Jones, a great actor, but get's on your nerves during this movie. Ashley Judd, miscast. I would have begged for Susan Sarandon to play her role. The acting was horrible, and the movie was not suspenseful. Put this movie at the bottom of the list of must-see-movies, and at the top of do-not-see-movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous","review":"OK, so Ashley Judd is very cute and Tommy Lee Jones has showed us more than once that he can play tough cops. Well, you know what? That's no excuse for putting the two of them together with an absolutely lousy script and very bad direction to make this piece of junk. For one thing, there's no suspense at all. The \\"action\\" scenes are laughable in the worst possible way. Also, Ms. Judd's nude scene is completely unnecessary. You'd think Tommy Lee would have more sense than returning to the SAME character he played in The Fugitive and its sequel just because it rendered him an Oscar nomination the first time around. He could do better than this. So should we. (For more, see Sue Scotese's excellent review, below.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Can we please have a zero","review":"No really, this movie doesn't deserve one star. Well actually it does but I feel the need to balance out all the morons who actually feel that one can call this a \\"good\\" movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievable!","review":"There is neither mystery or suspense in this hackneyed plot with unbelievable characters and inexplicable actions. The title reveals the major plot twist and the main character's unreasonable choices lead to even more unreasonable actions. Ashley Judd's performance is lack luster and Tommy Lee Jones' talents are wasted in the badly written character of the parole officer. The whole premise of the movie is ridiculous."},{"rating":"2","title":"review to keep the buggies away","review":"I used this insect repellent while I was building a maze for a fundraiser.

Even so, regular chemical-based insect repellents such as the lower-DEET content versions of Off work well for me. I tried Burt's Bees repellent as an alternative. What a complete waste of money. Not only did it not repel insects, it actually attracts them to me. I had more bites, more quickly, than wearing no repellent. It's back to DEET-containing products for me. This product is one of several from Burt's Bees that has given me a distrust of the company. (The rash-inducing lettuce soap was the worst; this at least did not make my skin itchy or sore, which is why it gets 2 stars instead of 1.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"stay away from this stuff","review":"Let me start by saying that I am usually a fan of Burt's Bees products.This herbal insect repellant not only failed at keeping bugs away but actually attracted a swarm of wasps. I was given the choice of using deet or this herbal spray. Not having access to a shower for the night, a few buddies and myself chose to douse ourselves with Burt's juice. Fast forward 5 minutes, a swarm of angry wasps decended upon us like it was the rapture. The only person who escaped unscathed was the one who didn't spray anything. Unfortunately, I was stung over 10 times.Trust your instincts, there are times when all natural is not the way to go."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smells repellent but too OILY","review":"This stuff has all the repellent herbs/smell in there and it does repeal the bugs but it's so OILY that it's pointless to use it. This one needs to be reformulated using a non-oily base. It might work better as a aromatherapy type oil you burn under a small candle, (which I have done to repel bugs outside.)**UPDATE: I found a great 100% Natural Insect Repellent , non-oily, safe for kids, I use it on the dogs, smells & works fantastic. It's by Herbaria and it's called Citronella Mist. Also repels CHIGGERS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ineffective","review":"The product smells very nice and is very easy to apply, but it did not seem to repel insects and caused a rash on my arms and a blistery rash on my spouses neck. We won't use it, again."},{"rating":"2","title":"No bites!","review":"I love this product. I'm extremely allergic to bug bites and I get absolutely zero when I apply... don't even notice bugs around me, really. I've used this during summers in Michigan, visiting national parks, camping, and it works every time. It doesn't stink like DEET, and I don't have to worry about over-applying or poisoning my skin. Only gave it 4 out of 5 stars because it's super oily and will ruin your clothes if you're not careful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not too bad","review":"I bought this because I wanted something that was not offensive smelling for my kids to use. I had tried a eucalyptus based oil before but the smell was way too strong. This repellent seems to work pretty well at what its intended for. I only wish that it sprayed the way it should. It does not spray a mist at all, it is a stream and if you are not prepared, will be a huge mess. By the way, it does not come off of painted walls too well. It's not that big of an issue to me, I just use it like I would tanning lotion or something. I apply it on the kids and rub it on their pants and shoes. It is pretty strong smelling, but not nauseating to me, so I would recommend it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love This Product","review":"Not only does this herbal insect repellent work well, it smells great!

Overall I like it because it's natural & seems to work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for gardening in Chicago","review":"I got this bug spray to help ward off the clouds of mosquitoes while gardening in the Chicago suburbs. I wanted something that would keep the bugs away, but not expose my 1 year old to nasites in traditional bug sprays.I don't know if I am using it wrong or there are some crazy bad mosquitoes out here, but I was eaten alive in about 10 minutes about 20 feet from my house. It seems to just not be strong enough to keep everything away.I am giving this 2 stars, because it does work when I'm not out in the garden (i.e. sitting on the deck). I think I just need something stronger for working in the back 40."},{"rating":"1","title":"ATTRACTS mosquitoes","review":"This product actually attracts more mosquitoes than usual to me--and I'm very attractive to mosquitoes.

It is to their credit, that they pull it off so well, when it could have easily been a disaster.I do not understand why Eloise and the other tracks on the 12 inch were not added as extra tracks to this CD, when it was reissued. The original cassette that I had, was able to do it, so why not the reissued CD?I also would recommend Anything as a companion piece and do not understand why it is so hard to find on CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another failed project, but not totally dispensible","review":"I think this and Music For Pleasure were the two black dots on an otherwise awsome carrer for The Damned. While this is the better of the two it still isn't as good as the others. Not really a bad album just not a very great one. It does have its moments \\"Is It A Dream\\", the Beatle-eske\\"Grimly Feindish(the best song)\\", and \\"Trojans\\" do have a gothic charm. It feels like they lost the fun element of their earlier efforts and tried to replace it with gloom and sadness. Just imagine the Damned without punk and you'd get this one. Felt like \\"13th Floor Vendetta\\", \\"The Dog\\", and \\"Life Goes On\\" over and over and over again, not really my cup of tea but the more gothic fans will love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"We shall be the haunted men...","review":"I first bought this a few days before I went to a Damned gig in Islington and brought it back to shop the next day (I traded it for Rage Against The Machine's \\"Evil Empire\\"). At that point, the only albums I knew were \\"Machine Gun Etiquette\\" and \\"Damned, Damned, Damned\\" which are very silly, punk albums but as soon as I put \\"Phantasmagoria\\" in my CD player I got really confused...

That is \\"The Black Album\\" and \\"Strawberries\\" and eventually it prepared me for \\"Phantasmagoria\\". So any fans of the punk albums, listen to \\"The Black Album\\" and then \\"Strawberries\\" before you try this one out.

This edition should have included \\"Eloise\\" and \\"Temptation\\" rather than those bloody remixes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not punk, but still enjoyable","review":"I you're used to the original punk Damned music you might be disappointed, but if you are willing to listen to something a little gothier and can still enjoy Dave Vanian's gorgeous voice you might want to check this one out. It is a slow, melodic, very full-bodied musical album with a little gothier tone than the orginal Damned. But at the same token, I don't find this album a downer or too slow to enjoy. It is best listened to as back-ground music. As with most Damend albums, the lyrics are a little annoyingly shallow and silly (so don't listen too hard), but Dave still sounds great and the music is well put together, like always. I am a pretty big early punk fan, but I still enjoy this album, although it's not for everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Like A Good Red","review":"Brewzerr and Paul A.

The band has now been reduced to aquartet (Captain Sensible left for a solo career). The bandfocuses more on the genre they help create, Goth Rock and the album becames the David Vanian show. The music isvery goth, similar to the sounds of The Black Album. Keyboard and guitar driven (both performed by Roman Jugg), the band also gets a hit single out of the album \\"Shadow of Love\\". Ironically, without their strongest musician the band reaches upwards on the pop charts.A new sound and a different direction. The Damned are more popular than they ever were. In between their second LP for MCA, the Damned would score with another top ten hit Eloise. But sucess has spoiled the band. With a lot of infighting and clashes of egos, the band would call it quits after fullfilling their record cotract with MCA (the not so great Anything),Strongly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another useless toenail fungus remedy","review":"I bought this product after having tried every other over-the-counter medication against toenail fungus.

The storyline is great....Matt Damon and Danny Devito compliment each other well in this film.

So I feared that this movie would not be up to the book.

It is like a series of promos, loosely glued together, without even a good time line to enable a viewer to determine what has occurred. Since my spouse watched it with me, and has never read the book, we are both convinced that we saw this movie before, and that it was longer, with much more detail. In this version, Birdie and Donnie could have phoned in their parts, as could Ms. Black. Very little in the way of part development for anyone except Danny DeVito, and even that was abridged.

Where was the editing? This needed a 30 minute haircut, especially the pedestrian courtroom scenes where absolutely no surprises happen to justify the tedium. Francis Ford Coppola was once a titan, but by 1997 when this bloat job was made, his talent had vanished. I did enjoy some of the acting, especially Jon Voight's shark lawyer. Matt Damon, then unknown, is okay, but not special here. He would do much more with the same-time-frame \\"Good Will Hunting.\\" The plot is standard courtroom fare, and all the characters are stereotypes, including the battered wife, the rumpled clown (Danny DeVito), the wise judge (Danny Glover) and the hard-luck family that wins over the cold hearted insurance company in the end.

I have only seen the movie on Belgian TV. This review will review the actual movie, not the DVD and all of its features.I have read the book that John Grisham wrote. And I liked it a lot. The I saw the movie and it disappointed me, even more so when I saw the director was Francis Ford Coppola.What is disappointing in the movie is that although it follows the book fairly closely, a lot of background info that the book gives is absent in the movie, and makes the movie story much more incomprehensible. I doubt if people who have not read the book will fully understand everything that happens in the movie.Danny DeVito was also the wrong actor to cast for the role of Deck Schifflet. DeVito is a great actor, but in this movie he was too much of a goody two shoes person and did not resemble the Deck Schifflet described in the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie","review":"This is a good movie.

It's short on plot and a little heavy-handed, and Grisham is not very good with characters. Coppola, however, is wonderful with characters, and Matt Damon's Rudy Baylor is one of the finest performances he's ever given. Damon, DeVito, Danes, and Voight all make this an amazing film when it could very easily have been another Pelican Brief. All the actors are very obviously having fun in their parts. This movie is heartwarming, funny, and kind, and Damon's gentle voice-over perfectly underscores the genuine feeling that Coppola so deftly engenders. It's fascinating to watch Damon work here - he plays a soft-spoken Tennessee lawyer with as much assurance as he does a brash Boston mathematician in Good Will Hunting. Go watch this one. You'll like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's got everything.","review":"I'm going to start by admitting that I'm not a very big fan of dramas. Generally. This movie, however, rises above the rest. It's well written, well acted and well worth owning. Get it today!"},{"rating":"1","title":"o boy","review":"Yup, this is just what the world needs. This guy is a cheeseball and it shows in his music. Journey may have ruled, but this guy has done way to much lovin, touchin, squeezin on himself. Plus he's more dorky looking than Eddie Money"},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh Sherry","review":"She should have been gone, knowing how he made her feel. But what did Sherry do? She hung out. She could've done worse. Sure he made a really cheesy, mullet laced video about her, but that's love, man! That's love. What would 9th grade have been without Steve saying what we felt and with synthesizers? Different, I tell you. He told some broad \\"Go Away.\\" He told yet another, if she would have tried, if she hadn't lied, she'd never be alone again. Why'd I miss my bus listening to Strung Out and eating cornflakes? It was the Steve Perry magic. That's why. He spoke for the poor, unrequited young dude. Viva la Perry! Viva la Perry!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Steve Perry is so talented","review":"I didn't like Oh Sherrie after MTV played the hell out of this. It is sad that it is not available for MP3 download. I bought the Greatest Hits so I don't want to double-pay for the music but I might just go back and do it anyway. My original LP has long been lost and my recent nostalgia for great music has made me think about getting this replacement as I rebuild my old library. Amazon should get this on MP3 download along with a bunch of other rock music of the 80's!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good debut album","review":"I've always been a Journey fan, but I also wanted to add \\"Oh Sherrie\\" and \\"Foolish Heart\\" to my collection, so I got this album. I started to get Steve Perry's greatest hits album, but I didn't know any of the songs other than the ones that were on Street Talk.After listening to Street Talk, I liked most of the songs on here, I don't see why \\"Go Away\\" and \\"Strung Out\\" weren't major hits. But some of the songs I wasn't too crazy about, such as \\"I Believe.\\" But this is actually a great debut album for someone who's never sung solo before."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Journey Into Hell","review":"Steve Perry, the singer of Journey, is one of the greatest vocalists ever. He sounds very good on the album but the problem is...this is not Journey. Journey knew how to do a slow song, but they also could rock like no one else. This album has a few rocking moments but most of it is a mangled mess of pop balladry. I bought this album solely because of Oh Sherrie. Journey fans will not enjoy this, but if you love Steve that much you will probably enjoy a little of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Received scratched up!!","review":"Music is great, cd will not play for any length of time without being ejected from any of my 3 players.

He is naturally gifted and has developed his talent to connect the emotions from the heart of the songs to his listeners. The ballads are all well developed little stories about moments in our lives. And just when I thought Steve Perry had given his all, I heard the bonus cut, \\"Don't Tell Me Why You're Leaving\\", and was floored by the humorous R&B; arrangement. On top of that, Steve's smooth, silky voice had a few shovels of gravel in it with a vocal progression that can only be described as, \\"How did he do that?\\".Wonderful lyrics, arrangements, style, and vocal delivery. My all time favorite is \\"Foolish Heart\\". Many, many thanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Successful Look at O'Keeffe","review":"Surely it is difficult to sift through an artist's life and write about only the meaningful moments/events. Castro does a good job with this, including what is important and omitting the tedious. Her art criticism is simple and easy to understand and her approach seems balanced. My major complaint with the book is that while she may discuss a painting on page 15, it may well appear on page 200 - with no note or appendix making it possible to find the plate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!!","review":"This praise and worship is a great addition to any collection.I listen to this every day in my car.

In fact, no sooner do the trio beam down than they are in the middle of a hit, from one of the bosses, Krako.Kirk breaks the rule of non interference and appoints one as the boss and Krako as his lieutenant and tells that he doesn't want any trouble from the rest of them. He says there'll be a ship sent every year to collect their cut. McCoy is unhappy because he thinks he left his communicator on the Iotians planet.

There is something for everyone on this CD, and if you like R&B/Pop, then you will enjoy the selection of music here. If you do not like the typical rap music beat, then there are a few songs for which you may not have an affection.

Swanee Hunt's own tone of moral outrage never eclipses the voices of the women she has interviewed. She writes of them with love, and also finds much love in them, a love only more startling for having survived such intense hatred. This book is a great, great achievement, both for its singular mix of empathy and for its clarity. As Primo Levi and Viktor Frankl found meaning in the Holocaust without diminishing its horror, so Hunt finds a language of strength and power in these compromised lives. This is a book about the very best and very worst of humanity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Political auto-goal","review":"This is yet another attempt to water down the real cause of the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The reader will conclude that the agressor was not Serbia and Monteneagro, but....some crazy local politicians who succeded in fomanting the heatred after coming to power. Reader is fooled into beleiving that this heatred had nothing to do with previous history, which is full of bloodshed caused by this monsterous project of Greater Serbia. Personal tragedies of these woman are masterfully twisted into illusion that \\"we lived like a brothers during Marshall Tito\\", who by the way was one of the biggest criminals and dictatiors in the recent history.

David Golder was a Russian immigrant who rose to a place in the financial pages of the world's oil business. He was ruthless, ambitious and completely amoral, married to a grasping woman and father to a spoilt daughter who loved her father only for the money he gave her. It is a desolate read without any love or redeeming features in its characters who worship only money and the privileges it brings. I couldn't feel any sympathy for him, even on his deathbed, so I'm glad that it was such a quick read as it made me feel too depressed with its bleakness and the pervading sense of hopelessness."},{"rating":"2","title":"princess","review":"i enjoyed this cd, very much. this is my MAN!

Her way is decidely pop, and at times with a christian angle; somewhat like Amy Grant. She is often snubbed by the Christian music community because few of her songs even get close to Christian music. At 16yo on this debut recording, she shows a remarkable range, and confidence in her abilities and reception. She is multi-octave, comfortably bi-lingual, drop dead gorgeous, and with less than flashy plummage. She's easy to take, and easier to love. Why this gifted person isn't recognized as one of the world's greatest songstress, and hell-uva great person, must lie in the fact she was initially presented as a Christian artist. That's fine.

It is a narrative style book, and follows these young men through the stripping down (metaphorically speaking) of themselves to conform to the standard of priesthood. This book already has given me a glimpse of what it might have been like for the priests that I know that went to the NAC. It does seem to center on the Landry twins and Chris Nalty above the others, though maybe that changes later in the book. It also gives a good look at (now) Archbishop Timothy Dolan."},{"rating":"2","title":"once there myself...","review":"I was once one of \\"The New Men\\" this book refers to, though a few years before the time of this story's telling. Many things seem to have changed but many more remain in place, particularly the feeling of being one of the \\"elite\\", a \\"bishop-to-be\\", the feeling of being utterly torn between the sacred and the profane.

Picture quality is excellent, but I did notice one possible problem with the sound in the episode \\"Patterns of Force\\". About 43 minutes in, when Kirk is trying to get Gill to respond, Kirk slaps Gill, but no slap sound can be heard. I also have this episode on VHS, so I know that there should be a slap sound. There is one other sound problem I noticed 2 minutes later when one of the Nazi guards is banging on the door to the booth where Kirk and Gill are. You don't hear the cound of the banging on the door. That sound is also on the VHS tape, but not the DVD. I have e-mailed Paramount Home Video about this but haven't heard back from them. I would be interested in knowing if anyone else had this same experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"This book does come at very very very hefty price, but it is so much worth it. This is where I totally disagree with the previous reviwer. I have found it hard to find a book that explains the concepts of logistics and supply chain management in a clearer fashion than this book. Every chapter features a number of case studies in which the theory is discussed in-depth. In addition the figures and illustrations are clear cut and easy to understand. A must have for both student and practitioner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work with DVD/RW or CD/RW.","review":"Warning: Starforce requires a CD-ROM only (i.e. a reader) It does not work with a burner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misinformation mixed with good information","review":"Some of C.W.Allen's information is correct but some was flat wrong. I read the book at author, Robert Kiyosaki's recommendation (Rich Dad, Poor Dad) and because some of what RK implied was offbase about having your corporation pay for your car, house, etc. As a CPA and twenty year veteran of the tax profession, I was curious to read his authority. Some glaring problems: You cannot hire your kids in your corporation and write off their education. The tax statutes are very specific about greater than 10% owners and their closely related family not being eligible. There are several other items like this that contradict Allen's info. Another dislikable characteristic of the book is that it has several sections entirely written by different authors who very clearly did not review each other's material. Several times they covered the same subject with different detail. How can you buy a book that you can't trust?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievably disorganized!","review":"I ordered this book after reading the recommendation in \\"Rich Dad, Poor Dad,\\" and I was terribly disapointed when it arrived. \\"Inc. & Grow Rich\\" is the most disorganized book I've ever seen. It's as if the authors just pasted together a series of unrelated presentations -- leaving it to the reader to decipher the important points. I did pick up a couple of new ideas, which is the only reason I didn't rate the book lower. However, I'm now going to have to do some research on my own to find out how to implement them, since the book was too sketchy. To sum it up: save your fifty bucks for something better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Falling short","review":"On the positive side, Inc. and Grow Rich did have some very useful information on the advantages of incorporating your business, and other important legal information that will allow people to save money in various aspects of their lives.On the other hand the situations and case studies supplied to demonstrate these concepts were too specific, allowing the author to end the chapter or section with \\"to see how this would apply to your situation, contact a CPA\\". And while I do see the advantages of going to a CPA to see how the laws apply to my situation, I feel that for price of the book, it could have contained a broader range of case studies to see how the law applies to each one.My advice.. save the fifty bucks for an appointment with a CPA... with or without this book, you'll need one anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit of a sham......","review":"I had high expectations of this book due to positive recommendations, but was extremely disappointed upon reading it. I found it to be amazingly disorganized and not very helpful. Save your money look for value elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst educational book I ever read.","review":"I cannot think of a more poorly written educational book! It was poorly structured (did the authors ever take an english writing class?). Topics didn't follow a logical flow and seemed to come out of nowhere. The book didn't go into any specifics of HOW to do something (even though a review of the table of contents show many chapters and sub-chapters with the title \\"How to...\\"). I was very disappointed and I now have more questions about how to form my business than before. In the end, they tried to convince you to hire the authors to answer all your questions. Then why would one buy the book?"},{"rating":"2","title":"I found it to be a wonderful intro into what is possible","review":"This book was a great overview of what is possible when creating your business structure. However, you do need to look into some of the specific Internal Revenue Code concerning certain deductions, but the book lists those. In terms of actual \\"How-To\\", you are referred to \\"The Essential Corporation Handbook\\" which is why I do penalize the authors as much as some other reviewers. If you do not have a financial backgound, I would definitely enlist the services of a Qualified professional. This book is a great start for the novice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed.","review":"Just a quick note on this. I was not impressed with this book at all. It is vague, overly high-level, and after reading it I do not feel confident that I could follow-through in incorporating and taking advantage of the operating and tax benefits provided. It felt more like I was reading a collection of random thoughts on the topic, rather than an in-depth explanation. I was also turned-off by the quality of the book itself. The pages were not clear; more like two sided photo-copies than a published work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Privo","review":"These shoes would probably be wonderful if they fit!

Otherwise, I think it would be a great shoe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amusing book to learn French","review":"Although I have forgotten most of my French, I have to say that this book, and its accompanying CD's, were fantastic. The story lines throughout the textbook are funny (try to be funny) and amusing. Your vocabulary will expand enormously."},{"rating":"2","title":"French In Action Reviewed","review":"This book, WHEN used in conjunction with the workbook, and audio and video cassettes, is very useful. By itself, the book would be much less helpful, but of course the book was intended to be used in combination with the audio and video aids. The combination of book, audio and video tapes, makes learning French interesting and entertaining. The only thing that is lacking (in my opinion) is a running translation into English, and a set of flash cards with the new words for each lesson."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty much a waste of money","review":"Each chapter is only about 4 pages long and the workbook is generally more helpful than the text. My advice is to avoid buying the book because it's a waste of money and there is such little written that it hardly seems worth the cost. Spend your money on the French in Action workbook."},{"rating":"1","title":"Irrelevant for classroom use","review":"I just finished a year course using the second part of this text as the main curriculum, and although this might have been a useful resource for adults trying to supplement class work back in the 80's when this series was created, I found it pretty ineffective for a high school class. The video that goes with the text seems cheesy and outdated (making it a lot more difficult for students to take it seriously, to be quite honest), and the topics and vocabulary are mostly irrelevant too. Thanks to Mr. Capretz, I can tell you how to start my car and that I used to live in a grass hut, but my conversation skills are actually a little rusty from the inane verbal excercises. This might be a good course for adults looking for supplement and review, but this is not a very good text for classroom use, and especially not well organized or easy to follow if you haven't used it from the very beginning. As for students, there are much better texts out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best french course out there","review":"If you are learning French, don't hesitate, do this course. This will teach you more about the French language and about France than any other course out there. The TV episodes can be viewed direct from the learner website."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ummm. . . . .I don't think so","review":"This album totally stunk and I am ashamed to admit that I own the CD. In other words don't buy this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Allure Is All Played Out","review":"This CD did not meet my expectations. There are a few good tracks which include:\\"All Cried Out\\", \\"Head Over Heals\\", \\"Mama Said\\", and \\"Give You All I Got\\". They added rap artists such as Nas and LL Cool J in an effort to enhance the quality, but it just wasn't enough. They can sing, but need some better, more interesting lyrics and producers. I suggest you buy the single, \\"All Cried Out\\", but leave the CD alone. PEACE!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I give it a 2 because...","review":"I only really liked two of the songs on this album which would be \\"All cried out\\" and \\"Last chance\\" which were both slow songs.I liked these two songs because 1.

The rest I could care less for."},{"rating":"1","title":"The cluck of the Chickenheads","review":"This CD is extremely wack, these chickenheads can't sing. Don't waste your money buying this CD.

I looked in the used section a month later and saw about 10 copies of this album there (some were still unopened!). That should tell you how horrible this album is. Don't make the same mistake that I did. I didn't even buy the album (I got it as a present). If you like \\"All Cried Out,\\" buy the single or request it on a radio station, don't waste your cash on this trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Total Washout!","review":"I don't know who thought that Allure's version of \\"All Cried Out\\" is the best remake that there is. Don't get me wrong tho-Allure do have some beautiful voices that do some slamming harmony- but them remaking \\"All Cried Out\\" is a washout! And using 112 did not help matters anymore than the rappers used on the album. A good album, but not one of their best. An extremelackluster affair. The songs I like are Head over Heels, No Question and One More Chance. The rest of the album needs to recycled for the protection of the earth. These girls have gorgeous voices and voices like angels should not be given Gorgon songs. A total washout! My grade is:F!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's not that bad people","review":"I admit the first time i heard this cd i hated it. Then I listened to it again for the second time and i liked most of it.

You have to grow into the CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't judge an album by it's cover","review":"They may look all beautiful and angelic on the cover, but when you listen to the album you'll hear ugly, demonic voices. In other words, don't buy this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"This album is pure trash! Worst CD of 20th Century!","review":"This album is so bad! Please don't waste your money on this album!

He was extremely excited to buy the game and could not wait to play on family game night. The game itself is a complete nightmare!! It is horribly designed and impossible to put together. It is the cheapest quality that I have ever encountered in a board game! After spending an hour trying to assemble it my son was in tears. I will be returning this game to Toys R Us for another game that can actually be assembled and played!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor quality - badly designed","review":"My son got this for his birthday and was very excited to play with it. Setting it up became a nightmare because the \\"3-D Buildings\\" touted by the game were nearly impossible to put together. Attempting to put them together involves trying to insert many small, flimsy card board tabs into small, badly cut slots. My son was in tears, and frankly, I almost was, too. Frustrating! I finally managed to cobble them together enough to start the game, but since they kept falling apart during game play we finally had had enough and quit. Frustrating!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Played once, never again","review":"This game is much to hard to set up. The rules are confusing. My 7 year old could not get the game rules straight. The game is hard to put away because the pieces (once assembled) are very bulky. I am not impressed"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun game to play once you can get it together!","review":"Like other reviewers stated this game is difficult to put together without ruining the peices. Once together it cannot be put away easily but if you place the peices on their sides you can kinda close the lid on the box. You really do not want to have to take apart the peices because they will wear down or rip if you have to put them together too many times(we taped ours to help them stay together).My boys 7 and 5 do find the game fun and they can play it on their own. I find that it is a very easy game to play and it ends quickly so they usually end up playing a few rounds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Keystone Kops DVD!!!!!!!","review":"This dvd description and artwork are completely wrong! There are 5 shorts and only 1 of them has the Keystone Kops in it for a brief time. The cover photo is not from this dvd. Do not buy if you want the \\"Best of Keystone Kops\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Deceptive!","review":"Not only are the Keystone Kops not on this disc, but the films that are included were taken from bad, milky prints. I have seen a couple of these shorts before, and the DVDs that I saw them on were made from prints that were in great shape. This disc is a total rip off... even at $9.99!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mitchner's Hawaii Is Not Hawaii","review":"James Mitchner is an apologist for the missionary and American take over of the independent Kingdom of Hawai'i. If you have read this book and think that you know anything about the history of Hawai'i, you don't. If you think that by reading this book you will learn anything about the history of Hawai'i, you won't. If really do want to learn something of the history of Hawai'i, read Gavan Daws' A Shoal of Time instead. That book will at least give you an honest account that neither glorifies the Americans who stole Hawai'i nor the Hawaiian rulers who, in too many ways, let them get away with it.Don't buy this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"reads like a soap opera","review":"Overall disappointed - most of the chararcters are 1 dimensional and the plot lines fairly predictable. The geological development of Hawaii was enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a great novel","review":"This book started off slow with the formation of the Hawaiian islands and just continued from there. The second chapter was more insightful and interesting but it seemed to drag. Several pages could have been cut or edited out. It would have been better if this book moved through the years a little more swiftly, than dragging to each persons life. It was very difficult to finish and this is one book I will not re-read again. It was about as interesting as a school text book, without a teacher to bring out the lesson."},{"rating":"1","title":"At times enjoyable and a great read but overall a long bore that drags on","review":"I really liked the book from the begging I got hooked and could not stop reading. I loved the part with the missinaries and there triels and tribulations. We see how the missionaries tried tyo change Hawaii's customs on the people and we sew the down fall of the missionaries. But after that the book draged on and lost it's touch. It went on and on and on and only a few other things I enjoyed. i laos enjoyed the leaper partsd and the trials and tribulations of the chinese and Japense people. the problem here is that the auther gose on and on about pointless stuff we will soon forget. This novle could easly of been 500 pages but it's over 1000. I was dissapointed but it wasent entirley a bad book it was enjoyanle at times."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic","review":"James Michener's description of how the islands came to being was poetic. This book is great historical fiction that is fun to read. Anyone who is fortunate enough to have been to the islands should read this book. The description of the leper colony of Molokai was especially good."},{"rating":"2","title":"provie","review":"Readers must have patience when reading the first 2-3 chapters, things happen very slowly, keep in mind that the geological history of Hawaii is also being told. After the first chapters are behind you you will be hooked. The writing is magnificant, a book for people that truely love to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Michener's best","review":"This is definitely Michener's best work and one of my favorite novels. I have read it three times and love it more every time. The islands and the people are truly brought to life. I especially like the way Michener presents historical events honestly without trying to whitewash them. This was very courageous for a novel written in the fifties. Definitely read this book if you are planning a visit to Hawaii. You will see the islands in a different light."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way Too Long For Me","review":"Wow, this is the biggest book I have read in a long time. I just did not have the stamina for it. I read the book on a trip to Hawaii. I will say it did give a good feel for the place and the history of it. But it was just way too long with what I fealt was too much detail in many parts. Also I found it impossible to keep track of the characters. There are 5 missionary families that intermarry and use last names for first names. I could not keep Hoxforth Hale straight from Hale Hoxforth. (Yes I know there were family trees in the back, but I could not spend my whole time flipping back and forth). So if you are going to Hawaii or just interested in the place and you have lots of time and patience this book may be for you. But for me, I would prefer something shorter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hawaii","review":"Having recently visited Hawaii I have found this book very intresting.I have enjoyed previous books by Michener very intresting. This book is no exception."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hawaii","review":"A great book.

I read this soo many years ago I'd rather not say but remember how much details Michener uses in his books. My husband has never read it so its all new for him. We're reading it together and love it. I love it all over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Un-put-downable","review":"I'm 338 pages through this book, and I can't put it down. It is literally stuck to my hand, and my eyes won't focus unless they're on Michener's wonderful words. I have never in my life read a book like this before. I'm only 16, MTV attention span and all that, and if I of all people can find a 1200 page book absorbing and amazing and superlative, then anyone can. Pacific Island history is some of the most colourful in the world, and often overlooked. I'm infuriated with Abner Hale, admire Malama and think Terero's tops. I love these characters! All right, well, I'm off to finish Hawaii. After that, I reckon I'll have all the inspiration I need to write the Great Novel O Aotearoa.

I had to read it as an assignment for school, so I started off thinking, \\"Great. This is going to be so BORING.\\" And then the first 16 or so pages WERE rather boring, with all the geography and stuff. But once you get really into it, into the life stories of all the characters that are so wonderfully melted together, it's a really good novel. At points you even forget that it IS nonfiction, it's so realistic. From the opinion of a 15-year-old, good job, Michener."},{"rating":"2","title":"A long aloha","review":"I have to admit that I'd really only give this book 3.5 stars, but that's not an option... It's a really good book and I do recommend it to anyone interested in Hawaii, but I just couldn't get lost in it like I did with other Michener novels.The story follows the history of Hawaii from volcanic formation to statehood. Though it is entirely about Hawaii, a surprising amount of the story takes place outside of Hawaii. Aside from the obvious connections to Tahiti, there's also plenty of info on New England, China and Japan. You'll learn about agriculture, politics, religion, and most of all - people.If you aren't particularly interested in Hawaii but want to experience a great Michener novel, take a look at Carribean, Chesapeak, or Alaska."},{"rating":"2","title":"No kidding -- Among the best books ever written!","review":"One of my favorite books of all time. Just an outstandingly good read. The colors and sounds of Hawaii come to life with the characters he creates. The section on missionaries literally changed my life because it changed how I thought of the whole mission movement. This is presented in typical Michener style, starting with the pre-history of the region and bringing it through time to the present. The stories and characters presented here are among the most interesting he ever created. I have often said I envy anyone who is reading it for the first time. Besides, it's like taking a Hawaiian vacation. Pick up a copy, and have a really good trip!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite book","review":"There is no adjective to describe how good this book is. Michener even makes pre-historic volcano eruptions interesting. Every time Michener begins a new topic the reader must feel angry for they still want more tales of the last people, place, or time. The saving grace is that the next topic is always better. I am afraid to read Michener's other works for fear that I will like them less than this masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like it!","review":"I first tackled \\"Hawaii\\" as a young boy, partly for theadventure, partly for the violence, and partly for thenaughty parts, probably what attracts boys to read lots ofbooks. It taught me a lot about the history of the Pacific,despite being historical FICTION, as my parents often remindedme. True, but excellently written historical fiction. Mr.Michener can write historical fiction like no one else, onceone gets used to his style."},{"rating":"2","title":"Refreshing soap","review":"This soap cleans very well, and the peppermint is very vitalizing and refreshing.

It is a sweet, touching adaptation of the \\"Little House\\" stories that chronicles the family's decision and quest to strike out west. Trust, faith and taking pleasure in the small things of life are all evident here and the illustrations couldn't be better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This had to be a joke!","review":"If you ever have the chance to read this book you will be shocked, as I was, to read what appears to be the result of a dare. If there was a challenge to write a picture book about traveling West in pioneer days that would give any thinking child nightmares, this is the winning effort. People drink bad water, someone has a wooden leg as a result of a fight with a bear, people go off to hunt never to be seen again, Indians attack and leave skeletal remains....what was the publisher thinking?!

I have NEVER heard an entire album that seems to touch and affect God's heart as this does. I wish I could give it more than 5 stars. Five is not enough.

Although querying a database may be considered part of e-commerce, it is hardly enough! Jsp, Servlets and EJBs were only mentioned briefly towards the end of the book. Even for additional reading, it is hardly worth the time and money( there are some errors in the sql scripts as some other reviewers has pointed out ).Java has come a long way since the time this book was published and there are much better books now:1.

The correct syntax is shown on the previous page. Another example is the incomplete syntax for the INSERT command on p. 85 --- the VALUES keyword is omitted.

Anything kinda sounds like The Black Album only not done as well. There are some good tracks:\\"Anything\\" and \\"Psychomania\\" is probably the closest to punk that they've gotten in a while, and the cover of Love's \\"Alone Again Or\\" is a great tribute to the original. But there is plenty of filler. The fans of the Damned's older stuff would probably like this one over Phantasmagoria, I know I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"i don't know how people can listen to this","review":"man, i can't stand the sound of this album. the lyrics are alright, but the music is cheesy as hell. it has that horrible 80's recording on it.. the bon jovi hair-snare reverb and that slick vocal sound. i bought this album for 50 cents on vinyl... it's in great shape, if anyone wants it, just e-mail me and i'll be glad to send it to them. unless you're a big david vanian fan, don't spend too much more on this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dulce Decorum worth the whole price","review":"I have always enjoyed this album, as much as, if not more than, Phantasmagoria. The sophmore effort on Phantas. bloomed into full fledged maturity on Anything. Dulce Decorum is one of the best songs ever recorded, and the instrumental Portrait is achingly beautiful.If only loved the Damned as long as they were punk, then you won't like this.If you're still in the over the top-party-goth stage of Phantas. then you won't like this.But, if you like some soul in your music (and I'm not talking about Motown, that's a different review), then you can't miss with this. It's beautiful, plain and simple."},{"rating":"2","title":"A VERY Under-rated Album","review":"It took me a while to really get into this album; I always liked Phantasmagoria a lot but thought this was nowhere near as good. I was wrong. This album has some top-rate songs, including a cover of Alone Again Or, the old Love song (not \\"Love Song\\", but rather Alvin Lee & Love), the title track, which is clearly intended to sound like a really good Iggy solo song, and the classic In Dulce Decorum. Psychomania also rocks, and there are some pretty good slow songs on here. This is NOT just for hard-core Damned fans; it's a great album, and it's a travesty that it's out of print."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Figures....","review":"It figues that a song I really like Alone Again Or is on a no longer released CD going for 50.00 used.

Well, there were other things out there like The Walker Brothers' Nite Flights... or Replicas. Recorded in early 79, this one was much more ahead of it's time than the rest (exept maybe Suicide's first album from 1977 which came from .... I don't know). I can't think of a better transition album going from the 70's to the 80's. It's original, disturbing, funny, dark, captivating and : haunting. I nearly married a human, Replicas... almost like a best of of it's era. If you're looking for decent, innovative music in that time, here you got the real stuff. Splendid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Numan's earlier days","review":"This album has a really \\"weird\\" sound to me, mostly because I bought it after hearing \\"Down in the Park\\" and \\"Are Friends Electric?\\", both of which are masterpieces. The rest of the songs are a mixed bag. I felt that some were pretty good, like \\"The Machman\\", and \\"Me I Disconnect From You\\", while the others were just average. This style was pretty innovative 30 years ago, and as a concept album the songs share a dark sci-fi theme. It isn't a similar style to his solo work in the 80's and beyond, but does mark a strong beginning to Numan's stardom."},{"rating":"2","title":"Replicas","review":"This album is simply brilliant! I am proud to have a very well pressed vinyl version, but if you want to learn what 80s new wave is all about, this is the one! Stay in vision and have fun and make sure your neighbours aren't home! Play it loud and enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"was trendy music in it's time","review":"Most of Gary Numan's music is unlistenable today b/c it was way too trendy. Trying to capitalize on the new wave, machine sounding craze. Today that sounds silly. His best stuff was the guitar driven and more conventional (less synthesizer) stuff. Are friends electric, down in the park and the guitar riff songs are the best.He should take some of these decent songs, dump the stupid sythesizer and fake drum sounds and re-work the songs as real rock songs.Check out the cd \\"Return of the Rentals\\" by the Rentals (an off- shoot of Weezer). They do Gary Numan better than Gary Numan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"NUMANS ABSOLUTE BEST !!!!","review":"Im knocked down by this special edition 25th anniversary remaster ! This is the best album from his 70s period in my opinion.Why ? In that it combines kraftwerkian,minimalistic keyboard playing with heavy,punky powerhouse guitar riffing and a dry,pounding rhythm section (bassist Paul Gardiner remained my absolute fav for the following decade after I first heard this record back in \`79) .The bonus tracks are mainly studio outtakes but are almost as good as the songs on the album.The rougher demo version of ? I Nearly Married A Human ?, the album closer,is fantastic.The sound is very good,a far cry from that on my lp and the increase in production values respecting their debut lp shows everywhere.Oniric,b-movie sci-fi lyrics play a key role even more than on their debut album. The quieter songs are of a hypnotic,almost mantric quality,with weird but awesome hooks.One of my top 10 records of all times ."},{"rating":"2","title":"trendsetting music","review":"Hard to believe, but I just recently heard this album for the first time. Supposedly a concept album, this collection of songs is a great snapshot of the early new wave music movement. Nobody (including me) knew it at the time, but Gary Numan was destined to be a trendsetter in composition and musical style. If your sole exposure to Gary Numan is his hit single \\"Cars\\" you owe it to yourself to listen to \\"Replicas\\" and \\"Pleasure Principle.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply the best","review":"Without question, one of the best albums of all time.

The remake is a slick, fast paced \\"cops and robbers\\" action film that is sure to please fans of the genre. Sure some situations are contrived to say the least, but that doesn't keep Shaft from delivering the goods!"},{"rating":"2","title":"solid action flick","review":"Samuel L. Jackson, Vanessa Williams, Christian Bale, Jeffery Wright, Busta Rhymes, Dan Hedaya, Toni Colleti, and Richard Roundtree star in SHAFT, an action packed remake of the the 1971 hit film.I won't give away the plot, but the movie has a lot of action towards the last 25 minutes of the movie. The acting is pretty good, as is the direction by John Singleton. Samuel L. Jackson makes it seem like he was born to play the role.The only thing that I didn't like about this movie was that it took a while to hit its stride. Instead of a much needed big shootout to open the movie, we get a very brief sex scene which better hold you off because there isn't any more action more another 75 minutes.All in all, pretty solid action flick, but it took me a while to get involved with the movie.2000; 99 minutes; Rated R for strong violence, almost endless obscenity, brief nudity, and sexual innuendo."},{"rating":"1","title":"RICHARD ROUNDTREE IS SHAFT...","review":"BUT SAMUEL L JACKSON DOES A PASSABLE JOB IN THE TITLE ROLE.

However, I distinctly remember laughing out loud at how stupid the plot was and how unrealistic some scenes were. Samuel Jackson could have been great in this film if the script had been there (that is why I went to see it in the first place). Unfortunately, the script is WRETCHED. They could have come up with a more realistic and believable crime at the start of the movie to set the wheels of injustice rolling. Do people really bludgeon other people to death on the street right outside a crowded bar because they are dissed in front of their friends? When the first shooting/car chase takes place, you have to suspend your belief because it seems ridiculous. The gangsters seem fake, and the relationship between Bale and the drug dealer rings as false as the \\"count every vote\\" mantra of good old Al G.

According to the Shaft theme song, the answer is obviously Shaft. But after watching this pointless movie, it makes me wonder. There were a couple of interesting action scenes in the movie, and Jackson is always fun to watch as he struts his stuff. But this film was so formulaic, there was absolutely no question where it was headed and therefore no suspense involved at all. Christian Bale makes a convincing bigot & murderer, and Jeffrey Wright is great as Peoples, an endearingly slimy drug lord. But I would definitely consider this a movie to rent, not to buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"I thought it was a spoof\\"","review":"This film had one thing going for it--it was completely laughable!

No drama or politicaly correct scenes, Shaft just lets it rip . This time you wont have to wait too long till the hero gets his revenge, bones will break and head will roll when Shaft is loose.

I guess everyone sees things differently, therefore, form different opinions. Compared to Shaft of the past, this one doesn't stack up, but I don't think the intent was to compare.Answer to L. Gontzes comment...I would assume the reason for there not being a nude scene with the lovely (not so lovely in this film) Vanessa Williams would have something to do with the fact that she was very much pregnant during filming! notice they tried not to shoot any shots of her from the waist down?N-E-Wayz...this film had several different elements to appeal to a diverse audiences.

The first \\"Shaft\\" was a blaxploitation flick and is a classic. This movie, directed by John Singleton, seems less black, more made-for-Hollywood. The plot is thin and unlike the original, the only love scene to be found is in pieces during the opening credits. And what was Busta Rhymes' purpose? It added nothing to the movie.

Samuel Jackson is too old to play Shaft","review":"What was John Singleton thinking. I know he produces good films but this is far worse. The Shaft from the 70s was sexier, cooler, more aggressive, and classer than Jackson. This was a watered down verison where Parks and Roundtree made cameos. It's almost to the point they take the blackness out of the character. No love making and ect. Don't even waist your time! If you want to see it, check it out on cable tv or something. Save your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie is horrible","review":"Not even the acting of Christian Bale and Sam Jackson could save this horrible, poorly written, bad directed movie. The original is far superior in the fact that it was campy 70's at its best. This movie tries to be campy and serious drama at the same time. Mr. Jackson bashed this movie upon release, and should tell you something. Training day, which explorers similar racial tones is a far superior movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mindless Black Revenge Drama, Boring","review":"Racist cop John Shaft (again the over rated Sam Jackson) thinks that he can break all the rules and beat up innocent people, blow up the streets of New York and shoot anyone he wants to, well, this movie is a bit of something absurd. The direction is terrible, the action sequences are cliched and the \\"black brother\\" message doesn't really make sense because it falls flat by endorsing to kill all \\"honkeys\\".

He's been getting away with it for years.Love the bit where he is told about a white man's brutal assault on an innocent black man and a look of self righteous disgust crosses his face and clearly Singleton expects us to feel the same. Black on black violence is condoned however, and is executed with glee. Preposterously, Shaft shoots no end of people dead in broad daylight without any sanction whatsover.How about a more radical approach, like a white Shaft? Christian Bale looks sharp. A white Shaft who shoots other white people and looks digusted as a black man shoots an innocent white. Do you think the execs would have gone for it? Christain Bale looks so uncannily like James Brolin they could call it 'Crapandcorn One'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shafted.","review":"2000 remake of the original 1971 blaxploitation film that disappoints on nearly every level despite the talent involved. Samuel L. Jackson is nearly on autopilot as the NYC cop who nails a snooty racist (Christian Bale, back in \\"American Psycho\\" mode) for murdering a young Black man (Mekhi Phifer). The film is really a generic vigilante crime drama, with little surprises and countless stereotypes; the most obvious of which is Jeffrey Wright's performance as a Dominican drug dealer. Director John Singleton, who, quite frankly, hasn't done a good movie since 1991's \\"Boyz N the Hood,\\" has cheated the audience by releasing this shoddily-made film. The only good thing about this film is that the Isaac Hayes theme song has been re-recorded almost exactly as is, without any modern touches.

First, it was definately a sci-fi book. It delved into the whole futuristic post-apocolyptic scene. It also had an air of mysticism to it. A blend of several generes. It even had a mystery bent to it as you tried to figure out what was happening to the people who wound up missing. I love post-apocolyptiv books and found this one to be good on the whole government structure side. She explains how things work and why. It sort of reminded me of the Handmaid's Tale by Margaret Atwood. It did ramble on a little bit but that was okay because it made up for it with the rabid religous bent that this particular society took. Especially in comparison to the Guardians and the other societies that also sprang up around it.

For a movie released only 5 or so years ago, their vision of 1999 is far-out (a metal arm? hello! ) and loses some effect since 1999 has come and gone.

This movie was bad enough going in fast forward, so to people that actually sat through the whole movie, i give much respect for that kind of patience. Even when we actually do see Bruce in the end, again, i dont think i even hear a real word come out of his mouth, from his own voice. 5 minutes into the movie and i knew that this film was truly not a worthy Bruce Lee film. It wouldve been better not to have made it at all; Bruce Lee does not fight [poorly], and neither should his movies play [poorly].Bottom line - this movie is at worst a sorry attempt to pay homage to Lee, and at best a great way to help you get ready for bed, or to [make you mad]."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not the Master!","review":"Bruce Lee unfortunately faced his death tragic having only completed a few scenes in the Movie.

The actor who filled in for Bruce did not resemble him at all especially in the fighting and muscular sense.

I wanna start by saying whoever did the editing for this movie should be shot. It's terrible. It's very easy to tell when shots were mixed in. In fact, it's so bad it's funny.

Yes, you can get the SAME sound & picture with a decent VHS version of the movie.Wait for a better release!! (THE ONLY Bruce Lee DVD that is completely digital w/5.1 Surround Sound is 'Enter The Dragon'!!!).Save your money!! SD"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad, so sad","review":"this is truly disgusting, taking a dead man's out takes, footake of his funeral, throwing in doubles that hide behind sunglasses and trying t pass it off as a Bruce Lee classic. its almost as bad as all those Bruce Li and Le rip offs. if Bruce was still with us he wouldn't be too happy, thats for sure. HOWEVER it does include a pretty good fight scene with the master himself. so for that reason alone i give i did no tgive it a 1."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money To Cheesy","review":"This movie would have been cool if Bruce Lee could have finished it in 1970. But the finishing by Raymond Chow is worthless. Don't buy it save your money our buy Fist of fury.Or if you like cheesy movie or the last fighting scene. Buy it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sent Wrong movie","review":"I ordered Game of Death and they sent me Enter the Dragon. They didn't even have Game of Death nor did they let me know. They did allow me to keep the movie for free though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Game i death","review":"I liked the movie until he had is horrible death the qualidy was not to good but the movie was ok"},{"rating":"1","title":"hope the real bruce lee screen is worth seeing....","review":"bruce died from a problem in his brain...but some of the movie has the real bruce..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sounds Great in Surround","review":"The sound was very poor on the original VHS copies that were released. This latest release has been issued with a surround track. John Barry's score sounds great.We all know that this film was made several years after Bruce Lee's death and it included some unused footage of Lee that had been filmed by Robert Clouse. A stand-in for Lee was used for the other scenes (about 90 percent screen time of Lee's character).The fun thing about this movie is watching it and observing just how it was pieced together. I don't think they fooled anyone, but it was a clever idea.It's just a real goof."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst Bruce Lee movies I have ever seen","review":"This movie was a really pathetic attempt to make another Bruce Lee movie after he died. In fact it was completed about 6 years after his death. Only 20 minutes at the end of the movie show Bruce himself, and those 20 minutes are the only reason I bother sitting through the rest of the movie 'cuz they got some good fight scenes, like when Bruce fought against Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Dan Inosanto (and I might add, those are two of his JKD students). If you bother to watch this at all, be prepared for a long and boring movie with Bruce look-alikes. I only suggest this movie to fans of Bruce Lee (and only fans that will not be offended at the funeral scene in the movie, which was bootleg footage from Bruce's funeral)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get ready for tons of compliments!","review":"These thong sandals are so cute. Very unique and different. I bought these for our family Spring Break beach vacation and got lots of compliments every time I wore them. They look great with a pair of bermuda shorts or a light airy summer dress. You can't imagine how comfortable they are! The heel part of the shoe is cushioned and makes the shoe ultra comfortable. I've come to expect this type of comfort with Skechers shoes. I bought the silver pair and I can't wait to buy other colors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meanwhile, back in the 60s.","review":"This is just like an updated B movie from the sixties and I enjoyed it. It's real comic book stuff. The effects are not bad, the pace hardly flags and the cast seem to be enjoying themselves so it's easy viewing. I enjoyed this more than big budget films such as Evolution or Jurassic Park 3. But I think the absence of big names will put people off, not that it matters because the cast here do a fine job. And if big names don't matter to you then you could do a lot worse than watch this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Steer Clear","review":"Absolute junk, one of the worst films I have seen. You will be doing well just to stay awake for the duration."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice forks!!","review":"We like these forks very much. I think that they look elegant.

Excellent product and im going to buy more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT SKY is Breathtaking","review":"I can't say enough about this album, it's everything and more for every moment.

Where Van gets the letter and takes off leaving Taj by himself?Thanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad, but not all it could have been.","review":"As I sat watching the credits go by at the end of \\"Van Wilder\\", I was impressed by the high caliber of songs used (even if but five seconds of that song was played) in the movie. Upon listening to the soundtrack I found that many of the songs I enjoyed in the movie were not in fact on the disc. As previously mentioned, Sugarbomb's \\"Hello\\", and to add to that list, Jimmy Eat World's \\"My Authority Song\\" amongst others. All in all it's a great listen but some of the smaller-name songs would have made it a more enjoyable selection. I can't blame them though - they have to use the big names because hey, that's what sells."},{"rating":"2","title":"What's That Song..","review":"The CD's Pretty Cool.. But does anyone know the name of that song in the movie that goes \\"something something.. Plug 3 and 2.. My name's Plug 1... blah blah\\"...

The song is Show Me by Mint Royale, and features Pos from De La Soul.The song is available on the Mint Royale CD called On The Ropes. Another song from that album, From Rusholme With Love, was prominently featured in Vanilla Sky and Kung Pow. You'll recognize it immediately. The cd is well worth the $$.Hope this helps!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"NEED SONG","review":"DOES ANYONE KNOW THE SONG ON THE END WHEN THE CREDITS SCROLL BY.

For teens and over.It is all about building your own empire to take over the world while defending your own borders. Allies become important. This game needs to come with a warning. It seems to generate a fair bit of arguing and fighting by the players. We have played the game a number of times with different people and each time it results in an argument.Everyone we know who plays this game says the same. We have got to the point of acknowledging it is a great game but good relationships are better. Buyer be ware!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Huh Hah my big toe!","review":"First, be forwarned! These are NOT the original tracks. Close, but no cigar. In my opinion, the only three songs worth listening to are \\"Die Verrater\\" \\"Dschinghis Khan\\", and one of my all-time favorites, \\"Moskau\\". My German isn't what it use to be, but I do know at the last two are not the original cuts from the late 70's, and I'm not altogether sure if the artists are the same. Not a bad collection, but pretty pale stuff compared to the originals I drank so much beer to in what was then West Germany. Prosit!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Real Fast Indian Food by Mridula Baljekar","review":"This book is an excellent reference for formal Indian cooking.It describes classic meals; for instance, Paneer Kabobs with dried prunes, Madras Fish Curry, Kaftas in Lentil Soup andhundreds of other fine foods/recipes. This book would behelpful if you were cooking for an Indian guest or family.It would be useful for chefs and persons desiring to emulatean international flavor in the recipes presented to guests."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I have a tremendous amount of respect for Bill Hybels, but this book was a disappointment. It is the chronicle of a bad marriage, of people who probably shouldn't have gotten married. The Hybels bad experience colors their advice, causing them to make blanket recommendations, such as everyone should date for at least a year before considering marriage. What people need prior to marriage is an understanding of what God intends marriage to be. This book doesn't provide that.I'm glad the Hybels marriage is good now; but if you're looking for a pre-marriage book, check out Neil Clark Warren's _Finding the Love of Your Life_."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome read!","review":"This is a great read for singles, those in dating relationships and married couples alike. Bill and Lynne Hybels offer a personal look into the struggles and success of their marriage. They provide a transparent account of the lessons they learned from their own marriage and give valuable advice to the reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"ABSOLUTE GREATEST ANIME SERIES EVER MADE","review":"great story, lots of action, good comedy, and the ending doesn't ....."},{"rating":"2","title":"nadia","review":"i love nadia anyway nadia is an very old cartoon since my childhood it came on arabic television i live in the middle east though where i live they dub old japanese cartoons nadia is so old i have very little memory of it...."},{"rating":"2","title":"On DVD at last. A must for Anime fans.","review":"I first saw Nadia when it aired on TV in Japan at the end of the 80's. I was mesmerized then, and couldn't wait to get my hands on a copy once I got back to the states. Only volume one was available on LD, and I thought that was the end. But now it's on DVD! I am thrilled.Taking elements from \\"20,000 leagues under the sea\\", \\"Fushigi no Umi no Nadia\\", or \\"The Secret of Blue Water\\", as it's also known, is a wonderful adventure involving Jean, a genius inventor, Nadia, a mysterious girl whom he befriends, and the \\"Blue Water\\"--a jeweled pendant which Nadia keeps.If you enjoyed Laputa, or other Miyazaki Hayao animations, you will love the beautiful, detailed scenes in Nadia. Watch it in Japanese, with subtitles, for the best affect. I switched to English, but not for long--the dub made me grimace."},{"rating":"2","title":"Monticello was saved by the Levys","review":"Thank you Mr. Leepson for \\"Saving Monticello\\". I found it a very enjoyable read and very interesting. As a Virginian, we are proud of all our historic sites and heritage and the story of the Levy family is one of the best that I have read in a long time. Anyone who reads this book will discover that Uriah and Jefferson Levy deserve a lot credit for \\"Saving Monticello\\". Preserving Monticello was the Levy's way of keeping the memory of Thomas Jefferson alive. If it wasn't for the resources of the Levys, the many treasures of Monticello would have been lost to future generations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull, dull, dull","review":"Pass on this one. Monticello itself takes a back seat to the Levy saga of buying the estate."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Family Owned Monticello Longer than the Jeffersons","review":"I am an admirer of Thomas Jefferson and of his magnificent mansion, Monticello. I thought I knew a good deal about both, but was amazed to learn that I had no idea that a family, the Levys, owned Monticello for 89 years, longer than the Jefferson family did--and that the Levys saved it from ruin twice. That's the story this remarkable book tells. I strongly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fine VCR","review":"for 70 bucks this is a great value! i returned my ge 4 head vcr in exchange for this one and i'm keeping it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Enough Sipowicz","review":"I was disappointed by this book. It was not what I thought it was going to be. I love NYPD Blue and I love Sipowicz. I think Sipowicz is the most interesting, complex, and real character on television. I found that many of the essays (the book is comprised of 16 essays on different themes in NYPD Blue) use Sipowicz and NYPD Blue merely as a launching pad to discuss more general topics. For example one chapter starts off discussing Sipowicz's interaction with AA, but then turns into an essay on AA, not on Sipowicz or NYPD Blue. There's not enough Sipowicz in this book for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not waste your time or money on this book!","review":"I should have read a closer analysis of this book. I thought it would be entertaining about past situations presented to a ficitonal character and how he responded. Instead it was a bunch of rhetoric from scholars disecting fictional situations. I would not recommend this book to any fan of NYPD Blue. BORING!"},{"rating":"2","title":"keeps your heart racing","review":"My son got this game as a gift on my birthday. Funny anyway we played it that evening. We had a blast and laughed so much I was tearing. It makes you heart race. So not for the weak hearted. Definitely for 12 and older. I would like to find some more games like it. I highly recommend to others who like a little scare and laughter rolled into one."},{"rating":"1","title":"ATMOSFEAR ISNT NIGHTMARE","review":"I have to say I loved the Nightmare games. I have all four. I was disappointed when they stopped making them. Atmosfear is not the same. The Gatekeeper in Nightmare was such an evil guy. He was always on you but Atmosfear was too tame. If you really want a fun game find the Nightmare games. They were originally only on VHS. The first is Nightmare with the Gatekeeper; Nightmare 2 with the Baron (Zombie); Nightmare 3 with Anne De Chantraine (witch); and Nightmare 4 with Elizabeth Bathory (vampire)."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST.GAME.EVER!!!","review":"Yo i got this game for my birthday (which was Dec. 5) and i played it with my friends and family and IT WAS FUN!!!!!!!!!!!!
