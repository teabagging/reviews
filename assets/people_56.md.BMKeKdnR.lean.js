Not only does it have lively and catchy music to inspire the fire within us (such as \\"Pink Kawala\\" and \\"Macatea\\"), but the calming music of \\"Into The Mist\\" and \\"Robin\\" will be sure to tame the heartiest of pirates... \\"pirates... as in argh?!\\" The spirit, humor, and action of the \\"Six Days, Seven Nights\\" motion picture is truly captured on this CD. So, if you're in the mood for some great tropical beats, I recommend buying this CD today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Six Days, Seven Nights","review":"I love this movie. It is hilarious. I've seen it many times on TV. There is action and/or humor continuously. If you like tropical islands and comedy/drama you will love this one. I will watch it again and again. I wanted to add it to my collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Old man falls for young chick","review":"Second rate movie with a third rate plot. Ford is beginning to show his age. To make matters worse -- Heche's character is totally uninteresting; a real airhead. Now why would a middle-aged man, who supposedly is wordly, go for a young woman, who between the ears is nothing more than a wind tunnel? How much more entertaining and intriquing this movie could have been if the woman's part was played by someone closer to Ford's age and sophistication! It would have given Ford's character a run for his money, and we would really see the sparks fly. (Ah yes, but this is Hollywood -- no guts, and always choose the easy way out). The pirates were a bit much. Could have been a good flick, but got wasted away -- as usual."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great DVD","review":"Received this DVD on time and fast. The movie itself is quirky, funny, and just a good piece to watch.It isn't mind blowing- but it's a nice movie to watch if you want a pick me up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"Warning -- Watching this movie may be hazardous to your intellect. While I appreciate that Amazon is in the business of selling movies and would probably rather see reviews accentuating the positive, I would urge you to buy just about any other movie Amazon offers before you consider this one. With the exception of a couple mildly amusing exchanges, the movie is without any redeeming qualities. Even the usually dependable Ford fails to save this one from the garbage heap. The plot is ridiculous, utterly implausible, and insulting to one's intelligence. I wouldn't waste my own time or money, and I urge you not to waste yours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away from this one!","review":"This is NOT one of Harrison Ford's best films. I feel that he lowered himself to take this role. No way can this film be compared to Patriot Games or Clear and Present Danger as far as one of Harrison Ford's great films. This show was so stupid that it was very sad to associate such a great actor as Harrison Ford with this waste of film. It doesn't suprise me with Ann Heche in this film. A poor actress for a poor film. Don't waste your money or time on this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Acting","review":"If you like \\"Soup of the Soul\\" type books, you might like this movie.

Harrison Ford and Anne Heche have no chemistry at all. They might as well have played father and daughter to each other.

I expected better of him. I guess Ford will do anything for money, even when he doesn't need it. If this is the best that Harrison Ford can do then he ought to get out the movies.

Adventure+romance+Harrison Ford sounds like a good combination. However, this was not the case. Besides being unbelievably boring, it was also implausible and I really disliked Anne Heche's character. Harrison Ford was the hi-light of the movie, but even his role was a little aggrivating. For a better Adventure/romance watch \\"Romancing the Stone.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie is CRAP!","review":"What a huge disappointment. I have this movie on VHS. WAtched it once. I want to use it for target practice. Then I bought a DVD player and got it for free. Its still in the plastic. I could never watch this movie again. Anybody want it? Its free!The jokes were almost as bad as the story. Come on?? Crash on a desery island and have to survive? Gee, thats a new concept. Oh and the pirates! Who has pirates nowadays?!Heres a scary the scary thing. I am a huge fan of Harrison Ford. I'll say it again, what a disappointment. This was his worst movie. This was the worst movie since Babe! I give it negative 1 star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just another trite and sappy romantic comedy","review":"Note to producers: For God's sake, if you're gonna make a movie about being stranded on a deserted island, don't film it on Kauai.

You will experience clear crisp images and outstanding music and sound! I was rather surprised, as I thought I would need to get it on DVD to have the perfection I usually look for. Anne Heche is wonderful in this film ~ she sparkles; and so is, as usual ~ the great Harrison Ford; and David Schwimmer is appropriately cast too, and delivers a fine performance; other supporting actors are great looking, interesting to watch and do a fine job as well. It has everything you would want in a film: Adventure, Romance, Comedy and the Gorgeous Island of Kauai with all of its spectacular views!!

The Beaver was great also.I would give it 10 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't regret seeing it","review":"I would say this is a fine movie to watch while you're falling asleep. The plot was blunt and required no real ability to think. I was impressed by the beautiful scenery and got a cheap laugh at the character's facial expressions.. I questioned Robin's ability to remain so beautiful and hairless while spending the better part of a week in the wilderness. I love Harrison Ford but this wasn't one of his films to brag about. This movie was simply entertaining if not captivating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Six Days Seven Nights","review":"This is another one of my favorite Harrison Ford movies.

I laughed all the way through it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie...","review":"Not quite what you'd expect from Harrison Ford but he plays this part to the hilt. Ford is a cargo pilot who takes aboard a young lady, who is hesitant about flying (Anne Heche), for a quick trip to Tahiti...only problem is, they run into a storm and are forced down on a deserted island, where they have to battle pirates, storms, and each other, trying to get off the island and back tocivilization. Great ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"This is my mom's favorite movie, and I'm so glad I was able to order it for her for Christmas. Delivery was extremely fast."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely Funny and Uplifting. Harrison Ford is excellent!","review":"I thought this movie was great! and so under-rated by the critics. It was extremely funny and again, shows the complete versatility of Harrrison Ford to be able to play both dramatic and comedic roles extremely well. Bravo and I advise everyone who wants a laugh to see this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"SAD...","review":"Where are you going, Ford? What is this? A mere vehicle to change pace for a while, trying to be humouristic. But it doesn't work. The proof of this is the ludicrous scene where pirates appears out from the blue..! One good point: Anne HEche is so beautiful as beautiful women are supposed tobe. She's marvellous!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Appalling load of old rubbish","review":"I have been a fan of Harrison Ford since Star Wars in 1977 or whenever it was. I've seen maybe fifteen of his films, and loved them all until now. So I have to ask the question: Is it possible that there could be a worse Harrison Ford movie than this? I'd really have to see it to believe it. This is an utterly appalling load of old rubbish. Ford himself seems to be acting sarcastically as though he's squirming in his boots to have to go through with it. I can't think of a single thing to recommend it, unless it's to study how films should not be made. It's particularly difficult to accept since Harrison Ford is the selling point and he's one of cinema's most reliable actors. You can almost never go wrong. This time however, things didn't go wrongly enough. By the time the aircraft was crash-landing in the storm, I for one was willing it to go down nose first at a couple of hundred miles an hour and let the rest of us get on with other things. Simply awful production."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wife Loves it","review":"My wife can't get enough of this movie, so she's happy, I'm happy....its pretty good..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre","review":"People maybe shouldn't criticize Anne Heche for her personal life, but she DOES deserve criticism for her mediocre acting ability and her lack of charisma or charm. This was a terrible and tragic mismatch of Ford and Heche. By no stretch of the imagination is she \\"lead actress\\" material for a movie like this -- for which I fault the producers/director and not Heche.Ford, of course, is excellent. The movie has an entertaining storyline and great scenery/photography. But for Heche, this movie would have been a winner."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome movie","review":"This movie was very good and at an affordable price as well. It was well wortj the money. I love the deals I find on here"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous movie, great casting","review":"I have always enjoyed the acting of Harrison Ford. This movie shows a side of him you don't normally see in the Indiana Jones trilogy or his drama pieces. He's funny, endearing, evocative and his partnership with Anne Heche was a stroke of genius in casting. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Symphony, not islandy","review":"All of your reviews I read that lead me to buying this CD indicated this was island music. It is not island music by any means---very symphonic. Good for the right setting but definitely not what I expected."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice shots of Kauai's NaPali Coast but...","review":"that alone didn't hold this movie together. Pathetic love story, shallow story, even more shallow characters, and action scenes consisted of \\"Keystone Cops\\" meet the \\"Pirates of Penzance\\". But maybe that is what the director intended. If you must buy/rent this movie (not film) keep it on a 21\\" screen or smaller."},{"rating":"2","title":"Six Days, Seven Nights","review":"It was a fun movie. Good chemistry between Anne Heche and Harrison Ford. David Schwimmer was annoying as usual."},{"rating":"2","title":"dvd","review":"I love that movie. I wish it have blu ray instead ing of the dvd. Its a good movie. You gotta to love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice light romantic comedy; Ford carries it and Heche helps.","review":"The whole movie is about romantic sparks between Ford and Heche. Ford is amazing - there are moments when you can't believe this is the same man who did Indiana Jones, Han Solo and Jack Ryan. Heche is charming, but her TV Sit-Com style is overwhelming at times; it is when she settles down and gets serious that she becomes believable. The plot is largely superfluous. David Schwimmer fills his role as the overly-sensitive contrast to Ford very well. I wish they had played up the back ground scenery more - Kauai in Hawaii."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flaws in the Movie:","review":"Well, they could've just glued it back together! He had glue in his pocket (you see when he boards the plane, it says \\"Elmer's School Glue\\"). So, he wasn't being sarchastic when he said \\"Sure, we can just, like, glue it back together!\\". He meant it, but the script prevented him from doing so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice romantic-comedy","review":"It's fun watching Ford and Heche struggling in beautiful island and then falling in love.Dialog is also funny.Truely enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you're looking for light, romantic comedy, this is it!","review":"I really liked this film! Harrison Ford still looks great, and he could be playful in ways his other roles haven't allowed. There is definitely chemistry between Anne Heche and Ford. So it wasn't The Fugitive or Patriot Games--this is a perfect film for those interested in light, romantic comedy along the lines of Romancing the Stone, African Queen, and so many others. I think some critics were unfairly harsh toward this film. I still recommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A FOUR STAR AVERAGE RATING!?!?!","review":"PEOPLE! Get a grip! There are only five stars! This was an okay flick, not a bad time waster, but is it really 80% of the movie that, say, Taxi Driver or One Flew Over the Cuckoo's nest are? Does anybody trouble him (her) self to think before entering the star rating? Amazon should make 1 star the default and have people work up from there. Like 6 people think this is 100% of what a movie should be! The mind boggles. Too many kids online maybe."},{"rating":"1","title":"wonderful until they shatter","review":"These are for the most part, magnificent wine glasses. Notice I said for the most part. The problems stem not from the experience of drinking the wine, but from what happens afterwards. It seems as if anything-- and I do mean anything-- can and will shatter these fragile glasses. They have broken in the dishwasher; broken when washing by hand (as gently as if I were washing a baby's bottom); broken when being tucked away for the night; broken even when glanced at (though it was with some degree of malice). And this state of fragility is not limited to the cabernet glasses, or, as I refer to them - the brunello glasses. It happens with an equal frequency to the barolo, chianti, and even the meek and diminutive pinot grigio size.If you enjoy drinking wine, and don't mind stocking a garage full of wine glasses, then please click the button to purchase these. They are fine glasses while they last.Jim Giammatteo"},{"rating":"2","title":"You can't go wrong with these glasses.","review":"Great for every day, don't keep these in the cabinet or china hutch. Life is too short to drink cheap wine or use cheap glasses and these are really affordable Riedel. Use a quality glass for your wine - you are worth it. The shape of these glasses will bring out all the nuances a Bordeaux, Cab or Meritage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Riedel Vinum Bordeaux/Cabernet Glasses","review":"There's not much you can say about these glasses other than they are of excellent quality and are used by many upscale restaurants as well as in a good number of the better tasting rooms found in the Napa and Sonoma California wineries. They are designed in a manner that allows the user to adequately check the nose of the wine as well as to give it a good \\"swirl\\" so it opens up a bit. Follow the manufacturer's recommendations for cleaning and you should find they will serve you well over the years while impressing your friends in the process. Like any good wine glass, they are \\"somewhat\\" fragil, but if handled properly, they will last a long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"great product; damaged","review":"I ordered 8 Riedel Vinum Bordeaux glasses. 2 of the first four were chipped. I returned them and was sent replacements. One arrived with the stem broken. In checking with a local store, I saved only the tax and would have had less trouble and perfect condition glasses.The glasses themselves are great."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Show that started all the insanity","review":"This HBO special introduced PeeWee to a much wider audience, whereas before he had a cult following on the west coast, college campuses and via the National Lampoon magazine. All the supporting characters are excellent; the humor pushes the envelope without going over the line. Phil Hartman as Captain Carl is super as is Edie McClurg as Hermit Hattie. Shoe-Mirrors, Flying Reptiles; Bag-O-Tricks; and Hypnotic Dr. Mondo who can undress the audience are just the tip of the insanity iceberg. The raw energy can be seen here which evolved into the Emmy award winning Saturday morning show."},{"rating":"2","title":"This one's not for the kiddies!","review":"This is how the Pee Wee phenomenon got started. This is why television snatched it up and it became a Saturday morning staple. Why kids watched their parents eating Capt. Crunch and watching Pee Wee on Saturday mornings.It was great seeing pre-SNL Phil Hartmann. Their acting is raw and the jokes spot on.Let the kids finish watching Sponge Bob, then send them to their room. It's time for Mom and Dad to have some real fun.--- Shoe mirrors!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pee Wee - Unplugged","review":"This is the one that started it all. Videotaped in 1981 at the Roxy Theater in Los Angeles, this is essentially a stage show that precursored the dawn of Pee Wee. It's much funnier than the TV Series and definitely more... adult (without being obscene). When I rented this I had never heard of this guy - I was looking for a video for my son (8 -then) to watch. He was out playing with his friends so I watched it instead. It was the funniest thing I'd seen in a while. Even then you could see Paul Reubens comic genius. However this video is hard to find for some reason. I hope it will again be made available."},{"rating":"2","title":"Original PeeWee","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this-- I had seen the original on HBO when it first aired, and a few skits stuck in my memory forever-- the mirror shoes, and the puppet voodoo-- very funny. Love the cast-- I've always been a peewee fan-- loved the playhouse.Pee got a bum rap--I'D LIKE HIM TO COME BACK..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A gem from the vaults","review":"I never saw PWH in its original incarnations so this live show [now nearly 30 years old] was all new to me. It has a strong theatrical feel which I enjoyed--all the cast worked hard to keep the energy high. The gags are pretty timeless and the raunch factor is about minus 2. Pathos was on offer via the presence of Phil Hartmann. My spouse, who had requested it as a gift, waxed nostalgic and appreciative."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has its ups and downs. Sometimes you find yourself forced to laugh","review":"There must have been a laugh track to this HBO special, or the audience was high or something, because they were laughing at almost every little thing Pee-Wee did It was surprising to see a stage-version of what would essentially become Pee-Wee's Playhouse, with more adult situations (like Pee-Wee looking up a girl's skirt with mirrors on his shoes, to which the girl notices and says to his dismay, \\"I'm not wearing panties\\") Some of the characters from the TV show are here, including a raunchy Captain Carl, a somewhat psychotic Miss Yvonne, and Jambi!!!!!!!!!!!! Some of the antics were only mildly amusing, but there was nothing that was laugh out loud funny in the entire show. It's amazing to see these people in the crowd laugh uproariously at what you would have to force yourself to laugh at, or just snort a bit.All in all, it was fun to see Pee-Wee's Playhouse with an adult spin to it, but it wasn't at all very funny"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful characters","review":"A historical novel setting the tone of the time in regards to revolutionary war and the event leading up to it. It is written for the period, and it does not fit today's standards of political correctness. However, the characters are believable and endearing. I have never felt as connected to the main characters as I have here. I hartily recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent source for archery groups and SCA groups","review":"This is a wonderful source book for archery clubs looking to give their next tournament a medieval feel.

Now, wasn't this the best review ever?"},{"rating":"1","title":"For Joe Dallesandro fans only","review":"If you are looking for a good story and character development, this movie dissapoints. The story is rather thin and slow with more focus on Joe's good looks. A irritatating aspect of the DVD was white flashes occuring at innapropriate moments during the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anthropological artifacts","review":"Without wanting to sound like Bob Dylan's Thin Man, I have to say that the movies in this collection are nothing more than anthropological artifacts, amusing in parts, but crude and technically deficient. The acting, if it qualifies as acting, portrays a gallery of marginalized outcasts in the main, just letting it all hang out for the cameras. Their performances are stiff and flat, and lacking emotional depth. You get exhausted watching Joe Dallesandro lounging about in the nick while other characters squabble about their dysfunctional relationships. It's an aimless meander from one bazaar scene to the next, amid a parade of weird white people, peeling off their clothes at the drop of a hat and indulging in exhibitionism, voyeurism, and trainspotting. In some respects, it's Jerry Springer without the audience and Jerry, but a little less restrained. If you like inarticulate weirdness, this collection is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"The single worst piece of crap I have ever seen.","review":"This is the worst movie I have ever seen. It isn't the gay sexuality, I have no problem with that kind of content. But the acting, the editing, the dialog were all terrible. I am even a fan of Patti D'Arbanville, and I still hated it. I watched the whole thing thinking that the characteristics that the people who gave it a 5 star rating would arrive, but they didn't. I feel cheated even though it was free. I wasted an hour and a half on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let the buyer beware","review":"Perhaps I should have done some research before I bought the 4 disc set, but I was surprised to find these to be so disappointing. I had read Holly Woodlawn's book, \\"A Low Life in High Heels\\", and thought I would get more of a feel for all of the book's hype about Paul Morrissey and Andy Warhol and the movies they made. I just didn't know what I was getting. I wasn't misled by anyone. I suppose if you are a cult fan of PM & AW, you should have these for your collection. I'll make you a really good deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Day in the Life of Joe","review":"Certainly not for everyone's taste (the first camera shot will establish that) but a great introduction to the JOE TRILOGY. Just for the record, Andy did NOT direct this or any other of the Joe films! These are all Paul Morrissey! The opening shot however was an homage to the early static films that Warhol was famous for, more specifically 'SLEEP'. At any rate the sound was edited 'in-camera' and there are even whole sequences without sound AT ALL!!!! So don't be surprised by the poor audio. The film was also edited likewise and there is an audible POP at each edit. Do not attempt to adjust your set or return the dvd, it;s all part of the experience!!! Oh... and Joe D'Alllesandro stars in it (sometimes with his clothes on)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Paul Morrissey","review":"These films are classics of the Paul Morrissey/Andy Warhol era.

I was expecting timely words and insights on the importance of farmers and small local markets. And don't get me wrong, that was there, but peppered throughout his book of opinions (I mean observations), were dated, aged comments about youth (such as I)and the popula culture of today. I felt mis-understood, and could only relate as a I do to my mother.

Perhaps. One, of limited domain, sticks with me because it came to me in the course of vivid personal experience it's \`When you're burning a brush pile, don't wear a straw hat.'\\" Now that's a sentence! Or rather an entire story in a sentence. You can carry it out as far as you have time and imagination. And it's just one of the many such vivid and entertaining offerings in this wonderful book. In addition to the entertainment there's a large dose of history, philosophy and economics which I quite enjoyed and appreciated.

One of the first that we got was a recording of \\"The Happy Prince\\". It featured Bing Crosby. I listened to it over and over until I went off to college. Years later I was in England, and I discovered that there was a whole book of stories. Over the years I have re-read this book so much that it is now in tatters. Each story is a gem unto itself. Each story will become another jewel in your treasure chest of lenses, which help you to see the world more clearly. Now that I have discovered that this book is still in print, I expect to buy multiple copies to give as Christmas Gifts this year. Do yourself a favor and don't miss these delightful additions to your life.

It contains some terrific classic read-aloud stories, and is very well bound. Beautiful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same old story","review":"I bought this book because of the RITA award and excellent reader reviews. I was so surprised to find it completely predictable and trite. I don't mind if Romance novels follow the same worn plot - in fact, their very predictability is comforting. I do mind if they lack any originality, however. I found the conversation dull and unrealistic. There was no spark of passion. I did not understand the motivations for the characters at all. They were so weighted down with pathos and past injuries that I could barely keep myself turning the pages. My favorite regency romance is Whitney My Love - the same old plot but with humor and complex character development."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreal even for a romance novel","review":"It began well enough, but from the middle to the last page it went frankly boring.

Leah wasone of the great, wonderful heroines who took on the devil and won. Iloved her spunk and devotion to her sister.However, I had some problems with Raven. In my opinion it started off bad that he would even think to marry a woman dying without her consent. Leah handled it very well, but it put me off him and he never quite recovered.I found his motivations weak and unbelievable. When he \\"exposed\\" his past to her, I wanted to shout--could you stop snivling and grow up. He just seemed like a spoiled baby to me.In spite of that, though, I really did like the book and have recommended it to several other people. It was a nice effort and I'll definitely read Ms. Coughlin again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best thing I have ever read. Could not put it down.","review":"I have been reading romance for the past 12 years (everything from Barbara Cartland to Jackie Collins).

It was interesting enough to finish but I really wouldn't recommend this book (unless you're just a hardcore Cyberpunk fanatic).Not recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cyber-rabia!","review":"Unreal! This and the other two Marid Audran books transport the reader to a fantastical Muslim world of the near future where principles, religion and technology become throwaway commodities available to the highest bidder. Audran's fall from independence to virtual slavery is exciting and damning of the protagonist all at once. A worthy peer of the cyberpunk gods!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kinda Better Than The Voyager","review":"I like this figure much more than the voyager.

As a space buff, I can say that I learned nothing new from the book--in fact, the book does not cover what it purports to cover--the Shuttle-Mir missions.Thumbs down! This author should stick to writing Vanity Fair articles--he is way out of his league trying to write about the intricacies of space. (How can anyone make space boring??)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A page-turner","review":"I think Burrough has done an amazing job of reporting and writing here, fleshing out the drama (and bureaucratic folly) of a story that has existed now for several years on the periphery of our consciousness. It is a fascinating study of the culture clash of the Russian and American space programs, and of the egos, eccentricities and talents of the various astronauts and cosmonauts who have had to work together in closet-sized spaces for months at a time. I was left with an appreciation for the difficulties of living in space that gives me a deep and permanent chill in my bones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Author did his homework","review":"This is a very well written and very well researched book. I was very much drawn into the story from the beginning of the book until the last page.

This is a great book because in reading it you can put in context the present actions in space"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT!","review":"I find myself referencing this book quite often! Illustrates not only contempory history but shows how other religions can go down the path of fundamentalism. Many paralles can be drawn to the current conflict in the middle east as well as domestic terrorists and how they came to be. A great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scary story, well written","review":"The book discusses the background for Mormon fundamentalism, but also gives the reader the story of Joseph Smith and how the Mormon religion was founded, focusing on the religion's violent beginnings. The central story of the book is the murder of a Mormon woman and her toddler daughter and why this murder happened. Well written, although certainly not an objectively written book. Krakauer's opinions and feelings about the polygamist fundamentalist Ladder Day Saints are quite clear throughout the story. Very interesting story, makes you scared to think how far someone will go and claim religion as the reason."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Son and his Dog Broke it!!!!!","review":"When I just bought this toy for my son,he played with his dog and he tripped on it.The posts droke and the ropes ripped.After that I gave him a beating and smashed the ring on his head."},{"rating":"2","title":"ok ring","review":"these rings are ok.very small but ok and the post do break easley becase i went throungh 5 of them in 2 months.you can onley fit about 6 actionfigures in it.i would recomend the full scale ring."},{"rating":"2","title":"My son's favorite toy","review":"My son absolutely LOVES this ring! It has ropes for the wrestlers to bounce off of, and the mat allows the wrestlers to bounce back up as well. The only problem with this toy is that I have had to buy 4 of them because the posts keep breaking. A couple of times, I think my son actually tripped over it, causing them to break, but at least 1 time it broke from play. Overall, a great toy for any young wrestling fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for all level of quilters","review":"A well written, excellently produced book of 13 quilt patterns that a confident beginner can construct with extensive discussion on color choice. Each quilt is shown finished in color but the patterns are printed in black and grey which is an excellent decision because it allows the quilter to make fabric choices without being predisposed to only think about the sample that was shown.These quilts do not look like beginner's projects and the patterns will produce quilts which every level of quilter will be proud to make, show, or own. This book deserves to be on a quilter's book shelf with the other permanent keepers."},{"rating":"2","title":"A step into the past!","review":"Beautiful imagery to correspond with in comparison to the \\"Road to Avonlea\\" episode. Well written, and gives the impression that present day society is not all that different than it was one hundred years ago, we all carry the same basic problems and tribulations in life. This children's book takes it's reader to a differnt place, time, and age. The young become old as they dream between it's pages, and the old return to their sometimes forgotten youth. It is a step into the past for a seasoned, (or non-seasoned as the case may be) traveler! Although, on average, this is good reading, be wary adults that this is clearly a children's book and lacks the depth that L.M. Montgomery placed into the novels she herself wrote, and is merely an elaboration on an episode in a television series. Despite that, it is a must-have for a true 'Avonlea' fan, as are all the books in this paticular series."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book was written 100 years ago.

As he explains in his \\"Quinnipiac r-dialect Language Guide,\\"Each language is a strand in the fabric of world cultural survival. Each culture has its own unique way of seeing and explaining the world around it...and this is known as their ethos or world-view.\\"In \\"Return of the Thunderbeings,\\" Thunderhorse uses his multilingual fluency to trace shamanism in a comparative analysis across the globe. His Native American traditionalist values prompted him to strive for understanding among nations in order to fulfill one of his duties as culture bearer - the protection of Mother Earth, without whose health persons of all races and all nations will suffer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charming Deja Vu","review":"Greta Garbo and the Barrymore brothers are the top stars in the movie. Joan Crawford is however wonderful andWallace Beery is excellent in their roles. Beery's character appears to be humorously ogling Crawford as an ambitious secretary in their scenes together. John Barrymore displays some of the intensity which made him famous. Garbo's beauty and also grace and style are what her fans fell in love with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Barrymore and Garbo","review":"I found this film a very high-quality, well-appointed DVD product for the old movie collector or the Barrymore afficionado. John Barrymore at his romantic best as a movie star, probably in his waning years but nevertheless dashing and effective as the tarnished and destitute society leech and jewel thief. The scenes with Garbo are historic. And a young Joan Crawford is beguiling as an impressionistic secretary. Her beauty is mysterious and timeless. Great resolution in the transfer, clear and sharp and beautifully black & white. My research into John Barrymore's life and career was greatly enhanced by this DVD. Hopefully, archival material like this film will be marketed and promoted better in the future. We have a treasure in Hollywood films like \\"Grand Hotel.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Grand Melodrama","review":"Lets face it, \\"Grand Hotel\\" is essentially a soap opera, albeit an entertaining one, with ornate trappings. What distinguishes this film from the mundane is it's incredible cast(Greta Garbo, John Barrymore, Lionel Barrymore, Joan Crawford, Wallace Beery) who breathe life into otherwise ordinary material. I would recommend this film to anyone who want to see these screen legends in an ensemble setting. That said, a better film of this type is \\"Dinner at Eight\\". Not only does that film include the Barrymores and Beery but also a simply dazzling Jean Harlowe performance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bizarre","review":"I've seen this movie several times, and have always hated it. I don't know why - I love old movies, but I find this one impossible. Garbo is simply bad - incredible histrionics and inexplicable gyrations and shakes of the shoulders which I'm sure were meant to demonstrate her character as a ballerina, but which look only odd to the modern viewer. The whole film is stilted and shallow. The only other \\"classic film\\" I've ever come away from feeling shafted by was \\"Mrs. Miniver\\" for, I think, similar reasons. I think the modern viewer is simply incapable of viewing these movies in the spirit in which they were intended."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get the hype","review":"Sorry. This may be deemed a classic but I just couldn't get into it. Perhaps it is because it is the early days of movies. I think they sped up the reel so fast that it made people seem as if they were talking fast. Or maybe they were not acting but just reciting lines. I have no idea. But I can't understand people during this era. And the men . . . they seem too painted up . . . too . . . dracula like or something. I dunno. Not my cup of tea."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Greatest!!","review":"They don't come any better! Out of this remarkable cast, Lionel Barrymore runs away with the very finest role he has ever shown! (yes, even though his brother, John Barrymore, plays a most compassionate, romantic role at the top of his fame!)This is definitely a movie for your collection, to be watched over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"1932 oldie","review":"If i get a chance to see a movie from this era,i like to have a look at them probably for nostalgic reasons.This movie was very well made and the acting quite good.But i thought it lacked a good plot.I struggled to follow this movie going in and out of thinking about other things,and then saying to myself it's a bit boring.I just couldn't get into it for the most part.There was a murder towards the end and i started following it a bit then."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grand Old Film Seems Fresh","review":"This film holds up quite well after nearly 75 years, and after watching the first 1/2 hour, you'll know why: timeless acting, a literate sceenplay and beautiful b/w cinematography. The ensemble acting is terrific with many great nuanced performances, with no one performance *stealing* the film but gaining poignancy from playing off one another. The screenplay seems to have been written by someone who has known life, especially life among the rich and famous, and the film has enough depictions of the suffering rich to make F.Scott Fitzgerald proud. There are many famous lines which you will recognize, including the famous, *I vant to be alone* by Greta Garbo.This is one of my favorite golden age films, and you can't say you know films without seeing it at least once."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Recording","review":"Audio quality is very poor- words are barely intelligible.

This book reminded me of Rick Joyner's \\"The Final Quest\\" which everybody told me I just HAD to read..A book where you have to read the story and decipher/read into what the spiritual meaning is for you and apply it to your life.

It was \\"nice\\" but not helpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"When 'broken' really means 'whole'","review":"A mystical quality lingers about this tale of the biblical kings Saul, David, and Absalom, and so it grows even on readers who have been well vaccinated against insipid allegorizing.Anyone who has led and been hurt in the process-this may include anyone who has led-is a candidate for reading this brief, short-chaptered invitation to reflect upon power, who has it, what it does to those who hold it, and when to let go.Edwards has worked in particular with members who have limped out of authoritarian Christian movements and appears to recognize the scars with clinical ease. Fortunately, he has in his sack a remedy or two, or perhaps an innoculation against similar misfortune in future. Oh, and salve for the enduring wound.A very quick read, well worth the time invested."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Recommended","review":"This book, in my opinion, is very misleading and could be harmful to anyone under the authority of a pastor who is abusive or misusing his authority. It makes an interesting point that we cannot know if someone has been placed in leadership by God or by their own doing. But it goes on to teach that you should always submit to such a leader and just hope that God will change the situation (as David did not get involved in Saul's removal as king). However, the New Testament is full of instruction on confronting and correcting sin, in love, even of our pastors. They are representing God and should only hold their positions if they are emulating Jesus, the Good Shepard. To do nothing in response to an abusive leader, is not love or godly submission at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Phrases not scripturally founded.","review":"I thought the book was laden with writings that were not found in the scriptures. The premise seems enlightening, but is it worth reading if an author does not base his fiction on the truth of the word in the Bible? Does the end, justify the means?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Tale Told","review":"I have not had an opportunity to read this book yet but the person that recommended it was very impressed. She said anyone that has been hurt by those you value this is the book for you. Most often those that hurt you are love ones or those that you value as a friend. This book will put it back into perspective for you and direct your focus on the problem and not the person. You can continue to love through your hurt."},{"rating":"2","title":"A man after God's own heart","review":"What an awsome story to tell you how we should act and handle situations. This book really lets you see things as they are. Can we endure the hardships that David did in his early years and still look with compasion on someone. This book helps you to look at things in the light of how God would have you look at it and you will get the victory!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential reading!","review":"This book by Gene Edwards will cause a deep self examination by any serious and honest reader. Using the tale of David, you are led down the pathway of questioning how we should react and behave when we are persecuted and mistreated. You will not be the same after reading this book!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Tale of 3 Kings","review":"A great book dealing in humility and brokenness. It is one of my favorites. I purchased this one as a gift for a friend. I recommend it to all Christians."},{"rating":"2","title":"Healing from being Broken","review":"Since reading this book in 1997, it has become the book I recommend most to people. A Tale of Three Kings brought a new perspective and even healing from being able to release my own bitterness and anger in how I had been treated in a particular situation.By looking at the Biblical examples of Saul, David, and Absalom this book challenged me to think about who represented my life the best. As I read the book, I of course thought I was a David. Then as I read more and more of the book, I began to see that through my bitterness and anger, I was more of a Saul.This book confronted me at a very real level in a way in which I saw my own sin. The lessons I learned through this book, have brought me to the point of forgiveness and acceptance of what happened. It brought me to my knees in repentance as well.This is a must read for anyone who has ever been hurt by fellow believers, or will be hurt by fellow believers (which is pretty much all of us)."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you're leaving, leave quietly","review":"Anyone voluntarily or involuntarily leaving a position; particularly a church staff position MUST read this. This will help you leave better, not bitter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book","review":"This book was referred to me by my pastor and he recommended for us to purchase it. I am so glad that I did. I skimmed through it the first go round but ended up reading it again at a slower pace. I really received the message in this book for myself and the situation I was going through. Truly this is an excellent book and I highly recommend it for those that have been wounded by leadership."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"While Edwards' book is great literature, I found it theologically, biblically, and pastorally empty for those traumatized by abusive churches and denominational leadership. Where is NT church discipline where we call both members and leaders into account in a gentle spirit that speaks the truth in love. I much prefer VanVonderen's When God's People Let You Down and books like Allender's Bold love that help us deal abusive people. I'm sorry that I bought the book and will not read anything more by this author although I had thought about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Profoundly helpful for hurting people.","review":"Everyone will (or ought to) hurt deeply over something in their life and this short book uses a parable setting to shed helpful light on how to redeem hurt and go forward. A very good gift to someone in need of a lift. Not simplistic but simple."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read For The twenty-First Century","review":"When I think about how, in the past, I have voted for my elected officials, including President if the United States, this book has opened my eyes as to how God would have me pray prior to voting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reveals the Saul or David spirit in each of us.","review":"A former Christian Bookstore owner, I consider this to be one of the \\"must have\\" books on my shelf. It opened my eyes to the way I respond to hurt from others and literally caused me to weep. I've read it several times. Anyone wanting to walk in the ways of the Lord and respond rather than react to others must read this. There's a David and Saul battle raging in all of us--this book reveals which one is operating in us at any given time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding!!","review":"A Tale of Three Kings is an outstanding study in leadership that is good and leadership that is evil. To think that Edwards said it in so few words so well makes it a superb piece of reading. Don't miss it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Perspective on Brokenness and Followership","review":"The name of this book doesn't really convey the full purpose of this book. It is a book on brokenness, recovery, restoration and followership. It is not focused upon the followership of a person but upon God Himself.I was deeply moved by the writing found here of these 3 kings and how I am just like them. Just when I was thinking about how I could identify with the pain of another person, the author would call me back to reality and state don't think about how another person is like this king, but how are you personally like this king.I highly recommend this practical writing that applies deeply to every person who would read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't purchase this item!!!!!","review":"I bought this DVD. It didn't play. I asked for a replacement. It also didn't play.It was a great disappointment as I was looking forward to watching this program."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's not all fun and games...","review":"To my knowledge, this video is the only piece of audio or video media that contains Rollins talking about his best friend Joe Cole and what it was like to have him murdered in front of him. Rollins has kept this subject pretty closely guarded, and if you know his history, you understand why.\\"Talking..\\" contains some funny stuff (Tales of his pet store days about \\"Bun-Bun the Rabbit\\", Henry's observations on and experiences in the LA Riots in 1992), as well as some more intense stuff; descriptions of his father's abuse, and the story about himself and Joe Cole.It's an intense tape, and a good one. I highly recommend it for all fans, and even some of the non-fans may find it compelling and excellent, as I do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hank bears his soul and his weight on DVD...","review":"This two-fer for Rollins fans is an easter egg. Half the stories he tells on both discs are tales told already on his spoken albums, but now have a nice visual touch added in for an even more intense view of Rollins' wonderfully twisted psyche. From travel stories, to personal enlightenment, to the death of friends to masturbation technique, Rollins has a superb gift for making the most mundane experiences we all share, to tight and personal stories you were miles away from, into events the audience can take away as a present, feel they were walking with him, laugh and hate, and feel good overall. Very good, very funny, very touching. A must for anyone who likes to hear a good story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Book","review":"This book was so exciting, I couldn't put it down. If there is only one book you read all year, it should be this one. Victor Carl starts out on a seedy mission of revenge, but slowly comes to believe his hapless client is innocent. How he goes about proving it is amazing, and I don't want to give anything away, but you won't be sorry you read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Victor is back on track...and so is Lashner...","review":"Fatal Flaw is far better than Bitter Truth, in league with the first book in the series, Hostile Witness. This book is lengthy, but does not feel overly long. The long, wandering passages of Bitter Truth are no where to be found (nor are any references to that story). A twisting, turning, but never hard to follow plot keeps you intrigued. And Victor, while not more successful, really has grown up. Well, not in his choice of women, but certainly in his understanding and the fact that he is not striving for money here. That is a refreshing change. I was still annoyed to see Beth as a secondary character. Even more, why the heck was Morris Kapustin ignored (ok, there was one mention). Couldn't have been used in some way? Oh, those are minor quibbles (as Skink is a good PI). I look forward to the next adventure of Victor Carl."},{"rating":"1","title":"Impossible","review":"This is an OK book, but it's too long and the author seems to write long passages to no effect becuase it's fun, not because the story needs it. As usual, small town America is the root of evil and there wasn't much mystery about the real murderer's identity. We have an attempt on the hero's life by the standard technique of running his car off the road; this never works, so why bother? The plot is also totally impossible, because no attorney could represent a defendent, when the attorney is the person who finds the dead body, and the murder weapon, and who sees the naked defendant outside the house where the murder occurs. He would be a prosecution witness. Perry Mason used to do the same in the TV series (not in the books) but the author should know better."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT ON MANY LEVELS","review":"I only recently discovered William Lashner, and I'm delighted to see that he's written many books. This novel is a page-turner, yes; but it also has big laughs and a whole lot of heart. I love the character of Victor Carl; he's a complicated guy. He's determined to see the worst in himself, but by the end it always becomes crystal clear to the reader that he's kind and deeply moral in all the ways that count. I have tried to find Lashner's books at my local Borders, and they only stock one or two. This author needs more attention -- he's an excellent writer with a slightly eccentric style that works. This is a grown-up book that I'd recommend to any mystery/suspense lover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unlikable characters, slow plot.","review":"Let me start by saying I read books for character; if I don't like the characters, it's a good bet I won't like the book. For me, this book didn't have a single character about whom I could care. There's the lawyer who is cheating on his wife and family, there is the protagonist lawyer who is having an affair with his \\"best friend's\\" mistress. That alone was enough to make me stop reading. If that doesn't bother you, the plot was decent enough, although slow and, at points very repetitive. The only reason I ranked this higher than NR was because, to be fair, others in our Mystery Group rated this book Good to Very Good. While they agreed they didn't like any of the characters and found some things improbable, they felt the characters and plot were well done. But for me, I kept thinking how many other, better books with more interesting characters I had waiting to be read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much repeating, too much repeating, too much repeating","review":"This is the first and last book by William Lashner that I will read. It lost me after just the first chapter or so. I just could not stand his stupid and utterly rediculous habit of repeating every other word or phrase. I just could not stand his stupid and utterly rediculous habit of repeating every other word or phrase.See how annoying it is?!"},{"rating":"1","title":"John Grisham, he ain't","review":"This is the first (and only) book of Lashner's I expect to read. It was necessary to read nearly half the book before it became interesting. Mr. Lashner spends too much space describing things not related to the story and continues to repeat himself in a most boring manner. I only rate him two stars because most of the last half of the book was interesting but still not comparable to many of the other 'lawyer' books. No more Lashner for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"No instructions and will not install","review":"Not only will Windows Vista not recognize the adapter it will not install the software.

It has a lot of no brainer information in it and I wouldn't recommend it for established photographers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy it for the pictures!","review":"I really loved this book and read it avidly from cover to cover. However I found it pretty light on \\"technique\\" To my mind statements such as \\"it is a good idea to have a selection of white, silver, gold, and black reflectors\\" or \\"as your groups get bigger keep your depth of field under control\\" are a little broad and far too basic to be \\"technique\\"...I guess I expected something a bit more technical, though as I write this it seems overly picky. Never mind, it made up for that with the beautiful images, and it was a very interesting read, but it was more of a what you could do than a how to, if you get my meaning. I mean if you don't know which depth of field you should use in a group you probably shouldn't be photographing someones wedding!!But again it gets top marks for looking at the unstaged philosophy of wedding photojournalism and backing that up with beautiful appropriate images."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ehhh! Nice pics, but not much on substance!","review":"I'm not sure why this book got so many 4-5 star reviews! Obviously, it's full of great photographer's work. But this book, in my humble opinion, is one for the coffee table. It seems to be a compilation of work promoting a group of WPPI photographers - the first 4-5 pages spotlight all the featured photographers - which dilutes the book far too much. If you are new to wedding photography (as I am - i've only been shooting weddings for about a year) I suggest you readDigital Wedding Photography: Capturing Beautiful Memories. Best of luck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmmm...","review":"I'd be very dubious about buying a book on wedding photojournalism when the book features 2 out of 3 shots that are obviously posed ( the front cover and the flying bride/nun ).

All of her books, including First Salute, are a pleasure to read. I find myself walking away (after being glued) to her books with not only a much more deaper understanding of the topic, but also a wealth of knowledge about other issues. In this case, not only of the American Revolution but of Dutch involvement that you rarely hear about. However,I do not think that this book is appropriate for someone reading about the American Revolution for the first time. I would recommend it instead to someone looking for a greater understanding of the event AND the world at the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Someone was indulgent.","review":"This book is a rhapsody on the theme of American independence, but isn't up to Tuchman's usual standard or those from whom she borrows. The Revolutionary War has been examined so many times that one expects a revisit to provide new information or insight; this book lacks both. Original materials (see Huddleston) are more entertaining, and textbooks more informative. As it stands, the book is a good introduction to the War of Independence, but superfluous to those familiar with it and useless to the specialist.It could have been a third shorter, if efficiency had prevailed over style. A sentence may run to a hundred words, with appositions inside parenthetical expressions. Was it dictated rather than written? Was the author, consciously or unconsciously, emulating Eighteenth Century prose while describing an Eighteenth Century war? Footnotes aren't indicated, leaving the reader to discover them after finishing the text. Was her editor out to lunch?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Is a bad Tuchman still worth reading?","review":"A tour guide at Williamsburg recommended this as 'essential' reading and since I had enjoyed Tuchman's \\"A Distant Mirror\\" I was ready for a good book. Into the fourth page describing intricate and, to me, unimportant interrelationships of the Danish royal family I came to the conclusion that at some point in this book's production Tuchman just gave up. So I did to. The chunk I did read was very well researched but I don't need to read a summary of everything Tuchman read in researching this book. The choppy writing and, most importantly, lack of editing wore me out. Is a bad Tuchman worth reading? If you need to know every angle about the American Revolutuion the answer may be 'yes.' But, for me, the answer is 'no', not when there are so many other good books out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"How a small country is great","review":"Reading this book was very interesting. Not many people read their own history interpreted by a foreigner. This book gives a very nice insight in the Dutch history and should be a must for everyone interested in de creation of the US of A and European history around that time.

But it should not entail the wholesale abandonment of logic and common sense for no good purpose. Yet this is what this book demands of us with its utter disregard for the unlikely and the most improbable. How can one even imagine the (OK, former) director of a secret service going door to door like a rubbermaid peddler, impersonating his own agents to get past high security, doing his own contract killing, rigging deadly devices and even acting as the killer of a head of state??? And there is no higher truth, not even a lower one, in this book, though there are lots of loose ends (the mob is in, but not for the evil deed; it can be crossed with impunity; Ruby killed Oswald for the official Warren motives and high blood pressure, and on and on).

Everything that was thought, was written. Now I understand why inferencing is so important (giving every little detail makes the story boring). The story lacked a well thought out plot and developed characters. It has some interesting ideas, however, they weren't aggrandized. I believe that the formatting caused some gaps in the story (or should I say I hope it was caused by formatting but I'm just speculating) as some sentences started but when the page was turned they didn't finish. The next page would start with a totally different idea. The main male character was suppose to be such a beautiful, strong, independent man, but to me seemed more like a punk. He couldn't make up his mind to say anything, when it counted. With the help of a good editor this story can blossom.Twana Spencer Brunson"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovin' Mrs. Jones - Great Read!","review":"I really enjoyed Lovin' Mrs. Jones!

I couldn't wait to get to the point when he revealed what Alex's husband Lionel had done that was so unforgivable - didn't see that reason coming, LOL!

Rather than focusing on the historical data the author seemed more interested in spinning a interesting story based on his interpretation of fact. The book has the feel of a historical novel and contains a lot of editorializing in the place of solid analyis. Documentation of his stories and sources could be better. His bibliography is weak considering the vast amount of data available, both original source and works written in the last 50 years. To be fair the book is very readable despite it's shortcomings. Some chapters are not as scholarly as I would expect and I think that a person who has more of a technical interest in the subject would be better served by other titles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intro to Turkish history & archaeology","review":"This is a personal account of travels along Turkey's Aegean shore, with a strong emphasis on history and archaology. The author has a detailed knowledge of all the periods of Turkish history and places each archaeologic site in its historical context: original inhabitants, Greeks, Romans, Persians, Byzantines, Selcuk Turks and Ottomans, into the twentieth century. He also identifies sites associated with various mythologic and biblical events and those related to Homer's Troy. It's a bit encyclopedic but never boring, and greatly enhances a trip to Turkish Anatolia."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO EXIT","review":"The film moves along as if it is a poorly done version of \\"No Exit.\\" A man and a woman are in a prison. They don't know how they got there. There are strange things going on as well as annoying flashbacks. There is also a subplot of a model being interrogated for murder. She attempts to act sexy and cool during the questioning aka Sharon Stone. We also see dead bodies (no faces).As a \\"No Exit\\" type movie, it was cleverly, but poorly done. I know that is hard to do. It was a good idea, but poorly executed. The acting and dialouge had the poor quality of a soft core film. There were no tense or scary scenes as the scenes change too often with annoying flashbacks to allow it.Now if you thought I gave you a plot spoiler, I didn't as this wasn't a \\"No Exit\\" film. While the ending tied the movie together, I just shook my head and said, \\"You got to be kidding.\\" The shorter German version was far better. No sex or nudity. Not worth the view."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the year's best","review":"I live to read romance novels and here I find myself halfway through the year and I've already read this book twenty times. I keep buying others, Amanda Quick, Mary Jo Putney, Loretta Chase, Johanna Lindsey, Julia Quinn, Stephanie Laurens and while their books are wonderful too none of them have captured my heart the way this one did. I just love this book. Ms. MacGregor really knows how to turn a phrase to make a reader laugh and she has an understanding of human beings that is downright scary. Most of all, I like her hero who manages to be a perfect balance of raw, powerful man and tender lover. Definitely my current favorite author and I can't wait for her next."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous fun on the High Seas","review":"I've long been a fan of pirate novels and I have to say this one is a real pirate's treasure.

His allegations that the smugglers or the people who buy the product as jewelry are somehow culpable is unsubstantiated. In any other part of the world, such resources would've been a stabilizing factor that enriched the nation economically, bringing jobs, added tax revenues, better schools, etc. This is really a book about the inability of a populace to police itself and the author's focus on the \\"guilt\\" of the West is just bullcrap. The one chapter on Al Qaeda and the diamond trade was interesting but short on concrete facts. This is lousy journalism."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Compelling Narrative with Its Flaws","review":"Campbell writes compelling narrative with a fascinating array of characters - corrupt dictators, warlords, mercenaries, peacekeepers, child soldiers, missionaries, shady Middle Eastern merchants, diamond buyers, jewelers, diplomats, et al. - weaving in the tragedy that the pursuit of instant riches in the alluvial diamond fields of West Africa has wrought. The result is a modern morality tale about the scarce resources, globalization, and violence.The book, however, is flawed by its author's failure to properly situate his narrative within the historical and political context of subregional conflict involving Liberia and Sierra Leone. The reader would thus do well to supplement this volume with a good political narrative like Pham's LIBERIA: PORTRAIT OF A FAILED STATE (Reed Press) or Ellis's MASK OF ANARCHY (New York University Press) in order to get a complete picture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Priorities","review":"Do we need a PR firm to boost the value of human life over a diamond?

I knew a home health aide from Sierra Leone who told me her country was in a civil war, that her relatives could not come or go and that she sent them whatever she could. Blood Diamonds' author Greg Campbell fills in the awful details of her story.We are working on becoming the small world and community some would like to be. Could we contribute by shutting down the Sierra Leone mines, buying their mangoes instead and letting the people there really go to the beach in a place called FREETOWN?What a well-written story; it should touch your heart and soul."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's ironic how marriage engagements are sealed with other people's blood","review":"What? The title doesn't make sense? Did you know how many people suffered to get the diamond on your wife's or fianc��'s hand? I don't either, but you can take a guess once you read this book.

Take a walk with the men that die in jungles while transporting this contraband to another country. Sit down with the monsters who butcher the pregnant women, who cut the arms of teenagers, who kill for pleasure.This is not fiction, my friend, this is real and it occurs even now as you read this review.

I was very excited to buy this album and thought nothing but great things would come from the alluring vocals of Aimee Mann. However, I found myself quite bored and eagerly anticipating the end of the CD. The lyrics seemed flat and needed to have matured a few years to keep up with the more profound writing of this era. I didn't find a single song to be catchy or worthy of immediate replay once finished. Vocals, too, seemed somewhat frail and lacking of any depth...almost as if she just discovered her vibrato and forced it.

Because Billy Vaughn had big hits in Latin America, South America, Africa, Japan, Hong Kong, Australia, Sweden, Germany and the US among other countries, it is definitely a feat to include just 50 of his most popular on a 2 CD collection. This collection was originally aimed at the German market. Yes, there are some HITS missing including US and German hits but those are available on other CD collections. Some of the tracks are in mono but that is because they either were not recorded in stereo (Sail Along Silvry Moon, Melody of Love, Raunchy, etc.) or a stereo master is not available.

(Our old head chef was a master with it, but he retired and none of us are very good with it.)So I bought this to throw in my work bag and pull out whenever I need to make julienne carrots. Also, I can have that same precision and uniformity at home as I do at work.There is a major downside in that it stains VERY easily. You have to scrub it almost immediately after you use it with carrots or something. I'm sure that set-in stains could be removed with a bleach soak and scrub, though.

This is not at all the same type of cloth as the micro-fiber cloth that comes with the cleaning kit. It has a coarser, rougher texture, and is far less absorbent. That means that it won't to a very good job of cleaning your screen, won't dry it completely, leaves streaks, AND doesn't dry itself very well. The rougher, thicker cloth also means that it doesn't fold and travel as well.I used this a couple times and then threw it away because it really just wasn't good for anything.

Nora Roberts shows that she can write quite competently outside of her usual romance genre. As per usual Robert's style, her characters are well written and multi-dimensional. She does well with sustaining the mystery and intensity surrounding the murder investigation. Even the sex scenes were crisped up to appeal to both men and women without resorting to what my husband calls \\"a dose of sap and silk\\".

I'm no expert on her, but I've read enough of her stories to make some comparison. In fact, \\"Northern Lights\\" is a pretty good crimi/adventure story, with enough romance to please her devoted fans, I suspect. To me, it's primarily about Alaska and about the life of this town, plus its interesting residents. I'm sure much of my enthusiasm for the story comes from Mr. Littman's considerable talents as reader/performer. I shared this with a male cousin who ordinarily would not pick up such a book, and he thoroughly enjoyed it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The plot might be good but why tell us all about it on page 248?

The descriptions of Alaska, the characterizations, and the mystery are quite good, though all of these are really at the expense of the romance aspect of the novel, which wasn't particularly appealing and lacked dramatic tension. However, my major complaint is it takes forever for anything to happen, and there are a lot of unnecessary parts that could have easily been omitted. This book meanders rather than flows.That said, I still mostly enjoyed it, and the novel will likely serve as a travelogue to inspire readers to head north to see the northern lights and other natural beauty of Alaska."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Story!","review":"\\"Northern Lights,\\" by the #1 female writer in the world...BAR NONE...is a story that had me eagerly turning the pages as swiftly as possible!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Read Three pages","review":"I regret that I cannot base my review on more of the book. As a person who lives in Alaska, I was unable toread more than three pages of the book before realizing there was very little reality to the story. I like good escapist literature as much as the next person, but the small \\"details\\" that were supposed to make this story seem accurate were very incorrect. The most glaring one is that most small villages in the Interior (where planes land on frozen rivers) are dry, but suffer from alcoholism as a serious problem in the community.

I wouldn't even buy it as a paperback. I'm very tired of Ms. Roberts' heroines being the brains and her \\"heroes\\" always needing to be corrected by a \\"smart\\" woman. None of these characters can be recognized as real people. Her women are becoming angrier and angrier and her men are becoming more and more weak-kneed. While, thankfully, there was nothing supernatural in this book (I very tired of witches and fairies, what's wrong with regular people?), there were no sparks either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't Care to Finish","review":"As a big fan of Ms. Roberts and a former resident of Alaska I was excited to hear that \\"Northern Lights\\" was coming out. Unfortunatly I got stuck about 1/2 way through the book and just couldn't make myself finish it. I didn't care who was killing of the townspeole and the heroine's family members including herself made me wonder what was in the water supply of the fictional Lunacy. Wait till paperback, or rent it at your local library."},{"rating":"1","title":"JD Robb maybe but not Nora Roberts","review":"Really a disappointment. Wish she had published under JD Robb or another alias altogether since this was not only not up to her usual style of likeable family characters, but full of vulgar language as well. The town of Lunacy Alaska and the mayor were bright spots in an otherwise dim landscape.This is not a romance with a murder mystery but a sad imitation of the usual bestsellers where bad language and bad relationships fill up the book. Over twenty years as a faithful reader, I expected so much more from a Nora Roberts book. If it makes the bestsellers it will be because of her name, not because that many people liked it. Don't waste your time, and check it out from the library before you buy one...it is not a keeper and most libraries will have already bought it because they buy everything she writes. Maybe next time they will wait for a review on her too!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"very poorly written","review":"The setting had potential but the plot fell way short and the ending just plain dumb. I would never recommend this one! It started boring and just never got better. I only stuck it out till the end because I was told the author was a excellent writer so I expected it to get better or at least have a spectacular ending. Sorry this one doesn't do a thing for me. Waste of time and money...DON'T BUY IT!!!! This was the first book I read by Nora Roberts....I don't think I'll waist my time or money on another of her books. Sorry Nora but this one stops me from buying any of your other books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tepid tea served with a soggy scone","review":"An easy read for those who like their stories premasticated.

Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Shadow Warrior The Complete Survival Guide","review":"The book delivers. I don't own the book because it is a great read but because it provides solutions at essential times of need. An earlier one star review makes it out to be a bad novel. The book was wholly adequate and kudos on top, a four star. No problem trying to find secret places but then, again, most of my time was spent in the game itself. When I needed help the Survival Guide came through with flying colors. The description of the book by the authors is accurate. No complaints here and the book was a life saver when trying to find the needed solutions to progress though the rest of the game. Definately recommended for the topic it covers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great 1st year, followed by nightmare","review":"The laptop is sleek, light, fast and great looking.But what good is all that if just after one year it will start to break down because of a design flaw that leads to overheating of the motherboard? To replace it, if you are out of the factory guarantee of one year (surprisingly convenient timing for HP), you will pay almost the price of a new computer. Which is worthless if you consider that it will be a matter of time before a new overheating.Do not take my word for it. Google this product and expressions such as \\"will not start\\", \\"three beeps\\", \\"overheat\\", etc.The two stars were given just because of the sweet memories of the first year of use.

I enjoy this movie although I don't watch it all the time. I was and am satisfied with the purchase I made. I went ahead and spent a little more for the DVD for the assurance that it was coming from Amazon itself, instead of another seller (which given the chance I wouldn't worry so much about now that I know more about Amazon and how it works.

But, they should have given granny a bigger part!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bynes is lovely on the big screen, and shows potential","review":"Miss Amanda Bynes is very photogenic and the camera loves her, she will be a superstar, and not just to teens, just wait till she turns 20 or so. This dvd is interesting and although the plot has been done fefore, and it is abviously more a girls film, boys will also enjoy it, just to oogle at Amanda's long legs, especially when she wears mino skirts. This is a fun fantasy film, for the whole family, and Miss Bynes sure shows a lot of charisma, and she is great, not really acting, but just being herself and having a ball."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cliched and silly","review":"Sometimes I enjoy silly films if they are heartwarming enough, but that wasn't the case with this one. It is packed with cliches, Amanda Bynes is boringly portrayed as this free-spirited American teen with an innocent disregard for English pomposity and the airs and graces of her relatives. After being pestered by the stereotypical, arrogant public-school boy with his condescending attitude to the other 'lower clahss imbuhcile', she falls for the nice boy who's really american at heart, free and classless. When this lad she falls for starts talking about \\"I was a part of this system and I just came to realise how shallow it is\\" (or whatever) I felt like laughing. There are many more stupid aspects but I can't be bothered mentioning them.I enjoyed watching Amanda Bynes, she's really beautiful with her cute teenage demeanor... otherwise, there is not much worth seeing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny","review":"Worth a good laughs, but why must they make films showing the bRITISH AS SNOBBY?

There were a couple entertaining pieces here and there...but they only lasted for about a minute. Nothing was particularly clever or funny about it.

I actually didn't finish the last half hour or so---and unlike good movies, I'm not sorry about that."},{"rating":"1","title":"This girl wants her money back!","review":"This movie was so contrived on so many levels.

It is nothing like the awful Princess Diaries (which this film has been compared). Because of this comnparison I didn't bother seeing \\"What a girl Wants\\" in the theater. I am pleased to say that this is one of those films which is just fun to watch. It wasn't meant to change the world but is entertainment that the entire family can see together. Amanda Byrnes and Colin Firth are wonderful together as father and daughter. Kelly Preston is beautiful in the part of Daphne's mother. In my opinion this film is more like a cross between: Cinderella (because of the future evil step-sister), Snow White (because Amanda finds her prince), and Parent Trap (because....can't say because that would be giving the end away)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I dont really like these kinds of movies but this one was actually good. I like amanda as an actress and i love her tv show on the wb. I thought this movie was also hilarious and i loved the cast and the kid Ian--amandas love interest is extremely hot!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie rocks","review":"The DVD has not yet come out yet, but this movie is the best. The soundtrack is awesome and I also give that 5 stars. I saw this movie about two months ago and I can't wait to buy the DVD. This movie is really sweet and here's why. Daphnie never had a father as he became royalty over in London. So when she is 17, she goes over there to meet him. He takes her in and she is being herself. Soon after, he becomes embarassed and she then has to dress like all the other girls (which are very ugly clothes). The ending is a happy one and pretty perdictable. Go out and at least rent this one, because it's a keeper!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a Girlie Girl Wants","review":"Though a bit cliche at time, the movie does deliver a warm feeling and gives a great message of empowerment. The happy ending is also very satisfactory."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amanda Bynes is a real doll","review":"Wow, if the term \\"living doll\\" ever applied to anyone, it applies to this little cutie Amanda bynes, I think I'm in love. This movie is also very sweet and perfect for teens, kids, or adults. As a matter a fact it's a good family film. With a good modern story line, that many people can relate to, yet it has a good deal of fantasy to it, and that's what makes it charming, and reminds me of a movie from my youth called Cinderella Jones."},{"rating":"2","title":"the greatest movie ever!!!!","review":"This movie is about a young girl (Amanda Bynes) who wants to find her dad who lives in England. I thought that this movie was exilerating. It was the best movie Amanda Bynes have starred in. This movie has comedy and romance.

Firth is fine and so is Jonathan Pryce, but they're not even enough to distract from Bynes'awful performance - if you can call it that. Someone mentioned it was a \\"teen\\" flick - I beg to differ - it would be ok for pre-teens maybe, I can't imagine any teenager actually sitting thru it. It was just tiresome and silly. Sad waste of Firth and Pryce. Amanda Bynes' eye-rolling and tripping was old after the first 2 times and just got irratating after that. Can't say there was anything much redemable about it - it was just really bad and this is coming from a big fan of Firth's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible movie...don't even bother","review":"This movie was one of the worst I've seen, with a cheesy, overly predictable plot and amateur acting. It also portrays Americans as clumsy and brash and the British as overly pompous and unaffectionate, which was a disappointment. The movie is clearly aimed for female \\"teenie-boppers\\" between 8 and 12 years of age, and is highly annoying to anyone else who attempts to watch this garbage. Just pass it up and don't waste your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute Story","review":"Ordered this one principally for my wife to enjoy, which she did.

I only watched the movie because I love Colin Firth and I think Amanda Bynes is cute but the movie is gag out loud sweet. It contain three things I hated1.) The uninspiring dance scene. I hate Hate HATE when movies deem it neccesary to have every one dance the SAME move at a party. (other that the electric slide or something like that.) I've been to many parties and that has never happened.2.) So strange young girls can just pop up on your doorstep and claim to be your daughter and no blood test.3.) A girl 17 years old, I repeat 17 years old can fly all the way to London ALONE and find her father within like two days of leaving.I found this movie to be too cheesy for words. I can't relate to movies if they don't even try to treat me like I have a brain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stellar","review":"My girlfriend fully understands that I'm allowed to drop her, without explanation, should Amanda Bynes enter the picture.

However, I agreed to see it with my Aunt and little cousin for some fun and a few laughs and that's what I got. But if it wasn't for my Aunt making cracks at the movie I just might have barfed, for this is the kind of film that makes you wonder \\"Gee, can this story numb my brain any further?\\"I mean, is there a \\"Movie Making For Dummies\\" book that the writers followed or something? Come on, you could have added a little more creativity than this guys. Anyway, maybe if you got stoned you might get a kick out of it but otherwise, you better leave it for the Bynes devotees."},{"rating":"2","title":"Did anyone else notice how utterly yum oliver james is?????","review":"Good god, if you haven't seen this film and you are a teenage girl (or gay teenage boy), you MUST see it, for one reason and one reason only.

The tracks are all over the place from the slow, trippy, folksy \`Kickn' to the wild head banging \`Hobo Humpin' Slobo Babe.' One thing that is consistent about this album is its outlandish and suggestive lyrics. With that said, this is a great album, its just different.

And as expected, there starts to be some sparks between the rival and the young girl, big surprise there.Interesting idea, it was so very predictable, how the story unfolded, that it failed to impress me or truly grab my attention. Not bad characters though.

This has been one of the first books that I just could not read at all. The story itself is alright, and amusing but as I was reading it I couldn't help but be annoyed by Emily's antics. I really disliked the authors style of writing, it seemed like the characters would say a sentence and then she would describe how the character was moving or how they looked. Pretty much to me it really seemed like a story I would write-and that is one of no writing history whatsoever. I guess I thought the character was a little too willing and to nave for my taste. Maybe the book gets better, but I only got to page 100 before I was like I can't read this any more.

I found the story severely disappointing, particularly since I'd so thoroughly enjoyed everything I'd read by Ms. McGregor both under this name and under Sherrilyn Kenyon. In fact her book, 'Fantasy Lover' is my favorite romance novel ever. This one, however, landed in my trashcan around the time I reached page 90. The hero was sympathetic but dreary and repetitious; the heroine was spritely and sparkly but not very bright. And abominably intrusive. The supporting cast with the exception of the hero's brother is lackluster. The writing felt forced. I don't think even the author liked this one much."},{"rating":"2","title":"refreshing - funny - great heroine","review":"After reading this book, I was left wondering who was the master of desire.

Despite his plans, Emily is determined she knows the right of it and he will marry her and they will live happily ever after.A faint touch of purple prose mars the effort. It's well balanced with angst and humour in proper portions, but the characters just seemed a wee bit two-dimensional.Still a wonderful read, and showing she has a voice in historical romances that just keeps improving."},{"rating":"2","title":"Romance is alive & well","review":"I have come to love this author, in both her names. I have never been disappointed and this book is no exception to the rule. I read this book in 2 days and immediately went searching for another of her books. The characters are so alive and real. I found myself, in Emily's place, cursing the stubborness of Draven! I loved this book. Take yourself away for a day and get lost in the world of Emily and Draven!"},{"rating":"2","title":"CHIVALRY AIN'T DEAD!","review":"I LOVED this book! Draven was so hurt and Emily was a breath of fresh air in his life. They were meant for each other. He could pull off a snide comment and she could give him a comeback. They had me laughing throughout. His pain was so unbelievably horrible that it made you just ache for him. If you enjoy knights and their ladies then you MUST read this story."},{"rating":"2","title":"A treasured keeper","review":"I've been reading romance all my life, but never can I remember reading a book that touched me as much as this one. Draven is a great hero and Emily is the perfect match for him. Kinley MacGregor has a new fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't finish... dialogue was too modern","review":"For a historical romance, I found the dialogue, minus the occasionally inserted \\"aye\\" and \\"anons\\", too modern. I really expect I could hear people on the street having these same conversations. This was my first Kinley MacGregor and I'm not sure I'll pick up another. I liked the concept she put out there, and I'm always a glutton for tortured heroes, but the dialogue and lack of much forward momentum. I even liked the heroine. I think I would have been able to get through the book if the dialogue hadn't bothered me so much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same ole' Same ole'...","review":"No luck with this one either...Just the same ole' same ole'...nothing great or even review worthy...Hopefully better luck next time (and considering I bought all in the series BEFORE I read the first one then lets hope they get a little better!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Master of Desire","review":"The plot of the book was a good idea, however, it became VERY boring when all you would read about is how much pent up frustration Draven had with his lower body. IT was becoming vulgar. I am interested in the romance of the story not the lust one man has over a woman.Now if you are a reader who thinks that when a man has feelings or \\"loves\\" the heroine he must lust after her and all the man can think about is sex then this is the book for you.My overall opinion is that it was a great idea, underdeveloped, and WAY to much on below the belt reaction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreal!","review":"This was my second book by Kinley MacGregor. I find her writing to be more for the younger reader. This book/story was totally, totally unrealistic and silly, but it was fun. I did smile and laugh. But, I like a higher intellectual, mature story. I won't read anymore by Ms. MacGregor. Added note: She writes detailed intimacy scenes which I like, but without the maturity of the writing/story to go with the love scenes, they are unmoving. You want to be moved - read Madeline Hunter's 3 books that start with \\"By......\\" they are fantastic mature love stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST LOVE STORY EVER WRITTEN","review":"This wonderful romance is by far the best that I have ever read. I agree with some of the other reviews when they say that it was so easy to like BOTH characters. The other stories that I have read usually has something to make you made at one or both of the leads. Draven and Emily are so wonderfully detailed that you feel all the happiness and pain right along with them. Kinley MacGregor is a great author and I can't wait to read another of her books.I think a book for Simon should be coming like one of the other reviewers. He was a lovable character and we could also keep up with Draven and Emily."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read!","review":"This was my first book to read from this author under any name and I am hooked. Touching characters and a great story line enabled me to read this in one night. I was sorry it ended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Even better than her last.","review":"I didn't think MacGregor could write anything better than Master of Seduction. I stand corrected. I started this book and six hours later when I finished, I realized I had forgotten to eat or move. I'm just glad it was the weekend.Draven and Emily are classics! This is one of those rare books that is destined to remain a keeper for anyone who touches it. I ran the full gamut of emotions, tears, laughter, joy, aching. Everything said before is so true. I honestly can't express just how wonderful I found this book.MacGragor has another new fan and I've already preordered the next one. And Kinley, if you read this, then add me to the list that wants Simon's book. I adored his character. He would make a great hero too and I want to know what happens with Emily's sister and her Highland husband too. She deserves happiness after being married to such a jerk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed with this one...","review":"I am normally a big fan of Kinley MacGregor books, but this one was such a huge let down. I felt that the characters were weak and the chemistry b/n the love leads was severely lacking. I kept rolling my eyes everytime I read something along the lines of \\"I can never have her, but there's just something about her, but I will not allow myself to succomb to my desires.\\" blah,blah,blah... After reading this basic sentiment for the 20th time, I was thoroughly bored. I was never attached to the characters or yearned for them to come together. I won't be completely negative though, I enjoyed the scene that took place at the Lincoln Fair, but that's about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never Received","review":"Though seller stated item would arrive by late Feb., it never did arrive. To date (3/9/2009) I have heard nothing from the seller"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely L","review":"I was pleased with the quality of the product. I purchased this to put in my granddaughters room. We spelled out her name, nice quality! Sturdy to stand by itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does Anyone Know the Plot of This One?","review":"I don't know what this one is about, but I will say that the drawing is MUCH more realistic. In all the the new books the covers are terrible, especially Sterling's Second Chance and Christina's Courage. Sterling looks like a Percheron and the tack and clothes are all wrong. Anyway, good job!"},{"rating":"2","title":"dale gasque is a genius","review":"I love this book. All the horse stuff\\u0010 is accurate, unlike many books of this kind, and the characters were very interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yay!","review":"This book is a really great book! I loved it! I agree with the reader from Maryland about Parker, though I miss racing--but it's back! And even though this boo kwa about eventing, it was really good and much better than the past books about Christina(except ASHLEIGH'S CHRISTMAS MIRACLE). Read this book--it's really good and exciting and interesting! And finally, Clay Townsend actually confronts his son instead of making up a lame excuse for his stupid behavior. And I'm raelly glad Samantha and Tor are back!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book SUCKS!!!","review":"This book is so stupid! The only reason it got one star insteadf zero is because the only intense part is when Parker crashes on Foxy. THAT'S IT!!!! Christina acts so naive in this story!! IT'S NOT EVEN NORMAL!!! This book sucks, and everybody gets a little stupider just by reading it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely an Improvement","review":"This book was a breath of fresh air. My fav books were right at the beginning. The Cindy books weren't as good, the Christina books needed improvement, but this one with Christina was actually good. TB Series is an excellent collection of writings."},{"rating":"2","title":"They're getting better...","review":"Finally! A good Thoroughbred book! Cassidy's Secret was ok, but I loved reading Racing Parker! A lot of new stuff happens, and everyone still likes eventing, unlike On The Track... but you have to read it to find out what I mean. I really like reading books when they're Christina's point of view because she still likes eventing. But she does do some stupid stuff in this book..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good film","review":"Having seen the original Tucker ads when they were printed in the Minneapolis Star way back then, I looked forward to seeing the film and was not disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Movie","review":"This is an excellent movie I really like it. What I can also say is it was done in my hometown of Bay Point Ca. The scene where they are watching the movie of the car pulling into the garage and the gas man comes and opens the hood but now engine that is a block away from where I live. They also did some at the county seat and had to take down the state flags because they had to many stars on them for this time but I would recommend this movie to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glad to see this film being recomended","review":"TUCKER was a much under-rated film at the time of its release. Jeff Bridges was excellent and the story was compelling. The costuming was great too - quite stylish."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Soundtrack too!","review":"Nobody has mentioned the fab soundtrack by the one and only Joe Jackson! Terrific movie - allegorical story of Coppola's own struggle to bring his movies to life. Read between the lines and it's the Francis Coppola story!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tucker The Man","review":"If you haven't viewed this movie yet it is one of the greatest movies ever produced and depicts at how far ahead of his time Tucker was in the automobile Industry and how the Big Three and the Government and Politicians put him out of business and out of the automobile market.Low and behold it wasn't long after 1948 the Big Three started the evolutions in their cars that Tucker created. This Movie is well worth the Money."},{"rating":"2","title":"An American Dream","review":"What an uplifting and inspiring true story!! Tucker - The Man and His Dream is one of the best movies of all time! Jeff Bridges does an amazing job as Tucker, a man who built a better automobile than any of the Big 3 at the time. Some of his innovations are standard equipment on all cars built today.I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who has ever considered the possibilites of what it would be like to realize a dream. Truly inspiring!!Worth every cent, as it's becoming harder and harder to find available on DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie, but not history","review":"I loved this movie, and being an automotive enthusiast with a stable of 9 Studebakers (a company independent from the Big Three), I especially relished seeing the Tucker on the streets of America again. But beware...this is not a documentary and there is much more to the actual story than is shown in Coppola's fable. Anyone intrigued by the movie should conduct their own research into the true story of the Tucker Corporation and find out for themselves why only 50 Tuckers were assembled."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tucker: The Man And His Dream","review":"The Tucker is a rich man's collector car that I've wondered about for years. This movie somehow fell through the cracks when it came out but is not only educational but great fun to watch. Jeff Bridges nailed his leading role, as usual."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie","review":"We actually had this movie before but it got lost. So happy to see it available on DVD. Such a great story about a man and his dream just as the title says."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tucker the Man","review":"Tucker The Man and His Dreams is one of the best movies I have ever seen. It reflex on the times and how hard it was for a person to get a head. Tucker was a man of his time and years ahead of the times.I Highly recommend this Movie......."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable movie","review":"It was a very good film. We hadn't seen it in many years. It was nice to watch it again. Although the one thing that always bothers me with films is the timeline. Events happen in a very speedy manner. Jeff Bridges is a wonderful actor and played Tucker very well. It was neat to recognize a very young Christian Slater in the film too! A little piece of automotive history!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It+s agreat movie","review":"I saw this movie years ago on TV in Germany. As I like Classic Cars, especially those who are made in USA, I wanted to have this movie, but the original one, not a German translation. I really enjoyed to see this movie again and i'm glad to have it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Show DVD languages / subtitles.","review":"No matter DVD is according my expectations, if you can publish languages / subtitles a better decision can be taken."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome movie!!","review":"this is the best movie ever in my opinion. not only does it show the history of the tucker automobile but it also shows how it would have been if you came up with a new idea and what would happen to it. Also in the movie you will see saftey features and things on the 1948 tucker car that are just now in 2009 appearing on cars. again awesome movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"best complete box set of Schuberts masses for the price","review":"The five cds in this set comes beautifully packaged in carton sleeves in a space saving cardboard box with a thin plastic covering. There are several different performers in this set but they all are good. The sound quality is great although not quite excellent. Everything but the German mass was recorded in 1996. The german mass was recorded in 1975 and is an analog recording, but it sure doesn't sound like it.The instruments are heard loud and clear, but it sounds as though the mic is too far away from the singers sometimes. It is still good though, a much better deal than the vox box that costs almost as much. This one also comes with a few extras and a complete German mass that the Vox Box set seems to lack. It's too bad there are no samples for this one, everyone buys the one with the samples but if you just take a chance on this one, you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Generally good and usually startling opening repertoire book","review":"To play 1.e4 requires either a lot of knowledge about a lot of different opening systems, or a good, brief set of tools to prepare you to deal with most of the stuff that you may only run across occasionally. Or if you just want to \\"startle\\" your opponent (Cochrane Gambit, Koltanowski Var. vs. Italian Game), this book should pretty much set you on your way. The quality of some analysis is a little weak, leaving you in a fog after the line's summary, and some opening systems will never be tried by anyone but the brave, but on the whole, it's a good general work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better Than Her Previous","review":"Mary has manged to produce another album that has raised my opinion of her. (i want impressed with her last album) Standout tracks are, Family Affair (great radio tune), Keep It Moving, Dance For Me, Destiny and FOrever No More. Mary hasnt changed direction that much, she has just sharpened her quality that has amassed her legions of fans and she has proved that she is going to keep them"},{"rating":"2","title":"There's Something About Mary","review":"On this outing, Mary J. pulls no punches and comes out with a spectacular album brimming with hip hop, r&b, dance and jazz. Credit that to the various producers who guest on the album, but make no mistake that it's Blige's pipes that bring it all together. What's more, No More Drama doesn't let up one inch of Blige's innate street sensibility, even when she soars to pop heights on \\"Family Affair\\" or the silky, joyous ballad of \\"2 U\\". If this CD doesn't blow up like no one else's business, then Blige had better just pack it up; better still, maybe the general public should."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mary's Back, and she's still the Queen","review":"Since I bought Mary's previous album \\"Mary\\" I spent everyday of my life waiting for her next one. And now, after 2 years I understand that every single day was worth of waiting! Of course Mary have changed a lot, but in a good way. Her rhymes became stronger, beats more up tempo, and here voice became even more beautiful. When I'm trying to find at least one flaw in this record, I just run out of words, because this album simply perfect. The highlights are Family Affair, Steal Away, PMS, No More Drama, Forever No More, but there's no better or worse songs on this CD, you'll be listening all of them, and this album worth every penny it costs. Sure it will say new word in hip-hop and R&B music, and it supposed to become even more successful than its ancestor. So lets go celebrating No More Drama in our life and lets get crunk cuz Mary's back."},{"rating":"1","title":"What kind of bootleg operation was this?!!!","review":"This album reaks of hot garbage. I really dislike this album. I wish I could really express how mad I am about this album. Until this album I REALLY LOVED MARY, but this album really leaves her yet to be desired. In the past Mary was one of the select few that could release an album and get me to buy it simply because it's HER. To date, I own every Mary album: What's the 411?, What's the 411 (remix album), My Life, Mary J Blige (Live album), Share My World, Mary, and (now this) No more Drama. After this I've come to the conclusion that Mary is at her best... WITH drama. No more Drama is a sad rendition of a true Mary album.Real fans of Mary will not this album!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry Mary...this is weak","review":"After the artistic strength of 1999's MARY, to have NO MORE DRAMA is very much a disapointment. The album caters to the current R&B/hip hop crowd, with some lifeless tracks. The album was even re-released and repackaged with new tracks and a new album cover (which is also awful I might add). There's a few tight joints here, PMS, Family Affair, No More Drama, 2U, etc but there is also some on the very weak side like Rainy Dayz (with that ever so awful and always in your face Ja Rule), Destiny, Where I've Been (feat. Eve), LOVE, Dance With Me, etc. There is almost no soul on this album, and it seems like a rushed project. Please bring the DRAMA back Mary, or come back with a better album than this. You could do much better..."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Big Disappointment!!!!!","review":"I have every cd that Mary has put out.....however this effort by far is the worst. Maybe Mary needs \\"Drama\\" to produce good music.......This cd is so unoriginal and the songs are straight up wack!!!!!! Hopefully her next cd will be like her past releases..........I'll keep my fingers crossed."},{"rating":"1","title":"ABSOLUTE JUNK","review":"I admit I am NOT from the hood, but I just have to say that this CD is just so much junk for the mind-less to me. Even though Family Affair does showcase her talent-the rest of this CD is just stupid, repetitive, aimless, with no substantial musical rhythm, melody, lyrics, etc. I forced myself to listen to the whole CD-and it was a very painful expereince. I think Mary would be better served to sing great pop & R&B type songs-and stay way clear of this Ghetto junk!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Give me da drama","review":"I am a Mary fan, but I was so disappointed at the fact that Mary put this type of garbage out.I listened to the album twice, no lie and I never listened to it again. It is not one song on that album I like, not one.There is no more I can say. Mary needs to try to forget that she put this album out.Later...."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'M NOT A FAN","review":"I thinks she can't sing and how ugly she looks. She just screams about her damm boring life on every song. You're no Madonna okay get it Mary J. Don't buy this crappy album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much drama","review":"I was very disappointed with this album. Mary's music, until this album, grew up with each release, showing how her voice and her content could mature over time. This album is a throw back. The melodies feel played, the lyrics are unoriginal and you just feel like her heart wasn't into it. The only truly worthwhile songs are the ones already being played on the radio which makes this album a waste of [money]."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Sound - Great Vibe","review":"Hello Music Lovers,It took me a while to play this CD because I wasn't sure it would measure up to Blige's Share My World. There were a couple of tracks that received airplay and I bought the CD because I liked what I heard.Eventually I let the CD play continuously without moving through the selections to only find my favorites. I'm glad I did. I soon realized that this woman has really come into her own. She's been great over the years, but I'm so impressed with where her sound and her heart is right now. You can hear it all through her words and the execution of her lyrics.I highly recommend this CD for anyone in the mood for a relaxing, energetic, truthful, funky, galactic musical ride. Standing \\"O\\", Ms. Blige. Standing \\"O\\".Michele V."},{"rating":"2","title":"SHE'S DONE IT AGAIN!","review":"Mary is the bomb and she's done it again with her incredibly soulful voice and passionate lyrics. I gotta tell you guys that I trully love this CD and my favorite track is number 7 \\"Rainy Dayz\\" and the video for it is so amazing, it's simple but so beautiful. JaRule and Mary make an amazing team, they sound great together on this track. I've been a Mary J fan since her first album \\"What's the 411?\\" and she sounds better on this album than any of her other albums because her voice has grown and developed so much. I recommend her new \\"No More Drama\\" album to everyone because it has something for everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mary you make my heart sing!!!!!!!","review":"I got this album because I know that Mary always has quality music. And I was so right! This album is full of tracks with mostly a hip-hop vibe, but does not compromise the R&B in any way. She does both really well. And since she is the Queen of Hip/Hop Soul, you know she has no choice but to give us quality music to enjoy. Let's just say this: This CD has been in my CD changer since August, and will not come out any time soon.Some highlight tracks are:Family Affair (I love the bridge)No More Drama (powerful stuff)Crazy Games (cool vibe)Dance for Me (A happy song, with one of the tightest beats ever)Flying Away (smooth and easy breezy)Never Been (feels like extacy)Overall, the album is total HOTNESS!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, But Not Mary's Best!","review":"It's taken me a few years to appreciate this album. At first I dismissed it as being inferior to Mary's earlier releases. But I recently began playing this album again and realizing what a beautiful songwriter Mary is. Mary had a hand in writing all the songs except for three. My favorite songs are Steal Away, Flying Away, Crazy Games, and 2U. This is a really diverse album and a great album to have in your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mary J. Blige","review":"This is a great album! It's like Mary's \\"My Life\\" album where you can relate to the songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Some Comments","review":"I have this cd and I like mostly all the songs but I just want to comment on some of he reviews I read on this cd. To that girl that called Mary J. Blige's and Ja Rule's collaboraton \\"Sunshine\\" sorry hon the single is called \\"Rainy Dayz.\\" How could someone own the cd and not know that? Second of all to that person who was wondering why Mary kept quoting TLC, the reason is because Ja Rule wrote that song for them when the three of them were going to come back together for another cd( This was before, of course, Left Eye passed away). So I guess since the song is for them he just wanted to quote them in the song a couple of times.Ok that's all I have 2 say."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tsk, Tsk, Tsk","review":"This is by far NOT Mary's best work. Share My World and Mary were so on point, that I rushed out to get her latest release, No More Drama. I should have known it was sheisty, when I heard the word \\"HATERATION\\" in her Family Affair release.Granted, this is a more upbeat album, but everybody can't do fast cuts (JOE). Mary should stick to what she's good at, ballads. Even Dr. Dre's intervention couldn't pull this album out the fiery depths. Of course you should decide for yourself, but don't say you weren't warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"not for me","review":"i tried, but i couldnt get into this cd. always liked mary and played out all her cds but not this one. family affair is the only song i even kinda like. i bought it the day it came out so i didnt even get rainy days on my copy. just alot of songs that i dont wanna sit and listen to when im driving or just relaxing. i just dont wanna hear unhappy songs or songs about pms, im just not in that place in my lfe this album just wasnt for me i like feel good music, fun music, love songs, not bitter music and thats the feeling this cd gave me. i highly recommend mary j. blige as an artist share my world is one of the best cds i own, but i will probably never listen to this cd ever again."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Get Crunk Cause Mary's Back!\\"","review":"I am very impressed with Mary J. Blige's new CD, \\"No More Drama.\\" In my opinion, it is a thousand times better than her last album \\"Mary.\\" The songs are written well, and sung extremely well, and well all I have to say is the \\"What's the 411?\\" Mary is back! I've missed her style ever since \\"Mary\\" came out, and I've been listening to all her old CD's. Then, I heard \\"Family Affair\\" and I thought Mary's back! So, if you all are Mary J. Blige fans or just love R&B with a hip-hip twist, also known as Hip-Hop Soul, buy this album, and maybe check out her earlier albums: \\"What's the 411\\", \\"Share My World\\", and \\"My Life\\" and you will soon see why she has been named \\"Queen of Hip-Hop Soul.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"No More Drama !! \\"Mary\\" Go on with your bad self","review":"The Queen of hip-hop has out done herself with No More Drama. Every cut is tight, fun, thought provoking and the music is slamming. Mary has really matured and shares her inner most life experiences, thoughts and feeling through her music. With renowned producers such as Dr. Dre, Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis, Missy Elliot - you know you've got unsurpassed quality, performance and you'll be dancing up a storm. Family affair is definitely a great party song but Steal Away is one of my favorite party-love songs. The title cut \\"No More Drama\\" with a bridge from the young and the restless is just to tough. I love PMS, Where I've been w/Eve, Never Been,U2, & testimony says it all. I'm an avid Mary fan and I have all of her CD's but as I reiterated before, Mary has out done herself with \\"No More Drama\\". Go get this one - you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"FANTASTIC!!!!!","review":"I loved this CD. Especially PMS. That song should be nominated as the woman's national anthem. Keep bringing it the way you do. And I agree, life is too short to put up with drama in your life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Average","review":"Mary J.Blige what Happen?after Her First Two Albums it's been downhill since then.yes She has had alot of Drama in Her Life but after awhile it gets Boring&Predictable&this Album is no different.no matter who She is Working with the Formula is intact now.Her Vocals don't Move me much anymore.Music&Lyrics don't really go anywhere.I'd give this Album a 2&half.She has Moments but a whole far from her Best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mary J. Blige HAS DEFINITELY ALLOWED US TO SEE HER MATURE!","review":"I have all of Mary J. Blige's cd's and I have always enjoyed her style. She has allowed those fans such as myself to experience her growth and maturity through music. She has taken us through the journey of \\"What's the 411\\" in looking for answers to \\"Mary\\" in wanting us to know that she is Real. Now this cd \\"No More Drama\\" wanting us to know that \\"what matters most is how she see herself.\\" Of course these are all my personal perceptions but this is what I get from her music. She is tired of explaining, justifying, denying, pleasing people, and all those in the scandalous music industry. She is here for herself first and for you if you've been her shoes, I have. This cd is very motivational, upbeat, funny, and maybe her best work yet.Thanks Mary J. and I hear you girl..............Keep It Moving!"},{"rating":"2","title":"DIFFRERNT BUT TIGHT","review":"THIS ALBUM IS QUITE DIFFERENT THAT HER OTHER 4 ALBUMS.

However, this is an album that will grow on you if you continue to listen to it repeatedly."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm sorry, this is a BIG disappointment...","review":"...and now that she's back with sample-happy P. Diddy, it's only gonna get worse. Her new track featuring the 3-month old 50 Cent \\"In Da Club\\" beat with the ubiquitous ranting of P. Diddy is an UTTER ATROCITY and a COMPLETE SHAME on her career.This album tries to be deep, passionate, and uplifting, but her trademark rawness gets lost in OVERPRODUCTION and CLICHE lyrics. For example, \\"Rainy Days\\" could've been a great song WITHOUT Ja Rule and WITHOUT those annoying synthesizers and superfluous effects. Let's just hope that next time she teams up with some real songwriters and unselfish producers."},{"rating":"1","title":"She is not the 2nd coming of Aretha","review":"She is lucky she's successful enough to afford the best producers...they're the only reason why any of the songs on this CD are any good...I would like her to find a key & stick with it for a while."},{"rating":"1","title":"MJ is aight but...","review":"I do respect Mary J. She is awesome, but she didn't worth the Grammy for Best R&B; Vocal performance for \\"He Think I dont know\\", it didnt become a single. It should have been for Ashanti (\\"Foolish\\").You can find her best vocal performance in Love & Life, in the track \\"It's A Wrap\\" (her 4th single from the album)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Please Mary, get some drama back in ya life!","review":"Now don't get me wrong by just reading the title of my review. I am a fan of Mary, own all her albums and still listen to them on a regular basis. I am happy that Mary has finally found some peace in her life and has decided to let everyone know. But, dang!, I am or should say was sorely disappointed by this CD. I have only listened to it about 5 times and everytime I've listened to it, I get mad that I spent good money on it. Now, dont call me a hater or say that I'm not a fan, because I am, but the truth is, Mary was in her prime earlier in her career when she was having major drama.

Following on the heels of Jill Scott's stellar debut, Mary releases an album drenched in monotonous beats and lackluster lyrics. While Jill Scott seeks to enlighten, educate, and uplift; Mary J.

This blender is very heavy duty and performs well. It has nice suction pads that allows it to stick to the counter without moving around. The only drawbacks I can think of is it is a little noisy when running. But the variable speed controller knob on the front works well. Also you have a reverse speed. It is a pain sometimes removing the lid. It takes alot of force to take it off and being careful not to spill any liquid if the blender is full. Wouldn't hesitate to buy another one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast, no lumps, simple and elegant to use","review":"Bought this blender for $70 in Nov 2005.Blends smoothies and frozen margueritas effortlessly and quickly - no chunks, just smooth.Great controls too.

The blender worked for a couple months and then that same piece cracked again.

I like the fact that there are subdivisons within each chapter because, at least for me, this isn't a book that is to be read rapidly. It's definitely been a contemplative experience.

I expected what one usually gets from a novel such as this: gratuitous violence, gratuitous sex, a sicko psychopath and an author with little or no idea of the actual workings of police, detective and forensic operations.What I found was a very deep and gripping book, fully researched down to the most basic of details, and full, deep, finely-honed characters. I found myself liking each and every character, even the psychopath, for distinct and different reasons.If I admit to skimming some of the more graphic details of the removal of body parts, it is only because I couldn't put the book down and was eager to see how it ended.

With a rarity of its own, The King of Billy Goat Hill magnificently captures the joy, pain, wonder and miracle of adolesence. It has left me permanently impressed...like I was by Salinger's Catcher In The Rye, Wolfe's This Boy's Life, King's Stand By Me and Courtenay's The Power of One.

Where? When? Where's the proof?) One could argue that the Bible does the same thing but I didn't buy the Bible, I bought Three Magic Words. Irritated, I just put the book down but not before skipping to the end to find out what these Three Magic Words were."},{"rating":"1","title":"Compared to other self help books, it stinks.","review":"Don't waste the money when James Allen is available.

Why they decided to stage it and update it is beyond me. It would have been nice to first see it in the period in which it is written before seeing a re-interpretation but decision at The Met make no sense whatsoever. Mr. and Mrs. Alagna are the big draw here and I have to say they are not my favorite for this opera. She acts the part very well but there's a sub-Callas flutter in her voice that I don't find appealing and frankly the tone of her voice is more serviceable than glorious. I vastly prefer Kiri Te Kanawa and Anna Moffo on audio recordings. Roberto is generally in good voice but he stills sings sharp and then flat at times. The direction of this video is stodgy. It's as if live television direction hasn't changed in twenty five years. I do wish Alan Skoog had been available for this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deep, moving, powerfull","review":"While I usually cannot take my eyes away from the impossibly beautiful Michelle Pfeiffer, this movie shows what is probably the only way to accomplish such a deed: put her side by side with Alison Lohman, who delivers a performance so powerful that grabs your attention away from the gorgeous, cold, intelligent and altogether monstrous character played by Michelle.The movie is supported on its intense, rich characters, who struggle through difficult ordeals to find a way to reconcile their choices with their relationship as mother and daughter. Ingrid, desperately trying no to loose control of her daughter while spending time in prison, and Astrid, confused and torn by a demanding mother and a twisted world.Do not miss this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"boo! read the book instead!","review":"This painfully boring and mild screenplay leaves so much to be desired. It's slow. It just doesn't come close to the drama and emotion of the book. Left out are so many of the foster homes- some truly defining moments of Astrid's life. I was so excited to see the movie- but i had to watch it in 2 sittings - it just wasn't riveting in the least. A lot of the acting is forced- it seems to be they hurriedly filmed this just to get it out in a timely manner, ignoring art- except they did make an attempt to make it interesting with the \\"blair witch\\"-like cinematography (the shaky camera, etc.). Which shouldn't have been so noticable.Take the time to read the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Movie.","review":"This is one of the few movies that i can say have changed my life. This movie has so many quotes that i have used in expressing myself and situations. The actors/acctresses in this movie are Great! A better casting could not have been done. This movie is a tribute to the book that has been loved by millions. The movies plot and protrailes of caracters and actions are amazing. This is one of thoose movies that when you leave the theater you feel so impacted. Most people i know have even bought this film they have loved it so much. So I highly recomend that you buy this movie. The best thing you can do is buy this movie and the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly Well Done!!","review":"The acting performances by the two main principles were excellent. Pfifer was superb in her egocentric self centered role which seriously afected her relationship with her daughter.It was sad to see her daughter bouncing from foster home to foster home. Unfortunately, the film illustrates the reality of our child welfare system. The foster homes are licenced after meeting certain requirements such as fire safty, fenced pool and size of the home. The foster parents receive no training on parenting skills or dealing with disturbed children.At times, some families are dysfunctional, neglectful, uncaring and frequently sexualy or physicaly abuse the children. Having worked as a child welfare worker in two sates, it was rather easy for me to understand what neglected/abandoned children end up in dysfunctional homes. Child welfare laws must be revised and changed to protect our innocent!! Great movie! A must see!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very censored compared to the book!","review":"I know the filmmakers didn't want to make a very explicit movie because if they had kept everything from the book in the movie it would have been a really hard R. In the book there are graphic sexual encounters. But in the movie they are only insinuated which is very good for teen audiences. But onto the other stuff:The movie is very true to the book and I am happy with that. The movie is different in some ways but not very differet. Top notch flick! Be prepared to be depressed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific Drama","review":"From beginning to end, there is drama, drama, and more drama. The movie is well-written and acted. What's more is the soundtrack, by Thomas Newman I believe, adds an element of sadness for Astrid's, \\"little girl lost\\" theme. White Oleander is a story I've never seen before. It's a mostly female cast, starring a teenager growing up in foster care, and the ending was not what I expected at all. Ahhh...it's so nice to watch a movie I can't figure out the ending to in the first five minutes. ~Thanks Kosminsky!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No...","review":"This movie was a chore to watch. They took all the emotion from the characters in the book and butchered it until it was completely unrecognizable.

Don't waste your time with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"awful!!","review":"if you've read the book and loved it, do not see this movie!! They cut it up so badly you wont even recognize it. They left sooo much out, things that needed to be there in order for the story to retain its integrity and just simply to make sence. Here the characters fall flat and are 2-dimensional,and the storyline is silly and incoherent. I really enjoyed the book and I dont expect the movie to be exactly like the book, but when they cut out a third of the novel, you kind of wonder did the people who made this movie understand what the book was really about?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"First off, did everyone read the book. I did, and it was a great book, very detailed, loved it. Maybe it's just me but I wanted to see all the characters from the novel. Everyone and everything Astrid came in touch with. She didn't even have the scars on her body from the dog attack, which was very significant to the story. You never got to see how Astrid grew up with all the moving around, it was mentioned in the movie, but it wasn't even the correct amount of times. I gave it two stars only because Pfeiffer played her role perfectly."},{"rating":"2","title":"change feedback on White Oleander","review":"Previously I left bad feedback on this seller ... movie was not something I could watch due to lines going through it.Seller promptly emailed me and offered a prepaid envelope to ship back to them!

Even in dire straits such as JAIL or foster homes, the female actresses all look beautiful especially Robin Wright Penn in the dressing room. I felt a little guilty and weirded out that this movie was such eye candy and seemed to be so glamourous when the mother and daughter were in such perilous situations. I understand that the story is about what happens to women who are both above average intelligent and beautiful.The music cues at all the appropriate moments just like an Aerosmith song in no-acting boring action blockbusters and that really bothered me. I thought it was manipulative. I think the music was reused in a popular Korean drama to even greater effect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully Done","review":"....I loved the book and read it twice as well as have shared if often...The movie can only be followed it you have read the book first...Only then will you understand how much the creators worked hard to do justice to the beautiful writing...I have gifted them as a companion piece...enjoy! enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved the Book?

It is too longwinded, bogged down in detail and fails to underline the major key principle, that the GDR was loved by over half of its population despite what the Western media would have us believe. Having spoken to former East German citizens, the book seems to be too concerned with the origins of the Soviet satellite state and doesn't address the issue that most East Germans were content with their state.

Cameron uses the incident of a horrific car accident he suffered in Bangladesh to tie together his own sense of mortality and India's great endurance.Pace can be a little rough at times, but that is the only detraction from this beautiful, appreciative look at India and its foibles, humanity, grace, sufferings. His treatment of conversations (with little hints of well-observed Indglish) are a joy to read. Many tender and thoughtful passages about mankind, but it's really a very personal memoir of Cameron's ongoing yet troubled love affair with a nation.Indispensible part of any India-phile's library, great pre-departure (or take-along) reading for anyone going there."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD is worth every penny","review":"I am a fan of Guyver.

The mixer that I purchased was a deep brown, called chocolate, and it was beautiful, not even a smudge! I cant even express what a convenience it is.

I'm very happy I bought the Kitchenaid. I don't know if the extra price for the Artisan is worth it over getting their other white mixer but I like my red one anyway.

The Artisan and Classic are the entry-level models and reasonably so as the motor isn't quite as powerful as the professional models. When creaming cold butter, you will get some ozone odor from the motor but it can handle about everything. If you are purchasing for a bakery or use a mixer daily, consider a pro model, but for my occasional baking, this is a perfect fit for my needs.The best part about the KitchenAid's unique design is that the orbiting mixer scrapes down the sides for you, so you can let it mix and tend to other kitchen affairs without having to tend the bowl with a rubber scraper the duration of the mixing."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Love It!!!","review":"I have always wanted a KitchenAid but couldn't afford it.

The mixer is supposed to knead bread and my recipe isn't any larger than the one in the Kitchen Aid book and I didn't knead on any higher speed than 2 but this mixer (size of motor or reconditioned motor to fault?) couldn't take it.

It mixing everything so well and with such little effort. I do love it. I have two complaints one is it is pretty heavy, the second there isn't much room on the sides to add ingredients as it mixes. I intend to purchase the pouring shield to see if that helps the situation. I am sure this will be the last mixer I buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Condition","review":"I never thought in a million years I would ever buy a Kitchen Aid. It's one of those things, you'd LOVE to have, but don't splerge because of the cost! Not to mention the counter space in my kitchen, or lack there of!I decided I'd go for it when I saw what a GREAT DEAL this was. I truely can not find any scratchs or nicks or anything. It works PERFECT and is gorgeous! I couldn't be more HAPPY and EXCITED to start all the Christmas baking in my NEW Kitchen Aid!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product !!!!!!","review":"I bought one of these mixers for a wedding gift, paying full price off a bridal registry, and thought afterwards, I would like one of these for myself, but not at this price. When I saw the deal for a reconditioned unit, I just assumed it was to good to be true. But I took a chance, and I'm glad I did. It arrived in perfect condition, no blemishes, or problems with the motor. I'm not sure how much I will use it, but I'm a gadget freak, and it looks great on my kitchen counter. I chose pink, it looks great in my black, stainless steel, and pink kitchen. I only had one concern through the whole process, and that is the carton it was delivered in. It was flimsy cardboard, somewhat crushed, with very little tape holding it together. The mixer itself was held in the box by two small pieces of foam. As I said, it arrived in perfect condition, but I hope that wasn't just luck. I think this item could be packed better for shipping."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Mixer at a Wonderful Price!","review":"Bought this mixer reconditioned because it saved me 30-40 bucks or so, and also a previous reviewer mentioned they like buying reconditioned especially on items like this because then they're sure the motor has been fully tested and checked (although i'm sure KitchenAid checks the new ones too!).With regard to wear and tear, I really can't find much at all! The paint job on the mixer is pretty much flawless, and though the steel mixing bowl has a few wear-marks, they're nothing that a new mixer wouldn't get in a week or two of normal usage!The packaging is very thick styrofoam that fits perfectly around the mixer, and mine arrived with no damage to the outer box.Overall, i'm very satisfied with my buying experience and the product performance. I saved tons of money both buy buying this online (instead of super overpriced at like williams sonoma!) and also getting it reconditioned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Factory-Reconditioned KitchenAid RRK150ER Artisan Series 5-Quart Mixer, Empire Red","review":"I HAD A KitchenAid 5 QUART MIXER FOR 20 YEARS. iT SILL WORKS NEEDED A SECOND ONE.

Although the mixer was in great shape and not hack marks, it still had no splash guard. When I reread the product decription, it only mentions a beater, dough hook, and batter paddle...no guard. the picture is faulty advertising.

The first time I read it, I was 15; it had been recommended by my high school journalism teacher. The second time, I was a young parent. Both times the pictures it painted and impressions it left me with stayed vivid to me for weeks.

There are many high points on this album, such as 'Bambino Nel Tempo'('Como Un Nino'), 'Solarita' ('Solaridad'), 'Una Nuova Eta' ('Una Nueva Edad') and, of course, the wonderful duet between Eros and Anatasia, 'I Belong to You'.

His syntax is senseless. If his goal is to convey a message in a new language, 'italianish,' then he has done a fantastic job. \\"Solaridad\\" - is that supposed to mean solidaridad. He has made a fool of himself by not giving his lyrics to a translator that can make sense of what he says. No wonder why he only gets 1-2 hits ot of every record.

My only complaint is that 'Clash City Showdown' spends most of its time on the post-'London Calling' era, but Chris's prespective as a fan from the USA who lived thru the band's tough times makes for a good read.

I solved the loose earbud problem by adding Jabra EarGels. I paid attention to the Oregon Scientific guidelines for the player-surface swimming only, for half an hour, and was careful about a tight seal after charging. However, after four months, the display had water in it. The player continued to work for another two months before quitting entirely.It has taken over six weeks for me hear back from Oregon Scientific on how to send the product back-and there is no guarantee they'll fix it.So I have switched to an iPod Shuffle and an Otterbox waterproof box. It's big and bulky, but I'm betting it's a far better investment than another Oregon Scientific product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"I was very disappointed in this MP3 player since it's the most popular waterproof available. I followed the instructions, but found water in the screen after two uses & rust-colored water coming out of the holes in the ear buds. The third time I tried to use it...it wouldn't even power on.The player is difficult to use because each button performs multiple functions. Even with the manual in front of me, it's confusing to operate. The buttons are small and VERY difficult to push. The water ear buds are uncomfortable & don't stay in place while aqua-jogging. The screen is hard to read even when it's illuminated. The clip comes off so easily that it's almost impossible to clip the unit to anything b/c it just pops off.I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone for any reason. Fortunately, I've recieved a full refund from the vendor.Thanks to the suggestion of another reviewer, I've learned about Otterboxes. I'll be buying an iPod Nano as soon as Otterbox markets the box to fit!"},{"rating":"1","title":"MP3,MP120, Oregon Scientific","review":"Unit is easy to program but I have had nothing but problems with the ear-phones from day one. I was sent replacement rubber cups that protect the phones from water but they too come off. This design is not well suited for our ears, much less water, thus it is just a glorified expensive MP3 player and does not perform as advertised, water proof not with those ear-phones SHAME ON YOU O.S. take this unit off the market. I do not recommed this unit as water proof no way !!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not your industry standards","review":"Although this player is waterproof & shock resistant the download is slow and cumberson and when the player is shut off it reverts back to the first song.

I was wrong. After two uses, the headphone connection started to go bad. If you tighten up the headphone bottom unit, to prevent water from getting into the unit, the headphone connection does not work. In my case, I loosened the headphone bottom unit just a little past extremely tight, to get the headphones to work, and water leaked into the unit. I have an extended warranty but it will not cover water damage. Nothing like a $100 paperweight. Having to remove and re-tighten the headphone bottom unit (to charge or download music) is this products downfall, because the headphone connection will go bad, like in my case, or you will not tighten the unit enough, again like in my case, and water will ruin the unit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great waterproof MP3 Player - bad earphone adopters","review":"This is a great product. For those who need all the motivation they can get to do their laps and are craving some music, this product will please. I bought a couple of Speedo waterproof radios a few years back and thier reception went from bad to horrible within a month of use. The MP3 player allows you to listen to music of your choice underwater, clearly. Loading music is a snap, and the player displays the artist and song in easy to read font. Like many reviewers have mentioned, the adaptors for the earphones don't stay in your ears as you swim unless you use a swim cap. I found the swim cap annoying, so I swapped out the waterproof earphone adaptors from my useless Speedo waterproof radio I somehow never threw away -- and voila - the perfect product!!! Now I have to come up with a new excuse not to finish my laps."},{"rating":"2","title":"A concert to watch over and over again...","review":"Most concert videos are worth watching only a few times yourself, maybe once with friends etc. But Live Wood is a very energetic concert, well performed, really a must for Weller fans. Especially us Americans who don't get to see him much. I've watched my copy at least ten times and still enjoy it. The energy between Weller and his drummer Steve White is really the focus of the live show. The other musicians are competent, but low-key, almost so as to not steal any attention from the star himself. Highly recommended to all Weller fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keep them coming!","review":"This five dvd set features Pride events 17,18,20,21,and 22.The main fights are;W.Silva vs K.Sakuraba,H.Herring vs A.Nogueira,M.Cro Cop vs W.Silva,R.Gracie vs S.Oyama,S.Schilt vs.Y.Takayama,D.Frye vs Y.Takayama,and W.Silva vs A.Otsuka.All dvds contain the entire fight card.All I can say is keep them coming and thanks for saving me some money by selling them together for the price of one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little speaker!","review":"This speaker was initially purchased for my 1 GB SONY beanie, but I have ended up using it for other devices as well, such as my portable dvd players! The wires wrap around in a dented groove behind the speakers and tuck away nicely in a little compartment with a hinged lid so that nothing gets lost! The design and the sound is great, as with most SONY products. My only complaint is that there is no volume control- you must adjust it through your device."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fasinating! Profound! Creative! Simply Wonderful!","review":"Thanks, Mr. Simmons. Your wonderful creativity really surprised me. You are a rare talented writer and I am so glad to have found you laterly. I'm also very glad that you have decided to transfer from the fantasy territory into your 'make-believe' fiction land, and believe me, you really transcended! This book is very deep while never lost its interesting tension. It has put me 50 years back to Cuba and WWII and making Hemmingway and Jose Lucas both a tragic hero and wonderful person. I also love your 'Darwin's Blade,' so fasnatingly written. I'm now into half of your 'Hard Case.' and I've already lost half of my precious weekend sleep, but absolutely no complaints here!

God Bless!"},{"rating":"1","title":"yawn","review":"i've read all of simmon's books and have loved every one of them, but this was just boring. sorry, but after finding this book, buying it and trying to read it four times i eventually gave up. it is the first dan simmons book to gather dust on a shelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"A real gem for fans of Ernest Hemingway!","review":"Going into this exraordinary novel I knew very little about Hemingway's spy network 'The Crook Factory' during WWII in Cuba. It was fascinating & surprising to read author Dan Simmon's note at the end revealing that 95% of what I'd just read was true!!! The book not only offers lots of biographical info on Hemingway, but gives some key insights into his final days before he committed suicide. However, I don't want to spoil what those facts were for the prospective reader. It's clear that Dan Simmons followed Hemingway's immortal advice about writing what you know. He blends fact and fiction seamlessly in this tale of espionage and intrigue. There's even a cameo in here by the master of the spy novel himself Ian Fleming who was also involved with WWII intelligence work. This book is exciting, well written and well researched. It really makes its main subject shine through!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawwwwwn","review":"Boring....zzzzzThere were maybe 4 chapters of the book that held my interest. The writing was too predictable...WAY too predictable. I knew who agent X was from the get-go. Not Mr. Simmons' best work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dan Simmons should stick with horror and sci-fi","review":"I'm a great fan of Dan Simmons and was excited to read his latest, The Crook Factory. It didn't take long to realize that despite his great talent writing horror stories and sci-fi, Dan Simmons cannot write a spy thriller with any of the tension or plot twists required in this genre. I worked on reading this book for 4 weeks convinced at some point it would stop putting me to sleep and get into the spy story. Unfortunately, the story seemed more intent on describing Ernest Hemingway and his celebrity- and party-filled life during WWII. Since I am not an Ernest Hemingway fan and have no desire to know the minutia of his life, I found this book an excellent sleeping pill. It deserves two stars because the last 50 pages were moderately interesting, but I give it one here to get the average rating down to where it should be."},{"rating":"1","title":"A One-Sentence Review","review":"Dan Simmons remains one of my favorite authors (due to Carrion Comfort, Hyperion, Olympos, etc.), but like many successful novelists no one edits his work any longer, so - while there is an exciting tale of WW2 intrigue in Cuba with Ernest Hemingway in The Crook Factory - all the heart and thrill is compressed out of it by being minced and wedged between 300 unnecessary pages of pure, boring suck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simmons continues to please","review":"I am surprised by the people who thought this book was boring. If anyone would be bored by this book, I would have expected it to be me. I don't really enjoy reading history, and I have never really gotten into reading spy novels. The only reason I even read it was because Simmons is one of my favorite authors, so I figured I would give it a try. I was not disappointed. The fact that much of this novel was based on actual events in Hemmingway's life is what made it so interesting to me. The spy stuff in this book was interesting and believable, unlike most spy novels which are bloated with so much unbelievable superhuman action and heroism. I highly reccommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful read","review":"Dan Simmons is one of my favorite authors and here he's writing about another of my fav's. The story in engaging and flows well. He brings WW2 Cuba to life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painfully slow moving.","review":"I am a great fan of Dan Simmons, but this book was slow moving and I couldn't wait to be done with it. If you are a fan of Hemmingway and like slow moving spy stories you might like this, otherwise do yourself a favor and skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Life is too short to waste reading dull books.","review":"I have read just about all of Dan Simmons's writings and the Hyperion books are top-notch science fiction. His horror books easily surpass anyone in that field, including Stephen King but I have read 261 pages of The Crook Factory and had to lay it aside. The only action so far has been the murder in a whorehouse in Havana of a radio operator for a spy ship.A lot of time was spent by the author in researching this book and I am sure it appeals to those readers who enjoy a good spy yarn but it is not my thing.I may read the rest of this book someday when I am retired and have lots of time on my hands but I am in no great hurry to see how it turns out."},{"rating":"1","title":"More chiller than thriller!","review":"I totally agree with the \\"reader from Kansas\\" on 7/18/99. I give this one star to bring down the overall rating. This reader's statement that the last 50 pages were somewhat interesting, and that the reader kept waiting for something to happen, are also true. I read this because I like the author, and I kept on because of the reputation of the author, but there is no tension, twists, etc to this story. It just goes on..and on..and on..The problem is that it is described as an espionage thriller, and it's not. It might be good if reviewed within another genre, but not this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A revival that we need","review":"Being sensitive to a need for a Revival in our country right now, thisbook shows how we need to listen and pray for Revival. It is short, reads well and I recommend it to every Christian family in America."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful","review":"This book really ministered to me concerning revival, and if you are a fan of folks like Leonard Ravenhill, you will enjoy this book. The only part of the book I found rather weak was the last couple chapters that were a large collection of sniplets from the personal Journal of Oswald J Smith. In my opinion, they did not add much to the book, and sometimes it made me wonder if Oswald J Smith really was sound in his faith. Overall though, good book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting, but by no means enlightening","review":"This book is more of a therapist's guide to dealing with a few particular narcisstic marriages. The only thing this book does is to discuss certain narcisstic personalities in a marriage situation. That's about as far as the author takes the topic. Narcissism is only talked about in a marriage setting, not in terms of any love or relationships outside of a marriage. While the author does give some interesting examples and does well comparing and contrasting narcisstic and non-narcisstic personalities, the examples are few and are very particular to certain types of marriges and are hard apply to anything else. The author also doesn't give any clues on how to go about changing narcisstic patterns if you're stuck in them, which is what I was hoping to find when I bought the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"other book better","review":"I could not get into this book at all........... the other book I bought was so much better.

Sure he's got the looks, the flash, and the slickness to be a success in the entertainment industry, and I suppose his Australian/New Zealand roots make for an interesting back story. But in the final analysis, the music here is bland, formulaic, and ultimately boring. It's sort of like a paint by numbers painting, Nashville style. Sure it's fun to do a paint by the numbers painting, but do you really want to put it in a frame?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poser","review":"May the Gods of Country Music save us from posers and wannabe's like Keith Urban. Here is a guy that couldn't play his guitar fast enough to play rock and roll so he settled for country. Makes me wonder if the founders of the Grand Ole Opry are spinning in their graves right now. Might as well have Britney Spears sing Patsy Cline. This isn't country it's pop."},{"rating":"1","title":"This one is a loser","review":"I bought into the hype, and boy was that a mistake. There is some cute ditty's on here but for the most part, if will leave you disappointed. All the songs sound the same and become repititive. There is nothing orginial here, heard it before.If you are looking for country music, trust me this is not it. The only thing country about this album, is Keith is classified as country. The songs, melodies and music is far from country.Save your money, buy the Loretta Lynn album that won the Grammy for Country Album of the Year and leave this garbage on the shelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite Album","review":"This album is probably my all time favorite album. His songs are touching on this cd, especially Nobody Drinks Alone, Making Memories of Us, These are The Days, The Hard Way...I could go on.

This latest collection is also great, although I expected some more insightful maturation in the lyrics or even more experimentation with the music. I think, while making sure to please his diehard CW fans, this effort played it a little too safe.Regardless, the guy is a real talent & showman and this CD will probably be in heavy rotation on your stereo!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A rare moment","review":"I think everyone's said it well but I just have to \\"ditto\\" what is being said. This is one of those albums that makes you smile in contentment as it takes you through life's ups and downs in a musical journey that is so beautifully done. It is diverse in its sounds but not too over-the-top. This is by far my best purchase this year. Key tracks are \\"Making Memories of Us\\", \\"God's Been Good To Me\\" and \\"You're My Better Half\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Keith Urban Be Here","review":"This guy has got to be the find of the decade,I am no great fan of Country but his blend of rock and country is awesome,his guitar playing is second to none, and as a live act he is surelynot to be missed.Well think you have the picture,totally beened coverted to Mr Urban"},{"rating":"2","title":"Keith Urban's Continued Success","review":"One word - OUTSTANDING!! This CD continues to show how Keith continues to grow as a songwriter and performer. The emotions in his voice are so real that you feel what he is singing about. I get chills on songs like the Hard Way, Tonight I Wanna Cry, and Noboby Drinks Alone. Along with great positive songs like Days Go By and God Has Been Good TO Me. With each release, he gets stronger and stronger. It is great see someone with exceptional talent like him - writes, sings, and plays most of the guitars when he records - achieve this level of success. Country music is about talent - signing, writing, playing, performing, etc. Keith is defintely in this league of excellent talent.Keith is a country superstar and will be around for years to come. I believe he has the writing talent to write songs for others to record. I highly recommend this CD, along with his two. Also, I recommend purchasing The Ranch. His group work before going solo."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm not even a country fan!","review":"I bought this CD because of one song (Tonight I Wanna Cry)and was pleasantly surprised that I genuinely enjoy about 1/2 the songs on the disc. Which is more than I can say about other CD's I've purchased. I also like God's Been Good to Me. If you don't tap your foot when this one's on, your dead! I always like to hear the cuts that don't get radio play, and since I wasn't familiar with most of these songs, it was and is a refreshing listen. Urban seems like a cool guy who doesn't try to be what he isn't. I mean the guys gotta make a living, but he's not over the top commercialized."},{"rating":"2","title":"my wife loves it","review":"Kieth urban is a good country singer but it is a little rocky to so I enjoy it very much as well"},{"rating":"2","title":"Keith Urban is amazing!","review":"This CD tops Golden Road which I absolutely loved.

But if this is country (it's just good music and does that really need to be categorized to be worthy?) this is far from something to scoff at.Initially I thought Keith Urban was a bit over hyped but quite the guitar player, and perhaps a bit opportunist. Golden Road changed my mind somewhat and this is simply a great CD. Not a bad track to be found and some real, real gems - with even a nod to Jive Talkin' thrown in on one intro? Personal favorite and probable monster hit is Making Memories of Us - good job Keith one more convert here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Be Here is Amazing!","review":"Keith Urban has done it again folks and even better this time around! Following up the success of Golden Road, this album has something for everyone and its all done in Keith's own unique style which defies genres. Don't even search for a category to put him in...he is a category all his own. Without breaking down each track to comment on, I'll just say it flows beautifully and ends the same way. It don't get any better than this! Do yourself a favor and add this one to your collection,, you won't be sorry!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just when I thought it wasn't possible...","review":"Keith Urban delivers a cd that takes me back to what I felt like when I got my first James Taylor album. Deep roots, personal reflection and an honest to God- literally- beating heart propels this latest effort. He has grown into his artistry & his manhood; there is more of Keith here & he hasn't forgotten how to have fun with a song and and play the heck out of his guitar.I am so moved. Trust me, Keith's the real deal. Why trust me? I have over 800 cds in my house and never have I felt absolutely compelled to write a review on any of them until now! This is a must have for anybody looking for something genuine from someone genuine...Ah, James, have a listen...Urban's got it, too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"New Keith Urban Fan","review":"I have recently realized how absolutely awesome Keith Urban's music is and decided to purchase Be Here as my first CD of his.

I am an old admirer of his poetry and believe he's one of the livest, truest poets of Great Britain.

His music makes you wanna get up and move, and if you don't, your listening to the wrong music. One of my favorite tracks has to be \\"Rollin' & Tumblin',\\" which is the base song of the remix \\"It's Bad You Know\\" from the album \\"Come on In.\\" You can't help but smile when you listen to the fast paced and loud \\"Snake Drive\\" as his entire band goes to town. He is undoubtedly one of the best artists under Fat Possum Records (or anywhere for that matter), just about every album of his kicks out that nitty-gritty Delta vibe, but this one of Burnside's albums that does it the best. His soulful music is what real blues fans should be looking for. Buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Expect More of \\"Your Woman\\"","review":"When I bought this album, I expected to find a disc full of funky, poppy tracks like \\"Your Woman\\".

While I agree that a few of the songs are quite forgettable, the ones I love, I really love. Obviously, Your Woman, probably the reason that most even learned about them, but \\"Wanted\\" is great. Going nowhere somehow is AWESOME. I just love the chorus of that song and his voice is just so smooth. The Shape of Love and Death of My Desire are very enjoyable as well. While all may not sound like Your Woman, its definitely worth a listen in my opinion. It has a great range and I Love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Great CD","review":"This CD is ok. Most of the songs are boring and slow. The 1997 hit\\"Your Woman\\" is the best song on the CD. The second best is \\"Undressed\\" then it goes down hill from there. If you heard the song and are dying to hear it over and over then find the single! If you want to hear their other songs I suggest not to get this CD but it's your choice. I made a mistake getting this CD but I had no idea. Save your money, and don't buy this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"One struggles to choose their most compelling fault","review":"One struggles, in fact, to choose the most compelling of its faults.

Also, Thanks to those of you who wrote reviews so I could guess which song my 3 and 6 year old sons ask for every time I turn on the radio. They call the little trumpet call STAR WARS, and it makes me laugh. I recently purchased Gorillaz 2005 CD which has \\"Feel Good\\", which the boys call the laughing song.

In comes Brilliant's book on Dinosaurs, but the kicker is that what you learn in this detailed and simple to follow book can be applied to much more than dinos. Very well written and illustrated (great image files included on the CD). With a minimal knowledge of most 3D apps, you can start creating some neat stuff. I also like the fact that texturing is greatly discussed in later chapters. This book fills a definit publication niche specifically dealing with organic or creature modeling, dinosaurs in this case. I wish this book would have been included in most 3D application packages as part of their documentation...one can only wish!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Collection of Information","review":"I found this book to be a good collection of resources on C# and .NET development.

Probably more appropriate for new developers just out of university, where computer science, but not necessarily software development, is taught. Written for developers in small companies, but addresses same topics that apply in large companies too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Average at best .Net","review":"This is a beginner book specifically aimed at .net developers. I'm afraid a lot of people will think this is a general language book for advanced development/system architecture methodology - it is not.As i said, it's pretty beginner and full of product reviews. its filled with tools, and even some tool documentation which feeled more like filler (if you are going to use Nant, will you use the crap documentation in this book, or the one that comes with nant?).If you are developing .Net application and don't know the basics than this book might be for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality read","review":"I am surprised at the number of people that complained about the .Net specific material. I have read many books using JAVA and other languages that translated well to my current development efforts. It's how the tools are used not what the tools are.This book is a great introductory text into general programming techniques: take advantage of your IDE, use tools that complement your IDE, use test driven development, map out a project, team development, track your time, etc.Almost all the subjects deal with programmer professionalism. Subjects that we take for granted that no one really writes about and most programming texts do not delve into: leverage your tools, look for resources beyond the accepted tool set. Will this make you a top notch programmer? No, but it's like having a break room conversation with a programmer ace and realizing that what you do could be a lot easier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Serious errors","review":"I used to use this text for AI undergraduate courses, and have given up. It has grievous errors in it, including in the on-line errata. Two quick examples: the information theoretic equations for decision trees is dead wrong. And the alpha-beta algorithm is completely incorrect. The text also has packed large amounts of information into very tight spaces, leading to poor explanations in important sections: the backpropagation section in particular consistently leads to serious confusion among students. And attempts to reduce algorithms into a procedural rather than functional/recursive format only result in excess complexity.This is particularly frustrating because there really is no good undergraduate text for AI. This one comes close, packing in lots of stuff into an inexpensive volume. But the errors are serious enough, and in such high-utility sections, that this book cannot be recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"both speakers were bad, did not perform, only purchased for preaching and singing, and upon installation both speakers were terribly distorted.

I am hoping that going over them with the original REFRESHER will bring them back to the floors and product I used to love. The results from the CLEANER were not as the label described at all and that's what IRKS this ole granny!

However, it has its frustrations, especially a) the unremitting tone of hauteur by this right-wing, upper class novelist when confronted by the ascendant working class, and b) the editor's feeling that every rumor reported by Bunin, no matter how outlandish (St. Petersburg has fallen to the Germans; \\"The Red Army has been chased from Russia\\") requires his footnote assuring us that \\"The rumor was not true\\". Although both are very different in focus from this book, I much preferred Bulgakov's The White Guard, an autobiographically fictional account of his life during the same time period, with the same confusion, in Kiev, and Sukhanov's The Russian Revolution, 1917, an almost hour-by-hour description of the actual government takeovers in 1917."},{"rating":"2","title":"Startling Beauty","review":"This book is both interesting and inspirational how she could find beauty and restoration after experiencing such evil.

I am in awe of the personal strength that it takes to reveal to the world this kind of personal and emotional nakedness.I hope those who are in law enforcement and those who deal with those who have been raped, male or female, will benefit from this book.Words can heal or destroy.Thank you Heather and Steve."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Poor Picture Quality","review":"I always buy the best cables, they are usually the weak link in a system, but I decided that if Crutchfield would reccomend this brand of cable I was ok.

The first ten or so tracks are absolutely flawless. The hits just keep on coming and you are just like... 'man, this one is a classic.\\" Then as the album winds down, there are quite a few trite, extremely repetitive filler songs. This is proven with lyrics like \\"keep your head to the sky/ I don't need to tell you why.\\" (That's the chorus). The Lox make an unappreciated appearance. Luckily, the album ends with the great \\"Not Gon' Cry.\\" It's a shame that the executive producers of this album just couldn't have cut off a few tracks.

Let us address one thing though... Mary.Cannot.Sing.She can carry a tune. She slurs notes instead of hitting them straight on. Her pitch is awful at times and what could be considered her \\"vocal stylings\\" are basically the same scratchy, non-melodic riffs throughout every song. I think the word here should be \\"caterwauling\\". You can tell that the studio has glossed over her vocals and judging by her awful live singing you can also tell that she was coached in the studio while making this album.

I also like that he quotes people directly rather than paraphrases them.The only reason I give this book four stars instead of five is that I found the framing story (about all the weekly \\"China Doll\\" restaurant lunch attendees) less interesting than Auerbach's stories themselves. Regardless, this book is definitely worth reading. It's fun to read and full of wisdom.--James"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was expecting a lot more anecdotes about the NBA and its players. An inordinate amount of this book is taken up with discussing Red's post-retirement weekly roundtable lunch and the various participants.

I picked this book up because it reminded me of his love of the Celts and because I like most of John Feinstein's topics. I can tell you that I'm not a big NBA fan but this book is worth your time. Mr. Auerbach's stories about the game, his life and the people in it are fascinating. You come to care about the lunch club that meets every Tuesday to hear his views and his rememberances about the game and politics. John Feinstein really outdid himself with this book. It's not his typical make everything to be dramatic book. It doesn't have to. Mr. Auerbach's stories come to life on their own. He talks about everything and everyone from the beginning of the NBA league to Rick Pitino to Bill Russell to Danny Ainge to Bob Knight to Michael Jordan and Larry Bird. I would recommend this book to any basketball fan that wants to hear about how the game came to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Of The Fastest Reads You'll Have - A Fun Book","review":"One thing about Red Auerbach: love him or hate him, he's always interesting to hear. The \\"hear\\" translates to \\"read,\\" as noted author John Feinstein gives us an ear to Red and his weekly group of guys who met at a Chinese restaurant and shot the bull about various topics over the years. Feinstein sat in for four of those years and relays some of the conversation.This is an extremely fast read. It's so entertaining that you'll zip through it, laughing in many spots. It is biased: oh, yeah.....so Celtic fans will love this book more than others but everyone should enjoy it. Basketball in the \\"early\\" days, with Bill Russell, Wilt Chamberlain, Jerry West and other big stars are always fun to hear about and nobody had more opinions and/or \\"hot air\\" than Red!

It includes at least one color photograph for each entry. But the entries themselves will determine whether you like this book or not. Deco and Modernism rule the roost for this author, and the selection of buildings reveals that. It's not a guide of historic architecture, per se. Sure, you'll find the obligatory gaslamp district, Old Town and Balboa Park in here, but not the subtler more hidden gems scattered around Bankers Hill, Olive Park or Hillcrest.

The beats on this album are sharp and to the point and his lyric quality / flow is at it's best. A lot of people like to complain about the rap/metal fusion on some of Necro's stuff (some tracks on this album, and the pre-fix) but this is the smoothest combination of the two I've seen thus far. There is a good balance of pure hip-hop and metal fusion tracks on this album. The only complaint I have is the same as everyone else, the album is much too short. The \\"filler\\" (skits, intros, outros) of previous albums are missing, but on the other hand I can listen to this album on repeat over and over and it just doesn't seem to get old.4.5/5Buy it and we can get it percolating like the church of Satan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware","review":"First off let me be clear that this in no way reflects on the group.

What really sets the EH apart from the others is the big, punchy, compressed low end and smooth distortion. This tube never gets flubby. It's got beatiful compression as you crank the gain and the distortion is very smooth. It also transitions from clean to distorted very smoothly making your guitar's volume control a very useful tool. The high end is sweet and never harsh, yet there's plenty of chime available.

The strange thing is they don't seem dated to me at all. For instance, in one episode the settlers are griping about the \\"savages\\" and Cheyenne sets them straight by explaining the reason the local tribes don't trust the settlers. It struck me as an unusual trait for its time; to begin setting the story to rights. I plan to buy each season as it comes out to share with my young nephew and my older kids.

Upon seeing this again after around fifty years, I was amazed by the over all quality of the show. some of the screen plays were very, very good ( Warner Brothers wern't opposed to lifting scripts from movies, such as : The Treasure Of The Sierra Madra - which they adapted to one episode ).

You have plenty of us still around to make money off of so start producing, besides you may want to hurry and get it before the goverment gets it all.

Seeing some of my favorite actors and actresses when they were young is fun.Cheyenne was an orphan raised by Indians. While not much reference is made to this unique background, it never goes without saying in each episode that he is a large or big man. He is a wanderer who is a Jack of All trades and a friend to all who let him be. I especially like how much he travels because I love the old west. Women swoon over him, but he is always a gentleman. He is resourceful and always helping someone else. His deep, slow monotone voice is not a distraction, but the message gets across. His facial expressions help.

It is an open ended, static box holder that is too big (deep) for standard window boxes. The only adjustable portion is the mounting bracket, but it is so poorly manufactured that it doesn't hold (it fell off the railing as soon as I put the empty windox box onto the holder). If you want it to stay in place, you will have to use 4 screws (not provided) to screw it into your wood railing (2 screws per mounting bracket); if your railing is metal, you are out of luck.

More importantly, this book raises more questions than it answers and wastes your valuable time. There are too many gross errors to name (picture on p. 249 should be replaced with the one on p. 211). This shows the authors did a poor, hurried job and Sybex did an incompetent job of transcribing what they got from the authors. I've never seen a more shameful display in a technical book.

The subject of interdomain browsing appeared to completely miss the point of how WINS and LMHOSTS aids the interdomain browsing (I cross-referenced using the Microsoft Knowledge Base to find the truth).

It survived the destruction of the Roman Empire and the Dark Ages. \\"The Histories\\" survived because it is so well written. While listening to this book, I was often times taken a back by the sheer power of Tacitus' prose. His descriptions of the follies of civil war are as memorable as any of Goya's Caprichos. Tacitus was a master of scorn. \\"The Histories\\" vividly personifies Roman characteristics like dignitas and gravitas. If all this were not enough, Blackstone Audio uses a classically trained English actor as the narrator. It was almost like listening to Masterpiece Theater. This is a great book and it is beautifully read. It does not get much better. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"fascinating reading","review":"Tacitus Histories deals with the turbulent year 69AD the year of four emperors. Tacitus eye for detail which allows us to understand the personalities of Galba, Otho, Vitellius and Vespatian and their motivations and ambitions in this trully chaotic time in Rome's history. The sinister role of the Praetorians in these events is faithfully accounted. I found I could not put it down! Very readable compared to the Annals. The translation is first rate.

She could have made this one better if she would have taken the time to develop the story just a little more. The whole plot begins great with Katherine taking her sister's child away from the Manning family, but then she just willingly let's his brother Jason move in and take over her life. The whole point was to keep baby Allison away from her grandparents, yet they never seemed to pose a real threat throughout the whole book. They just seemed to fade into the background without any kind of confrontation at all. If I had to sum this book up in one word it would have to be BORING!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very realistic but okay for an afternoon read","review":"In my opinion, for Katherine to have taken such drastic measures to protect her niece, Allison, she trusted Jace Manning way to much. Personally, if this was reality, the moment Jace knocked on the door, I would have collected the baby and went running. But even being fiction, the quick first kiss, his moving in, the marriage, was a bit much. Then the fact that the grandparents are pretty much dropped from the story line was pretty disappointing. I was expecting a little more especially after their wayword son, Jace, was the center of the fiasco. Okay book, if you need something to do for an afternoon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read it at the beach","review":"As many love stories' books this one start with a thrilling story of an \\"abducted\\" baby.

They do the trick but eventually break from wear. If you plan on jumping rope regularly like I do (20-45 mins a session, several times a week) you should get a better rope.A decent rope will not cost much more than 20 dollars (e.g. a Nike rope, which I just reviewed), but will last you for years. I have worn out one of these Everlast ropes in just a few months. The other lasted about a year before breaking. Typically ropes break either near the handle or where it hits the ground - I've had one of each type of failure happen with this rope. The handle does not have a bearing, so the rope isn't as free to rotate. Furthermore, the rope itself is pretty thin and doesn't last much wear.Sometimes \\"more is less\\" - if you go ahead and just dish out the 20 bucks now, you'll probably end up with a rope that will outlast several of these."},{"rating":"1","title":"jump rope","review":"Not great.

You would think that a brand that specializes on boxing gear would be your best bet but it is NOT!I cannot begin to express my frustration, I mean, I would totally understand if it was 1 out of 5, but 5 OUT OF 5 IN A WEEK?? This is just a rip off.

They have all become Christians and are beginning the fight towards the antichrist, Nicolae Carpathia. Their pastor Bruce was just killed in a bombing in Chicago, and now they have to face the future without parents or a pastor.I thought this book was very good. It helped me become a better Christian and better believer of Christ. This book would be good for people who are Christians or people who want to learn more about the Rapture and about being a Christian.

She was beautiful (still is for that matter), personable and talented, possessing a voice so sweet and yet sooo powerful. Truly a phenom of the '80's.This album/CD contains -10 tracks- of Juice at her very best singing songs that are now considered classics.

If you are looking for a true account of the battle, as it happened, this isn't it. It's very dry, boring, and I finally gave up reading it. It probably doesn't deserve even a 2 star rating.

I just watched the movie again, and that wonderful and amazing dance in the rain, Christopher Walken's strip tease (who knew he was a fabulous song-and-dance man?), the classroom production number, and the wonderful cinematography all had me rewinding and watching things over again. This movie is tailor-made for someone who likes quirky musicals starring Steve Martin and Bernadette Peters with a supporting cast of great talent. What's not to love?"},{"rating":"2","title":"My All-Time Favorite Movie\\"","review":"\\"Pennies from Heaven\\" is my all-time favorite movie. I love the music and the quirkiness of the story. I only wish there was a soundtrack CD available."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kennedy Center Honors 2007.","review":"The 2007 institution called 'Steve Martin' is a multi-millionaire of prolific success as a writer, actor, musician and comic. The 1981 Steve Martin gave us the darkest most disturbing flick... ever. The REAL 1930's were a bit more complicated than what our grandparents and great-grandparents may have let on. Unfortunately, the urge to be sentimental about events of 70 or 80 years ago comes VERY naturally to lazy american movie watchers. Don't be lazy, just realize that the Arthur character is the villain, and is completely self-unaware, and that makes him more horrifying. 5 BIG stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Pale Imatation of the Original","review":"Steve Martin and Bernadette Peters work mightily in this VERY abbreviated version of the original Pennies, but the result is a very small \\"mouse.\\"The producers use SOME of the original music, but apparently trying to appeal to a U.S. audience also inserted some American popular music, to the detriment of the movie.I consider this one of Steve's genuine \\"turkeys!\\" And I believe I read that he agreed with that evaluation.Amazon is asking a fortune for this 108 minute pale version of a wonderful NINE hour television play written by Dennis Potter. Skip it and go straight to the ORIGINAL, if it is not too pricey for you.A genuine television work of art -- and TV has seldom produced any art at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"They can't be serious- can they?","review":"Everyone in this misguided extravaganza tries hard -- maybe too hard -- to make something meaningful and entertaining of what amounts to expensive bloat. But for many viewers, it just doesn't work. For those who've seen the 1936 Depression-era original of the same title, the oldie has less but offers more, even if what it offers is sentimental Hollywood mush. Ah, but listen, isn't that what the lyrics of the title song are all about, how to make more from less? The original likely isn't the greatest film classic of all time, but it's a hopeful little bit of fluff with excellent performances and some of Crosby's nicest tunes. I was given the Steve Martin DVD of this title by a close relative (gift wrapped by Amazon, of course), so I suppose I'm obliged to keep it. But watching Martin's work simply made me more desirous of sitting back with a copy of the 1936 original, which I finally bought from Amazon and which I and everyone who watched it enjoyed much more."},{"rating":"2","title":"they tell the truth, songs do....","review":"Steve Martin, in an interesting choice with which to follow The Jerk, give an excellent performance as a salesman who falls victim to the romanticized visions of life offered in the lyrics of the sheet music he sells. The real world is continually juxtaposed against the world of song-the place that Martin's character wants to live. \\"They tell the truth, songs do,\\" he says. He believes each time he meets a beautiful woman that she will be the one promised by storybooks and songs and lives for a short time in the light of that romanticized take, but then descends into reality. In that way, he plays a kind of everyman. It is a heavy film in which almost every scene has a genuine core of sadness to it Von Trier is trying to do something similar in Dancer in the Dark, but is too interested in offering a distorted critical view of an America he doesn't understands save through stereotype and rumor."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Most Original Movies I've Ever Seen","review":"Moulin Rouge and Chicago don't come within a million miles of this film's intense emotion, brilliant dark satire, and sheer originality. It probably helps that the song and dance numbers in Pennies are far, far, far better executed than the ones in Moulin or Chicago. In fact, Christopher Walken's performance alone was worth the price of the video. However, if you actually enjoyed the cliche ridden bloated Hollywood budget nonsense that was Moulin and Chicago, you will probably not care for this movie. There are no wistful romances here and the ending will be far too ambiguous. In my opinion, Pennies from Heaven has the very thing that most musicals lack: A brain."},{"rating":"1","title":"A total waste of 8 dollars","review":"I've been a fan of Steve Martin since I was a young teen. It was a good thing I never saw Pennies from Heaven until last month. Steve has done a lot of good work over the years that can tend toward the weird side. But, I never really minded that. Did you ever see L.A. Story? Anyway, even L.A. Story had some redeeming qualities.Somehow, this movie just made Steve seem creepy. MGM was smart to bury this one. It's not an undiscovered treasure; it's was a waste of 8 dollars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crude and vulgar.","review":"This movie sickened me. The music was great, but the way it was used in the movie didn't do it justice. To be frank- I hated this movie and couldn't find anything to like about it. Steve Martin and Bernadette Peters were as wonderful as they always are, but I really hate to see talent wasted. I really can't understand what kind of a sick and twisted mind would write a screenplay like that. I was completely disgusted with the utter lack of any kind of loyalty and honest, decent charity for mankind. It was very unrealistic and I found it not amusing at all. If it was supposed to be, it was only feeding the perverse minds of people who enjoy that."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best Source Books So Far!","review":"Of the many books I've read and collected on French Country style and decorating, this is the best and most thorough.

Aside from the fabulous photos of French Provincial homes, Dannenberg delicately picks apart the details that make a typical Provincial home and garden.

I am a new homeowner and was really stuck on how to model my new kitchen. After finishing Linda's book I must say I was very disappointed. I want ideas not pictures. I understand that a picture speaks a thousand words, but I would like some actual words to go with it. A kitchen is one of the most important aspects of a home, and one should express their knowledge of how to go about making a kitchen by telling... not just showing.

All are pretty good in their own right (though don't start with \\"Lick It\\").

Sexy and dangerous.If you love N'Sync, stay away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just a tease of the talent that lies within...","review":"My best suggestion to any/everyone in respect to the Dwarves, is--Listen between the lines...Take an interest in the bass player's talent that knows no boundaries. Trust me on this! \\"without his match, there is no flame,\\" and as I once read,\\" A mouth without a kiss is just a worthless hole\\"--how true. Certainly 'punk' and psychadelic, however, to make one's mark, you must be one step ahead of the rest. Beyond his own years in talent, the band is lucky to have such an inspiring, gifted attribute.

Alright content, but not what I expected."},{"rating":"2","title":"Leaves you wanting more","review":"This album left me wanting more, and not in a good way. First, I know there is a long tradition of recycling tunes, words, and even titles in country music. But I think the traditional Durham's Reel (also known as Durham's Bull) is more interesting. His biggest barn burners seem to be Cackling Hen and Lee Highway Blues, which are almost the same tune. How about a tune with more than two parts? I don't suppose we need another Orange Blossom Special, but how about Beaumont Rag? Or Grey Eagle? Or Ace of Spades? With all due respect to Michael's blinding speed and facility, he does start to sound the same after a while."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super hot picking","review":"Mike Cleveland and his band have amazing chops -- check out the flat pick break on Bright and Early and the Mandolin and Banjo breaks throughout. If I have complaints about this album it's the weak vocals -- a very ordinary collection of guests except for Tim O'Brien on one cut -- and the fact that Mike Cleveland's breaks, oddly enough, are the least interesting. You get lots of hints of what he's capable of, but he never completely cuts loose like you want him to. Still, this is very, very high quality musicianship and recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"A wonderful book, gives hope to parents and families that have loved ones on the other side.

After 7 months of using at the gym, one of the ears became very staticky. I had to hold the wire in a certain position in order to make the sound come out of both the ears.I sent them back to Shure as they have a 2 year warranty. They were replaced. I have had these now for 13 months and they have done the same thing. The short seems to be in the wire itself, not by the ears.I would like to add that I only use these headphones about 45 minutes a day, 4 days a week for my work outs.I am very dissapointed in the quality and will not purchase again. Shame on Shure!"},{"rating":"2","title":"These sound great, just great.","review":"Originally I started using in-ear earphones at work to isolate me from the office noise. I started with the Shure E2c and liked them pretty well.My ears are not built for the normal earbud; I need something that would stay in my ear. Later, in a moment of weakness I decided to upgrade to the E3c and I have no regrets. While I know there are better earphones out there, I think that for the price these are great. They make a big improvement while watching movies on an airplane. They are well balanced acoustically with good base and good highs with a nice midrange in between. They also are not victim to noise when the wires move around.The come in a great little case that makes them convenient for travel.I've had these for a few years now and am very happy with them. By the way, I would give the E2c's 5 stars as well. They don't sound quite as good, but they are almost half the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounds great, but broke after less than a year","review":"These are easily the best sounding ear buds I've owned, however, both buds have broken at different times requiring me to crazy-glue them back together.

The sound quality of these Shure earphones is excellent. They fit directly into your ear so sound isolation, bass response and volume are all improved.

They sound fantastic and look cool, but no matter what I do they fall out of my ears.

The sounded worse than the stock earbuds I got with my iPod. No bass...tiney (sp?) at best. I used them for about 5 minutes and walked back to the store. The rubber \\"orbs\\" that go in your ear also make for a \\"swish\\" sound when you walk making them virtually impossible to exercise in, to the point of being so distracting if they sounded great I probably would have taken them back (I rarely return anything!). It sounded like you were walking with an Ultrasound machine attached to your head....wooosh woosh....woosh! Not impressed at all!I wonder if I just got a bad set of buds...but for $179 (at the store) you'd figure they'd be bullet proof!

Right out of the box one can tell these are quality listening devices and not the cheesy pairs that come bundled with most mp3 players.

For a pair of $200 (MSRP) headphones, these should be longer lived and more durable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth the Money","review":"I've had these headphones just over a year and have never been happy with them. The sound is great, there's no arguing about that, but my primary complaint is that they hurt my ears. None of the earpieces were comfortable, except the foam ones, and they get dirty quickly. Forget about wearing these earphones to the gym or doing any exercise with any of the earpieces. The gray earpieces actually slipped off in my ear when I removed the earbuds once. I got it out myself, but was still concerned.My second complaint is that the volume is usually too loud. The lowest volume setting (above totally muted) on my computer and my iPod (two different models) is too loud when using these. I don't need excessive volume to hear.Next, they didn't last. The left earbud just stopped working after a little over a year. At the price, I expected these to last several years. I wouldn't buy them again, nor would I recommend them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!","review":"Okay, the sound on these ear buds is quite good, but if you're a commuter who expects these buds to stay in your ears for an hour or more as the cable is gently tugged and pulled by your jacket, arm or whatever, this is NOT the product for you!If you're going to use this product in your favorite chair and not moving around much, then this just might be the product you seek.I tried every ear fitting that comes with the ear buds and none of the options were able to keep the buds in place. Even the slightest tug of the cord caused the buds to pop out. VERY frustrating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Sound . Quality Problems","review":"I would have rated these headphones 5 stars however, I have had to return 2 pairs of them within a year and a half. I am a fairly heavy user of the headphones .. about 3 hours every day on my commute to and from work. Both sets of earphones lasted about 7 months with premium sound. Then I noticed a slight sound problem in the left earphone and the problem quickly got much worse until there was no sound in the left at all.These earphones were properly stored at all times and never abused. I did buy the phones only 3 months after they were introduced to the market so the problems may have been worked out.Shure has honered their warrenty replacing both pairs at no charge. However, I feel that when you pay a premium for a set of earphones like these, the quality should be much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stop working after light use.","review":"I finally bought these back in 2005 after being too broke to ever afford them. I was happy with the sound but then stopped using them for a couple years when I bought some floor speakers. When I started going to the gym, they stopped working after a week. To be clear I used them less than about 30 times over 3 years and the right ear stopped working. I should have known. My initial impression after buying them was that they were poor quality and materials. I have recently been back in the market for new IEMs and went with Westone and Sennheiser instead. I also got a pair of VSonic GR07s coming. These are worse than $30 in-ears and they are asking $180-300? Give me a break.

Shure replaced them under warranty with a refurbished pair. Second pair lasted almost 1 year before the left side earphone quit working completely. Shure replaced them under warranty with a refurbished pair. Third pair lasted approximately 1.5 years before the right side earphone quit working. Shure will not replace the third pair because they only warranty their warranty replacements for 1 year. Overall the sound quality is very good, however if you are active while wearing them don't expect them to last. I expected much more durability from this Shure product considering the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality control","review":"This is my second pair of Shure earphones, and while they sound good, both pairs broke within a year of very careful use. I always put my earphones in a carrying case when not in use (especially when in my pocket or bag), and I always carefully twisted when removing from my ears, as per the instructions. The first pair the earbud broke off in my ear and had to be removed with tweezers by my husband when he got home hours later. Within months of use, the left channel of the second pair only worked intermittently depending on the angle of the wire. I think for the price this lack of staying power is unacceptable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't beat the 2 year warranty","review":"I stepped on one of the earbuds, I slammed a door on the cable and got it yanked out of my ear several times. The sound became intermittent and finally cut out altogether.

I am now on my 3rd (and last) pair in a few weeks of these---as soon as you start to sweat, the moisture in your ear enters the earphone and it shuts off.

For $180, these should function for more than a week...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Enough Bang for the Buck","review":"I used these for about 3 weeks before returning them. If I didn't know how much I spent on them, I would say they are ok. There is something about spending a lot and expecting a lot. Well, find another pair of earphones, these have a decent sound, mid-range bass reflex and get uncomfortable after an hour of use. They are basically ear plugs with a small driver on the outside. If I paid $40 for these, I would keep them. Anything past that is simply not worth it. That small driver doesn't really compare to a good over-the-ear type headphone set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overpriced and underperforms","review":"Contrary to the advertising, the sound quality of these headphones is poor at the low end and I did not find them very comfortable to wear.

The story is definitely imaginative, but I found the writing itself to be flat and uninteresting.

One the steel is softer than I expected as I found out when trying to shatter some tempered glass. I did shatter it but the tip fo the spike deformed slightly. The glass is pretty hard though... Also it is heavier that I expected. Not bad but to use it in a defenseive situation you will likely want to choke up on the handle uless you have massive wrists. Overall though its a great product for the money. I cant wait to start throwing it next time I go camping."},{"rating":"2","title":"SOG Tactical Tomahawk","review":"This thing is AWESOME!

I would definitely buy another."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect For Backpacking","review":"I used to carry a machete for clearing trails and cutting firewood along with a folding shovel. Now I just carry this tomahawk. I discovered this tool when a friend of mine bought one first. I've used my a fair amount; he's used his extensively. I use it to cut firewood, dig holes, driving tent stakes, pulling tent stakes (see the holes in the blade? perfect!), and for entertainment. When all your chores are done, it's fun to throw this well balanced axe. After many poor throws, this tomahawk has show it's durability. I've also used the axe to pry wood apart and am surprised the handle holds up as well as it has. For the price, the quality of the tool is simply amazing. It's also extremely light.

It appears durable, has a good feel without being very heavy. Long enough to generate some chopping force, but not too long as to make it difficult to carry in/on a pack. My only issue is the edge.

It comes sharp, and is obviously of very solid construction. And at this price - it can't be beaten. I immediately took it out and threw it several times, and was amazed at how well balanced it was. Feels like a feather in the hand and glides through the air very smoothly/predictably.Obviously this isn't designed for chopping wood, but it can certainly do that along with most other \\"hatchet\\" jobs. Also, the spike on the end opposite the cutting edge can be a powerful gripping/puncturing tool. The case it comes with isn't anything fancy, but it has very sturdy buttons and won't be torn or ruined easily.The real fun in this Tomahawk is throwing it with deadly accuracy. This is a weapon first, and a woodsman's tool second."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poor Man's Tomahawk","review":"Like everything SOG makes, its tough as nails and built to endure. As a combat Infantryman, you can find a multitude of uses for a tomahawk (aside from using as an offensive weapon). At $38 bucks, its a damn steal. when I received the tomahawk during my deployment to Afghanistan, I was pretty surprised to find it had a sharp edge, perfect for chopping of wood for tinder and smashing in glass. I was a bit disappointed to find the pick part was dull, but nothing a local machinist couldn't fix. I say if your in the market for a killer tomahawk, I'd go with SOG. Its cheap, its tough and its instills confidence"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't think, BUY.","review":"This was worth every penny. It is the most solid and durable sharp object I own, and I have an extensive knife collection. If you see the only two one star comments say how the handle broke, their comments were written in 2007 and 2008, I'm pretty sure they would have resolved this problem since then. Relatively easy to throw, I am familiar with throwing knives, so throwing this tomahawk was no problem. I once threw it blind folded while walking at night and it stuck in the tree, so yah pretty easy to throw. Even my friend who doesn't have the best arm got it in a tree.

If you are getting it to kill zombies then it will do wonders, or maybe you just play a lot of Medal of Honor, either way, its badass, its looks badass, it is pure badassery!

I immediately asked the counter person to take one out for me. I couldn't wait to get home to check out so I took it out of the packaging in the parking lot. I got home and took a couple tosses at the log I throes knives into and it throws nice. BUT on my 7th toss the handle broke right off. I.am very disappointed.

When I was a kid, my family was involved in the Revolutionary war re-enactments (a popular thing in the 1970s) and I was familiar with old style tomahawks.While this product is obviously not on par with the top of the line models (which cost in the hundreds of dollars) it is solidly made, reasonable well balanced and sturdy. As the picture shows, it has a \\"spike\\" on one end, suitable for punching holes in things (the original tomahawk lacked a spike, although some other fighting axes were spiked-mainly to pierce metal armor).Overall, it is a nice tomahawk to throw around a bit. Just don't scare the neighbors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic SOG Tomahawk","review":"I am very pleased with the SOG Tomahawk I recently purchased.

The cheap metal blade comes sharp and the shipping is extremely fast but the blade bends and breaks with normal wear and tear. It's cheap metal. As far a throwing it is concerned... Don't even bother. I broke 2 of them in less than an hour. The handles are cheaply made and break easily. I've had plastic forks that were more durable.

A believable narrative voice. I could accept that Henry VIII would say this, or that Augustus would say that. I simpy cannot accept that the T. E. Lawrence whose books and letters I have been reading for years would speak with the voice Stevens has given him here. This is the voice of a blunt post-Stonewall sensibility, not the voice of an evasive Victorian-born, Great Depression-died man, no matter how one interprets his personal psychology.

This is not the kid we remember from Allie McBiel. Among these masterpieces are sprinkled good performances fom Boz Scaggs, Michael Buble and Brian McNight. Those of you with Blue Ray will enjoy the crisp sound and picture quality. Buy this Blue Ray DVD and enjoy it again and again.Wayne"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Hit man is a Hit","review":"I bought this after seeing a portion of it on PBS and was not disappointed.

Braverman's novel is a fake; a laughably overwritten composition: just like an dreamy adolescent's diary it's wildly in love with words(four to five adjectives before every single noun), and it teems with metaphors, pseudopoetic images and repetitions. This is supposed to be a memoir of family tensions, love gone sour, addiction and death; nevertheless, it reads like an overlong, overwritten and very clumsy poem on Los Angeles, full of cliches and borrowed phrases.

But I'd still like to hear more about Cindy. Just because Karen Bentley ruined her, doesn't mean that she has to fall off the face of the earth. I agree with the reader from Virginia, Christina is the Queen of Snobs.

Although it adds considerable weight with the two EN-EL3e batteries in it, it has a nice heft to it and feels really solid in my hands. Even with the grip, the D200 still feels lighter than the D2H for my medium female hands, and I shoot 1000+ frames/week as a portrait photographer.I LOVE the command dials & shutter release button on the grip - it makes portrait shooting a breeze and really saves your wrists and arms from contortionist poses.I do notice, however, that when both batteries are inserted, they tend to drain faster than when inserted one at a time. This may simply be an anomaly or my perception, but I always keep a third battery charged and in my bag just in case.Have not tried it with the alkaline battery converter, but it is nice to have that as an option.LOVE this grip!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not cool enough","review":"Ive had this for 1 month now and I put the water inside per direction and it just is not getting cool like my last mat that I used to own for 3 years.

Although the rest of the track list is pretty good, I can't say it's a five star effort since they have done better.

Also, she was scared of him and did not ride him well, so it is a surprise she did not get badly hurt earlier. Why, why, why, are stallions always the mount of choice for children and teens in books?

All of this comes down to confusion on your Keillor page - is it a book or a CD?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Typical English Movie","review":"This is a series that is hard to get to know in the beginning. It's cast is superb however, but the dialogue from this era can weigh down on your patience to stay with this series. But to stay with it in all of it's pompus settings is really worth it. It's most believable when you really think of what the producers were really trying to tell, a story from this time using english actors, actresses with accents and wardrobe to make it all work. Most definitely worth the time to see to the end. But if your not the type to accept a culture change, then maybe you should stay away from this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull","review":"It is a 3 part play about a rich aristocrat's son's voyage to Australia and a government job. The historical facts are sound--the plot is dull and boring. I found the whole 3+ hours way too long and way to dull.I would not recommend buying this DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ooops or We Simply Don't Care About Accuracy","review":"...and the TV series is in the wrong aspect ratio as is Timeless DVD of The Incredible Journey of Mary Bryant. They are both widescreen not the 1:33:1 ratio Timeless has abridged both of them in. I am so happy so many of you don't care about this and don't mind seeing a bastardised version of these television shows. It restores my faith in humanity. Hey, anyone want to buy a copy of War and Peace without 33% of its pages. I can cut you a deal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dark and Depraved","review":"This move is depressing, at best. I couldn't rent it so I bought it, excited to watch it. Man, was I in for a surprise! I dislike the main character, his acting and the character he portrays. In fact, there isn't one character with redeeming qualities in this movie. It went from bad to worse. I couldn't quite finish the first disc, and will be shredding both of them. I couldn't recommend them to anyone, so how could I even donate them? People cruel to others, gratuitous sex, vomiting, defecating, who knows what else, but I finally had enough. I know horrible things happen in this world, but I don't have to dwell on them nor partake in watching and planting indelible pictures in my mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"No captioning and heavy accents","review":"I can usually watch British productions because the actors speak clearly.This movie has no captions and the accents were too thick.Production appeared to be very good.Sellers should mention whether a movie has captions."},{"rating":"1","title":"DEFINITELY NOT a family film!","review":"I was absolutely compelled to write this review. Nothing could be further from a family film than perhaps porn or some gratuitous gore. This film contains truly shocking sexual subject matter that I cannot imagine any parent would want their child to see. It is unpleasant almost from the beginning and we certainly could not bear to watch it through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lord of the Flies at Sea","review":"Debauchery at sea. I was hoping for maritime history surrounding a story of voyage and discovery. Instead I was held hostage by a group of characters nearly devoid of anything resembling morals. There was nothing nautical about it save the setting. There is none of the spectacular sailing footage that one would expect from BBC and certainly could have played a part in this story. The setting is a nearly vacant ship with an unruly crew and lustful, drunken passengers. There is nothing gratifying about this series. Shame on me for not paying more attention to the author. Once I realized it was William Golding I expected nothing more than Lord of the Flies, and these expectations were met."},{"rating":"1","title":"Discarding the movie","review":"Too bad the producer felt that a very ugly sex scene added something desirable to this movie. Physical intimacy is too sacred to display so implicitly and crudely. Not everything that tragically happens in real life must be on the screen"},{"rating":"1","title":"This one is a STINKER!","review":"I adore Sam Neil But this one is a STINKER! Boring - Boring - Boring!You think any minute something will happen that is worth sitting through the mundane English Chitter Chatter between the not so colorful passengers. This takes place on a \\"little ship,\\" nothing like the TITANIC. So... you have no \\"great scenes\\" and not much action either, other then an occasional storm. BIG DEAL!I keep getting up to do things as my mind wanders, because this silly useless mini-series doesn't keep me glued to the set as I thought it would. This is certainly not the Sam Neil performance as he is in the TUDORS or Jurassic Park. Goes to show you what choosing such a Rotten Roll in a Rotten Script can do to a wonderfully talented actor such as he."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgusting, disjointed & disappointing","review":"I found this movie impossible to like and incredibly difficult to follow. When it became clear that the sexual behavior with the \\"clergyman\\" was indeed what I thought was happening, I was truly disgusted and confused. This appeared to me to be included for shock value and made no sense. There was no flow in the \\"storyline\\" if you can call it that. It was a mess. I agree with others who were not impressed by the lack of morality, farting, vomiting, and overall crude behavior of the characters. I tried to continue to watch the movie despite my disgust over the aforementioned scene involving the \\"clergyman\\" in an attempt to be open-minded, but could not find any justification for wasting hours of my life I can never recover on this garbage. I threw the disc in the trash where it belongs."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"To the Ends of the Earth\\"","review":"This four and a half hour series, produced for television by BBC, would be a great adventure experience for any viewer. Briefly, it is a saga of an 1814 voyage from England to Australia as seen from the point of view of a young English aristocrat who is embarking on a civil service career.However, there is far more than a thriller at sea for reader's of William Golding's trilogy on which it is based...and for which Golding received a Nobel Prize for literature. The producers did a fine job of depicting young Edmund Talbot's growth from spoiled snob to humanitarian with a film that was mostly faithful to the novel. Casting was excellent--with a couple of exceptions-; and scenes of dramatic devlopment on a storm-tossed ship ranged from extreme tension to hilarity. The ending was undoubtedly adequate for the film-viewer only; but disappointing for lovers of the full message of the novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"360 degree perspective","review":"'Alliance Competence' provides a 360 degree perspective on business alliance. It captures both the difficulties & opportunities involved in developing business alliance. It also outlines the resources & skills needed.

Very little is written about the Soviet slater of German Civilians. If you are intressted in \\"Battle of Berlin\\" I recommend other books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read","review":"The Fall of Berlin is a magnificent account of the last days of the Second World War and the German surrender of their nation to the Soviet Union. I just read it for a second time and think it a valuable contribution to our overall history of that horrific era. No, it is not a comprehensive tale of the Russian 1945 spring campaign, but it certainly provides readers with a dense, richly textured portrait of one of the world's most famous cities and its obliteration from bombing and invasion. Anthony Read is a fine historian and despite my being familiar with several accounts covering the exact same events, most of its stories and first-hand testimony was new to me. The Fall of Berlin is strong on fact but is also a great story...which is precisely what draws us to devouring history in the first place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could be a better deal","review":"The pieces in this set are utter junk. Think of that hollow unbalanced set at the thrift store for .50, and that is what they coupled this game with. I am returning this because its to light weight. You are really paying $15 or so for cards. If this was simply a pack of cards for $7 bucks I would have kept it. The makers of this don't realize how important the feel of moving a chess piece is. I started on a decent semi weighted set and can remember how they feel 30 years later. All in all a great concept but terribly executed. Bad deal!"},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT!!!","review":"My four year old son loves to play chess! He no longer even needs the cards to play chess he can do it him self thanks to this game. Now we are teaching his Dad how to play with it! My oldest son loves it because it puts a twist to the game when you are using the cards and you already know how to play. Because with the cards it is luck of the drawl.Love this game!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"easy to learn fun to play","review":"My 7 year old daughter showed an interest in chess and this set has helped her to learn \\"the moves\\" and some strategy.

I've been playing Chess since I was eight years old, which is quite a long time, but I love this variation on the age-old game. It is a wonderful teaching tool, which I have used to teach several dozen children, some as young as six, to play. Every child has learned the basic movements in a single sitting of about 30-45 minutes, and most have moved on to the three-card or five-card variations very quickly. The truth is, though,that most seem to prefer this game to \\"regular\\" Chess!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best bargain ever","review":"I bought this for my oldest of four kids (he's nine), and in one day he wanted to play without the cards. Problem is, I needed a refresher myself! He's also been playing with my oldest daughter, who is seven, and my four yearp old has been asking to play too. For the price, I can't see how this set gets any review other than 5+ stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great starter chess set","review":"I purchased this because of the reviews that vouched for easing in the beginnings, especially kids. The chess board is two sided: one side has stationary positioning labels and movement rules for the pieces. The other side is the standard chess board. The chess pieces are your typical plastic (strong but hallow). The cards included for \\"thinkless\\" play are good starters.Overall, a great value. It's already a full chess set, plus extras for beginners/kids. All cheaper than chess sets of the same quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chess made easy","review":"I wanted my son to learn to play chess, but he said it was for \\"old people\\". So, I didn't have much hope for this game when I bought it. My 6 year old can't get enough. If is a fun and easy way to learn the game and to play with all levels of chess expertise. After a few weeks of playing the game with the cards, my son wanted to try to play on his own without the cards. With this game you just flip the board and play. When he plays with his younger brother, we flip it back and use the cards.Materials are sturdy, board is sturdy and well made so it won't crack like other board games. Really a fun game for us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Learning tool for beginners.","review":"Great Twist on \\"the worlds greatest game\\".Biggest Problem Solved, ie.,How an advanced player can teach someone new without them being discouraged. The board layout & cards are great learning tools, and there are 3-4 steps or sets of directions designed to \\"equlize\\" skill level of players. For example, at step 1 advanced moves like \\"en-phasent\\" and \\"casteling\\" are not allowed. At step 4, you are playing full chess. Also, in the early phases because your move is draw/card dependant, it is harder for you to carry out a winning strategy. You also have ample opportunity to teach your young opponent about strategy while playing a less competative version of the game.Great concept, fairly well made board & pieces.Only con is its not regulation size (about 2/3), still decent for comfortable play. Great value for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Introduction to Chess","review":"This is the perfect inroduction to chess. My 5 year old son loves playing with me.

We have a great time and I feel like my children are gaining a valuable skill."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Stress Chess is perfect for someone who wants to learn how to play the game of Chess","review":"I bought No Stress Chess as a gift for a 5 year old. I'm also a beginner in the game of chess. I've had a chance to play No Stress Chess and it's exactly what it is described as...\\"no stress\\". The board have two sides - one for total beginners and the other side for the more experienced player. The beginner's side of the chess board have all the position named, so that the player doesn't have to keep guessing as to what goes where. It also comes with a deck of cards with the name of the pieces and it describes how each piece moves. In just a short time, a player can advance to playing chess without the deck of cards. Perfect for beginners... I highly recommend this game!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My 6 yr old loves this game","review":"My six year old is completely new to chess. The cards made this game quickly understandable to him. He is learning the moves without needing to understand too much of the strategy - but enough to play the game as it's designed. He even figured out how to win in 2 moves if he draws bishop then bishop. Eventually we'll play the more advanced version where you can choose from between several cards. What he's learning now is a great start to expand on in the future.Everyone, adult and child, enjoys playing it. The experienced chess player likes the variation because it takes the game into unexpected turns and even more likes that a once reluctant chess playing child will now ask to play this. Even if you don't know much chess yourself, you can learn and enjoy this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"No Stress Chess\\" is truly stress free","review":"I bought this game for my grandson's 11th birthday. Not only was he thrilled with it so were his younger brother, Mother and Father. What a wonderful way to learn a new game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too basic","review":"This chess set is only good for kids/adults that have completely zero exposure to how chess pieces move. My 5yo daughter (who just started playing last month) knows how to do the basic chess moves, but she felt too restricted in terms of planning. For example, she wanted to move a piece that was going to get taken, but she could not because the chess cards did not allow her to. My husband and daughter hated it after one game. Oh well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading name, bogus concept.","review":"From the description of this chess set you would think that the instructions and cards would teach you something about openings, strategy, defense, value of exchanges, etc.All it does is put how each piece moves on a bunch of cards and the premise is that you draw a card from the pile and move that piece now. With no regard to whether that makes sense.I had taught my daughter the moves and she was playing a decent beginner game after two days, and I thought this would teach her a little more.It includes a decent plastic set of chess pieces and an acceptable cheap cardboard chessboard. Save yourself about $5 and just get a board with pieces. This 'no-stress-chess' concept is obviously cooked up by some marketing person who doesn't even know how to play chess."},{"rating":"2","title":"7-Year-old son would play this every day!!

I am proud to be American or Manessah. Looking at all that is happing in Europe right now, I can plainly see biblical prophecy coming to pass just as Mr. Armstrong said it would. He was right on.

I knew it was going to be bad when I read on the back of the DVD case- \\"with K.C. Armstrong and Jim Florentine from The Howard Stern Show and Crank Yankers\\". The script is as bad as it gets, the acting is ok, and there is literally nothing good about the fights. The main problem is that the lead actor (some Korean guy) is very short, and his kicks don't look that powerful, and he can't kick high. The only reason I got this movie is because Bobby Samuels is listed as action director on the back of the DVD. He gets a fight scene, and after that I gave up. I couldn't take it and I turned it off about halfway through. Truly one of the worst movies I have ever seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost a Zero...","review":"I would not give this film a zero for 3 reasons.A: I thought some of the camera work; that is some of the visuals worked quite well in evoking some response. andB: I happen to know that this movie was actally filmed over 10 years ago in NYC despite the 2007 DVD release date.C: The Star, Director, Producer and some of the crew were all from Korea.Not that that makes up for the poor quality but it may help to explain why they possibly had a hard time in transitioning the film into an American vision."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just so horrible","review":"I wish I could give this movie 0 stars because the acting,story and action was terrible."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Good Read\\"","review":"Enjoyed the read!

The music on the main menus on both discs seem way out of place and I have no idea why they put it on.Also, I wish they'd stop screwing around and put Kane Hodder back as Jason.

This cave is 13 ft wide by around 28 ft long and is very well insulated and in the very cold winter months is easily heated with a 40 dollar space heater. I decided to buy this A/C because I have two windows that are not window AC accessable and this one was a little cheaper than others. The mounting kit works very well, I was very please with this. Long story short, this AC does not have the power to cool this room, the air that is blows does not even feel that cold. I wish I would have installed an A/C through my wall instead or spent a little more for a more powerfull unit. Would probably work ok for a small bedroom because it is not that loud as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak","review":"It blows slightly cooled air which even on high takes a bit to lower the room temp barely at all.

Additionally sunpentown said that i could send it to their warehouse on my own dime (approximately 60 us dollars) and theywould fix it.my question was: why would i have to incur the cost of shipping when it is covered under a one year warranty?the bottom line is that no one will take responsibility for a crappy product that broke conveniently after the 30-90 day return window.i recommend NOT purchasing this product. it is crappy and will most likely break after a few months."},{"rating":"1","title":"GARBAGE!","review":"Do not even bother buying this if it ever goes back on sale again. what a piece of junk!

I searched in stores first and couldn't find any, then I found this one on Amazon for a great deal with free shipping so I had to get it. She was so ecstatic to see this computer.

This is the essential Hugo - NOT \\"Les Mis\\". Let's face it, Hugo is a romantic, and all of his attempts at realism and psychological accuracy have led to nothing but boredom. He tries the high moral ground in \\"Les Mis\\". The book came out tedious and preachy. \\"Hans of Iceland\\" offers the same kind of absurdity and brutality as \\"Notre-Dame de Paris\\" and \\"The Man Who Laughs\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very enjoyable politically incorrect surrealistic comedy","review":"The director subverts family values about marriage and virginity, with a tounge-in-cheek comedy where free sexuality runs rampant, while paying hommage to movie musicals and magic realism.

The surrealistic touches add to the enjoyment."},{"rating":"2","title":"sexy and sweet, with whimsical humor","review":"Have never seen a Maria Rojo film before but bought this film on impulse. It is subtitled which is fine with me, I like foreign films, but has no chapters or special features. The film itself is very sweet; Rojo has great charm. She is also quite sexy and several of her husbands are bound to set some pulses racing as well. It does have some fairly frank nudity which isn't made clear on the DVD case. The story has charm and provided many smiles as well as a few outloud laughts. I will definitely be looking for more of Rojo's films."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, but not for beginners","review":"I have found this to be a remarkable book which has helped me take my skills to another level. That said, if you're starting out, you will probably be overwhelmed and frustrated for awhile. It's less of a how-to book and more of a \\"looking over the shoulder of an expert\\" book. He illustrates how he does things and it's pretty much up to you to experiment with the concepts/techniques and adopt them as you see fit. Thousands of pictures and full color - very beautiful book. It also extensively covers areas like rigging and deep paint, which are difficult subjects to find books about, as well as modeling and animation. But, if you're just starting out in 3D, hold off until you have a solid foundation and good basic skills."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Maya 5 Book Out There...","review":"I was about to buy the first edition of this book, until I heard about the impending second, which was literally just published in March 2004 (and the cover that Amazon.com shows is slightly incorrect; the sax player is replaced with another character, but, oddly, the background is exactly the same).The major plus I have to give this book is the sheer fact that everything is in *color,* and it is neither too basic, nor too advanced. There are plenty of step-by-step tutorials for everything from modeling to animation.I have only really scratched the surface of this book (after all, it was only recently published), and if you're savvy enough to have found this book here in Amazon.com (searching for \\"Maya Character Animation\\" only yields the first edition of this book; I clicked on the author's name to find the 2nd edition), I would certainly suggest picking it up. If you only buy one intermediate-to-advanced Maya 5 book, then I'd suggest this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the best as stated!","review":"I really would not call this the best Maya 5 book. I definitely commend the author on giving us color images throughout the book but as it mentions on the cover it is for the more advanced users of Maya. In no way is this book intended for the beginner to intermediate level. Once you have good experience with Maya character animation then move to this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reference Book with some tutorials","review":"This books seems to me more like a Maya Reference Book than a How to Book. I did not like the style the book was written in. There would be tool introductions and details for while and than a tutorial later on. The Writing seemed very dis-jointed to me.The tutorials were often hard to follow along with and the models in the pictures were hard to duplicate because the pictures usually mediocre or didn't cover all the angles. The Tool descriptions fill a lot of the book and weren't great. Basically, If you don't know how to use the tool already than the defenitions aren't in depth enough to help much; if you do know the tools than there is no reason to read the tool info in the book so I have no idea what group this book is trying to cater too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crappy book","review":"This was book had boring tutorials and confusing wording.

I removed it from the package to find the knife only in a small cardboard sheath around the blade and nothing else.Every other knife I have ever ordered came much better packaged. The knife has a good edge and a good look but it has flaws, very small but yet there. It does not feel like quality as do my lesser priced Kabars, Case and Ontario knives do. The sheath is a joke, nothing but a couple of cheap weak rivets and poor stiching, the hole for the leg tie was not even punched all the way threw, I do not see it holding up well. It even feels cheap. My other knives have better leather and better, rougher construction and rivits in key positions. My rate for this knife on a 1-10 would be 5 and dissapointed. My rate on the value and price; it is comparable to a $20.00 flea market special, big let down. SOG has lost my admiration."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Read...","review":"I like the book \\"million dollar mate.\\" It is encouraging to someone who is single with people getting married all around. I would highly recommend it to anyone who isn't married, especially college age and beyond. And, honestly, the more desperate the single, the more applicable this book. The focus of this book is a nice change from the typical single young adult's fixation on the emotional side of being in love. I will confidently go on secure in the knowledge that God has a plan for me and my future mate. I now have a better idea of what I'm looking for, and who knows when that may come in useful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Captain Obvious","review":"This book states the obvious.....and maybe that is a good thing to be reminded of at times...but it is a short book with very simple concepts that, if you have good friends or belong to a decent church, you have heard before.

The only thing shakier than the camera man was the plot.First, let me say that the idea of the movie was pretty good and original but the execution lacked a whole lot. The camera work was horrible with shakiness, times that it was out of focus, background music that comes and goes and does not seem to belong there. The acting was second rate. The story line jumped around. There was absolutely no character building. Overall, this movie was like a train wreck, you don't want to look but can't look away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low Budget Entertainment","review":"If you liked \\"The Room,\\" you'll love \\"The Trinket,\\" a fun little horror movie that's clearly low budget, but certainly not lacking in entertainment value. The music and dialogue may seem campy at times, but the filmmakers certainly created an array of disturbing images that keep the viewer interested in how the film fetale battle will play out.The film, however, could have probably been told as a short, as some of the shots and scenes did feel a bit long or unnecessary. The acting was at times a little lacking, and at other times it felt like the actors might be intentionally performing so poorly. Often times it felt like there was an overflow of character exposition, ironically juxtaposed with a complete lack of character development. This may be appropriate, however, since the story isn't one about character sympathy (there are very few you could empathize with in the film), but rather a cut-'em-up revenge tale of a scorned woman.

The wood back and handle are lovely and smooth to the touch, comfortable in your hand. The pins may feel kind of like plastic, but they aren't - they're bamboo, in a cushioned bed. They go very smoothly through my fine hair, with no snagging or pulling. The ends are rounded and feel good against my scalp. I tried a boar bristle brush before this, but the bristles were too soft to get through my hair - this one does the job well. One thing I really like is that the pins are not bulbous at the ends. The old vent plastic brush I used to use had bulbous tips on the ends of the pins, which would catch lint and debris, which was nearly impossible to clean off of the brush. This brush seems like it will be easy to keep clean and looking good.Definitely recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best brush ever for my long, thick hair!","review":"I love Bass brushes. I have previously bought one with a combo of plastic and boar hair bristles that is awesome for night brushing and spreading your natural oils through your hair, especially if you have thick hair. (Boar hair alone does not penetrate the layers when brushing thick hair.) I gave that brush to a couple of my friends because it was so fantastic. I feel the same about this brush--which does have bamboo bristles. It brushes and styles my long, thick hair better than any other without the breakage that other brushes cause. Plus, it gives your scalp an amazing massage when brushing! You won't regret getting one. (I got mine through the Vitacost seller--$8 + $4.99 shipping. Excellent service and received the brush in two days.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best brush I've had.","review":"Doesn't leave static in hair, doesn't pull hair out, and IT\\"S NOT PLASTIC!!!

I also use one as a cat brush because it is stiff enough that they like it, but not pokey.

It was sized as though the pocket would be there, but no pocket, thus a very tight fit.Also, I'm not seeing the 3 layers. The inside is stiff material and all double-stiched seams are exposed and on the paint. I paid extra for a custom fit cover and was very dissapointed.

I can buy the fact that there was no \\"murder\\" in the sense that no one actually died here. What I can't buy is the consumerism, etc. I grew to really dislike Shelley by the end. On the one hand she's frugal, and on the other she's a shop-a-holic. Which is it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did I miss the mystery?","review":"I love Jane Jeffry but am not sure what has happened to her as of late. The books seem to be written on auto pilot and most of the charm is gone. This one was just a little too cozy for me as there wasn't even a murder. I highly recommend the author's other Grace and Favor series over this one. To say I was disasppointed in this one would be an understatment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to Jill Churchill's usually charming standard.","review":"With a few exceptions, I agree heartily with everyone that has reviewed Bell, Book & Scandal. I was so shocked at the difference in writing style, lack of character development, and simple dialogue that I logged on to Jill Churchill's website to make sure she actually wrote this book. Well, she did, but you would never know in comparing it with her other books. Jill Churchill normally writes a well developed character-driven mystery with an emphasis on charm. How many authors could make suburban life and car pooling interesting? Don't bother with this one, but pick up Grime & Punishment or another of her earlier mysteries. I look forward to the old Jane."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was there a ghost writer here?","review":"Wow, was I disappointed with this one. I can't tell if Jill Churchill let someone else help write it, or if maybe she's got a new editor or something who missed a lot of the strange changes in style. Jane is suddenly a lot more blatant about her sexual relationship with Mel -- I just hated that! It really didn't seem like Jane. There is WAY too much shopping, and the detailed description of every feature Jane gets on her new Jeep looked like product placement to me! And the writing seemed so simple compared to what I'm used to seeing by Churchill. Her Grace & Favor mysteries, and the previous Jane Jeffry books are so good. I just don't know what happened here."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING!","review":"I have read every one of the Jane Jeffrey books and loved every one of them so when I realized that there was a new one that I hadn't yet read, I was on it! I struggled to get through this one but kept going because I have never given up on a book. This was dull, dull, more dull. Sure hope her next one is better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did Ms. Churchill lose a bet?","review":"I always look forward to anything by this author, but this latest has been a major disappointment. What happened to the story? I usually have a difficult time putting Jill Churchill's books down, even for sleeping. For this one, it was a struggle just to finish. Whatever is happening in Ms. Churchill's life I fervently pray it gets resolved and she can resume her usual delightful fare."},{"rating":"1","title":"I have to agree!","review":"I have to agree with the others that this is just not up to Jill's other Jane Jeffrey mysteries. No murder mystery, too much repetition, no tension, too drawn out and no satisfying conclusion. Since it was set at a Mystery Writer's Conference it appears that the author has missed the point of what makes a good mystery in this book! I have her newest Grace and Favor to read now and we will see how it fares!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A ghostwritten book? Written quickly to fulfill a contract?","review":"I have enjoyed several of Jill Churchill's books, but this one is a true clinker in the midst. Everything seems so contrived and unrealistic. For example, one of the two main characters says something and her friend responds with, \\"Heaven forbid!\\" In another instance, the heroine calls home, after being away for a few days, to ask family members not to be doing any laundry when she gets home as she wants the washing machine free to wash her own clothes. One, who would think to call home to ask this after being gone only a couple of days? And two, what teenage daughter would be washing clothes anyway?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Glaring error...","review":"I have enjoyed other Jane Jeffry books, but I had a hard time getting into this one. It was a bit of a slog and I just wasn't drawn into the story. At the end a literary error was so glaring that I just gave up on it: she refers to women dressed as grubby little boys along with a man dressed as Sherlock Holmes as Doyle's Bow Street Runners.\\" Doyle had his Baker Street Irregulars which are not related to the Bow Street Runners. Such an error about one of the classic mystery writers just made me sad. Maybe she wasn't much into the book either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"This book is not as badly written as \\"The Accidental Florist\\"--that's about all the praise I can give it. None of the characters are realistic, not even Jane, Shelley, and Mel, with the dialogue they have been given. There is no subtlety of language, no quirky self-thoughts. It's a real let-down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing - it's just lacking 'ooomph'","review":"The more of her books I read, the less I like them. The characters do seem a little stiff and contrived, the dialogue just doesn't quite flow... It's like the author has fairly good ideas, but just can't sculpt them together into a really pleasing book. I have to say I like the stories, not the writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very enlightening book!","review":"This book helped me in understanding Islam from both a historical and theological viewpoint. The author not only gives a thorough background of the subject but also answers questions that Evangelical Christians would be confronted with in their personal witness to Muslims.

Not bad, but good. It's about a woman named Mrs. Mallad that learns that her husband is dead. She then thinks she is free until certain events ruin it. Mrs. Mallad is the main character and the only one the author describes. She is young with a fair, calm face. She is also very emotional!The story starts at Mrs. Mallad's house and in her room. A possible theme is to not get your hopes up. The strength in the story is the plot. It keeps you on your feet. For the weakness, I would have to say description. The story should've said what her past was like with her husband.

Unfortunately, the product that arrived had the most horrible sound quality imaginable in modern times, with some songs actually skipping and an obvious loss in depth and quality of sound at all levels.

This is the book the professor assigned.I began reading the first few pages today, all the while wondering just what kind of beginning OS student would find this useful. Stallings jumps in to a detailed description of hardware components without providing a simple, \\"top-down\\" description first. The prose is wordy and, at times, unneccessarily infused with technojargon. Sometimes the author makes such great leaps in his thinking that the reader is left puzzled, at best. I got the impression when I read these few pages that Stallings intended this book to be a follow-up to a basic introduction to computer hardware learned in another course.Bottom line: This book is probably very useful for those who have spent a good deal of time studying computers at the design level.

I recommend this story to everyone and I can't wait to read the other two in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly Disappointed.","review":"Jane Feather is a very good author, but The Diamond Slipper is not a favorite. Leo was wrong for not telling her what kind of man she was marrying. He was foul for that, because he just wanted a woman there to look after his nieces. Cordelia had to put up with all the pain, heartache and humiliation because of Leo. The thing that pissed me off was that sex with him was supposed to make the suffering worth while. I won't buy that! Then they had to leave town after it was all over, like they did something wrong. Leo is a punk, and there is no way any sane woman would've put up with that for \\"love\\" of the man who sold you out.

The heroine goes through a lot of (unnecessary) torment, and any book that makes Marie Antoinette into a nice girl and a good friend of the heroine is going to be hard to swallow. This is more along the lines of an historical Danielle Steel, in which the heroine triumphs over adversity, after hundreds of pages of pain, through which you must wade.

While this book has a number of suspenseful moments, and I don't feel completely cheated, I think Fred needed to do another draft of his outline. Tension is built up on elements that prove to be completely irrelevant, like the mysterious box of contraband. Turns out, it's just a device to get the main character into the book. The McGuffin of the title, Shiva, inexplicably fizzles toward the end, and a whole new Big Ending Battle ensues that is totally unrelated to Shiva's fate. Hints are raised (Berserker's being \\"lucky\\" for the sociopath) that end up nowhere. I love the Berserkers, but this one was a disappointing mess. I wish other writers would write Berserker books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather Disappointing","review":"First, let me say that in general I like the way Fred Saberhagen writes, and his stories and plots are exceptional. I got hooked on the berserker series after reading \\"Berserker Base\\", and went to my local half price bookstore and bought every book in the series I could find. This book, Shiva in Steel, has proved to be the worst. The hype over the big bad Shiva is never resolved! Did it die? Is it hiding in our hero's ship as he makes his get away? We never know. Mr. Saberhagen repeats himself a lot, and his prose isn't very smooth in this novel for some odd reason. He's done fine in the past, but this one was sloppy. New editor? No editor? The plot wasn't bad, but the execution was poor. This should have been a draft rather than the final product. If this is your first Berserker book, don't give up on the series.

So two stars is pretty much the lowest rating I'd give a Berserker book on principal. My two biggest objections to this book are:1) The characters all have hidden agendas that are never exposed. Mr. Saberhagen refers to connections between the characters, but never fleshes them out.

Inside thepadding is a pretty decent novellette struggling to get out. Maybe. Thecharacters are so flat, cardboard looks well-rounded. Plot-threadsdangle, and logical holes gape. Saberhagen clearly lost interest at thefirst draft, and his editor didn't send it back for a badly-needed rewrite(bad Tor!). Is he in poor health?Shiva in Steel somehow got a good review in Locus, which is why Ibought it (besides having liked previous Berserker stories). So Isuppose YMMV, but I doubt it.

I wish I had looked closer! This book is poorly written, poorly edited, poorly organized, and is only partially about Java threads. It appears to be a port from the authors' previous book on pthreads, and takes up too much space covering details of the underlying hardware without adequately covering Java itself.Many of the examples show C code, and their coverage of Java almost seems like an afterthought. If you're interested in Java threading and are in the market for a good book, I suggest that you keep looking.

The concept of active imagination, a way of tapping creative intuition and allowing inspiration to become conscious, has been tremendously influential and has been endlessly copied and written about.

This book can be looked at as a self-help book if you possess those qualities because it will gently remind you of sources of unhappiness that you would not readily accept consciously as being a valid reason for getting depressed. The danger of ignoring these sources of conflict is that your mind will take over and cope with the use of the imagination leading to fantasies.

Younger players will feel right at home with the 3D graphics but players who experienced the original versions will also appreciate these additions as they experience some of their childhood favorites in a new 3D variation.Other features are wireless play over WLAN (Ad Hoc) and a game sharing feature which allow PSP owners who do not yet have the game to experience a taste of the classic gaming world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Old school mixed with new school technology...","review":"This game has had a lot of thought into it.

It really shows the tension and stress of the war and the dire position of the Confederation. Much insight is given into Blair, and Thrakhath. There is also internal dilemmas faced by the Crew.

Whereas Computer Games have more than one 'path' to the eventual end of the story, a novel can only have one 'path', leading to one ending.But, regardless of that small fact, the book was a good read, not a must read, but one that you should consider, if you have the money/time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just terrible.","review":"This thing is just plain bad.

I strongly urge you to see the original 12:01. first filmed as a short in 1990, starring Kurtwood Smith who is perhaps best known for playing Clarence J. Boddicker in Robocop. This version focuses on the tragic aspect of the idea, with Smith's character (trapped in one hour! - not 1 day!) becoming more frustrated with the situation as the story goes on. The most heartbreaking moment is when he has explained to another character what is happening (and proven it by predicting a few occurrences around them). She responds by trying to give him comfort with an embrace. Both versions are based on a story by Richard Lupoff. The 1990 short was nominated for an Oscar."},{"rating":"2","title":"12:01","review":"This is one of my favorite science fiction films. The premise that time is repeating and only one character is aware of it has been used before, but rarely so well.

Jumped all over it. Thanks a million."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Clever, Funny and Tender Story.","review":"I am a fan of Science Fiction and I disagree with all the negative comments below. This story was never meant to be as heavy as 2001 or even Ground Hog Day. The actors are not preforming Shakespeare. They do a very good job in this light drama, perhaps more a kin to a tv movie. Helen Slater gives a very subtle and nuanced portrayal of a woman who is deeply lonely and yet still open to a man who sincerely cares about her. The story focuses on the characters and their interaction and does not spend an inordinate amount of time on explaining the cause of the time displacement. This is one of the best science fiction movies I have ever seen because it is honest, simple, and done with care. I doesn't bother me that it obviously had a low budget. Besides, the whole thing essentially takes place on one floor of an office building."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing Pages","review":"Just received notice from my grandson that the middle pages are inserted upside down and some are missing.

It just gives you the names of bosons, leptons, this equation, that one, such and such, and gets to nowhere. The principles of quantum physics are introduced at the end of the book just to put them somewhere, becuase the structure of this book is a shame. It also fails delivering a feel of amazement to the reader, which in other words would be that this book is boring.In conclusion, before buying this book, think it twice, because if you look for an understanding of what quantum physics is, that is the thing this book is not about."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Pictures!","review":"Instead of pictures and graphs, you fine text that says you must look at the printed version to see the pictures!

In between, that one photon has traveled EVERY POSSIBLE PATHWAY between the two points. The location where you detect it is determined by probability, not certainty.This book blew my mind, as I had left physics behind over a decade prior. It was very accessible, but disjointed.

Fundamental ideas of the quantum mechanics are explained in plain, clear and concise language. I think the book can be useful to undergraduate students who take a course on modern physics or a basic quantum mechanics course. I read \\"The Quantum World\\" in parallel with University Physics and Modern Physics and found this reading very enjoyable. But as a popular reading this book may be rather complicated. To people who don't have a relevant background in physics, before starting this book I would recommend \\"Warped passages\\" by Lisa Randall or \\"The Fabric of the Cosmos\\" by Brian Greene."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth it","review":"I just finished reading the book for the second time and it was definitely worth the money. In his book Ford touches on such complicated subjects as entanglement, quantum jumps and wave-particule duality, yet keeping it a relatively easy read (no pun intended).As a side note, the book also touches on the \\"whys\\" and \\"hows\\" of the quantum world, or at least attempts to divert the reader from asking those questions.

But we actually know very little about the man himself and what we think we know (the selling his soul at the crossroads story and forever being demon haunted)was a late addition to the legend. Pearson and McCulloch peel back the layers of what commentators have said about Johnson to reveal what we can really know about him--and it is not very much. They then tackle the literature on Johnson and show how a legend is created through wishful thinking, academic desire, and faulty deconstruction of lyrics. This is a wonderfully written, intelligent book that exposes the flaws of some methods of interpreting entertainers and the danger of interpreting them outside of the artist's culture. Johnson emerges as a human not such much chased by demons, but who chases women and whiskey too much. A fantastic study that should serve as both a model and a warning for all who write about entertainers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost the plot.","review":"A truly terrible book, that treats the reader like a moron.The blindingly obvious is explained over & over,& then againin case you still don't get it.The entire premise of this book could have been distilled in two pages.Don't bother ,play the music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Nessary","review":"please note: these are not required to listen to your mp3's if you're fine with just using the phone's own speaker"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the same volupte from years past....","review":"I was EXTREMELY dissapointed.

If we were dealing with Sci-Fi maybe I could forgive him.Winton constantly states that Fox can't believe that \\"she is real\\" - refering to Georgie.

Add to this the development of his characters who remain with you after the book has been closed, then you have sheer reading pleasure. In a nutshell - this novel is not plot driven but by the wish on the part of the reader to savour the prose and experience the characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"A refreshing love story","review":"This book deals with many issues: life in a small Australian fishing town, the mourning process of losing close family members, the feeling of being \\"direction-less\\" in life and the risks we need to take to find happiness and love. In an unconventional and refreshing way, the author takes two wounded and lost souls and, against all odds, draws their lives together for better or worse. What an unlikely satisfying experience was to read this book. It is moving and avoids all the cliches and blandness of a traditional love story."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book to be savored...","review":"Every sentence, each word of this richly layered saga is worth savoring. The imagery is deliciously textured. The skillful use of assonance allows the reader to feel as well as hear the author's words. The language Tim Winton uses is so absolute and so decisive and yet seems so effortless. If it weren't for the urgency of the plot, this would be a book one could linger over endlessly.This novel isn't so much about a journey of self-discovery or self-absorption as it is about a rite that unlocks the characters' ability to accept another's love. This is a book that could be reread many times and deliver fresh discoveries each time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keep on Rocking in the Free World","review":"From the ashes of Grade rises the formerly founded Somehow Hollow, who have raw passion, grit and sincere sensitivity which is the foundation of this album. The guitar work is impeccable and the singing is definately unique and heartfelt. Sounds blend heavy guitar riffs with band influences like MXPX, Saves the Day and The Getup Kids. I suggest reading the lyrics then blasting this CD on your stereo and singing along as loud as you can. It is a feel good album. Go buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware! Incomplete Edition","review":"Kessinger Publishers has reprinted only chapter 13 of The Christ of the Indian Road. The first 12 chapters are missing.

They have a certain breezy, seductive, summery, nostalgic feel that's never been captured as good anywhere else. While a lot Donovan albums are better left on the rack, this one is consistantly beautiful and his best alongside of the saddly unavailable (on Disc) \\"Mellow Yellow\\" - another sweet and atmospheric gem."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fine album","review":"This is one of the more evocative records in my collection. Many of the tunes benefit from the lush string and harpsichord adornments that, some of the more pop'n'roll tracks aside, conjure a misty, medieval feel. I was a little curious as to the editorial comment from Roy Francis Kasten with reference to the Pennebaker film 'Don't Look Back'. For a kickoff, it was Donovan who requested that Dylan play 'It's All Over Now, Baby Blue' as opposed to it being a pointed 'put down' on Dylan's behalf. As for the metaphorical disappearing into the wallpaper, maybe that was part of the DVD special features 'cos I don't recall it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Leaving home and the state for the first time by myself","review":"In the summer of 1966.

I'm using Hewett's and I thought it would be nice, rather than scribbling my own cards, to have some that are nicely printed. The problem is that these 1000 words are not organized alphabetically. So it's difficult to find the vocabulary words I need for Hewett's text. In fact, it's not even worth the effort of either resorting the 1000 cards, which are organized based on frequency of usage in the New Testament! If you was to learn your vocabulary just based on how many times a word appears these cards are for you. But if you want to use them to supplement any text other than Mounce's . . . not so much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb for the 1st LP","review":"H.C.P. has been my favorite group since Mystic Stylez, and they continue to bring heat.The new artist Chrome brought a lot to the table for this album.

In terms of usefulness for me, this would rate one star. Others, however, may get a lot more out of it. This book basically takes you through all the menu items of Frontpage 2000. It does this well. The writing is clear and the book well illustrated. On the other hand, there is no information here you couldn't get through experimentation and using the online help. If you are uncomfortable with computers and want to learn to use Frontpage to do simple web pages, this might be a good book for you. If, however, you know a lot about computers but are new to Frontpage, you will probably find this book to be a waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely useless","review":"This is a very poorly written book.

This might work for younger children who are unused to pencils, but I honestly don't think a 3 year old needs to worry about forming D'Nealian letters properly.

I used the OUT! stain and odor remover a few times in the problem areas, which did remove the stain and the odor, and my cat has been using her litter box ever since.Works well on those organic stain/smell issues, so I thought it would work well on other organic stains (red wine, dirt, etc.) but it didn't work so well.Overall a great product, does exactly what it says it will."},{"rating":"2","title":"Out Pet Stain & Odor remover","review":"This is a fantastic product, it removes the stain and the odor very well.

Unfortunately, this reissued CD's sound quality is nothing short of shameful and appalling and thus limits your ability to enjoy it.

I'm sure strobes are the way to go, but I'm very sorry he doesn't say why.Also, he got the f-stop chart wrong. He says f/4 is one stop below f/8, and that's just wrong. I wonder if he knows what a stop is, because he talks in the text as though stops are all powers of 2, rather than powers of square root of 2.I'd look for something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book","review":"This was actually a gift for a friend, but I always try to peruse before I hand over a book just to make sure it doesn't have any questionable content.I am not very interested in photography, but I found the book very fascinating. If I had had time, I would have read it more in depth.However, the reason I did not give it a fifth star is because it had some questionable pictures in it. Nothing too bad, but it was enough to catch my attention. Because of the pictures, this is a book I would only give to responible adults. Definitely not to kids or teens."},{"rating":"2","title":"sound resource","review":"I ordered this book because the questions I have are tenfold-I was quick to discover that the material is a little beyond me.

Mr. Grey explains all of the photographic terms in plain language, which makes it easy to understand the topic being discussed. Chapters include lighting styles, equipment, and techniques.HOWEVER, as I was reading through this book, I became confused when the pictures didn't match up with the text--upon closer inspection, around thirty or forty pages had been bound in the wrong section, which made for some interesting flipping around to find the illustrations. Also, I would have liked more information on how flashes can be slaved together, as with the Canon digital setup."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Source for Basic Information","review":"This is a good book to start with for basic lighting set-ups for specific (and a little generic) looks with relevant explanations.

It does not necessarily explain some of the more current styles of lighting, but it does work with a solid foundation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Informative Book","review":"Easy to understand.

It's simple to understand also for a beginner in studio lighting.It mainly treats studio strobe lights.You can find a lot of example for studio lights arrangements: all of them perfectly explain with pictures and photos."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too vague, not very useful","review":"The author is no doubt a great photographer, but the book is less then ideal. The book covers what light types are out there, and only gives a few examples of how to place them. There is far too much detail in some areas, which are not followed through in practical examples. The second half of the book diverts away from its title as well. What subject matter is covered, concentrates too heavily on expensive lighting set-ups as well. I think there is some useful information here, but not worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy language and jargon","review":"Being english my second language, reading this book is really easy.

However I was unpleasantly surprised. I agree with what's already been said that the DJ was entirely unnecessary. He persisted with irritating hues and shrieks that only took away from the music. It was like watching the twilight zone while listening to a jazz solo. Furthermore Herbie's little speeches only inspired impatience: \\"Knowledge is the future\\"- ok man thanks for that. I appreciate the search for a new sound etc but not when its dragging good musicians behind the cart. If you like \\"weird\\", this might be for you but it wasnt for me.

These tracks, originally released on his two solo albums, are hook-ridden pop gems that hold up quite well, thanks to Limahl's appealing voice. He certainly was as mannered as any of his 80's peers, but one of his real strengths as a recording artist was his choice of material. These are very catchy, very top-40 sounding songs, and he and his producers definately knew how to make great sounding singles!

It's kind of like the time Max and Cindy fought when Max thought Cindy was spending too much time 'training' to become a jockey.. Overall it's pretty good. I think one of the best of the 'new' Thoroughbred series, but then again, these books have gone down farther and farther. The TB series dug itself into a hole of about 200ft with the release of #24.

I have always thought Species was one of the better sci-fi films of it's time. Sure, it's no Aliens, but what else is? Species is much more than just waiting to see Natasha nude, it has a very compelling story, good special effects, and characters that interest you. And no, I'm not just a Natasha fan. As proof, I thought Species II was lame. Species II, in no way, compares to the original."},{"rating":"2","title":"Welcome Natasha!!","review":"For her first starring role, NH is fantastic... this moving is exciting, dramatic, funny and a little bloody, but... the story is good, the characters are well chosen and all in all, it is a very good movie!!!I highly recommend!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fast Paced Junk","review":"I think \\"Species\\" moves at a fast clip before it becomes evident that it's a piece of junk.

Very disappointing for a blu-ray release. In fact, the PQ is the worst in my 30+ BD collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass On This One!","review":"This movie is a real stinker. If you want eye candy and that is all you want, then Natasha Henstridge certainly fills that void. If you want an intelligent, coherent movie with interesting characters then you are out of luck! Forest Whitaker is probably the most annoying in this movie because he is an \\"empath\\" whose main role seems to be stating the glaringly obvious in every situation. Ben Kingsley comes in a close second with a thoroughly unlikeable character. There are plenty of plot holes and just plain ole stupidity all through this film. I will not be checking out the sequels to this lame sci-fi/horror hybrid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Search and destroy the naked menace!","review":"Always a sucker for beautiful naked Australian super model, alien babe movies, I could not resist the BD up-grade of Species for my collection. Take out your brain, make some popcorn and enjoy! PQ is beautiful, nice and detailed with enhanced colors as you expect from BD. SQ is an excellent up-grade as well. Clear and very dynamic when called upon and a haunting musical score runs through the movie. A team of professionals from different disciplines are pulled together to complete a common cause. To search out and destroy the often naked menace that is attempting to mate with a human male to perpetuate her species. She is like a black widow though. Her potentials and rivals never seem to fair very well. But, if you gotta go and given a choice in the matter, that's how I'm goin!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Has a worse sci-fi movie EVER been made?","review":"Ben Kingsley, you really must have needed the money. Natasha Hentsridge was cast solely for that gorgeous body of hers; the producers knew that they had a ridiculously bad film on their hands and had to give the target audience some reason not to complain. But complain I will, because I want something resembling a real plot in my sci-fi; I want stimulation for more than just my groin; I want my sense of plausibility to be stretched, not tossed aside. This film is a mish-mash of retread effects, no thrills whatsoever and way too many, \\"Oh, we just missed her again by seconds, so let's chase her some more!\\" Wretched, simply wretched. Species, since it's release, has been the movie by which I judge all others - for awfulness. Whenever I see a truly terrible sci-fi movie, the first thought that comes to mind is, \\"Well, it was better than Species.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"First third is OK, ending is a joke.","review":"I agree with the reviewer who said its split in thirds.

The babe is beautiful but you only get that in the first third."},{"rating":"1","title":"How bad","review":"I don't know how to begin my comments, the movie is so bad, the alien looks is a mix of Alien and human, Natasha Henstridge is always one step ahead the group, they always go together every where and...

The treatment of the woman, whom the alien takes captive after jumping into her car, is one of the cruelest things I have ever witnessed in a movie. I try to give particular reasons as to why I think a film is successful or fails. This film is not worth that kind of exploration. \\"Species\\" is just a piece of junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Started Decent, Last 30 Min is AWFUL SCHLOCK!","review":"WOW this movie is truly awful towards the end, decent special effects cannot save a really bad last 30 minutes, I almost stopped the movie it was so bad...Seems to be a trend in Hollywood to have a good movie for the first hour or so, but then to quickly drop into plotless, pointless action towards the end (eg ConAir, The Rock, Independence Day)...If you like good horror science fiction (eg Aliens, The Hidden, The Thing, Blade), DO NOT get this movie...

As for the rest of us, the pervasive nudity will cease to be novel after the first 5 minutes or so. What we are left with is a lame & predictable paint-by-numbers horror flick which apparently wants to be \\"Alien,\\" but seems content merely to steal liberally from an infinitely better movie.This is so predictable that you could stop watching after the first hour, but why would you want to waste that first precious hour anyway?

A top secret experiment is undertaken and within weeks one of the injected human ova grows into a seemingly normal female child, called \\"Sil.\\" It soon becomes apparent, however, that she possesses dangerous alien characteristics.

However,the patterns inside are typically the more simplilstic, run-of-the-mill design so I was anxious to have access to construction details for some of the more stunning cover quilts. The book did not live up to my expectations.The first 22 pages of the book are devoted to a tedious history of the magazine. Of the 15 patterns included, only three or four are of the artistry and caliber that I had come expect from a QNM cover and hoped to use as inspiration for my own designs. In addition the instructions and color placements are difficult to follow. For these reasons I feel the book is an overpriced collection of 15 patterns."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"It's a pleasant-enough book to get from the library and look at for 15 minutes, but I don't think it's worth the price to buy.

More like crying with laughter!","review":"This movie might look like a pretty cool movie: a psyco killer with a cool-looking mask that obviously is going to try to kill people on the cover, right? RIGHT! It was all very predictable. Also, the killer has a pretty stupid motive of killing his victims. Besides, all of his victims were killed for no particurlar reason. The person who wrote this movie obviously just wanted to create a movie just for the heck of it. And to top that, the first 30 minutes of the movie is all the characters (guys and girls) come to a party, take off their clothes, and swim and guzzle boos. Can you say _______, becuase this movie doesn't even deserve insults."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just...... Awful","review":"I rented this movie on impulse a few weeks ago, thinking that it sounded like a fun, if stupid, horror movie. Firstly, it wasn't scary. The rediculous premise and bad writing, directing, and acting made that impossible.Aforementioned problems aside, I might mave been able to enjoy this movie had it been a bit higher budget. The low-low-low budget is so apparent it's distracting. Throughout the entire movie, the cast drinks out of red plastic cups. Even wine!The only plus (And that's stretching it) was how comfortable the cast clearly was with each other. Every actor in the film shed their clothes at least once, and they didn't seem in the least bit nervous. The (surprisingly) graphic sex scene should have earned the film an NC-17 rating, especially in the extended version seen in the deleted scenes section on the DVD.All in all, do not rent (or even think about buying) this movie. If you want a good horror movie, check out the far superior \\"Scream\\" and \\"Nightmare on Elm Street.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"BLEED, big timewaster and just plain awful","review":"Bleed (2002) Debbie Rochon, Danny Wolske, Allen Nabors, Orly Tepper, Ronnie Gene Blevins, Julie Strain, D: Devin Hamilton. After fish-out-of-water Rochon gets invited to her young boss's party, his circle of friends and him (around a hot tub) explain to her about their Murder Club. When she is convinced to join, she kills a woman, and it turns out there was no Murder Club, but a real killer does prowl in her path. Strikes a similitude to a college filmmaker's effort with shoddiness and common story; the suspense is traded in for repulsive splatter. Running Time: 82 minutes and rated R for strong violence, gore, sexuality, nudity, and language."},{"rating":"1","title":"0 STARS SHOULD BE ENABLED","review":"This movie is so awful I can't even make it through it. The acting is worse than a Porky's film,mix that with annoying Blair Witch camera work and you have the trashy movie Bleed. A scream type clone that should be missed by all."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'D RATHER BLEED THAN WATCH THIS","review":"The reviewer before me hit the nail on the head. This movie is just plain awful,terrible acting and plot and just plain boring. My words can't describe how bad this movie is. The manager at Blockbuster was giving this movie away for a couple bucks to clear inventory.

It is time for a revised edition of this well thought out book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Immune Power","review":"Dr. Kaiser's book presents information that has existed for many years prior to the onset of Human Immunodeficiency Virus. The book does a marginal job in reflecting information however, it lacks current research data to support his theoretical construct. The book does however, serve to provide a rudimentary understanding of pathologoical issues connected with the disease process. In my opinion, the book needs to be more centered on the psycholological issues that are as a direct result of multiple physiological problems associated with the disease process.In my opinon, readers should understand the author is a medical doctor and as such presents his information from a medical model and apparently lacks Clinical Psychological training in the field of Health Psychology to support his findings.David Wayne Doyle, II M.A.,LPC, CTADT,CCGCDoctoral Candidate-Clinical & Health Psychology"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"This is the best album of 2001 IMHO. Nikka combines rock, soul, folk and funk like no one else. Expertly produced. And she's even better live than on record. Unlike most folks here I bought the album for \\"Push & Pull.\\" Didn't even realize it was the same person who did that \\"Like a Feather\\" song and video. Didn't know what I was getting but I like what I got!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS CD ROCKS>>>","review":"this is one of my fav CD by far, out of my 600+ cds that I own...Woman's got it all. funk, rock, blues, soul...u name it...I love each and every song off this CD. and I love her attitude, her style, and her righteousness...she keeps it real. I saw her in concert last year and she sounds twice as good live. I highly reccomend checking her out live. buy this album. you wont regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"More Nikka, Please","review":"If you crossed Lauryn Hill with Melissa Etheridge, with a dash of Joan Jett pinched in for good measure, you just might get Nikka Costa, who's a pretty good facsimile of all three, and still manages to carve her own niche. If this record had dropped five years ago, at the crest of the Lilith Fair rock chick wave, Costa would have been on everybody's playlist. As it is, she's crafted one of the best records of the last year, regardless of exposure.\\"Something\\" is an evocative witches' brew of scratch 'n' sniff samples, creative funk, and rock 'n' roll nostalgia. Costa herself is all spike heels and sex appeal,sneering at former lovers, daring new ones to make her day, and making it all sound legit."},{"rating":"2","title":"like a heavyweight!","review":"nikka makes her debut disc as hard sounding and mulitlayered as a seasoned artist would. the album opens with five great upbeat tracks. she slips a little in the slow numbers...but all-in all this is a funky ride! buy this album if you are fan of d'angelo or maxwells' more rock infuenced songs. a great debut!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So-so","review":"Bought the disc for the title song. There were only 1 or 2 others that were ok, but I found most of the songs just ordinary. Not an impressive album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nikka Costa","review":"I was looking for her CD, hoping that it will be like the song I loved as I was younger. Nikka Costa as a child singer is more my style than the R&B, soul etc. \\"First Love\\", her version of \\"Through the eyes of Love\\" and \\"On my Own\\" to say the few from 1980 s are more my style than this one. Sorry,Nikka. I am able to appreciate her vocal then than now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Prince fans will love her!","review":"Nikka blends rock, soul, and funk in a way that is uniquely hers. She's also got a great vocal range, and she knows how to use it! My first thought when listening to this CD was \\"Nikka and Prince should get together!\\" (Sure enough, Nikka has performed at Prince's mecca, Paisley Park.)Funky Tracks: #1, #4 (kind of reminds me of Eric Benet's version of the 70's song \\"If You Want Me To Stay\\"), #8 (I can just hear Prince on this one!) Rockin' Tracks: #2 (very uplifting lyrics), #3, #7, #11 (this track is one of the best showcases of Nikka's vocal ability - at the end of the song, she sings in a primal scream-fashion, very similar to Pink Floyd's \\"The Great Gig in the Sky\\").This is REAL music, with real instruments (horns, guitar, etc.) - a refreshing sound in today's world of synchopated fluff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Something REALLY different","review":"Parts of this album was great with tons of soul sending out a great vibe. I am especially impressed with these 4 tracks- \\"Like a Feather\\", \\"Tug of War\\", \\"Everybody Got Their Something\\", and my personal favorite \\"Hope it Felt Good\\" Songs on this album such as \\"Nothing\\", \\"Some Kind of Beautiful\\" and \\"Just Because\\" are ok but don't showcase Nikka's great powerful and soulful voice. She sounds much better with the funky disco flavor then with slow songs. I overall do love this album and since i just listened to it twice I'm hoping to get used to the songs i don't enjoy now. Props should also be rewarded to Justin Stanley and Mark Ronson the producers and musicians in this album..Why? because the music is just as HotT as Nikka's voice and that deserves some applause."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nikka Got It Goin On","review":"I would definately not call this rock. This album is very eclectic in nature with a hint of soul and a splash of electronic grooves. Some of the songs are like jam sessions with music of all types swirled into one soulful groove. NIkka comes from a music background and its obviouse she plays ohmage to every type of music she loves with old shcool funk to heavy industrial guitars and almost gospel type singing in the way she bears down on the mic. Oh, did I mention shes GORGEOUSE."},{"rating":"1","title":"nothing like I thought it would be","review":"i was expecting this album to be a lot funkier and spaced out than it was...She has a great voice...but the single \\"like a feather\\" misleads you to believe the rest of the album has that same deep soul/funk feel and it doesn't...too many slow tunes..not even that catchy im disappointed"},{"rating":"1","title":"overrated","review":"apart from the unique feel of the first single, the album's a bit of a let down. her voice is pretty thin and not too interesting...the only time she stands out of the mix is when she's off-key. the poppy production doesn't help either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album, better live","review":"This album's a pretty decent mixed genre album. Definitely catchy from the start. It's a shame that it falls so short of Nikka's amazing stage presence and performance. I saw her this weekend at Dodger Stadium while I was working. Even while she was warming up before the public was allowed onto the lot she was absolutely amazing. Her voice sounded so much more convincing and empassioned than on the album. She is a great performer as well as singer, even in the heat and in the presence of a half empty stadium, she gave it everything and really blew the crowd away. She finished it up with a great Sly and the Family Stone cover that deserves to be seen live.I think this CDs a pretty safe bet for most people, it's catchy and sincere, and deserves some play time. If you have the choice to make though, save your 15 bucks and spend it on seeing her in concert."},{"rating":"2","title":"KNOW YOUR FUNK! NIkka owes it to the masters","review":"This is a good hook ladden funky record that is influenced by the great FUNK records of the seventies. If you listen to the title track \\"Everybody got their something\\", and then you listen to Sly and the Family Stone's \\"If you want me to stay\\" you will see what I'm talking about.To understand FUNK you need to know who the original masters are and buy their records. James Brown, Parliament, CYMANDE, Sly Stone, etc. I recommend that people who are reading this go buy two records. SLy Stone's Fresh and CYmande \\"The soul of rasta\\". [....]Then you will start to learn about the true FUNK masters! Nikka is to be commended for keeping the FUNK alive and kicking in the 2001. Peace and Funk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nikka is NO Joke!!!","review":"Like.....Whoa, this CD is the Bomb! I have nothing but good things to say about this CD. Nikka Costa is like a breath of freah air to the music industry. Her music and lyrics are right on point. Listening to Nikka reminds me of how good music use to be in the late 80's and early 90's, because back then many artist had REAL talent unlike today. I would consider Nikka to be a cross between Taylor Dayne & Alanis Morrisette except with a more Funkdified Harder Edge!!! The standout tracks on this CD are of course the hit \\"Like A Feather\\", \\"So Have I For You\\", \\"Tug Of War\\" and my absolute favorite is the title track \\"Everybody Got Their Something\\". All I have left to say is that you can't go wrong with this CD, it's every true music lovers Musical Delight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money.. stick with the real thing.","review":"Absolutely B O R I N G, stick with the real thing and buy the CD by 'Senen Suarez' \\"Guaguanco Callejero\\" with the original version of \\"Yambeque\\" on the Tumbao label.The Conga solo on the first cut of this CD by \\"Little\\" Johnny... is a joke."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"How the heck do you wash this once your child spits up on it???

I disagree that the other books are any better, and I also disagree this book is full of innacuracies. There might be some. I did not see any. Perhaps others are so biases toward this beautiful little country that they cannot accept seeing a car with a little rust in page 63.

I honestly was surprised at how little it weighed and how much sound was produced. It being rechargeable was an absolute necessity.Two drawbacks that might need to be considered: the sound is not really variable (bass, treble) and the unit needs to be at a proper distance to produce feedback. Those were not issues for me. One drawback that I can foresee is that the portable microphone requires a 9-volt battery. I have a battery charger, but now I'll need to find a couple of 9-volt rechargeable batteries. The other option is a microphone that will plug in directly.All in all, this was a great purchase and I am very, very pleased."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good little PA system","review":"Works well.

But that changed with TOYER! Actor turned author, Gardner McKay (Adventures in Paradise) has a great style--concise, crisp, provocative. He withholds and surprises with every chapter. And what an intriging, inventive character/plot he has created. I've told five friends about this book. What a thrill to get back to pleasure reading, that is scary, intense, sexy and frightening, all at once."},{"rating":"1","title":"glad I didn't buy the hardback","review":"I can't believe that this book has so many readers \\"enthralled\\" and up all night.

Take the time to find one of them, and leave Toyer on the shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"The cover is better than the book!!!","review":"This book was written like it was a play. The story was not \\"real\\" at all. Maude, she was smart and then so dumb. The best part of the book is the last chapter, because you want to find out what is going to happen to Toyer. Telen, how can you fall in love with your X-lovers friend so quickly?? The books was just not believable."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than a thriller","review":"An extraordinary story, seductive, frightening, strange, unlike any other serial madman tale.

Horrible!","review":"This was the WORST audiobook I have ever listened to. The reader has no intonation, no life, no character. He simply drones on and on in a most boring fashion. He sounds as though he is going to sleep. His characters have no life, and no interest to the listener! I would urge any audiophile to pass this one up. As you note, I have not mentioned any of the characters in this book, that's because one doesn't remember when one is in a trance. This reader and book have no redeeming qualities!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid, pretentious and a little sexist","review":"Gardner McKay clearly wishes he was Thomas Harris or James Ellroy; he's ripped off both of them here pretty liberally. But since he writes like a 15-year-old and doesn't bother to do any sort of research (watching cheesy TV movies doesn't count), he won't ever come close. The plotting is thin, the characters thinner, and the dialogue is from Cliche-ville, USA. Writing a bad novel is one thing, writing one that is so blatantly mysoginistic is another. His main characters are females, and at first seem strong. But by the time that all of them have slept with a father figure and either gotten raped or very close to it, it's clear that his main joy is having his villain hurt women."},{"rating":"2","title":"Toyer","review":"I am a long time fan of Gardner McKay the author, I met him when he performed a play back in the early 1960's when I was a teenager. This story scared me so much I was afraid to even reply but I enjoyed the book very much. It is beautifully written and so real. The characters are very believable and seem to come alive on the written page. I want to read more of the author's books, anything he has written or performed. I have been writing all my life and wrote the last chapter of a murder mystery. The main character of the book sort of reminds me of the character in my book, but more intense and frighting. I hope this book becomes a movie.I'm am thrilled that Mr. Mckay has made such a success with his writings. Also the audio cassette is very dramatic and well performed. A must for all old time fans and new ones as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gardner McKay should stick to acting","review":"I read 50-60 books a year and at least 1/2 of them are mysteries or thrillers. One would hope that the action in this book would be impossible. I found it unbelievable! Mr. McKay seems to be trying to incorporate romance, murder, serial protanganists, Hollywood, medicine, etc. into one neat bundle and it's so far-fetched."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth even $1.00","review":"This book is just plain bad. Anatomical errors abound, which is unforgivable since the main character is a NEUROLIGIST! I tried to read this book four times. The farthest I got was page 152. There are many reasons I could not read the entire 482 book. Too many to list actually. Here's one-The main character is supposed to be a very brilliant doctor. But this so called genius does not even put in place the most rudimentery home safety featrues: which you would think she would do after Toyer contacts her. Also, where in the world are the police? Apparently in another book. I gave it two stars only because the idea of the book was a good one. But it was not written in a way to garner a higher rating. And the grammar of the book is worse than mine. Don't even touch this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Flow","review":"The early reviews of this book captured my interest, so I chanced it. Although the premise is interesting enough, the delivery just didn't do it for me. I found it to be too choppy even the way the chapters are constructed. Maybe it read more like a play than a novel. In any event, I just couldn't seem to get into the flow of the book and it seemed to take a long time to get through it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck!","review":"After reading through the early reviews for this book I purchased the unabridged audiobook version thinking I'd be listening to a great story. Not! I found the book boring, hard to listen to, and very choppy. In fact, I gave up on the 3rd tape, and there are 5 more to go. I'll likely force myself to try and listen again -- since I spent my money on the darned tapes -- but it'll be a while."},{"rating":"1","title":"I found the characters unbelievable","review":"Although at first it feels like a page-turner and reads like one, it is one of those novels that when you are done, you wonder why you wasted the time and effort. I found most of the characters to be gullible, beyond-stupid, and just plain crazy. One of the main characters, Maude, seemingly an intelligent doctor, was so unbelievable that her role in the end would have been laughable had it not been so ridiculous. Please tell me women are not this stupid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Gardner McKay writes plays. This is what this material called a book truly is...a play. Short clipped sentences 453 pages long. By the middle of the book I couldn't wait for it to end."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS BOOK IS REALLY BAD!","review":"I cannot imagine how this book was chosen for publication much less for recording. Much like pornography this book has no redeeming social value! The characters are all shallow and self-absorbed. The cat, whose relationship with his owner was described and psycologically interpreted ad nauseum, was more likable that any character. The plot was ridiculous, the police response laughable, the whole tone depressing. Perhaps Mr. Gardner and his entire ensemble should see someone about prescriptions for antidepressants."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read Thomas Harris' \\"Red Dragon\\" instead!","review":"What a piece of trash this book was! If you're looking for a serial-killer story with a completely unbelieveable storyline, the world's most inept detectives, and a \\"killer\\" who (with no medical background) is able to perform complex medical proceedures, then \\"Toyer\\" is for you. By the end of the book I didn't care if Toyer was caught or not. This book is so jam-packed with unpleasant characters (all of whom sleep with each other at some point) that I was hoping they would all get bumped off by the end. Thank God I only bought it in paperback. This book was so unrealistic that it was laughable, and certainly not frightening. Read Red Dragon instead, which has similar themes and was ten times the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is awful! YUCK!","review":"Gardner McKay might be a celebrated playwrite but boy can he NOT write a novel. The book begins on a very creepy and promising note, and then quickly degenerates into disjointed vignettes that have no flow whatsoever. The characters are one dimensional and moronic. Have you ever heard of caller id, stakeouts and FBI profiling Mr. McKay? Even the victims were unlikeable. When I was done I felt like I needed a very very long bath in some sort of disinfectant. I still feel kind of dirty and sick for even finishing it. Am I easily offended? Not at all --this was just a repulsive and disgusting book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a REAL fur toy!!!","review":"I have a cat that is ONLY interested in playing with real fur toys, he won't touch a synthetic product, even if it is filled with catnip. I bought this based on the somewhat misleading statement that it was made with \\"natural\\" fur...I have no idea what that actually means, because the covering is most definitely not natural or real. So, I basically wasted over $6.00 on this toy due to the misleading statement. Don't buy it if you are looking for \\"real fur\\" toys."},{"rating":"1","title":"CHEAP, cats not even interested","review":"These are terrible: poorly made rough fake fur, not even as pictured!

Save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chuck Negron Still Has It!","review":"Chuck Negron's personal challenges have been documented elsewhere so there's no need to rehash them here. Besides tight vocal arrangements, one of the things that made Three Dog Night stand out was their diversity of material and their vocal interpretation of those compositions. The same can be heard on Chuck's solo venture here. A nice variety of styles sung with the passion we know he is capable of.

There are so many features within Fireworks, that it's easy to get lost amongst the settings and menus. Sandee Cohen shows the way. She has real empathy with new user and upgrader alike - at times I thought she was reading my mind! Until I bought this book I was struggling to discover where everything was, and what everything did. Apart from increasing my awareness of and enjoyment from using Fireworks 2, Sandee has helped to improve the productivity of our little company.

It has the videos, but I've seen the videos on television. The performance of Get It Faster isn't really all that good at all. I've seen them play that song live twice and both times it was better than this one by a long shot. Given, Bleed American is not even worthy to be gauged on the same scale as Clarity, but even then, this thing isn't worth the 8 bucks you'll pay unless you're a stupid new fan who hasn't bothered to buy the older stuff. It's good to see that Jimmy Eat World hasn't lost it, as they've been playing more Clarity than anything else live lately and they aren't pleasing the 13 year old girls who want to hear The Middle over and over. Tom and Jim both looked totally bored playing it. Either way, for the real fans, the only incentive is the live audio-only of For Me This Is Heaven just because it's the best song ever.

Imagine some guys from the local community college, who spend a little too much time playing role-playing games, borrowing someone's dad's camcorder and making a movie in the local park during their days off from Wal-Mart. That should give you an idea of what you're in for here. These boys obviously have dirty minds worthy of any 13 year-old boy, but they couldn't even find any girls willing to take their tops off and provide a little prurient interest.

Virtually every idea in this book involves including a note with a bad pun with your gift. That would be OK, if the note were optional. The problem is, most of the gifts don't make sense without the note. If you leave out the silly note that says, \\"Sorry I've been driving you nuts,\\" just imagine the confused look on the face of the person to whom you just gave a bag of mixed nuts.There are a few genuinely good ideas here, but not enough to make the book worth the price, or to justify having it take up valuable bookshelf space.

Cydney should give every person who purchased this book an apology for writing this crap and their money back.

She had no self-esteem, self-respect or any regard for her only child! I usually write very positive reviews, but this book baffled me. Cyndey, you're a good author, but I think a lot could be said in this book, with less words...it was a bit long and drawn out. I feel that Lauren should have been more upset than she was; hey, her mother can learn from her, Lauren was an extraordinary child.

For such a real issue that could happen this book was not a good representation of what it could have been. I gave the author one star for having the courage to write this storyline and one star for writing certain scenes that made me believe I was in that state. But I mean come on Tracey was a monster for doing what she was doing to her child and thinking it was okay. Then to have such a well adjsuted child as Lauren it made you wonder who was the adult. To make matters worse the author leads you to believe Tracey was pregnant by Aaron but that storyline never goes anywhere. All I can say is it was a good try for this author but I would not recommend anybody to buy this book. Buy a Hoagie instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!!","review":"I really enjoyed this book.

Yes the sex scene between the 30 something woman and 20 something man lived up to what you would expect. But nobody's character was well-defined enough to make me understand the whys behind the relationship. I didn't LIKE any particular character in this book. And at one point I was actually just wishing that the daughter would hurry up and find out so we could move on from the \\"made-up\\" drama. I thought this was a great idea for a book, but the dialogue, lack of character development and lack of a male/female relationship that you could actually root for just made me quickly read this book and put it in my \\"never to be touched again\\" category."},{"rating":"1","title":"She was wrong for that!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This book is about a mother, daughter, and a boyfriend.

I was thoroughly disappointed by the lack of character development, poor dialogue, and just poor writing in general. It seemed like the writing was supposed to be an imitation of good books that are out there, however, without basic storytelling skills. I wanted to throw the book. Not because of the actions of the characters because usually that's a good thing. That means the characters seemed real and were well developed. But I wanted to throw it because the book wasted a perfectly good storyline through lack of development. This story should still be under construction to be fully developed later. I'm highly upset and disappointed. I bought the hardcover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible....","review":"This book was absolutely terrible. The plot was ok and kept my glued to the book but the situations were too unbelievable. Why would a mother do this to her daughter and then after the daughter finds out she keeps doing it? She's more concerned with her own lust for this boy then about her daughter? The sex scenes were explicit but I couldn't wrap my imagination around them. There were too many characters and too much unneccesary dialouge. The author was trying too hard at times. At one point in the book I thought the mother was pregnant but the book didn't hold my attention enough for me to actually find out. The ending was terrible right along with the rest of the book.

Now I could just trash it for no reason, but I actually have examples to back up my disgust for this book (for the money I spent on it, I could have gotten a weekly MetroCard or a pair of Payless shoes or a flu vaccination). Cydney Rax apalled me with her amateur writing skills. The book was full of sentence fragments (\\"Mouth felt that dry\\", et al.), the characters were static and undeveloped (Lauren had no personality, but was not to be outdone by her mother and boyfriend who each had the personality of a toothbrush), and the plot was slow and unbelievable. Yes, a situation like this can happen, but I hope it happens to more interesting people if it does. By the way, Lauren spent the novel packing and going to the airport--that's quality reading?!

For example, I am using the money movement stategy now and back in January began moving out of stocks into bonds and cash. Why? Interest rates were rising. Mr. Givens mantra always was:\\"When interest rates are going up, stocks go down. When interest rates are going down, stocks go up.\\"Use the money movement strategy but use your head.

There are too many MTV-style quick cuts, making it hard to follow any scene for more than a few seconds.

The Desert Fox, Erwin Rommel, must be included as well. Six generals, five British, one German, a study in character, leadership, the lack of it, and meddling politicians in a time of war.Good read. Very good. It's about men, not war."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good read, if you are just starting out","review":"I got this book after reading several people mention it on various websites. I don't consider myself an expert by any stretch of the imagination but I have spent a ridiculous amount of time online looking into various ttc topics. I decided to buy this book and see if perhaps there was a great wealth of information hiding in its pages but sadly the information here was nothing new to me. It was helpful in having a lot of the information in one place, if I needed to look up something or re-read something of interest. I was disappointed because after reading the book I was left with more questions and feeling more confused and overwhelmed. I went so far as to log into the website listed with the book but didn't get much help there either. Basically, I would recommend this book to someone just getting started on their ttc journey or someone that doesn't pour over internet sites all night! :) Good luck!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice read","review":"This has been a nice read.

But very informational."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you are obessesd with getting pregnant.....","review":"like I was, you HAVE to buy this book and follow the advice in it. I am one of the most impatient people I know and I wanted to get pregnant right away - the first month I followed the FAM method, I was pregnant and now I am the mother of a beautiful 16 month old girl. I can't say enough great things about this book. I kept my basal body temp on the chart in the back of the book and I was able to tell that I was pregnant before I got a positive on my pregnancy test. The book also addresses potential feritlity problems and gives sound advice for overcoming them. I've recommended it to several friends who also got pregnant right away with FAM. Well-worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST READ for women who are trying to conceive","review":"I bought this book after trying to conceive for four months. I had been using ovulation predictor kits and taken the advice of my OB/GYN and nothing seemed to work.

I am now a proud parent of a 3-month old baby boy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Book! Better than the Art of Family Planning","review":"If you ever want to avoid pregnancy or get pregnant, this is the book to have. It also explains an alternative birth control that doesn't have side effects and will only require 2 minutes of your time in a day. I like this book better than the Art of Family Planning because it doesn't preach. Another reason is that it's simpler and very easy to understand."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is a must for all women!","review":"I had absolutely no idea how fertility worked. Sure, I knew what I had been taught in sex education, but it was nothing compared to understanding more about fertility and the signs a woman's body gives out. This book is amazing. It truly should be given to all women in sex education. I think we'd have a lot fewer unplanned pregnancies if women could take charge of their own fertility. If a young woman is fearful of demanding her lover wear a condom, or afraid to go on birth control for fear of parents finding out, this book could make a huge difference to a woman responsible enough to pay attention to her own body. it's wonderful for achieving pregnancy as well. I think this book is a must have in *any* woman's personal library. It will change the way you view your body and will make clear to you your fertility signs and how your body works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Informative","review":"This book is very informative, not only for those trying to conceive or those using FAM, but for all women as it very clearly and thoughtfully provides information about fertility, fertility disorders, life stages in women, and fertile signs.It dispells many myths about fertility (i.e. the 28 day cycle). All in all, this is an excellent book for women interested in how their bodies work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every girl and woman should read this","review":"I really wish that I had gotten *this* book when I started menstruating, but it hadn't been written :) I've given copies of this to my sister and female friends who were TTC, and everyone has had the same reaction - why didn't anyone tell us this stuff years ago?!This book is invaluable for knowing what is going on with your body and for helping you understand your fertility, whether you are trying or avoiding.

I did \\"practice\\" charting for one month and then the first month that we tried for real - well it happened!! A friend of mine and my cousin both used this book and it helped them as well.

She said that her and her husband and tried for 6 months with no success and got pregnant the first month after she read and followed this book. Why didn't they teach this information to us in health class? This is a great book for all women to read, whether they're looking for natural birth control, pregnancy achievement, or just want to know more about how their body works.

While this book provides some useful information, all it really shows a woman is how to tell when she is ovulating. There is a much easier solution - buy an ovulation predictor kit! The kits are easier to use and do not require a woman to write everything down on a chart. Also, this book has NO information about things that could impair fertility (such as environmental factors, smoking, foods, etc.).

I had already read most of this content elsewhere, so I didn't learn very much. Not only that, I found it to be preach-y and annoyingly full of anecdotes about how doctors never listen to the author. Clearly she has struggled to get her message across, and I appreciate her efforts and believe in the message, but its not supposed to be an autobiography. I wish I'd read an excerpt before buying. Also the CD included is the same software that you can download for free online, and the actual charting service associated with this book is not free (as opposed to several other websites which are free)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helped Get Me Pregnant!","review":"Without a doubt, I would NOT have gotten pregnant when I did (after 3 years of trying) had I not read this book.Whether you're trying to get pregnant, avoid pregnancy or just want to learn about your own reproductive system, this book is a MUST READ for all women!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Necessary Reading If Your Doctor Is Taking A Slow Approach","review":"This book was essential in helping me achieve pregnancy. It gave me a sense of control in a situation where I was feeling helpless and frustrated. The book was very easy to follow and had great suggestions and sample charts. The detailed charting suggested by the book helped me identify two very serious medical problems blocking my ability to get pregnant. When I presented my evidence and \\"proof\\" to my doctor, she admitted that she would never have discovered those problems because her plan was to take a \\"wait and see\\" approach for the first 12 months. Within 2 months of diagnosing and treating those disorders, I became pregnant. I highly recommend this book to every woman who is being told by her doctor that she is \\"healthy,\\" but still isn't getting pregnant. It gives you back a sense of control."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Masterpiece in Women's Health","review":"This revised and updated version of Toni Weschler's book is a true masterpiece in the field, and even more so than the original, is a book that all women should own. I have used fertility awareness for years as a successful method of birth control, and have no doubt that I will be able to use the very same method to maximize my odds of a quick pregnancy. But more importantly, and as the author stresses throughout, this is basic gynecological information that all women should know. That is it presented in a light, accessible and very well written style is just icing on the cake. Get this book for yourself, and then get another for your daughter or niece. I think this is an important book that will have a large impact in the field for many years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"A definite must read","review":"If you want to know more about your body and both preventing and attempting pregnancy, this is the book.Very easy-to-read format, clear, easy to understand information."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is a must-have!","review":"All women should have their own copy of this book.

I purchased the book at the recommendation from a few friends that are into holistic things and I am very very happy that I bought it. If I ever have a girl, I want my daughter to know everything in the book because it teaches you things that should be second nature about your body (I might even teach my son a few things that are good for him to know about the female body). Some people rely on doctor's to tell them what is wrong, but doctors should be used as an expansion of your knowledge and they should not know your body better than you do. So whether you are trying to get pregnant, trying to avoid pregnancy, or just want to know what goes on in your body from cycle-to-cycle, this book is definitely something to look into."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wish I had read this book sooner!","review":"This book is excellent. It is something that should be required reading for every girl. I didn't discover this book until I was 28, and I was amazed at how much I didn't know about how my body worked. I picked this book up to help get pregnant and after using charting for just 2 months, I got pregnant. I know this book helped tremendously in that. I had a son, but if I had a daughter, this book would be one that I would save and have her read when she was older. It is so empowering to know how your body works. Knowledge is power, as they say."},{"rating":"2","title":"I highly recommend this for all women planning a pregnancy!","review":"As an RN, I felt I knew enough to get pregnant on my own. However, I was using the rule most doctors use, which is to have sex on cycle day 14. Erroneously, most doctors (male) still believe in 28 day cycles for ALL women. This is just not so. We are all individuals with unique cycles. I feel this book is a \\"must-read\\" for all those trying to get pregnant. I would not recommend this for book for exclusively avoiding pregnancy however, unless an alternate means of avoidance is used, such as a condom. I have this book, have lent it to many girlfriends and plan to buy another copy for my sister who is considering planning a family. On many websites, this book is referred to as \\"The TTC (trying to conceive) bible.\\" Need I say more?"},{"rating":"1","title":"TOO TECHNICAL!","review":"Not an easy read for those that aren't in the medical world daily.

It gives instruction on how to use the Natural Family Planning method but doesn't explain how this protects the sacredness of life.

It is a great book for all couples."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasn't informed pages were ripped out","review":"Title says it all. I would have given more stars if this hadnt pi**ed me off so much.

I've consulted with 2 OB/GYN doctors and after reading this book I was shocked that my doctors didn't mention most of the critical information that this book offers. I am going to tell my doctor that he should recommend this book to anyone TTC. It is a complete and easy to read explanation about all of the different signals a woman's body gives at different times of the month. Signals that I've been experiencing for years but didn't know what they were. By tracking these signals you can understand what's going on with your body and why. It is much more thorough and accurate than using test strips or monitors. This information can also help identify specific problems with infertility or your pregnancy. This book is essential for anyone who is trying to have or not have a baby and most doctors will not tell you this information."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good start to FAM","review":"I have found this book very helpful in getting started with the FAM method to avoid conception as an alternative to hormonal birth control methods. The author very clearly describes the fertility process and the steps to observing and charting a woman's cycle. I especially enjoyed the tone of the book, which is gently humorous and devoid of religious ideology. It really convinced me that FAM is a good method of birth control as well as an aid to conception.The downside is a few \\"over the top\\" moments in the book. After using this method I will agree that the process of taking a temperature every day and charting fertility signs is not as inconvenient as I had originally thought, but I will not go so far as to say that \\"charting is a privilidge\\".Overall, this book is a good start. I recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book!","review":"I read this book in two days because I couldn't put it down. I found it to be very informative. I learned so much about my own body that I never knew prior to reading this. I gave it four stars because the author Toni Weschler does repeat herself numerous times throughout the text. However, because of this book I have started charting my cycles and have learned so much about my own reproductive health. This book is not just for women who want are trying to conceive, but it is also good for women who are trying to avoid pregnancy as well. If you suspect that something may be wrong with your reproductive system then I highly recommend that you read this book before going to the doctor so that you and the doctor both can understand what is possibly going on. It will save your doctor a lot of guess work. I will hand this book down to my daughter so that she can understand what is normal when it comes to her reproductive health. All in all a very empowering book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good manual","review":"This is a good manual to learn about how our body works.The book has very valuable information every woman should know.However I bought this mainly to learn the fertility/ovulation charting, but I didn't find it easy at all. Too difficult and detailed in my opinion. This was my tentative to learn about ovulation (being close to peri-menopause) and monitor my periods. Instead I will go with the option of the LadyComp/Pearly fertility monitor which is the same thing only electronic.I was disappointed about that so this is why I am giving only 4 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Resource for all Women","review":"This is an excellent and thourougly interesting book written in a light and humorous tone. It gives informative, solid advice on how (or how not to) get pregnant, but beyond that, it's just a wonderful read if you want to know more about your body. It goes into great detail about anatomy, cycles and hormones, and while you may think you know about all that, you probably don't know half as much as you think you do! Obviously, you're not guaranteed to get pregnant if you follow the author's advice, but I did and I am (after two cycles charting!), and I am grateful to the many friends who told me to read this book"},{"rating":"2","title":"So informative!","review":"Reading this was better than sex ed in school! Its good information for women who are or are NOT trying to conceive. It sure teaches us a lot about our bodes and how they work.

Its empowering."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting and Informative","review":"I learned so much from this book. It described the information in a way that wasn't dull and boring.

Even having taken courses on women's health in nursing school, I feel I learned so much by reading this book - both new information and new ways to look at things I had already learned.

My friends and sister had mentioned this book and all have said that they were able to conceive successfully because of the information contained in this book. I bought it a month ago, because I wanted to start charting to see exactly what was going on with my body before we even started trying to have a baby, and wow! I am so happy that I got this book. I had no idea how well-tuned my body is for having babies. I always thought that a \\"normal\\" body temperature was 98.6....yes, obviously this is according to men, because most women's temps are low for the first half of the month, and shift one degree during the last 12-16 days of their cycle. I always thought I was just weird, or my own bodily symptoms were not normal, but quite the contrary, I have been thrilled to discover just how normal I am.

She is an extremely smart woman, and yet she indicated that she was surprised how much she didn't know about her own body. I, too, was unaware of basic information related to cervical fluid and fertility. I am so much more educated now, and I have recommended this book to several friends and coworkers. This book takes the mystery out of our menstrual cycle and puts control over fertility issues back where it should be--in our hands. Even if you don't plan on starting a family anytime soon (or at all), this should be required reading.Thank you for providing women with information that our gynecologists might not provide."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wanted to buy it for every woman I know!","review":"My husband and I want to have children, but not for a few years. I have tried several popular birth control pills including the new nuva-ring, but have still been upset by the side effects and didn't quite feel like myself. I was searching for a new method that didn't involve chemicals and found this book. It is an answer to prayer for me. After learning so many things about my body that I had never known, I feel more sexually confident about myself and am appreciating things that used to be annoyances. I would reccomend this book to any female, even if you never plan to have children or are not sexually active.It's a big book, but an easy read because it is so interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"It really works","review":"I had been told that it would be difficult for me to conceive because of my irregular cycles, in addition to the fact that my husband travels most of the time and I am over 30. It also took my mom 10 years to get pregnant with me, which seemed another negative sign. However, by using Toni's FAM, I was able to conceive the first month we tried (after staying of the Pill for 3 months intentionally without conception). Now, we have a beautiful baby girl and I am heading back to the book to learn how to track my cycles while I am nursing. I recommend this book to any friend who I know wants to conceive.

After trying to conceive for 6 months with no luck, one of my friends suggested I read this book. I thought the title was a little cheezy but I was willing to give it a shot. I cannot say enough good things about this book. It truly opened my eyes to so many things, and made me realize I really didn't know nearly as much as I thought I did about my own body.

I found out about this book around year 4 and was so amazed at all of the things I never knew about my body and my fertility. I can't say enough wonderful things about this book. I think every woman should own a copy whether she is trying to conceive or not. The information in it is for every woman to know. There were things I learned that I had never been told in a doctor's office, and many \\"mysteries\\" that were explained to me in plain, simple language. I copied and used the chart she provides in the book for several months, and because of the information they provided my OB/GYN was able to properly diagnose my \\"infertility\\" problem. I'm now the mother of a very precious baby boy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It is very good!","review":"I think the book is good, but the first two chapters are pretty unnecessary.

I love it.","review":"This is a great book for anyone who is trying to conceive or just want to learn more about your body. It has so much great information. I read it cover to cover and started charting my BBT. I recommend this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Only took 2 months!","review":"I am 34 and my husband and I had be trying about 6 months to get pregnant. I heard about this book from a web forum and decided to buy it. Wow!! We got pregnant on our second month of charting.I am amazed at the information in this book. I have recommended it to all the women I know, this is information that EVERY woman should be taught when she is a teenager. I was in awe of how little I knew about how my own body worked!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Every girl should look into this","review":"It's a bit of a dry read, but there is a lot of good information in here. I charted to avoid conceiving for two years, then when we decided to start trying for a baby I got pregnant in the first month."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked for me...","review":"I never knew how little I understood about fertility until I read this book. Approaching 30, I decided it was time to start trying to have a child. I checked this out from the library, but it is completely worth purchasing. It was an interesting and easy read. It discussed the signs of ovulation such as body changes and increase in body temperature. Temperature isn't as much a factor until AFTER you've ovulated so you know if or when it occurred (some women don't ovulate every month). It even discussed the best time to try for a boy or girl (there's no guarantee on that, but you can increase the chances--I think it actually worked for me!). After charting my fertility for only 2 months I got pregnant last January. (I ovulated around day 16.) Now I have a beautiful 3-month-old and can truly say my life was significantly altered by reading this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Buy","review":"I bought this book used and it was in very very good shape just as the seller had said, it barely looked like it had been used it has been very helpful to me in my TTC journey and I would definately buy from them again."},{"rating":"2","title":"TAKE CHARGE OF YOUR FERTILITY","review":"I FOUND THIS BOOK HAD USEFUL INFORMATION ON LEARNING MORE ABOUT YOUR CYCLE AND WHAT TO LOOK FOR. THIS WILL BE MY 4TH MONTH ON TRYING TO BECOME PREGNANT AND I HAVE ONLY USED THIS METHOD FOR 1 MONTH. I FOUND IT VERY HELPFUL AS TO WHEN TO DETERMINE WHEN I'M OVULATING, BEFORE I HAD NO CLUE, I JUST BASICALLY KINDA GUESSED. THE SAD THING IS I'M ALSO A OB NURSE AND WOULD OF BEEN EXPECTED TO KNOW MY BODY MORE AND WHAT TO LOOK FOR. SO I LEARNED SOME VERY USEFUL INFORMATION FROM THIS BOOK, THAT YOU DON'T ALWAYS LEARN IN NURSING SCHOOL OR EVEN ON THE JOB. THE BLANK CHARTS IN THE BACK OF THE BOOK ARE EXCELLENT TO USE AND YOU HAVE A VARIETY OF STYLES TO PICK FROM, DEPENDING ON WHAT YOU ARE MONITORING. THE ONLY DOWNFALL ON THIS BOOK THAT I FOUND, IS ALL OF THE CASE STUDIES AFTER AWHILE, KINDA OF GOT BORING.

This book only gives you half the information that you have to further research online... So save your money and check out the web, and if you must have this book, try checking it out at the libarary.... Again I really dont know how this book got such good reviews (if youve been TTC for awhile this book if pretty much worthless!)

Later I used it for pregnancy achievement. But through all of this, I learned an incredible amount about the female cycle, things every woman should know and understand. This book has been a tremendous source of information and knowledge and if I had a daughter (I only have sons) I would make her read it as soon as she hit puberty! Mine is coming apart from years of useful service."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"I have never felt better about my body since I started reading this book!

It is not only for women (or men) trying to concieve, but it also points out how to use natural birth control. I used this book to conceive my second child and it worked like a charm. I did not have fertility issues, but I found that I was not getting pregnant as quickly as I wanted to, and I got pregant the month that I read the book and implemented some of the suggestions. I cannot recommend this book enough!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Didn't know that I didn't know.","review":"This is a great comprehensive book! I learned a lot of information about my body that I was unaware that I didn't know. Why isn't this anatomy information taught in high school health class?Update: We now have a healthy baby girl. It only took two months to conceive, and I knew (because of this book) that we missed our \\"window of opportunity\\" the first month. I recommend this book to all of my friends trying to get pregnant!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very informative","review":"This is a great book I think every woman should read.

I knew pretty much next to nothing about the signs we can look for in our bodies and how to time everything out before reading this book. It was VERY easy to read and understand, and it was fun to start charting my temperature and other signs and symptoms each day. Now I'm pregnant on just the first cycle I charted, and I have this book to thank for a lot of it!

I feel as though I got most of it already online and elsewhere. The main reason I wanted the book was that I thought I would get a more scientific description of how to identify the types of cervical fluid. Instead, I got the same advice that I get everywhere else, and none of the descriptions match my cervical fluid types. I also feel no closer to understanding cervical position."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ovulation Bible","review":"The book is amazing. I was skeptical at first when I read all over that it was the \\"Fertility Bible\\" but I kept reading it over and over. I finally ordered it because all the random information online didn't seem to make sense together. I'm so glad I did. This book helped make sense of all the things I'd already learned and so much more.The book itself was tattered, but I expected no less, and for being less than a dollar in used condition, it was a mighty good find.

As I read and learned about how I could learn to understand and even PREDICT my monthly cycles, I was amazed that no one had bothered to teach me about this before. If you are trying to get pregnant, this book is a MUST READ. If you are NOT trying to get pregnant, and you are sick of being on the Pill, this book is a MUST READ. The title is says it all: you can TAKE CHARGE of your decision to have a child or not, and you don't need a Pill or even necessarily the medical establishment to do it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"YES should be REQUIRED READING in high school health class","review":"This extremely well written, well edited and readable book explains everything about the female reproductive cycle. Every kind of discharge, every kind of bodily sensation has meaning, it turns out. None of these symptoms are random, but have significance in the reproductive scheme of things. It's amazing how ignorant I was before I read TCOYF. I blame in part the bad high school health class/state curriculum. Excellent message boards at her website, too. Amazing, important resource for anyone who wants to understand what's going on with her body. Its encouragement to women is not preachy, crunchy or new age, but is matter of fact, common sense and neutral. Weschler deserves some kind of award for her service to women."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked too good!","review":"This book was for my wife, who likes to boil everything down to a science. I was really looking forward to the process of trying to get pregnant - high volume of.....you know!

I have been successfully using this as a birth control method for over a year, and I love the fact that I know exactly what is happening in my body. Even during a period of time when I abstained from sex, I continued to chart - just to be aware of my cycle. As a form of birth control, this is more time consuming than the Pill, and certainly doesn't protect from STIs, but is well worth the effort (and gives peace-of-mind about pregnancy when combined with condom use!).I have never felt so empowered as I do now - I do not have to give any more money to pharmaceutical companies; I don't have the libido-decreasing, depression-increasing side effects of the Pill.In sum, buy this book!! I guarantee you'll learn a lot!"},{"rating":"2","title":"We loved this book!!","review":"My husband and I both read this book, and we hope it helps us concieve our first child!

We also got Making Babies: A proven 3 month program to concieving and that refers back to this book as a must read also.

You have to get to know yourself pretty well if you want to track all three ways possible,so I hope you are comfortable. I would suggest this go anyone who is looking for a natural alternative to birth control pills/shots/IUDS,etc. I would also suggest it to anyone having trouble getting pregnant. I am not using it for this purpose (at least not any time soon), but it would make sense that it would work for women with regular cycles.

I realized one day that I didn't want to spend the next 20+ years paying monthly to put unnatural hormones into my body and so I started to do research to see if I had a natural option. Enter TCOYF!I hesitantly started following it's rules and charting. My husband was scared to death that we would get pregnant (we had a 2 year old when I started doing FAM) but 14 months later he is a total believer in it.I try to get all my friends to read TCOYF. I just wish someone would have told me about this book 6 years ago. I feel better than I ever did while I was on bc, which made me moody and uninterested most of the time.

Not only did I find my alternative birth control method (successful since March 2005, knock on wood), I gained a much more thorough understanding and peace of mind in regards to my body.

I would show signs of ovulation, but never seemed to get pregnant. I have been diagnosed with mild PCOS, and was told I would probably have to \\"get help\\" to get pregnant. Then I bought this book. I realized that I was ovulating, but we weren't timing things correctly. Even if there are still other problems keeping us from having a baby, the knowledge I gained from this book is such a relief--to know what is actually going on instead of just guessing \\"Did I actually ovulate? Was my luteal phase long enough?\\" is well worth the price of the book. Before you take Clomid, read the book and chart a few cycles. It is cheaper than boxes of ovulation tests or hormone treatments, and you might discover what you thought was true really wasn't, and you won't need any of that stuff after all. And for those who aren't trying, knowing how your body really works is nothing but beneficial."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every woman should read this book","review":"This book is awesome! I purchased it at the recommendation of a friend. I hated the pill. I came off the pill and started charting. I learned so much about my body. I didn't know until I read this book and charted that I don't ovulate every month and have a luteal phase defect. You can figure this out by charting. When my husband and I started trying to get pregnant, I took my charts in to my doctor so she could she that I don't ovulate every month and do have a short luteal phase. So, I was able to go ahead and start testing and Clomid right away instead of having to try the 1 year that seems to be custom before you can be treated with infertility aids. I think every woman should read this book whether or not she's trying to conceive because every woman should understand their body."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing","review":"I bought this book, did one chart and was pregnant straight away.

I'm not sure how long these cold packs will last I've only been using them for a month every other day or so. I gave them four stars because they only stay cold for about 25 minutes but they do get the job done. Their a good size for wrapping around your neck or knee. The cloth covers are a bit thin but that allows the cold to pass through without giving you freezer burn, anyone that uses cold packs knows what I mean. As far as durability only time will tell, I tend to use things like this gently and over the years that seems to have paid off because things last, at least for me they do. if your the kind of person that is rough with things these may not work for you.

I was wrong, it was terrible....but extremely likeable and definately funny (Don't miss God as a bowl of cherries & ice cream!). This story of Jesus and his modern day adventures does have some pacing issues, it moves like the tides...slow at times, but able to pick up just when it starts to get tedious. To get to the meat & bones, THIS IS NOT a movie for those who cannot appreciate low budget cult films or those who do not take the teachings of the church lightly. THIS IS for those of us who enjoy more than a little camp in our films, or for those drunken obscurists who along with a group of like minded friends can sit back and enjoy this movie for what it is....another chance to sit back and hang out with your goofy friends. Cheers to Lee Demarbe for totally offending my father by creating a movie that no one else would dare to make!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Depends on what you want it for","review":"I really wish Amazon had a way to give two ratings to the same item. The one-star rating above is for the movie. It's a bad movie, and not \\"bad-in-a-good-way\\" bad, just bad. It's boring. Jesus loses his long hair and robes about twenty mintes into the film, and from then on it's like watching a Ben Stiller clone in some really dull fight scenes.Regardless of the movie's quality, this DVD gets Five Full Stars (*****) as a collectible. It's worth the money just to be able to grab this out of your DVD collection and show it to people, or hear their reactions when they see it on your shelf. Buy it for the title, buy it for the case, buy it for the cover art -- just don't buy it for the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"needs help from heaven","review":"I turned this turkey dark after an hour. I debated if I should finish it. but some videos get better. this one for example. the last half was sort of good... what was wrong?. the guy playing Jesus was inadequate. the musical numbers were like me singing in the shower. the fight scenes were worse that spaghetti westerns. from some reviews I thought this movie would be an unknown gem in the ilk of REPO MAN or 6 string samurai..alas it was not to be. this flick will be re gifted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Film!","review":"I love this movie! It is hilarious, with many memorable moments and is fantastic, B-movie satire."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bottom of the barrel","review":"This movie deserves zero stars. It is honestly one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Don't waste your precious hours on earth watching this poorly written, acted, shot, and edited feature. I've seen a lot of low, no-budget movies before; I've even worked on some, and this one getting all the recognition that it has gotten just astounds me. As every movie I choose to view they are given 20 minutes to grab me with something, be it the plot, the cinematography or other. There is simply nothing good to say about it. Get your thumb ready if you rent this one because it will work overtime on the fast forward button."},{"rating":"1","title":"90 minutes I'll never get back","review":"For the love of mike, avoid this movie! I purchased it based on the review and in the belief that eveything is either funny/dumb, or dumb/funny. this movie was just BAD. This makes the Story of Ricky look like an oscar winner. The script was pretty bad, the acting is worse. The charachters have a problem conveying realistic emotion and either look like their reciting lines they've memorized, or they're so over the top, its stupid. It just wasnt good. I've tried giving away my copy to everyone I know, they watch it and give it back, blaming me for having poisoned them with this bad, bad movie. you could do so much better by watching paint age or grass grow. I'd rather get fat than watch this movie again. If I could have given it negative stars, I would have."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like Vampire movies SKIP THIS ONE OUT!","review":"Honestly! If you are a true vampire fan... don't waste you money on this movie... it's pathetic!BUT, If you like foolish, brainless, B-type comedies... then this is the one for you... and enjoy it!."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing at Best","review":"There are already some honest reviews about the acting/effects/etc. so I will approach this review from a different angle.I had hopes of a very good B-Movie, which is why I purchased the movie at a very cheap price (fortunately). I am a Christian, but the title didn't automatically equal blasphemy. In fact, the only place where the \\"red flags\\" went up was at the very end when the script writer decided to give his interpretation of who Jesus was... a man who said some great things to live by, but but not the Son of God (my interpretation of the actual words spoken).That statement at the end could have been overlooked if the rest of the product would have been of some 'B' quality. ALthough the writer had an idea of what Jesus would have been capable of doing, the writer showed no ability of having a Jesus who was complex and cohesive.The movie idea was very promising, but it didn't even come close to the expectations of mine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great premise, terrible excecution","review":"When you hear the title, Jesus Christ: Vampire Hunter, you think Jesus Christ, in full linens, Hunting Vampires. Instead of this, I watched 90 minutes of pure crap! Jesus only looks like Jesus for the first few scenes, and then runs around Vancouver like a punk rocker, (By the way, a Canadian Punk is absolutley impossible)plus Jesus fights more Athiests than Vampires! The Movie had the chance to be raw and hilariously offensive, but intead the Writer/Director played it safe, thus losing the humor. This movie is Garbage, the creator should take this story and sell it to someone who could do something great with the idea, Like Trey Parker."},{"rating":"2","title":"Freakin' hilarious!!!","review":"This movie is the most enjoyable thing I've seen in a very long time!!! The acting varies from hammy to terrible (although the narrator is brilliant!!!); the picture quality is shoddy; the kung-fu, well it's not Jet-Li standard, but it's focus is more on the comedy than the action; the lipsynch is wonky; the script is brilliant; the music is fantastic and well integrated; and it's really well directed! And it truly is chock full of laughs!Le Demarbre could be the next Peter Jackson for all we know, so enjoy this movie, pay it the homage it deserves, and maybe one day you'll be able to say you witnessed the start of a stellar directing career!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Big surprise","review":"I didn't know what to expect when i rented this .I thought it would probably be some cheesy low budget lamo production.To my surprise it is an excellent cheesy low budget movie with tons of personality and quirkiness.Jesus is recruited by a local toronto parish to kill the vampires that are killing all the lesbians in town.There are a few funny lesbian jokes and jesus having a conversation with god appearing as a talking dessert is hilarious.Having jesus allied with El Santo,a mexican wressler isastroke of genious.;-)Well worth a rent to check it out and if you like it buy it like i did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing spectacular","review":"All I have to say about this album is ????? It really lacks the spice and flavor of Sonora Ponce?as previous hits. All it has going in this album is \\"Fuego en el 23\\" and the last track which is a medley of their biggest hits that includes Fuego en el 23 AGAIN!!!! I know it is a medley, but the decision to include the SAME song in an album was not a wise one. The rest is just average or just plain mediocre music. This album is one of the reasons I am not a huge Sonora Poncena fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"I know it's a cliche but...","review":"I know it's a cliche but...THIS WOMAN COULD SING THE PHONE BOOK! I remember her from when I was a child. of course, I wasn't allowed to listen to most of her stuff, but when I could sneak and listen, I did. I forgot how much I loved her and didn't realize what a SOUL singer she was--made those tired country and pop songs into something even a purist could listen to because on her tongue, they were almost unrecognizable. Sit up and take notice youngsters, this is what SINGING is. the girls we like now listen to people like Ms. Jackson here. Bold and bawdy for sure, using some words I wish she wouldn't, but telling it like it is. dirty comedy, true life situations you hope your daughter isn't in, and some BAD ASS SANGIN'!

The last reviewer is correct in stating that these are reprints of the original french editions, but those editions remain the best since there currently exists no critical or scholarly editions of ravel's piano works. The Dover edition even corrects some errors that existed in the original editions. The last reiviewer likes Nancy Bricard's editions (and other editions published by Alfred edited by Maurice Hinson) but I think Nancy Bricard got a little too happy when she got access to Ravel's manuscript, and purposefully included obvious errors into the score, including a footnote explaining that it's an error, instead of just correcting it. Alfred can hardly be trusted for scholarly editing, so for now, this edition remains the best buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"No illustrations.","review":"Being decieved by the the cover, I bought this volume expecting, naturally, the stories would be illustrated.

I listen to many of the genres within metal, but I was searching for something else top of the line heavy. I always like to hear new bands and hear new stuff. During my searching, the typical metal -core, death -core, whatever -core, and other crap showed up. Other death metal bands were also uninteresting and too dull for me. BUT then came Krisiun! It is in your face.... balls to the wall metal with just the right balance of groove, tempo changes, blastbeats and technicality to keep you interested. Pure death metal art! I recommend anyone who likes Decapitated, Bloodbath, and Nile to listen to this.

No Thanks!\\" review. It is definitely on target. Janet's latest song is indistinguishable from earlier songs like \\"Escapade\\" and \\"Nothing Really Matters.\\" The only \\"new\\" thing about the song is its retro feel, but even this is not particularly novel or innovative; Ms. Jackson has simply followed Lady Madonna's lead in reaccentuating and repopularizing the sounds of earlier decades.

My perception of Janet now is totally different from how it's been for a few years-a really good music artist. Now I'm not sure I'll buy another one of her CD's. There are only 3 songs I actually like-All for you, Someone to call my lover, and When we OOooooo. The rest to me are not worth listening-I don't want to hear the words she sings, I personaly think the cover should have some kind of note on it explaining this topic.

Doesn't Matter isn't as good because of the new mix. All the other songs are krap. The velvet Rope was amazing and lots meaning.

What happened to you? This CD is not one of her best. She is trying to hard to keep up with the younger music and artists and she's losing her touch while doing so. Some tracks such as \\"Someone to Call My Lover\\" and \\"Come On, Get Up\\" are great tracks for parties, but the rest of the tracks are so trashy. There is only so much stuff you can say about making love on a CD. And that \\"Son of A Gun\\" song is much better on the radio when it's edited compared to this un-edited CD version. So I'm sorry to say this, but Ms. Jackson your music has sure gotten Nasty."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the ... happened?","review":"I've been a Janet Jackson fan for years and I adored the Velvet Rope, but this album has got to go. I'm being generous with two stars out of five, mainly because Trust a Try & Someone to Call My Lover are the two songs I generally like on this cd. Overall the album sounds dated and is very bland. Even Janet's vocals are lacking....and who in the hell needs to know ...? She's really trying too hard to be sexy. Anyone can be sexual on record, but being sexy is something that comes naturally. The fake orgasms are laughable and the annoying cooing voice???.....it's [not good]. Maybe next time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hot! Hot! Hot!","review":"This album is really hot! You need to take a cold shower after listening to this CD! I have always admired Janet jackson's talents and she really gives it her all on this one.

I always thought Janet Jackson to be on the conservative side a little especially after she recorded her song, Let's Wait a While. This album is the complete opposite!!! If you have no date on a Saturday night, make this album your date and you'll have a hot!!! time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Janet would you please speak up!","review":"Janet jackson on this cd sounds like a purring kitten and not in a sexy kind of way because you can brely hear her sing she is very whining.The songs are monotonous not worth buying and the only singles worth listening are \\"doesn't really matter \\" and\\"love scene \\" but the rest is dull or overdone.

Well with \\"Doesn't Really Matter\\" hitting #1 for 3 weeks straight on the billboard charts showing she is the still a force to mess with! Her second single and easily the song of the year 2000 \\"All for You\\" hit #1 for 7 weeks straight on the billboard charts. One of my favorite tunes \\"Someone to call my lover\\" peaked at #3 on the billboard charts. But I also like the songs \\" You ain't right\\" and \\"Come on Get up\\" You won't go wrong with \\"All For You\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"The sound of nature.........","review":"I LIKE THIS CD MAINLY FOR THE FACT THAT SHE SINGS SLOWLY.

Janet was taking risks with \\"janet.\\" and \\"The Velvet Rope\\". This album is way too short and way too boring and dull. \\"China Love\\" is the best song on the CD aside from \\"All For You\\" and a few others. The disc is just too easy and simple. Janet's already working on the follow-up to be released in early 2003. Hopefully she'll take a few more risks other than producing trashy songs like \\"Would You Mind\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Comeback- Well worth the publicity!","review":"Janet hyped this album so much I did run out to get it at lunch time. It is good listening. It is not as dark as the \\"Velvet Rope\\" was - and in lieu of her divorce I'm glad she took the high road. She does dog him out though in Son of a Gun! The guys at work keep stopping by to listen to \\"Would You Mind\\" - they have the track number down and everything! I don't think it is as freaky as \\"rope\\" was but it is good listening and it was worth the wait!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific","review":"Janet really has upbeat songs on here. I love every track on this album(especially All 4 You.) This CD is fabulous, and Janet really has talent. Janet Jackson has a beautiful voice, too. Songs like 'Doesn't Really Matter', and 'Feels So Right' are very soothing and pretty. I recommend this album. It keeps me awake and makes me want to dance!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Reinvention at its Best!","review":"It seems like every time Janet releases a new album I feel like I can relate some aspect of my life to the emotions that Janet reveals in her music. I though that Velvet Rope was the most revealing project had ever done. Then I heard All For You. What a great compilation!Janet..you've come along way and as a fan I'm glad for the ride your rollercoaster has treated us to! Thanks for keeping it real... That alone puts you miles above the rest!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Below average","review":"Like the other reviewers, I love Janet Jackson & have cherished her past albums. Having heard (& immediately liked) the songs \\"All for you\\" and \\"Someone to Call My Lover,\\" I had concluded that the rest of the songs must be just as good and immediately purchased the CD.Boy was I wrong. Amazingly enough (and just my luck), every song other than those two just mentioned were just plain bad. The melodies, the music, the rhythm were awkward and very difficult to listen to with any appreciation.Again, I am a Janet Jackson fan, and for a performer like her, this album is below par."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth The Wait","review":"Its been 4 years since Janets last album and i have to say that it has been worth the wait. All For You contains top tracks throughout all of the album. All For You contains the hit singles All For You and Doesnt Really Matter, and also contains great songs like Come On Get Up, SOn Of A Gun and China Love. This album finaly shows that Micheal isnt the only Jackson in the family with talent"},{"rating":"1","title":"An Album of Air","review":"After \\"All For You\\", \\"Someone To Call My Lover\\" and \\"Feels So Right\\" there isn't much to this album. We've herad JJ do all this before and do it much better. Again we see her excentuating her sexuality over the self-assured knowledgable woman of \\"Control\\" and \\"Rhythm Nation.\\" What is she trying to prove?Also the interludes she's been using since \\"Control\\" (yes they weren't separate cuts from the songs, but they are there) are really getting perposterous and annoying. Enough already! Ever since \\"Janet.\\" she seems to be stuck in a rut of making the same album over and over again. It's time JJ get creative again or get out of the game."},{"rating":"2","title":"As you can see on the cover, she definitely \\"All For You\\"","review":"Personally, I don't think this one of Janet's best, but it's a great upbeat song. The video's hot, and to most people, so is the song. Janet's changed a lot over the years, and she's a lot better now. Here's my review of the tracks:1. Radio Edit- The album version cut from radio stations. Very good, even though an edit= 4 Stars2. Top Heavy Remix- This remix slows everything down. Janet's singing a lot slower, but still very good. Nice music behind the lyrics, and still the great song. But, I think, could've been better.= 4 Stars3. Thunderpuss Club Mix- This is 10:28. I don't really think it should be this long, but fair enough. Thunderpuss did a pretty good on this club mix, and I enjoy it.= 4 Stars4. Interactive Video Track- This CD is enhanced, so pop it in your computer, and watch the great video! = 4 StarsOk, there it is. My review of Janet Jackson's \\"All For You (CD SINGLE) [IMPORT]Letter Grade : B-"},{"rating":"2","title":"What is Ya Problem","review":"Its her cd and she can curse if she wants to. Whats the big problem? Why cant she say what she wants to? With that said the majority of this album slow bump n grind music. Songs like You aint Right, WHen We Oooh, China Love, Would You Mind,Feels So Right and Truth create this type of mood. She does have some uptempo songs on here though like the singles All For You, Someone to Call My Lover, and Doesnt Really Matter. But some songs dont work at all like Trust a Try. As a Matter of fact that is the only song that isnt any good. THe whole cd is good just not great. I would recommend buying this if you are a fan or not."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"After the schizophrenic and challenging grooves of \\"The Velvet Rope,\\" it seemed like Janet was on the verge of a real musical breakthrough. Instead she retreats into this...fluff. Now, don't get me wrong - I love fluff as much as the next person (as long as it's done well). But this goes absolutely nowhere. It's a cake made entirely of frosting.By the way, an aside to Tony Markham from Brooklyn - \\"The glow of love\\" was originally done by Change FEATURING Luther Vandross. Just so's you know."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Enjoyable - some explicit lyrics","review":"I really enjoy this CD. I do not recall that there was any sticker to alert me to the explicit lyrics so I was \\"surprised\\" by them (but hey, I should have known, this IS Janet Jackson) I would recommend this CD to anyone (as long as you are not going to be too offended by what she says and sings)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Janet is Back!","review":"Janet is finally back with a new song, and a new album on the way, both titled All For You. Last summer we were treated with Doesnt Really Matter from NPII, but this is the first song we've heard from one of her albums since 1998's Every Time, from 1997's The Velvet Rope. The album wont be out until April 24th, but its not too long until its released. All For You samples Glow of Love from Luther Vandross, which works very well with the arrangement of this song. This is the CD single of All For You, and it contains 2 tracks: All For You (Radio Edit), and All For You (Video Version). The US will not see a maxi single, but it will be released overseas, so you can import it. This is just a fun song, that will stay in your head, and it will bring a smile to your face. Go out and buy it, because Miss Jackson is back!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost All For You","review":"This is a wonderful re-release of an excellent, fun album. The audio disc contains two remixes of \\"Son of A Gun\\", the Missy one & the P. Diddy one. But excluded from this clean version of the album is the best sensual song, \\"Would You Mind\\", which is more exciting than either \\"China Love\\" or \\"Love Scene.\\" The J.D. remix of \\"Someone to Call My Lover\\" would have been a nice addition to this collection.But the real reason to purchase this album is the DVD. Packed full of Janet's videos from her years with Virgin, all the videos are included, with exception of Doesn't Really Matter, which is sorely missed. However, the rest of the videos make up for it. The energy of \\"You Want This\\" is a highlight of all the videos.This is perfect for any Janet fan, I advise to buy it, even if some of the stuff is left off."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is she saying?","review":"I have been a long time Janet fan. I have always enjoyed her music, until now. I mean, I like the music somewhat but with each album she puts out she get more and more whiney. I mean can anybody hear what she is saying?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, Energetic....Worth buying","review":"This album, in my opinion, scores high musically and lyrically....Janet teams up with Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis once again to produce what is a very energetic album.The singles from this album, were \\"All4U\\", \\"Someone to call my lover\\", \\"Doesnt really matter\\" and \\"Son of a Gun\\". Although I feel more songs from the album should have been released since it contains so many more \\"single\\" quality songs such as \\"U aint right\\", \\"Come on Get up\\" and \\"Trust a try\\". I am always pleasently suprised by the quality of Janet Jackson Albums and although many say that this album is not her best, it is still very strong in comparison to other artists...Really consider buying this album if you are a general music lover!! Its sounds modern and contains a whole variety of different music themes and flavours, pop, R&B;, and soul"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmm..","review":"The only words I have to describe this comeback single from Miss J. are \\"banal\\",\\"repetitive\\",\\"embarrasing\\" and \\"unoriginal\\".This song was tailor-made to fit every radio format and it has succeeded.I cannot believe someone would want to be called a serious artist and offer such a teeny-bopper song as a lead off single.If I was Janet,I would be embarrased to sing this song in public.Easily the worst song of 2001,better best avoided.But you don't have to listen to me,just ask any music lover and they will tell you that this song is abysmal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yaaaawwwwn","review":"I feel that this song is way beneath Janet. She has more talent than this. It sounds too much like Escapade to me. She looks fabulous though!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad, but not her best...","review":"I rushed out on my lunch break to buy this today... I could have waited. while not an entirely bad album, it falls a little short on the Janet legacy. All For You is a strong single, but the rest of the album tends to be a let down. I guess that is why she included Doesn't Really Matter. The 'in-between-song' snips are back again, which I find a treat. However Janet's \\"sampling\\" is not. Her voice tends to get lost in some of the strong beats, while other songs like Son Of A Gun are torture. Janet has been working with the same producers throughout her career & always says \\"if it ain't broke, don't fix it.\\" Well Miss Jackson (if you're nasty) it may not be broken, but it is becoming a bit stale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Like She Used To Be...","review":"All For You was a major disappointment. With over 15 new tracks on the album you would expect at least more than 2 or 3 to be good. But this album is below average.Janet doesn't have the best voice. She's not a very inspiring songwriter. But she used to entertain us with her catchy pop & r&b melodies... not anymore. She has used the same old production team for far too long now. This album could have been released in 1993.This album is not full of simple teen pop songs either. This album is just boring. Lyrically this album is much like 1997's Velvet Rope. Songs about orgasms, insecurites and relationship troubles. I'm not surprised All For You is not in the UK Top 100 albums chart anymore. A 9 week chart run is embarrassing to say the least.Unfortunately this album deserves it."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD TIMING","review":"I was going to the concert and I had to have this before I went. I got my wish. It was in great condition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great pop Fun Erotic Album","review":"Janet is funky, Fresh and sexy on this record, The titled Single topped the Charts for 5 weeks. This album also solified her as a Legend. She was slaying all the lessers. Go Janet!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This does \\"feel so right\\"!","review":"This album released in 2001 is one of my favorites of all time. Here are songs that you can have fun with, dance, sing a lot...but there are also songs that you'd rather be alone when you listen to them, such as \\"Would You Mind\\", \\"When We Ooo\\" and \\"China Love\\".Still, this powerful album is filled with energy and rhythm. Fast songs like \\"All For You\\", \\"Come On Get Up\\", \\"Someone To Call My Lover\\" and \\"Doesn't Really Matter\\" never make you sick of listening to them.I think that \\"Better Days\\" is kinda the perfect song to end the album; it's very relaxed song with a very nice and optimistic lyric.I give this album 4/5, because of the sex songs, they're good anyway, but they may be inappropiate for an album that kids would like to listen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Despite the stylish cover and elegant champagne color of the CD itself, the songs on this album are not worth wasting your money on. Ah, for another \\"Rhythm Nation\\" and \\"Nasty Boys.\\"In this album, J.J. whispers so low that you can hardly hear her. You are always going, \\"What? What?\\" Her voice is so high-pitched that it disappears into the ether. The songs are too slow. There are only a couple of fast ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"This cd is a complete dissapointment","review":"I've been a fan of Janet's for many years but what is this? This album is a complete dissapointment! This is the juvenile, immature, and offensive content that makes me hate R&B; so much these days. I can't believe that this trash came from the same singer who gave us classics like \\"Lonely\\", \\"Love Will Never Do\\", & \\"Together Again\\".\\"Would You Mind\\" gets the dishonor of being the stupidest song ever made in the history of music! >:( She sounded so desperate and I'm sickened to see one of my favorite singers tumble from the dizzying heights of The Velvet Rope down to the pits of teenybopper fluff like \\"All For You\\". I mean the song musically is not bad but the incredibly stupid lyrics completely ruin it!Don't buy this CD. Avoid at all costs.Get the Velvet Rope instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"All Janet Fans MUST Own This!!","review":"If you're a Janet fan this is the ONE thing that you should definetly have in your collection. I am so happy that Virgin finally released Janet's videos from \\"The Velvet Rope\\" era. This DVD includes rarely seen videos such as \\"Because Of Love\\" and \\"Together Again (Deeper Remix)\\" I cannot express how much that this should be added to your collection, whether a die hard fan or just an admirer of JJ. The package also comes with the \\"All For You\\" CD that has two different versions of \\"Son of a Gun (I Betcha Think This Song is About You)\\" as bonus tracks. GET THIS DVD/CD!! The booklet includes pics from the \\"All For You Tourbook\\" (another must if you don't have it =) Enough reading this - go and order this wonderful package!! It is a LIMITED edition so get your hands on it before it's too late!! P.S. Hey Miss Janet mailing list =)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"When I first listened to Janet's new CD, I was totally turned off. For one thing, when does profane language become \\"artistic\\"? There are other ways to tell a man how you want him to ... you in a song. This just sounds nasty and mediocre. Her vocals sound absolutely terrible this time out. I guess she lost her Midas touch after Rene Elizondo stopped co-writing with Janet. \\"Son Of A Gun\\" is one of the most painful listens I have experienced recently. And I though listening to Robbie Williams rap was painful.Only a few cuts are worthy such as \\"All For You\\" and \\"Doesn't Really Matter\\". Even those cuts get tired after a while. Janet really needed to take some more time off because the wait for \\"All For You\\" wasn't worth it and the media hype (do you remember the all star tribute to her on MTV?) was baloney.If you are a hard core Janet fan, buy this, but if you love good pop music, don't even bother with this piece of garbage. Flush!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"All for You- No Thank You!","review":"After waiting so long for her newest cd to drop, I was very disappointed by this album. Aside for the title track and \\"Doesn't really matter\\", I felt like I wasted my money. I was also surprised this album doesn't have a parental warning label with all the sexually graphic lyrics in it. I had to wait until my children were sleep to listen to it. Now you know that's bad! I didn't even want to give this cd one star, but I couldn't do this review unless I rated it.Janet, I think you'd better included your ex husband on your next effort. This album doesn't cut it for me! And from what I see in the other reviews, quite a few people agree with me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Janet - Remixed by Thunderpuss","review":"Miss Jackson returned to the scene with her first single off her new album, \\"All for You.\\" But in order to truly make a splash on the dancefloor, she needed to hook up with remixers who were up to task in re-introducing Janet to club America. Chris Cox and Barry Harris of Thunderpuss stepped up to the plate, and the end result will leave you breathless. They give the Jam and Lewis-produced single a remix that has tons of energy and life. This remix, as I understand, is not available domestically on CD. You can only get it on import. Therefore, you should make the investment by getting this fine remix. Don't be the last to hear it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it, I love it, I love it!","review":"Ms Jackson's new album didn't really grab me on first hearing but after a few listens there are some real gems on it. However, it's the bonus DVD, which just blows my socks off and one video in particular, which I have never seen 'together again' (deep remix), which I have to watch with a bucket of ice at the ready! This is Janet (in my eyes) at her most, sensual and perhaps even erotic as she just seduces you with her voice and THAT look as she removes certain layers of clothing (enough my lad!). IF YOU LIKE JANET THEN JUST BUY IT NOW AS SUPPLIES ARE GETTING LOW!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant stuff.","review":"This cd has the same pop-sexuality Velvet Rope had, minus the sultry bit. Most of the cd still makes you want to get up and shake your hips to the songs. Son of a Gun, which is choppy at one point, is absolutely fabuluous in its stunningly direct smack-down musical approach. A lot of the other music is peppy and joyful, celebratory of sexual wants."},{"rating":"1","title":"Actual title should be \\"The Day That Harris & Lewis Got The Flu\\"","review":"Even though I've stated that Janet Jackson is my favorite singer, I've become disgusted with the mediocrity of her more recent output after having my subconscious indelibly stamped with the greatness of her late 80s/early 90s albums. None of her albums are completely disposable, but there's not a lot to recommend this one, either. \\"Doesn't Really Matter\\" and \\"Come On Get Up\\" are plausible efforts, but the rest is pretty tepid, especially the embarrassingly bad \\"Someone To Call My Lover\\" which is a good way to make pop purists angry with its blatant rip-off of the America classic \\"Ventura Highway\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed in Janet....","review":"I have always enjoyed Janet's music in the past. Her past albums incorporated different moods covering a wide range, some fun and savy, while others were a little sexy. I was very disappointed in this album. Only three good songs, and the rest, well, almost trashy. The language was inappropriate, with a lot of sexual verbage. Wish she would have put a little class in this album. Maybe next time...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heard \\"Damita Jo\\" & she's defintely stepped up on that one!!","review":"I think \\"All For You\\" was a weak album & definitely isn't her best work.I've heard Janet's new album \\"Damita Jo\\"(in stores March 30th) and was confused as to why she would release \\"Just A Little While\\" as a single.\\"Just A Little\\" is a totally different sound from what the album really is... an R&B album.Some of the songs like \\"Damita Jo\\",\\"All Nite\\",\\"My Baby\\" ft. Kanye West,etc. could have easily been singles, which I hope will happen once the album is released. Forget about buying \\"All For You\\" and get \\"Damita Jo\\"!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Janet Jackson","review":"I believe that the SupperBowl act was a way to get the media off of her brother Mike,its just to close and she loose any fans over it.Mike is quilty and will be punishesed for his crime."},{"rating":"1","title":"PLEASE","review":"WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE SINGLE ALL FOR YOU, THIS ALBUM IS SOOOO BAD.

They are so very great and usually I like everything they release, but this album is a joke. It's not a secret that Janet hasn't got the biggest voice on earth. On this CD she moans & groans and is busy pretending to be so \\"sexy\\" that obviously the quality of songs has been forgotton. The only decent song is \\"All for you\\" and the rest is a zero."},{"rating":"1","title":"JESUS THIS IS BORING S***!","review":"ok, ok, ok. this is NOT wot i expected from 'rhythm nation' 'the velvet rope' and all the rest.

Waste of money. I'm tempted to toss mine, it's that bad.

But there's so much other bad stuff, you feel cheated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh, Grow Up...She's an adult now!","review":"To all of you who are shocked by the language, Janet is no longer singing bubble gum because she's past that...she's evolved. That's what artists do. I love this CD. I think it's one of her best. \\"Son of a Gun\\" was a risk worth taking and I take my hat off to Carly Simon for being so cool and funky on this cut. Janet, you go. Congruatualtions on the wonderful CD and I look forward to seeing you at Madison Square Garden in August."},{"rating":"2","title":"All For You Janet review","review":"I never thought that April 24, 2001 would come soon enough. All For You is a great album. It is an eclectic combination of musical style from R&B, Pop, Rock and a little classical. Some of the most bumpin tracks are Trust to Try, You Aint Right, Would you Mind. Beside the whole CD being amazing, the interludes (which i think were secretly recorded by Jimmy Jam) are great because you can hear Janet being relaxed and herself and funny, especially her imitation of Fran Dresher of the TV show the Nanny. This is a must have CD especially if you love to dance (vertically as well as horizontally ;)) I am looking forward to the remixes of the singles as well as the tour. Janet definitely an ICON who is at the top of her game. Love Janet, Love the CD and Love to Dance."},{"rating":"1","title":"All For Nothing.","review":"Janet Jackson is an AMAZING woman who has struggled with herself and her image since she was a little girl. Breaking away from her The Jackson 5 and Michael's shadow in the mid 80s, she made everyone recognize her as an artist and a musician. Rhythm Nation and The Velvet Rope were such amazing and powerful albums, while All For You was simply stupid. Janet is 36 now, and for some reason, the album sounds like it should be sung by a 26 year old, or even younger. The tile track is annoying, and most of the other tracks are just kind of thrown together and the final result is All for Nothing. The album lacks a lot of aritistic merit that The Velvet Rope had. Son of a Gun is a bad take off on the incredible Got 'til it's Gone. Carli Simon was famous in the 70s. Th 70s are long over Janet. Hopefully you'll lose Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis on your next album and go for a more electronica sound. Buy this album only if you need it to complete your Janet Jackson collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"All For You","review":"Janet's lead single from her 2001 album ALL FOR YOU, the title track is probably one of the more catchier songs on the album, wisely sampling Luther Vandross' \\"Glow of Love\\". This is a pretty memorable song, with some nice remixes, the best remixes from the AFY era. Included are the great remixes, such as the DJ Quik Remix, and the Rock Mix, which give it a heavier beat and overall a nice effect in remix form. The Top Heavy Remix is also a good one, however the Thunderpuss remix is just long and boring, and unneccesary. Overall though a pleasant single, too bad it was the only one from that album that was actually good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Janet Jackson Rock in All for you!","review":"I haven't heard it all but I just heard \\"Son of a Gun\\" And I guess it a best song that it could compose for. Janet Jackson rock for R&B Soul songs and all for her! \\"All For You\\" is rockin for all! It explicit with anything you could imagine for! \\"All For You\\" is a smash hit also! Let her shine for the lord! :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Little Hinges Here & There.. But A Great Dance Album Though...","review":"The album even though seems rather oplulent, but at times is fun to listen to whenever you feel tired out or just wanna chill. Than put this in. The music here is good and sounds her own. Unlike most people of todays modern pop industry. Janet may sound rather silly but she has made her ground clear on this album. And I like that. She has established herself. She's confident and having fun with her music. After all it's what she's supposed to be doing. But her older albums are sttill a little better to listen to. But I'll bet this album is more dancable to. But it's not bad as most people would put it. I am neutral and I stand my opinions. This album is better than most. It's fun, that's all I can say... Well Happy Listening Guys!"},{"rating":"2","title":"ALL FOR YOU!!!!","review":"I don't know what that one guy is thinkin, but this is a great JANET jam! It is SO not a \\"regular bubble gum pop\\" song! If you were a smart music listener, u can tell that she has gone back to an 80s kinda beat and tune, which I don't see anyone else doin!! The lines that are sung throughout the song \\"All my girls at the party, look at his body, shakin' that thing like u never did see, got a nice package alright, guess I'm gonna have to ride it tonight\\" VERY GOOD LYRICS! hahaha- my point is, this song is SOOOOO much better than the trash played on the radio today, and SOOOOOO not bubblegum. It is Janet at her best, which can be seen in her outstanding vocals, the best she has sounded for awhile, especially during the verses. They are nice and stronG!!!!! Along w/ being the best song so far this year, it has to be the best SINGLE COVER EVER!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Unoriginal: Write your own music for crying out loud!","review":"Well after hearnig the title track off this album on the radio I was immediately deflated. One of my favorite songs \\"Glow of Love\\" by the 70's group Change was repackaged shamelessly for Miss Jackson. Another slap across our faces. Actually they just took the Luther Vandross Vocals off the song and added her new deep lyrcis. You'd think Jam, Terry and Janet would at least have the decency to reperform the music themselves.The second single, no suprise, was another rip off. This time the song was from the band \\"America\\". Second slap across our face. Forget the flashing she's slapping us left and right. That's physical abuse and artistic abuse.This album deserves no respect, is un artistic and just plain made to make money. If you want to hear new original music go elsewhere.Where is the zero star rating when you need it!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it!!","review":"Like all new CD's it takes a few listens before you can get into it. And that's exactly what happened! I play this CD when I'm in the car and at work. It's a great CD to either shake that thang, or get that thang on with your signifcant other! Janet...sorry Ms. Jackson you've done it again! Can't wait to see you in concert!Go on...Ms. Janet!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"All For Me? No Thanks!","review":"It's sad for me to say, but All For You has to be Miss Jackson's weakest song ever. It sounds just like every other bubblegum song on the radio and has no innovation or thought behind it. It seems like the relative faliure of The Velvet Rope CD has scared her into banality. The only thing that stands out is the crass and offensive chorus that is, of course, repeated aud-nausium. Let's hope this isn't representitive of the new albums direction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Put Your Clothes Back On!","review":"Janet needs to put her clothes back on and begin singing good songs again. I only bought this for the DVD video compiliation and good thing too as the music on ALL FOR YOU is pathetic. Since Velvet Rope was percieved to be depresing, this CD was concocted to proove that Janet was a party grryl. Well it didn't work. We can see right through you. The only song I like on the disc is Feels So Right.I won't be buying any more Janet Jackson CD's until she can stop being a shallow poser and start being the stong opinionated woman we all learned to love on Control and Rhythm Nation."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT What America Needs Now","review":"I really feel let down by this CD.

I know miss j is capable of making great music. Before I say more, I want to point out that some of you in here have NO right to call michael weird(you know who you are) don't review this album as an excuse to bring michael down just because you think janet is the better jackson. I love and respect both of them and I'll stand up for them!anyway the standout tracks on this CD are You Aint Right, All For You, Trust a Try, China Love, Son of a Gun and Better Days. Someone To Call My Lover was a good summer song too, it became a part of my great memories from last summer!

It's mostly dance/pop tracks like come on get up, you aint right, all for you, someone to call my lover, son of a gun(with some rapping); ballads like when we ooh, china love, the babymaking songs, truth; r&b like feels so right, doesn't really matter and songs with guitar such as better days and trust a try. As far as being janet's best album, I don't think it is, but I still think it's worth owning and fun to play when cleaning the house or something cause it's bound to make you dance. And most of all you can hear the joy janet is feeling at the time of writing the record and that's what made the all for you janet period a memorable one for fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Janet hits a dead end on here!","review":"This album was a major dissapointment on so many levels. After such a great CD like \\"The Velvet Rope\\", AFY looking at it now, marked the beginning of the end for Janet's music.Many of these songs are just plain drab and are forgettable. The exceptions are the title track which is really a fun dance song, \\"Trust A Try\\" and \\"Truth\\" and the closing track \\"Better Days\\". The rest of this album doesn't fare well though.The middle part of this album is just awful and feels more like spoken softcore material than a music CD! \\"Would You Mind\\" is just plain stupid, even by teen pop standards. The interludes also are completely messy as well.As bad as it is, this album almost sounds like a gem compared to it's horrible follow up \\"Damita Jo\\".Looking at it now, I hate to say it but this album marked Janet's decline into blandness that has hit rock bottom with it's following disaster \\"Damita Jo\\". Stick with your older Janet albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"she has changed","review":"This CD was very dissapointing to me. Usually artists improve in each cd. That is not the case here. Janet's music used to be more meaningfull and it showed off her vocal talents. This CD is full of overproduced songs like \\"all for you\\" that show no creativity. If you plan on buying this cd and have high expectations, I'm telling you now you may be dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"All For you...and it is","review":"This is some of Janets best work in years.. My favorite track is 13 Son of a Gun featuring Carly Simon. I have been a fan of Janet since 1986 and her music keeps getting better and better. Your gonna love it Watch out for the HOT HOT track Come on get up. This song will be such a hit in all of the big dance clubs"},{"rating":"2","title":"Janet's back with more strength than ever!","review":"Janet's All For You is very good! It has a wide range of music from it's uptempo title track All For You to the very sexual songs like Would You Mind. From the house vibe of Come On Get Up to the more rocking sound like Trust A Try.All of the songs are good but my favorits are Trust A Try and Someone to Call My Lover.Janet's back and with more strength than ever! It really is a good cd, i recomend it highly."},{"rating":"1","title":"all for you","review":"Hey guys, I bought the new Janet album in hopes for anotherVelvet Rope(MY FAVORITE CD) but i just got [bad stuff].

The CD feels like a journey with each song creating a scene. I can relate to almost every song. Yes, some songs are a bit explicit...but J is a grown A#$ women! Handle your business, Janet. Definitely worth the wait."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a good cd, as good as any she has made! Try it.","review":"Well first off I would like to say that modern music in general is in a big depression. It's all becoming a game of who can mass produce a hit so we can all get rich faster kind of thing. So there;s no use complaining about that, if you don't like quick computerized popular kind of music then you will just have to wait for this phase to pass. But if you want to hear anything but bach you will have to content yourself with the stuff that comes out. As for the vulgar lyrics, well I am an intelligent thinking being and guess what, I am not scared! WOW! You don't have to coddle me with your music, and if everyone in the world is so prudish then well ,maybe the lyrics should be MORE vulgar to wake ya'all up! As far as the cd itself goes it happens to be a lot like Janet you guys remember it dont you? Well this one is very similiar. I like it and I just think it shows her personality. Well there you go. I Think it's very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Janet At Her Finest (And I Don't Mean The Cover)","review":"When I think of Janet Jackson, I think of good quality music and that is exactly the concept behind this fantastic new single by Ms. Jackson herself. \\"All For You\\" will find everybody on the dance floor, with an incredible new beat similar to \\"Doesn't Really Matter,\\" but Janet keeps it original like she does with all her songs. Janet's smooth and sultry voice grabs the attention of the listener for what seems like a music roller coaster ride leaving the listener mesmerized. This song is currently at #1, and has maintained that position for two weeks!!! So that ought to tell you something about it for people who keep bringing down her music. If you enjoy Janet Jackson, and like original music and are tired of the teeny boppers that are polluting the charts nowadays, then this is the song for you. Pick it up today, you won't regret it =)."},{"rating":"2","title":"MSJREVIEW","review":"Ms. Jackson (if you're nasty) has done it again. I thoroughly enjoyed this CD in it's entirety. I got my groove on and shook by thang!! You go girl!! I found \\"Better Days\\" to be quite motivating, when I'm feeling a little down I play that song and all's right with the world. I hope you all enjoy this CD as much as I did. I know I'll be playing it as often as possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Potty Mouth","review":"Having been a Janet fan right from the start and enjoyed seeing her rise to success, I was REALLY disappointed with this latest CD. Sure, the usual great dance formula and a couple of superb tracks, but why oh why did she have to have such foul-mouthed tracks on their too? I would have thought her talent (and even great looks) would have been enough to guarantee good enough sales figures, but there's no way I'd let my kids (aged 4 to 10) listen to this CD like I would her others. \\"Mother F*****\\" littered throughout? Come on Janet, you were the one that a couple of CD's ago told us that we have to think about the children as they are our future. Not to mention on this same CD giving thanks to God. Go join NWA or do a duet with Eminem, but don't appeal to the masses if you have a conscience. OK, I'll get off my soapbox now!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland Bland Bland","review":"So compeltely dissapointed in this album and Janet's work lately that I don't even know what to write. I became a fan with Rhythm Nation and was completely in love with her work when I got \\"Janet\\" with its beautiful combination of melodies, funk and rhythms. But this one sounds like she's trying to get young and fresh too hard. The lyrics sound so silly at times that you have to double check the linear notes to see if she really wrote them. Aside from \\"Doesn't Really Matter\\", \\"Son of a Gun\\" and \\"When we Ooh\\" everything else is very forgetable.Let's hope she's a little more inspired next time."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE THIS SINGLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This Single is the best single I' ve ever heard.

I just wanna say that J.J.'s CD is the best! There are so many new cool songs on the CD and I just love them all! The only bad thing is that there are 2 \\"nasty\\" songs on the CD. They are #8: Ooh, Baby and #9: Would You Mind! Other than that I would recommend the CD to anybody that likes Janet and often listens to her music and pop music. I got it the first day it came out in stores (April 24th) and I still listen to it everyday! It is my favorite CD of all time! There is something for everyone on the CD and I think that anyone who buys it will love it! I love Janet Jackson and I really want to go to her concert! I would also love to meet her too! She is such an inspiration to me and I love her and her music!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A FEW GOOD SONGS ON A LESS THAN MEMORABLE ALBUM","review":"I LISTENED TO JANET'S NEW ALBUM \\"ALL FOR YOU\\" IN A FRIEND'S CAR AND I MUST SAY I WAS PRETTY SUPRISED AND DISSAPOINTED.

She keeps getting better and better with her music and her introspective material. She says that she writes abaout what is happening in her life at the time...and I think that she is having on heck of a good time. She deserves it. The record is full of get-up and dance tracks...slow smokey grooves and some humorus interludes. All the essential elements to a great Janet record. Her preformances are stellar and she deserves all the accolades and praises that she gets. Put this one in the player and jam...you wont be sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"All For Me","review":"As a pop artist you either change with the times or you are so on the next VH1 \\"Where are they now?\\" It must be hard to make each album better than the last one. Janet Jackson has delivered great pop songs since the 80's and makes no exception with her latest album. The majority of the album is pure Janet - fun, energetic, and danceable. However,there are a few songs we can do without. Son of a Gun w/Carly Simon, simply put, just does not work. Sampling the song would have sufficed but having Carly rapping is just plain wrong. Overall, if you are a long-term Janet fan like me, you will dig her latest effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"JANET DOES IT AGAIN!","review":"Janet Jackson is a woman of many facets, singer, songwriter, and poet, and with her new CD All For You(the fans) she has done it again. This CD is over an hour long, and in todays day and age with 45 minute cds that is hard to find. EVERY song on this cd revelas a part of Janet not seen by others. She has the ability to convey her deapest emotions with every lyric. Like the song 'You Aint Right' which is dedicated to a best frined who threw their friendship away, anyone who ever lost a friend can relate to that. I am a Janet Jackson hardcare fan and find her music to be absolutley fantastic, but even if you are not you will lover her new creation, All For You."},{"rating":"2","title":"when she ooo's","review":"Emerging from _The Velvet Rope_ comes the lighter, optimisitic _All For You_, an album perfect for the summer. This time around, Janet pares down on the interludes and emphasizes music that is sensual reflecting a freedom explored in her albums since _Control_, but doesn't really come into playful fruition until this album. _Janet_ reflects initial sexual freedom. _The Velvet Rope_ comes in with its darker, layered sound of sex and love and their inherent contradictions. _All For You_ is a sensuality that is voracious and sassy. Highlights: \\"You Ain't Right\\", \\"All For You\\", \\"Truth\\", \\"When We Ooo.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"yawn!","review":"Janet's Album will sell. Not because it is good, but because Janet is a star and has top level producers. I listened to this cd more than once, but I have yet to find something that makes me want to say it's worth its money. I find it boring and flat. Whatever happened to the Janet I used to love? This CD sounds like she's biting off of her own copies and is lacking of the unique sounds she used to get folks with. I find this CD absolutely disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"All The Best!","review":"This album rocks!You've heard the singles All For You, Someone to Call My Lover, Son of a Gun and Doesn't Really Matter. If you love those jams, you will LOVE this CD.....I promise!The other stand out tracks are:Truth: A slow song about Janet revealing herself to her ex, Rene. It carries a sample of another tune, I forget, but it's really mellow and awesome. It kinda sounds like the \\"Together Again\\" slow version remix.Come on Get Up: Groovey dance number! This song will get you in the dance mood. Nice bongo beats too ;)So buy it or download it today ASAP!"},{"rating":"1","title":"boring!!!","review":"I have loved Janet's past albums, but this one was just BORING!!!.

This CD is nothing like her previous albums but that's not why I'm so dissapointed in this release. I love how Janet has made each album of hers sound different from each other but this latest outing is a poor excuse for trying to appeal to the MTV TRL crowd. Songs like \\"All For You\\" and \\"Someone To Call My Lover\\" are just bleh! Commercial! Don't get me started on the lame middle of this album. Terrible! What was she thinking when she made this? Leave this CD alone. Janet is almost sure to do better on her next project whenever that comes out. Avoid this CD. Get the Control, Rhythm Nation 1814, Janet, and Velvet Rope. Pick up the Design Of A Decade CD as well. Leave AFY to collect dust on the shelves. A complete dissapointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Online album version missing definitive song","review":"What is the point buying the album online when the definitive song on the album \\"Would You Mind\\" (normally track 9) is missing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I am very pleased...","review":"First off I wanted Son Of a Gun remixes. But I didn't want to spend (the mondy) for a cd single.

So instead this DVD package came out (...). Well hey, I get the SoaG remixes along with a collection of videos on DVD...you can't go wrong if you're a Janet fan.I am very pleased that I spent the money on what I did. Granted it is the clean version but that's cool. She cannot please everyone. Her and Virgin are blasted first because she used profanity and now by fans because she and Virgin took them out for this collection!!For anyone who is a music lover, a DVD buyer and a definite Janet Jackson fan (or even Jacksons)...I recommend it.::please note that the videos doesn't include the A&M; videos...for that try Design of a Decade on DVD-which was released not to long ago)"},{"rating":"1","title":"janet's good, but this isnt that great!","review":"so u expect some good pure Rnb', with a twist of janet?but this!...its pretty bad..well for the standards she set herself. the only good songs are all 4 you,son of a gun, cmon get up, better days,someone to call my lover and doesnt really matter....the rest?...all sex songs....they tend to get boring after you hear them a few times....this is definatly not her best work. im wainting on her next to be better."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's kind of boring...","review":"I must admit I liked \\"All 4 U\\" the song, but I got bored with the rest of the songs. There was no need for those lame interludes, it made the album draaaaaaaaggg. Since I found the title song fun and lively, I was expecting the album to be the same, but unfortunately it wasn't. Why curse and simulate sexual situations? Didn't Madonna do that already in the early 90's, and has moved on since then? I would advice Janet to do the same. By the way, where's the parental advisory label? There are teens and even pre-teens listening to this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"You've got this!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I totally love this cd I am a new fan of Janet's this is the first cd I have gotten of her cd's.Now I can't wait to hear all of her other cd's I know that they are rated PG compaired to this.But this was a great step hopefully this will lead to many more and great cd's like this.I love this it is the best cd of this year so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"ALL FOR YOU - SINGLE","review":"A brilliant single that's really a great dance track and with all the 5 dance mixes...it's just great great!

I got the Janet cd early because a store in my neighborhood started selling it early. It's a good cd, somewhere between 93's Janet and 97's velvet rope. My problem with the velvet rope was that it followed the same formula as janet. Almost every song on the VR had a similar song on janet. Got till it's gone = That's the way love goes, I get so lonely = anytime anyplace and so on. Not so with this album. It goes it's own route and comes off nicely. I don't really care for the first song, i don't know why, maybe it will grow on me, but it gets better from there. I like every track from 3 to 11. I haven't really listened to the rest of it yet cause I want to take my time and enjoy it. I think their using some knew production techniques cause the cd gives my stereo a sound I didn't know it possessed. Anyway. It's janet. If you are a janet fan, you are going to like it. so when it comes out on the 24th, go buy it. Got it? Good. Peace."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just another BUBBLE-GUM offering by Miss J!","review":"C'mon fellas, lets face it, the last single she had, taken off the soundtrack was way better than this piece of crappy bubble-gum jam.

The worst is \\"WOuld yOU mInd\\" which is just a pile of aural manure. The moaning and groaning is gross and classless.I am a big fan of Janet but I really did not like this album at all.

The title track is suitable for young children. WOULD YOU MIND is a sexual moment between two young women. BETTER DAYS sounds like a Carpenters recording because of the background vocals. I bought this album because I like the hit song SOMEONE TO CALL MY LOVER,which contains samples of America's VENTURA HIGHWAY. There's another song containing samples of Carly Simon's YOU'RE SO VAIN. Carly's spoken voice is heard in that song. She says \\"Janet and me,we have clouds\\". The title track has a late 70's/early 80's urban sound in it. This album contains quite a few short interludes. This album does contain some profane words. That's why the front cover bears the words \\"PARENTAL ADVISORY-EXPLICIT CONTENT\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"can i rate this book zero stars?","review":"Supposedly a book about fire-wise design, the poorly photographed, horrible examples of cruddy architecture and landscape presented in this overpriced promotional document do little to educate and would probably best be used as kindling.

It does squat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gelatin inside","review":"First of all I didn't like that the capsules are made out of gelatin so the product is not vegetarian.

If you take this product immediately, then it will eliminate the cold in seven days! If you wait five days to take the echinacea, it reduces the time of effect to just two days!!

What makes this book such a delight to read is the cast of characters--a bunch of academics. Specifically, a group of high-level linguistic researchers studying language development in children. Indeed, these characters are paid to conduct research--they don't even teach graduate students, let alone undergrads, so you know that their every thought is consumed by language-related theory. To add an extra level of strangeness, the research center has its own day care unit so that the researchers can have a ready supply of subjects (I wonder about the ethics of that).The plot is fairly slow, but cozy readers will probably not be bothered by that.

The only thing I see other reviewers expressing disapointment about is \\"it's slow pace\\". This is not a Hollywood film, which is based on the philosophy that if more than 30 seconds passes without something \\"happening\\", it is already boring. The only problem with that philosophy is usually the directors find themselves doing something, anything, every 30 seconds until 2 hours of really nothing has passed you by. This film does not make that mistake. Some westerners are upset by this.What some call \\"slow pace\\", I call \\"sub-text\\". What some call \\"low-key\\", I call \\"brilliantly humble\\".

There are repeated periods of protracted landscape shots that add nothing to the movie. This would have been a much better film had it been half as long as it was.

You can also to pretend how deep instead of how shallow you might be by appreciating or by not knowing how to appreciate this film. Knowing any marriage with a wife or husband so annoyingly blabbings all the time? Or sitting in a classroom trying very hard to listen to a lousy professor to blahblahblah?

It would be very good if it didn't give a large number of false signals.

At night the people across the street use a high powered RF security system, and while this system is activated the driveway monitor alarm sounds every couple of minutes. Every time an SUV or service truck using high powered RF equipment passes the alarm is triggered. I am concerned that other driveway monitors that work on a metal detecting basis will have the same problem.

If only someone other than Carmen Electra had played the lead female role! Mackenzie Astin, other reviewers to the contrary, was just right as the testosterone-driven male lead. Carmen Electra looked too old and worn for her part. Nonetheless, this is a good deal better than a great many Hollywood comedies of more recent vintage. Though the idea is an almost obvious one, it comes to life because of the clever script. It IS better than most of Woody Allen. Thank goodness no one had the poor judgment to cast Jim Carrey in the male lead. Astin's character has to be played, as he does it, naively and innocently jn order for the movie not to seem overly contrived.

It appears that this work of John Ankerberg is very subjective in order to appeal to the emotions of his \\"audience\\". If we try to judge the book based on the current scientific standards, this book falls short of that. Serious writers on a subject should not allow their sentiments and personal biases to creep into their writings, especially if they are writing about a faith which they themselves do not believe in. There is no place for such things as \\"intellectual dishonesty\\" in the scientific world. In addition, this book is filled with \\"out of context\\" information about Islam.

Panasonic knows they have created a faulty lamp and extended the warranty on the lamp to 18 mths (usually 12 mth). Conveniently enough for Panasonic my lamp went out after 20 mths. So, no warranty. And now I have to pay $300 for my $2500 TV, which I'm told (by a Panaosonic rep) I can expect to do every 18 mths for this TV. This is not the first issue we've had with poor Panasonic products.

The tech. at the repair center knew immediately the problem (and also had two other Panasonic LCD sets in for the same type of repair). Subsequent calls to Panasonic technical support resulted in long waits on hold (25, 26 and 47 minutes respectively).I have no complaints about the quality of the picture, but I am concerned about the lack of tech. support and the fact that Panasonic appears to be ignoring a known problem with reliability."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad bulbs, bad power supplies!","review":"The TV is cool looking and I've loved it except for the following complaints:1.

Even zooming to have the full comic fill the screen in landscape mode is enough to notice the image compression.

Still, the overwhelming quantity of sightings listed simply proves that a lot of people have seen a lot of unusual things. But the book doesn't offer any new definitive evidence.

In order to do this, you need a IR/RF converter, I looked an many products and hesitantly settled on this one. I was concerned it would be too difficult to program. I was pleasantly surprised that I was able to program my DVD, DirecTV and TV in one night with very little reading of the manual. The IF blaster does not need to be pointed at the components either, mine sits on top of my DirecTV box and works great with no delay. I rarely write reviews but felt a sense of obligation since I read so many reviews before I bought my DVD and sound system. I hope this is helpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Universal Remote for those who want to hide their equipment","review":"Strengths: Thanks to the RF Base Station, I can hide all my equipment behind a cabinet. There is no need for an IR sensor. Excellent user interface. Can handle many components, and has good ergonomics.Weaknesses: Very difficult to program. The owners manual poorly written leaving out important detail that I had to call manufacturer to obtain.Summary: After many hours of trying to program the remote, and figuring out the Universal Remote Controls programming protocol, I can see great potential in this device and would buy another. This is a device for someone computer/gadget savvy.

Analyzing it further, this cable does not have a solid copper core, just two strands of hair-thin stranded copper wire.

All i have in line with my tv is surge protector/battery backup unit the rest is direct to cable provider. Well i introduced the PXT1102 into the system and my HD channels were no longer detected, Picture quality went down, pretty much a failure. Simply put the cable does not have the bandwidth to support hd tv. Do not buy this outdated cable if you intend to pass Digital channels through it, it will not function.

I also have one that is 310fps, which is above the limit on the bottle (says not to use at more than 285fps). I fired them from all distances at a brick wall, even at point blank range these pieces of junk didn't break, they bounced. All I can say is if you want paintballs these are NOT the ones to buy.

Sometimes a small flashlight is not enough. Especially if youbreak down and have to walk somewhere. Yes, the flashlight is heavy but remember there arethree D size batteries in it. Any flashlight with that many batteries will be heavy. It definitely servesthe purpose I intended. I tested it out in the state park where I live, and it is very dark back there.It lit up the woods they way I wanted it too, especially if my children break down at night.It does not however, have a spare bulb.

I also like the optional feature of not having to click it on but just pressing/holding the button for light if you just need a quick beam.One minor complaint I have it that it's pretty heavy, and is very long--it doesn't fit in my cabinets upright. My biggest gripe is that there is a huge dark spot on the beam when you rotate the head into floodlight mode. This is apparently common and normal with this light, but I think it's a design flaw--it's very annoying. Also, instructions were vague on how to open the end cap and replace the bulb. I wanted to open the top so I could dust off the inside of the lens cover, but even though the diagram shows this should unscrew, I couldn't get it open and didn't want to force it. I guess I'll wait until I really need to open it to replace the bulb, and then I'll try to figure it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great going.","review":"This is a great product and delivers good light consistently.

Unless you send it to Mag Light and pay them $25.00 plus shipping to get the batteries out, you can toss the light in the garbage. NOTHING will get the batteries out, NOTHING. I was using top line batteries. Ridiculous design, batteries always swell over time due to the chemical reaction. Get one, and sometime down the road, it will do the same thing. Battery warranties cover leakage, not MINOR swelling, so that won't help.You are warned.My opinion, waste of money. Fancy, good looking, and well made junk, due to the battery tube tolerances.

Since I'm an active guy who loves cool stuff, I know the value of this $25 light beats those cheap junk ones. I bought this one for her so she'll be safer. With LED, the batteries last so long, she'll be able to see whenever she needs it. If she drops it, it will still work. AND the light is powerful white, so it will likely save her an accidental fall or two. What a simple way to lessen risk for an elderly parent on a budget.

Now I can clearly see the raccoon on the bird feeder at night! He doesn't like the bright light! If you have a home intruder, just shine this baby in his eyes and he will be effectively blinded.

But it looks like it's back in print, and they'll never be able to get rid of the legacy...the kicker is, the album cover came out I think before _Vampire: The Whatever_ roleplaying books did, and the cover of this album and the cover of the Vampire book look *remarkably* similar...hmmm!

The only problem I had with the charactors of Prue, Ag and Stella was that their relationships with one another were a little too easy and pat.

These three young women, enlistees in the Women's Land Army in World War II England, leave their comfortable homes to plough fields, herd sheep, and milk cows on a remote farm in the English countryside.

I am assuming they are accurate, although I have no way of knowing.

The long-suffering wife, the over-sexed lower class girl, the unattractive scholarly girl and the lovelorn dreamy girl, not to mention the hardworking farmer and his brooding, handsome son, are all the stuff of romance novels. I never felt close to the girls, believed in their friendship or really cared what happened to them. I got really tired of and repelled by the over-sexed girl's exploits, and the others' whining.So why did I finish the book? Well, I bought it instead of taking it out of the library, my usual book venue. There was some tension about which girl would get her man. But the ending!! Who could believe that?

He is sleeping with his childhood sweetheart whom he cannot marry or she will lose her children. Sounds reasonable, so why not stay with her if they're in love? I'd have preferred a story where they get together and are happy in the end, instead of him going off and \\"falling in lover\\" with some other woman who treats him badly.

It has none of the almost \\"mystic\\" yet dynamic feel of the \\"Tales...\\" album, and lacks any superb tracks such as the ones found on \\"I Robot\\". Furthermore, it seems that the APP here tries to get kinda Beatle-esque but failing to a great extent. I hope that this is not what the Beatles would have degenerated to had they continued recording into the 70s! The music sounds too pseudo-romantic and more appropriate for teenage girls of the late 70s to early 80s. The only tracks worth anything here are \\"In the lap of the Gods\\" and the album opener \\"Voyager\\". The rest are musically (but not lyrically) boring filler material and can be easily thrown away in a trash basket.

He is the consummate musician, contractor, producer, composer, engineer - I mean, what can't the man do? He's worked with The Beatles, and there's a select few that can say that.As for Pyramid, it could be loosely considered a concept album, but not nearly as much as Tales of Mystery & Imagination. It's just another brilliant, slightly different, offering from a brilliant, slightly different, artist. For some reason, this album has been hard to find for a long time, so when I saw it on Amazon for a reasonable price, I snapped it up. Probably should have bought ten of them, as I recommend you do.

IMO, Headhunter started it all and the band peaked in 1984 with the Blitz. Long before the hair bands adorned MTV's Headbanger's Ball, these guys pumped out an album that had 9 driving, well-produced, catchy tunes. Vocals flow lock-step with the rhythm, and Fernando's lead guitar and Jeff's percussion are stellar and some of the most underrated of their era. Storace's vocals appear to many as AC/DC wanna-be, though the total Krokus package is beyond comparison.

The coolest thing about this CD is the 30's-gangster- lounge room-smokey pool joint feel it has.

The result is a somewhat more laidback sound than the others (if that's possible), ie perfect summer music. If I had to name a stand out track, I'd have to say 'You don't Know I', or '....'.

In late 1976 and then in 1977 when this album came out.He is a fantastic performer and even 30 years ago he was funny and charmming. Back then, when this was recorded he was at the height of his career. There weren't that many radio stations not playing him.This album originally released on vinal as a two record set is one CD. They deleated a few songs from the orginal to fit everything on one CD, but it does captaure who he is.The VSM is on this album. The Very Special Medley. This is the comercial jingles he was noted for - or rather not noteds for but made him his bread and butter. (KFC, Stae Farm and more.) This is a good CD to have!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"I remember when I was a kid in the 70's running around listening to this album, brings back great memories.

I am glad I was able to get this album on CD at all, but I miss the things I used to listen to when I had the audiotape.

I loved the album very much and wore out my copy, so I was psyched to see that this came out on CD. I immediately bought it not even thinking that it wouldn't contain everything the LPs did. That is why I titled this review \\"Incomplete - Disappointing\\". Don't get me wrong, though, if you have never heard the LPs, then you won't be disappointed. This is a great recording, just wish it was the same as the LPs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic - Classic","review":"This is not a \\"collection of songs\\" with some \\"pretty cheesy songs\\" as one reviewer simple mindedly put it. This is a recording of a Barry 'live' in concernt when he was in his prime back in the 70's. You not only get a full compliment of his greatest hits at the time this was recorded, but you also get several other songs that, although were not \\"hits\\", they are examples of the entertaining flare of Barry in concernt. You get a sense of the fun that that this master showman brings to his audience. This is simply a vintage recording of one of our countries greatest performers at the peak of his talents.

Purchased a similar pair for myself, recently and was pleased with quality, but this pair had problems. Had to reorder TWICE (thank you Amazon!), but FINALLY got an acceptable pair, just in time. I disagree with the I1-I2 rating these have. I have purchased diamonds before and knew these were not \\"top quality\\", but the ones I received seemed far below any I1-I2 rated diamonds I've bought in the past. It seemed to always be a problem with one earring. Perhaps, Amazon could make sure these were better matched, as a pair. Also, these had noticeable scratches and divots on the face or table, which is the most visible part on a solitaire diamond. $100 is a lot of money for lesser quality diamonds.

Gripe 1: The side with 6 pictures takes six minutes to print. Gripe 2: The black ink was half used after 40 pages! (This poor speed and ink performance is nowhere close to the specs Lexmark provides.) Gripe 3: The worse thing is that just like with my old Lexmark, the feed mechanism grabs unevenly, and the paper gets jammed. Or it doesn't grab at all.

The acting is terrible, and the movie spends an inordinate amount of time on Hanseen's alleged sexual perversion.

But do yourself a favor and find out what the Alan Parsons Project was all about. To do that you need to forget greatest hits albums. Instead, listen to complete albums and find out how masterful APP was at the concept album. I'd recommend the following albums for new APP fans:1) Tales of Mystery and Imagination 2) Turn of a Friendly Card 3) I Robot 4) Eye in the Sky 5) Ammonia Avenue (less concept, but great music)These are all WELL worth their cost. Give it a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great music","review":"Alan Parsons had already established himself as an impressive producer with the Beatles and Pink Floyd. Starting his own band was a wise move. This album marks the best of Alan Parsons' music during the early dyas in the late seventies and early eighties. The music carries resonations of Pink Floyd influences, but overall has a distinct style that can only be attributed to Parsons. Overall, this is possibly the best collection of APP's music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Second listen was a surprise","review":"Years ago I found this tape in my dad's collection and I thought that the name sounded cool, so I decided to listen to it. At the time, I had no idea that Alan Parson was a producer of my favorite band, Pink Floyd. I couldn't really get into the tape much, it was much too advanced (melodic) for my preteen tastes. Fast forward 9 years... and, after getting into Supertramp and other 70's \\"pop,\\" I listened to this tape again and the production blew me away (obviously.) I could now see the (loose) correlation with Pink Floyd. Most notably on Time, which at times reminds me of a Roger Waters tune, (and not because of the title.) I like the nature of APP's songs, they have a soothing and relaxing pace which make this album a pleasure to relax to. I also dig the funky, almost disco-like beats in a few of the songs. I can't comment on if this is a good compilation or not, but it IS a good stand-alone album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"interesting","review":"love this book...great details of the members of charlie company...before/during/and after the vietnam war...great read and i highly recommend it"},{"rating":"1","title":"It doesnt smells at all","review":"This perfumes doesnt smells anything...i am so disappointed with this one.

I have a new appreciation for the true heroes of our day, the men and women of our military, especially the heroes who lose limbs in the line of duty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blood Brothers:Among the Soldiers of Ward 57","review":"What Michael Weisskopf has done with this story is truly amazing. It was a very emotional book for me, but it is a book that every American should read.I plan on passing this book around. It is a book that you cannot put down.You just want to cheer these guys on, cry with them, and you feel their frustrations. I would love to meet Michael and the men that he writes about to thank them personally for their sacrifices.I am a Troop Greeter from Maine where most of the flights that are going over and comming home stop for re-fueling.We are soon to have welcomed 500,000 troops. I often wonder how many that I have met that will not be returning home or have been injured. I say a prayer for them after every flight and pray that they will be comming back through our halls.I can't thank Michael Weisskopf enough for writing this book.

The belly itself is a large pouch that you can stuff with whatever you like to adjust the size of Santa's \\"bowl full of jelly\\". The only design flaw I found was that the pouch has no closure at the top, so the stuffing can migrate upwards - making you look a little more like Mrs. Claus than St. Nick.

Barnum was Right","review":"Its pretty telling when the biggest amount of interest in an artist is over his back story and not his music but in the case of Jobriath it is hardly surprising.The story has been amply recounted here and perhaps added to his blip of a footnote in rock history is that the two albums he made in his career both sold fewer copies than either The Velvet Underground which actually was highly influential despite their lack of commercial success and The Shaggs who were horrific and dreadful but at least had an honesty to them. Jobriath had neither of these elements as he was simply reacting to what Bowie was doing and represented an attempt to cash in by his record company that was anything but sincere. The music here is simply an odd cross of Bowie, Jagger, Tiny Tim with a bit of Liza Manelli thrown in for camp appeal.

The day after I bought it I ran out and bought \\"Tales of Mystery and imagination\\" too. Science fiction and Fantasy seem to go hand in hand with bands of a Progresive nature. I soon discovered that Alan Parsons was a Recording engineer at EMI's Abbey Road Studios, and did some work on the Beatle's Final album \\"Abbey Road\\". While in no way does he sound anything like the Beatles, it is clear that those influences are at work here. I give Alan Parsons credit for making one of the best progressive rock LP's of all time. What is sad is that is later releases would be just so much FM Radio Pop Fluff.

I'm probably going to go after all the other APP cds now. This was the god (thats God with a little g ) of studio groups in the late 70's to the 80's.

When I bought the CD in the 80s I was appalled to here that at the beginning of the first track \\"I Robot\\", just as it reaches a crescendo, the right and then left channel start to crack up and become distorted for a few seconds. I later listened to a vinyl record repressed in the 1980s. The distortion is there as well.Those that have never heard the original release from 1977 may not even realize that this distortion is actually a damaged master tape and is not what was intended. It's a shame that Alan Parsons has not (yet) taken it upon himself to re-record this track and correct the problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"First Parsons release for the masses is excellent.","review":"This was actually Parsons' second release, following his unique and wonderful \\"Tales of Mystery and Imagination\\", but the first to appeal to the mainstream. Of all his creations, this one probably resembles \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" the most. The instrumentals are masterful (beautifully enhanced by Andrew Powell and the Philharmonia Chorus), with the title track providing the model for many future gems and the ending two tracks (\\"Total Eclipse\\" and \\"Genesis\\"), providing a riveting plunge into despair and escape to joy. The songs are solid, with the touching \\"Day After Day\\" and the eerie \\"Some Other Place\\" being the standouts. On the downside, \\"The Voice\\" evokes a drug-fogged visit to a disco, something sorely out of place on this otherwise masterful creation. (I would actually give this four and a half stars, if possible.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just the most familiar, but the best","review":"The definitive Alan Parsons Project album, and also one of the most popular and enduring sources of television and radio background cues *ever*. Even if you have no idea who or what Alan Parsons Project is, you've heard snippets of this album. The album's use of echo for rhythmic counterpoint is artful, archetypal, and endlessly imitated. (It's hard for me to tell whether David Gilmour of Pink Floyd picked up his habit of playing against the echo from Alan Parsons in the DSOTM days, or Parsons picked the technique up from him. Probably a little of both.) The continuous rhythms of the instrumentals with their slowly transforming ostinato harmonies and atmospheric melodies foreshadow the electronic instrumentals of the late 1970s (Midnight Express) but even more significantly, help lay the foundation for a whole genre of dance electronica coming later in the 1980s and 90s.

Poorly constructed narrative that wandered this way and that often as not without reaching any point at all. Insights that were so obvious I didn't feel they merited the term.

That personal story was barely present in this book and what was there was a jumbled mess. A weird stream of consciousness that will confuse you even if you're well-versed on recent Iraqi history. Did McAllester write this book, or did he just give his assembled notes to some editorial assistant who tried to write a story around them? I wanted to know more about his relationships with the other journalists, with his girlfriend, with his family. The attempt at political analysis is so clearly off-base I can't believe that even the author believes it. I don't get the disparity between the moving talk I heard and the boring mess that this book is. And I recommend that others don't get it at all.

Could it that our transalantic cousins simply prefer this writing or could it that be his friends and family are trying to sway us into wanting to buy this book? Who knows. Fact is, it's a waste of time. Dull, obvious observations transposed with compelling personal fact. But ultimately has nothing to teach us from a conflict that badly needs to do so. I worked for several months in Iraq in the post war period and the Iraq I saw is not that that Matthew McAllester constructed around himself. I don't know where he was but I was in Iraq. Maybe he should have stayed longer. I worked in Kosovo and thought his book of that war fabulous. Maybe why this one is so disappointing. Or maybe it was too soon. Either way, as ever day goes by, his thesis proves more wrong by the day."},{"rating":"1","title":"a mixed bag","review":"this book was a way mixed bag but not meriting some of the praise or the criticism given on this sight. this author does emotions superbly; analysis not so well. perhaps he should have decided earlier what which he wanted this book to be about."},{"rating":"1","title":"a wasted opportunity","review":"I was looking forward immensely to this book, having read much of the author's travails in the press. i was disappointed then to find he had much to tell of his own hopes and fears and far too few of the iraqi people's. the title of the book promises an inside into the trauma of a people imprisoned for decades and then released. we learn too little of their release, their \\"blinding in the sunlight.\\" this book promises much but reads like a rush job. a more thoughtful exploration might have served better to reflect the suffering of the ordinary people and what must have been and still must be an epic battle to free themselves of the warped psychology of saddam's era. i hope another account, yet to be written, will serve as a better testament to history and human spirit, not just an author's ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was expecting more insight and intelligence","review":"I think that if you are looking for someone to justify the Iraq campaign now that the WMDs are known to not exist this is the book for you. In describing the life Iraqis led under Saddam's rule the author tries to convey that Iraq's future is more promising now than it would have been if Saddam were still in power. I did not find the author's reasoning to be convincing but maybe that is because this book was not well edited. I am not sure if Mr. McAllester really understands what is going on in Iraq or if the jumbled and at times contradictory analysis is due to poor editing. I think I would have preferred if he had concentrated on presenting his own rather incredible story about being a prisoner for eight days in Abu Ghraib prison in Baghdad. As it is this book is neither fish nor fowl and I did not find it to be satisfying reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Of interst only to the author's friends and family","review":"Journalists often give political analyses of situations they have reported on, and all too often reach facile and laughably naive conclusions. Such is the case with this book. The author might have given us an interesting read if he had stuck to what he is qualified to comment on: himself and his experiences as a journalist. Whether out of false modesty or an inflated sense of his grasp of the situation in Iraq, he chose to weave his personal story around the much larger, vastly more complicated, and more important story of what is happening to the Iraqi people. His conclusions about whether the Iraq invasion was warranted are unsupported, and blatantly self-serving. It can't be a coincidence that a young man who received a large advance to write a book about his experiences during the invasion of Iraq sees the campaign as necessary and ultimately for the best. It certainly was for him!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A CURRENT RUNDOWN OF EVENTS IN IRAQ","review":"A news reporter (the author) for Newsday was in Baghdad sending in his reports as to the conditions in the city just prior, during, and after the 2003 war.

It absorbs way more than my old t-shirt that I was using and although these towels aren't large perse, it does do the job of at least absorbing a lot of water. Being a curly girl, this towel is just what I needed. So okay, yeah you can get a \\"sham-wow\\" towel for about the same price at your local Wal-Mart or CVS, but why? Why use something that's not meant for your hair? I'm just a bit biased. I like the towel and for me it has reduced my diffuser time down.

I might try to return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't reduce my blowdrying time","review":"I bought this because it was advertised as reducing blowdrying time. Turns out to be one of those \\"if it sounds too good to be true then it probably is\\" products. I have shoulder-length hair that is naturally wavy and takes about 15 minutes to blowdry straight after using a regular towel. I used the Mimi's towel and the blowdrying time was (drumroll, please...)15 minutes! So it didn't work for me. On the positive side, it is very lightweight, so I could see how it would be useful if you typically make a turban out of your towel and walk around with it on your head. In that case, it would be much lighter and more comfortable than a regular towel."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible chemical smell","review":"I just received this Mimi's Diva Dryer by Aquis Microfiber Hair Towel.

I am very pleased that they were presented with no cuts or editing. These are works of art and should be respected as such. Scott Bradley's music is wonderful, and the animation is outstanding. I would love to see these cartoons on Blu ray at some point. I would also like to see more Tex Avery cartoons.

While other companies are making tea bags that don't soak up water, ones that drain more easily, and otherwise, Kusmi still has these tea bags that suck up water and drip everywhere. You cannot leave your bag in the cup, as the water will seep up the rope and drip all over whatever the tea is on. It is very, very annoying.Otherwise, though, Anastasia is the best of Kusmi's tea. And they make amazingly high quality, great-tasting tea. I am a huge tea snob and I balk at paying so much for a box of tea, but it is worth it, as it is really fantastic, taste-wise.

However, it is basically a Wicca 101 book. As a Christian, I was hoping it would provide more spiritual insight about the dark world of wicca. Instead, you are provided with a history/wiccan belief system. Look in the glossary and learn about terms from their beliefs. A young Christian reading this book I do not think would have any reason to avoid wicca other than, \\"the Bible says.\\" YES that is a very good reason, but God makes sense, He has good reasons. Russo, I believe understands very little about the spiritual battle going on in the world. This is a purely intellectual look into a spiritual battle. We wrestle not against flesh and blood."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Fight","review":"Live and Let Live!

If you're worried about your children, Wicca or other flavors of paganism are not going to be what puts them over the edge...any edge.If you're a Christian: Stop flogging a legitimate belief system.

Instead of doing any real search about how Wicca is NOT any form of \\"devil worship\\" (Witches do not even believe in 'the devil' or 'satan'!), Russo sticks to his Christian-dogmatic viewpoints to skew the truth and once again, add to the hatred and misunderstandings directed at Witches today in the world.If I could give this book 0 stars, I would."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst sounding book EVER","review":"I read about both of his books and will safely say this guy has his head so far up his butt its back out his own mouth it puts a BIG target on our already strenuous relationship, and its people like him that started the burning times"},{"rating":"1","title":"A terribly biased look at a beautiful earth based religion","review":"Obviously the author didn't do any direct research into Wicca, or he would have found out right away that true witches do not do dark magic, as they believe in the law of threefold, and that everything one does comes right back to the person doing it. Kind of like what Jesus said about DO UNTO OTHERS. This is clearly a biased right wing Christian author who wants to turn people away from a spiritual tradition that is far less violent than modern Christianity, and that is taking people away from traditional religions in droves because it is a beautiful, earth based tradition that honors women, children and all living things - something Christianity DOES NOT."},{"rating":"1","title":"pathetically researched","review":"This book is basically a rehashing of every objection that Christians have ever come up with about Wicca...As for the claim that is was well researched?

As an agnostic, my interest in ancient and current religions and belief trends never leaves me without something to read. Having researched Wicca and Neo-paganism myself - extensively along with other religions, I can honestly say without a doubt that this man did absolutely NO RESEARCH whatsoever on Wicca. None. Christians and Muslims alike are very quick to cry foul when their religious beliefs are doubted or questioned yet in turn are the first to belittle beliefs different from their own. My advice to anyone christian or otherwise, before you spout off at the mouth - do extensive research on your subject before professing knowledge on it. That does mean reading more than 4 or 5 books on the subject. WHAT A CONCEPT!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Four Words...","review":"Focus on the Family.

That being said, the Dead did release some great studio titles (Workingman's, American Beauty, Mars Hotel). This, however, is not one of them. In fact, I would say this is the nadir of 1970s era Dead, a period generally acknowledged as their most prolific and accomplished. While some of the material is strong (\\"Shakedown\\", \\"Fire\\"), most of the rest is just plain awful. The execution is competent, but annoyingly garnished with a \\"disco\\" sheen that is enough to make you either laugh or cringe.

Don't bother unless this is the last GD album to complete your collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the CD for the start of your Dead Collection !","review":"I bought this CD after hearing classic Dead songs, such as Uncle John's Band and Friend of the Devil. This sounded NOTHING like those songs. It starts out innocently enough; Good Lovin' is a decent upbeat track. With the exception of Fire on the Mountain, it goes downhill from there. The vocals become invading and annoying, switching lead vocals often (who the heck is that chick on from the heart of me??). At times this record is too easy listening, at other times it's too arena rock. It finishes with the weak \\"If I had my love to give\\", which sounds like a B-side Paul McCartney top 40 ballad. Leave this album on the shelf, or better yet, don't buy it at all!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Damn Good","review":"Boy, some Dead Heads are a picky bunch. This CD is very solid from start to finish.

Never before have I been inspired by a book in the way The Good News About Injustice has inspired me.It exposes the truth about what the bible says about oppression and violence against God's children, and the resounding call for God's followers to stand against the forces of corruption and oppression.

The portraits are often beautiful, but there is no explanation of how they were acheived. The captions are often ridiculous and read like a museum curator's strained attempt at reading meaning into a canvas of paint drippings.The narrative is ofen just plain silly as when Hurter speaks of image stablization lenses that have very limited application to portraiture. Statements such as \\"Most photographers agree that a pleasant, happy expression is considered more desirable than a big smile\\" aren't worth paying money for.In sum, the serious student of photographic portraiture will find nothing of value in this book.Jerry"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very useful","review":"This book did not meet my expectations. The text and pictures seemed to belong to different books. Hurter writes how a person should not be posed, but most of the images in the book break those rules!

The pictures aren't quite as lovely and artistic as the ones in this book, but Smith shows you what he means."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite disappointing","review":"This book may provide some info to the totally ignorant snapper, but any decent amateur already knows these things. Moreover many concepts are not even clearly explained, and all the photos are rarely linked to the text. The useful info could have been enclosed in 20 pages booklet!As an outstanding example of superficiality, 90% of featured photos are digital, and no consideration is due to the choice of film (while portraiture often requires medium and large format films)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watered down Supertramp","review":"This is my introduction to APP. I don't recognise anything vaguely like prog-rock or concept album. Sure, the lyrics are all about the moral degradation of society, but that does not make for a concept album and this is hardly original subject matter. And as a collection of pop songs, neither does it work. It all sounds too much like low-grade Supertramp. Shrill vocals, predictable boring pop beats, nothing at all noteworthy in the musicality of the band... only diehard fans would make apology for this. As a newcomer I find this such a poor album that I doubt whether I want to hear any more of APP. IF you want 80s pop rather get the real stuff like Thompson Twins or Yazoo. Utter disappointment all round and I would give this 0 stars if the site would allow that, meaning that I rate it so poorly that I think it should never have been recorded."},{"rating":"2","title":"I believe there's a theme there","review":"The Vulture Culture project, though lacking an obvious theme like the first 4 or 5 APP albums, does have a focus.

The album does have some gems: \\"Let's Talk About Me\\", a marvelous plea for recognition; \\"Days Are Numbers,\\" a tuneful and pensive look at the life on the road; and \\"Same Old Sun\\" an appropriate closing to the set. \\"Hawkeye\\" is the obligatory Parsons instrumental, but it is not nearly as imaginative as some of his earlier instrumentals like \\"Pipeline,\\" \\"I Robot\\" and \\"Voyager.\\" However, even a mediocre AP release is better than 90% of the junk now filling the CD racks!

His street cred is impressive.But his advice is lightweight. Much of this you've heard before. The stuff that's new - his inside secrets - he presents casually and without much detail. For instance, how do you structure a presentation as a story? He uses a careless example that barely looks like a story, then is quickly onto his next point. Very disappointing.The overall impression I have is that this book is not intended to share any of his secrets, but merely to be a 188 page brochure for his consulting services.

This books has been spotlighted in The Washington Times, The Baltimore Sun, US News & World Report and many other publications."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book.....","review":"Well written... hits all the right pointers on presentations.Would definitely recommend it for anyone wanting to brush up on his presentation skills..."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Exceptional Presenter is also an exceptional writer","review":"If only all self-help books were like this one...Informative, clear, helpful, short and to the point.In the past few months since I purchased this book I already used what I learned on numerous occasions, and to great results (read: standing ovation!).I consider myself a good presenter already, but Mr. Koegel really pointed out some issues that I'm trying to improve so I can become exceptional.In short, if you speak in public, get this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Exceptional Presenter - does what is says","review":"In my training on book reviews, I was taught to critique the work based on the claims and parameters of the author. What the author suggests the reader implement in making presentations, the author does in this book. He keeps his ideas and suggestions concise and clear. He covers all that is necessary but without extrainious information. If you follow his advice, you will get better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak Contents...","review":"Few chapters are good (non-verbal communication, understand your audience), but rest of the book does not have much to offer. I suggest reading \\"Presenting to Win: The Art of Telling Your Story\\" by Jerry Weissman."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beginners only","review":"I found the book to be valuable for a beginner but not for the more advanced speaker/presenter.

While it's true the book focuses on the basics, it is a well organized, easy-to-read text that will be immensely useful to beginners and a nice refresher to experienced presenters. Since I am somewhere between the two, I found it to be worth the read, as I continue to enhance my own skills."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recommended to anyone who makes presentations","review":"This is a great book for anyone who gives presentations or who speaks publicly. It can be used as a quick refresher for pros who just need some tweaking to improve their approach. And, it's also a good place for someone new to speaking to start and probably all they will need if they catch on fast. It's fun to read and a page turner that you can complete in a few hours. I highly recommend it to anyone who has to make presentations to small and large audiences."},{"rating":"1","title":"Raw bar?","review":"This bar was not tasty, but to me totally addictive. I just ate like 3 or 4 bars at once. I don't think that is the best idea, and I did not feel good after eating it.

Lots of synths and drum machines make this album dull and lifeless. The best thing about it is the cover art. The album's concept is how women have caused the downfall of mankind (based on the Garden of Eden parable). If you look closely, you'll see huge warts and lesions on the women's faces.

My baby boy loves Veggie Tales! When I turned this on, he paid rapt attention...until two minutes in when Larry was still doing his \\"chicken head\\" antics. Kid was bored! The concept was o-kay...but it was so bizarre. No storyline to follow. The songs were okay but the silly songs with Larry from other episodes are much better. It's tough for a small child to grasp the concept and, even though I get it, I still didn't think it was funny. Kinda lame. A rare miss for Veggie Tales. I'm going to take it back and exchange it for a better DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Veggie Tales Ever!!!","review":"I bought this DVD back when it first came out. I was a Veggie Tales fan back in high school and had to buy the latest releases. This was the one that had me stop buying them for many years. This DVD was released after Big Idea had gone bankrupt and was purchased by another company. It was obvious that there was something different about this movie. It was terrible! There is no plot, no lesson, no moral, and barely any biblical references. The only good part about this video is the song \\"My Day\\" by Junior Asparagus. It is a wonderful, innocent song that mentions God and deals with prayer. Overall, I think this movie is terrible and I'm sure they regret ever making it.I now have a two year old who loves Veggie Tales and so I am very happy that they are back on track making quality Christian entertainment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Love VeggieTales...Hate this One","review":"This was definitely the worst VeggieTales movie I've ever seen (and I've seen most of them). It wasn't like any of the other episodes/movies which would have been okay if it was enjoyable, but it was just plain weird. I couldn't watch it with my daughter as it jumped around a lot. I probably only got 1/2 way through it, but if this one had the usual VeggieTales lesson, it must have not come up until the end because everything I saw was random, disjointed, and not really funny. I never understand why people who have a great idea and a good format feel like they have to change it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sigh, I could make a video more entertaining","review":"I love VeggieTales; so I was shocked when I saw this one. Somewhat boring & very chaotic, I'd have taken it back if I could. OK, little kids will look at the TV for a while when anything is on, and esp something this \\"busy\\". However, I really think I could make a funnier home video. I like ALL the other VeggieTales including the Larry Boy cartoons! This one was just junk. :("},{"rating":"1","title":"VT \\"Concept\\" Video?","review":"They must have come up against a creative wall to put this one out. Although my 5 y.o. likes to watch it occasionally, it usually sits on the shelf. There's not really a story or plot, it's supposed to be the future of entertainment - randomly selected by computers. The jokes aren't funny, although they're not really supposed to be, there are a few cute songs, but there's no message, no plot, no point really."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing sham. Avoid if possible. Rent if you must.","review":"Short Take:If you want an engaging, secular sing-along video, look over the various videos by The Wiggles. If you're looking for the usual Biblically-based stories and songs by Big Idea, try any of the other VeggieTales videos. This video gives the impression that Big Idea is trying to go more \\"mainstream\\" and it suffers badly for the effort. If you are already a VeggieTales fan, my recommendation is to avoid this video and rent it only if you must. If this would be your introduction to the VeggieTales characters, please seriously consider one of their other videos before this one...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusion around the office at Big Idea?","review":"This DVD is so far out on left field I am not sure what to say about it.This seems to be a secular video with the Veggie Tales added for flavor. No Biblical references, no moral to the story..... nothing.Spiritually speaking, there is nothing to help nourish the mind of your child. You could get more from WB animaniacs than this video. If you have bought just about every video Big Idea has made, and just can't seem to keep yourself from buying it..... then just consider it a small financial loss and one that should be put WAY up on the shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty darn weird","review":"This is the strangest VeggieTales episode out there. There is virtually nothing that could be considered a plot, the concept is bizarre, and the whole thing comes across as being plain ol' weird. It seems like this was an excuse to showcase songs, and that the whole \\"animation\\" and \\"storyline\\" parts were afterthoughts. That this video is \\"autotainment\\" can't really be argued with, but I would really take issue with the \\"wonderful\\" part...thank goodness most VeggieTales episodes are nothing like this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Visionary content","review":"The authors of this book introduce readers to a little-known field related to education: free choice learning. It happens every day for learners of all ages, and it is an area that educators and the general public pay too little attention to. This prescient work is an excellent beginning for people who are interested in education outside the classroom, and it gives a glimpse of where education needs to go in order to succeed."},{"rating":"1","title":"How can a flood be boring?","review":"I was terribly disappointed in this book. The writing style is amateurish at best. There were considerable grammatical and spelling errors, and the author kept moving from the present to the past tense. I was offended at almost every turn, and the only reason I finished the book was to learn what I could about the Johnstown Flood. Unfortunately, I learned very little. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blast from my past","review":"I bought this for my wife (and for me, too). It's one of our favorite albums from our coffeehouse days, enjoyed endlessly on cassette during road trips.

This CD will not disappoint."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie with a wonderful message","review":"This is a heartfelt movie based on a true story.

Although I personally do not consider this their breakthrough release (US charts are not everything, I consider Quickstep and Sidekick their breakout), nor their best album (Quickstep and Sidekick), it is, perhaps, their most complete. You will most likely not find yourself skipping songs on this CD to get to your favorites. I do not give out 5s often, but this one deserves a solid 5. I, of course, recommend this as your second Thompsin Twins release, right after you purchase and enjoy Quickstep and Sidekicks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Today is the First Day of the Rest of your Life!","review":"What a wonderful inspiring book that lifts up and encourages those who feel like it might be too late to make a difference or to change their life.

Year Of The Cat matches his often historical lyrics with wonderful tunes as good an anything ever recorded. A rare match. One of the best albums/cds ever. A learning, moving, picturesque trip through the world of Al Stewart. His best work. Writing from the song \\"On The Border\\" reads - The fishing boats go out across the evening water/Smuggling guns and arms across the Spanish border/The wind whips up the waves so loud/The ghost moon sails among the clouds/Turns the rifles into silver on the border. - If you can appreciate lyrics like that you'll get a good fill in Year Of The Cat. Intellectual words, mixed with the amazing guitar playing of both Al and the great Peter White."},{"rating":"2","title":"Near perfection...","review":"There are literally no bad songs on this album.From the opening notes of \\"Lord Grenville\\" to the last strains of \\"Year of the Cat\\" this is pure listening pleasure.I loved this album as an 18 year old back in '76 and I find that I still feel the same about it at 50.

Any help????"},{"rating":"1","title":"This Cat's one stellar track","review":"Maybe it's how it evokes vivid memories of my own coming of age in 1976 but Stewarts \\"Year of the Cat\\" (the song not the record) is worth the price of the disk. It's always mezermized me, from the opening piano intro to the nylon and elctric guitar solos split in half by that high-proud sax, then and now whenever I hear it. It is quite simply, one of the most hauntingly, effortlessly flowing and perfect pieces of music I've ever heard. Track nine surly is his master opus and his finest year."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 great songs, 2 mediocre ones and a bunch of filler","review":"Al Stewart can write great songs and he can write really bad ones. Just what the heck is this Lord Grenville? A song about a loser English nobleman. I didn't know whether to give this album 2 or 3 stars, but decided on 2 because this is such a bad way to start out a CD. The two great songs are the two hits (which is unusual. Radio stations typically make hits out of the weaker material). There are two songs that have a nice social commentary (Midas Shadow and Broadway Hotel) but don't have the music to back them up. One Stage Before is an OK song, but the remainder are pointless stories with sappy melodies. For rabid Al Stewart fans, this is probably his best album. For everyone else, there are other Al Stewart albums that have a higher per centage of great songs and a lower per centage of filler."},{"rating":"2","title":"Welcome Back Al but no interview track....","review":"I bought the album at FYE today and the CD sounds better then ever! I like the Title Track as well as Lord Granville... Al is the master of the studio and This album really put Al into the American Market...I think that Al is one of the best folk rockers of the 20th century and is a master of the stories in his songs... You will find yourself getting lost in the album and listening to it over and over.I am glad that Rhino is keeping the album alive in the 21 century...I feel that Rhino should get the whole Al Stewart library... I promise that you will enjoy this CD.. I likeYear of the CatLord GranvilleIf it doesn't come Naruraly Leave itand On the BorderThis album is a great starting point for new fans to really get to know Al Stewart...

He offers us tales of smuggling on the border, Lord Grenville, yet also gives us whimsical Sand in Your shoes and If it Doesn't Come Naturally, Leave it.There is his signature Year of the Cat which is mysterious and intriquing, and with highly visual images and lines such as \\"you go strolling through the crowd like Peter Lorre contemplating a Crime..\\" But also balances this with the haunting, near sad Midas Shadow, Broadway Hotel and maybe (?) autobiographical On Stage Before.This is a feast for someone hungry for more than bebop!!One of my favourites!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Always loved this album","review":"I still have the original record of this album. However,with the change in technology, I no longer listened to it.For my last birthday, I asked my wife to get me the CD,which she did.I had forgotten how much I loved this album! Normally,I listen to one or two tracks and skip the rest, buton this CD, I listen to each one and frequently sing along.If you like ballads, and song with lyrics you can hearand appreciate, you should love this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating is Al Stewart's Year of the Cat","review":"A must have for the true music enthusiast and romantic, if you like a rock/jazz feel with compliments in form of spanish guitar, saxaphone and lyrics that are truly timeless and captivating. Unlike most British artists, Stewarts voice is unmistakingly British which adds so much intrigue and mystery to his lyrics that you feel as if you are flying while listening. \\"Year of the Cat\\", is the last and best cut, but serves as the ultimate compliment to the other masterful arrangements. \\"On the Border\\", another masterpiece is one you will most certainly find yourself playing over and over again. The remaining songs will satisfy even the most critical ear as Alan Parsons made sure in his production of this excellent addition to the \\"real music\\" lovers collection. Enough said.

(The cover also does not match the cover of the book advertised.) If you order this, be aware that you will receive only 45 activities, based on animal themes, which are not even reproducible as promised in the editorial review. Instead of a focus on math and problem solving, the kids are directed to draw animals such as a stag, a doe, a rooster, and a bull. I'm sure the math will be completely lost in the unreasonable drawing tasks. Bottom line, check the ISBN of the more comprehensive book of reproducible problem solving tasks with the same title and don't bother to order this."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent for third graders and ESL","review":"The other two reviews of this item are reviewing the preschool version.

The disc starts out with \\"Dear Mary,\\" with both Richard and son Teddy supporting on vocals and guitars. This song and the others that follow have wonderful melancholic feel similar to I Want To See The Bright Light Tonight (R & L's masterpiece).

It was terrible. None of the songs were catchy and were all slow. Also, it was filmed outside at a zoo and not in their normal, colorful sets, so it wasn't as fun to watch for my son as usual. Even though he didn't even make it through two songs, I vowed to watch the whole thing and it seemed like the longest video ever and I really enjoy the Wiggles. Spare your children and don't buy this video."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Change from the Wiggles","review":"My son (age two) really likes this video (as do I). It is nice because almost all of the songs are shot outside rather than in the studio (as in previous videos). Steve Irwin fits in perfectly with the Wiggles - he obviously loves what he does and his integration with the rest of the Wiggles crew is seamless. While some of the songs are slow, the up beat ones are the best they have ever written."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE WIGGLES ARE THE BEST !!!!!!!!","review":"I think all of the wiggles videos are the best. i can not pick just one, my daughter and i just love them. but this video is full of great music and funny funny skits with the whole gang. the children love them because the wiggles know how to interact with our children. and thats why they are loved so much by our children. so lets not pick and choose cause we do not like it lets let our children love them cause they do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of fun for Toddlers!","review":"My 2 year-old loves this DVD. She loves the animals and all of the excitement that the Crocodile Hunter brings to the show. They also deal with being careful around possibly dangerous animals, snakes in particular. Even the extras on the DVD were neat!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wiggly Safari","review":"This is a great entertainer for little ones! Plus, it contains footage of the late Steve Irwin, who most kids loved and were fascinated by watching his adventures."},{"rating":"1","title":"wiggly safari","review":"It was not as engaging as the others. I figured since it had real animals, Steve Irwin and live-action scenes, it would be really good too. But the whole DVD doesn't have that special quality that say Yummy Yummy has or Wiggly Time or Big Red Car have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boy, were we disappointed!","review":"My daughter and I are both huge Wiggles fans, but I found this tape to be not up to their usual standard, and she found it rather boring (she's 22 months old). Not even getting into the *10 minutes* of commercials in the beginning of the tape, none of their \\"hits\\" were on the tape. The music wasn't up to their usual standard. The whole thing took place in the Australian Zoo, which was sort of cool, but just didn't do it for us. Different is always a risk, but I don't think this worked for them. The only reason I gave it two stars is because we still love the Wiggles! I hope their next release is more like their traditional releases, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful!","review":"This DVD is boring and annoying. It won't catch the attention of my child and the songs get on my last nerve. Even the performers seem bored to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOO MUCH!","review":"Our family owns all of the Wiggles videos and my children love watching them - but I have to say this one was very disappointing. The editing style is frenetic - The camera seems to stay on an image for no more than one second. My three year old who is usually singing and dancing around - got up and walked away - undone by the bombardment of images. Plus, like the other reviewer said, there aren't any songs you can really sing along to. We long for the early days of \\"Wake Up Jeff\\" !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck!","review":"My kids like it cause they like Steve Irwin but I don't really. Really cheesy... too cutsy.. really a piece of publicity for Irwin's Australia Zoo.... This video doesn't have the quality ofsongs, script, etc. of the other recent Wiggles Video.. it is like going back to the days of \\"Dance Party\\". Worst part if the koola interview with Jeff-- it is Terri who is really too cutsy.. Also way too much of Bindi (Irwin's daughter)... I give it too stars because my boys really like Irwin but I personally would send it back"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not their best movie","review":"My son LOVES The Wiggles, but HATED this movie. It did not keep his attention at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different from the other Wiggles movies, but so much fun!","review":"My 3 year old and 18 month old consider this their 2nd favorite Wiggles movie (after Hoop-de-doo!). It is a bit different than the other Wiggles videos--it is set outdoors and co-stars Steve Irwin, the crocodile hunter. My boys were captivated with him & love the catchy songs, especially \\"Crocodile Hunter\\" and \\"Snakes: Look but you better not touch\\".This is guaranteed to hold their interest, which I love. And the songs, while very catchy, don't seem to stick in my head quite as long as songs from some of the other videos (which is great from my point of view!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"ANOTHER WONDERFUL VIDEO","review":"This video is one of their best! I loved the songs. They are very catchy. My daughter loves watching the animals and The Wiggles. After getting Wiggle Bay, I was worried that the old style of The Wiggles was gone, but this one is back to their normal high standards. The children are back involved in the songs, dancing and singing. There is also many extras on the DVD. I truly loved it. The only problem with this video ,is that I walk around all day with the songs in my head!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"the perfect combo!","review":"I couldn't be happier that these Aussies hooked up for a program. My 2 year old loves the Wiggles and the Crocodile Hunter. The songs are all about animals and are catchy. My only complaint would be that she loves it too much! Even I find myself singing the songs! If your children like the Wiggles and animals, then this is the DVD for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Wiggles Video Yet!","review":"How can you go wrong with the combination of Wiggles and the Crocodile Hunter? This video is by far my two year old's favorite. We have every Wiggles video, and this one is so wonderful. Not only are the songs all fun, but the video is educational. Between the songs the kids learn facts about the different animals featured. The entire video (all but two live songs from a concert) is taped at the Australia Zoo, so it is outdoors instead of in a studio. We get to see everything from Captain Feathersword swimming with dolphins to Jeff sleeping with a cuddly koala. I think everyone should add this video to their Wiggles collection!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It got my toddler off the couch to sing and dance and learn","review":"When we first intoduced this DVD to my daughter when she was 14 months old,she wasn't interested at all. She prefered the other Wiggles DVD such as the Wiggley Dance Party and Yummy Yummy. She was also at an age where she enjoyed the Teletubbies. They had a simplier background and \\"less busy\\". At 22 months, my daughter is much more energetic and prefers more movement and songs. My husband and I are so excited to see her jump out of the couch to dance along with her favorite songs. She even says the word \\"butterfly\\" when she sees one now. She watches the credit at the end of the show and immitates the guy who throws himself on the ground. You can learn ABC and 123 anywhere, but not the safari! Our friends showed up at our house once and found all three of us singing and dancing to the Crocodile song. See, it is for all ages!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kids love it, adults too","review":"I got this for my daughter, as I was looking for an alternative to those horrible Barney songs. This album is actually quite good in the song writing. My kids love it and sing along in the car. My older daughter likes it too and everyone is happy when we put this on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very fun","review":"Unless your kid is a crocodile hunter fan, skip this DVD. There is too much \\"plot\\", and the songs are lame. My 2yr old asked for \\"other wiggy\\" DVD, so even she was bored."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wiggles are Enjoyable for Adults Too.","review":"The first time I actually heard of the Wiggles was while watching \\"Crocodile Hunter\\". This movie incorporates these two major Australian exports into a fun show for kids and adults. We watched this tape last week when my toddler son was in the hospital and it was the most enjoyable of all the kid's tapes offered by the hospital's Child Life department. I also became a bit nostalgic for Steve Irwin who died more than a year ago. My only complaint about this tape is it's too short!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good, the only poor wiggles performance","review":"I should have listened to the negative reviews on this one; I have many of the other wiggles series and my kids can't get enough of them for years. BUT the wiggly safari was such a failure - my boys watched it once and were so bored and don't want to see it again. The wiggly safari is poorly made, poor graphics, boring songs, nothing interesting about it. I'm sorry to say it was a waste of my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit too hyper!","review":"We started with the Yummy-Yummy video by the Wiggles and our 16-month son loves it, as do we! It is great because the songs are great--simple lyrics and choreography that make it very interactive for all of us. Wiggly Safari is the second video we've purchased. In general, it is much more complicated and too active for all of us. It has been thoroughly \\"Hollywoodized\\": many more camera angles, more complicated and faster choreography, young child dancers replaced by Mickey-Mouse club 20-yr olds, etc... Our son became frightened by some of the overly hyper scenes. My biggest gripe is the frequent scene changes during songs (often a new frame every 1-3 seconds!!)--it makes me dizzy and surely can't be good for kids. There are a few songs that are more calm, and our son does enjoy many of the animals, but we intend to store this one away until he's quite a bit older, in hopes that he won't end up with ADD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Our 2 1/2 year-olds FAVORITE!","review":"We just got our copy of Wiggly Safari yesterday. Our 2 1/2 year-old watched it for the first time this morning. She absolutely loves this tape already. Every 10 minutes she would race into the kitchen to tell her mother, \\"New Wiggles! Has Animals! Wow!\\" Then race back to watch more.She has only watched the tape once, but already has learned the words \\"crocodile\\" and \\"kangaroo\\" and several other new animal names, and has even pointed them out correctly during the video.Yes, Steve Irwin is hyper. . .I wish I was as excited about my job as he is! His enthusiasm certainly got our daughter excited about this tape and the animals of Australia! We are hoping there is a Wiggly Safari PART 2 coming soon!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not bad - but not great","review":"My first reaction when I watched this show was that it was just okay. I didn't dislike it (like a couple other Wiggle's DVD I have tried) but I wasn't excited about it. The songs aren't too bad, but there is very little dancing on this one. My little girl (almost 2) is starting to pick up the moves from some of the other DVDs and this one would have given her little reason to get up and dance. I didn't like the live show segments at all (two). There is some good animal education, if that is what you are looking for. And, there were some fun scenes with the guys. This is one that I might get for her when she is older if she still likes the Wiggles, but for now there is too much talking and not enough dancing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor execution","review":"Great concept, but too much of that Irwin guy who is a bit agressive and loud, and too much technical intervention with the editing. My son (3 yrs) likes the Wiggles, but this one just overloads him and he wanders off to get a book. This DVD is going in the next yard sale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Our favorite Wiggles video!","review":"We got this as a hand-me-down and at first our kids seemed mildly interested in it. Over the months though it's grown on them and they love it. An oldie but goodie, lots of great catchy songs that get stuck in your head for days. Can't go wrong with Steve Irwin either, even though he's gone we still love seeing him on the tube."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best for an Older Child","review":"My 17 month old really doesn't like this video very much even though it was the first we purchased. Her dad calls it The Wiggles Meet Steve Erwin. The songs are cute, but the video seems a little long to me and she doesn't usually watch but a few minutes of it. As I limit her video time to when I fix dinner that means this video isn't very useful to me. She has started watching more in the last few weeks, but still prefers the other videos more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grows on you","review":"We bought this video when it first came out & our son wouldn't watch more than 2 minutes of it before insisting it be taken out. Now that he's older (almost 2), he wants to watch this one multiple times per day! It doesn't have as much singing & dancing as the earlier videos, but it's his new favorite. When he picks it out now, we're saying \\"not again.\\" My suggestion is: Don't rule out this video if your child doesn't love it at first, give it time & it'll grow on you."},{"rating":"2","title":"A winner in our house!","review":"Our daughter loves this one. She is 1 and dances the moves with them. It is a nice change from the other videos they make."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wiggly Dad","review":"The Wiggles team up with Steve Irwin, \\"The Crocodile Hunter\\" at the Australia Zoo and put together one heck of a great show for the kids! It's musical, educational and fun all rolled into one great video. With a mix of catchy music, interesting animals, Wiggles characters (Dorothy the Dinosaur, Captain Feathersword, Wags the Dog and more) and silly Wiggles humor, my kids (son 6 & daughter 4) just love to watch this video over and over again. This video is one of the best ever made by the group from down under. Another nice thing to note is that the kids get to see and learn about some very uncommon animals."},{"rating":"2","title":"Toddler Friendly","review":"I bought this DVD for my 2 year old who loves the Wiggles and he really enjoys it. He loves the animals and the music. There are a lot of Special Features that are fun to watch. My only complaint is that the music does not seem to be as upbeat as most of the Wiggles other music, so it is not as fun for my toddler to dance to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie but with mandatory previews","review":"My two-year-old daughter and I adore the Wiggles and I think this is their best movie. My daughter dances, sings, and laughs throughout the film, and then she asks to see it again. It is refreshing to see the Wiggles outside at the Australia Zoo, rather than on an indoor set. The animals are interesting and the skits are entertaining. The songs are catchy and don't stick in your head to drive you crazy the way some kids' songs can. The one problem with the video has nothing to do with the Wiggles-- it is those mandatory previews. The fast forward function has been disabled, so every time my daughter wants to watch it, she has to wait through 6 minutes of previews for other Hit Entertainment productions. However, the Wiggles are always worth the wait."},{"rating":"2","title":"EUREKA!! El Supremo!!","review":"This is the hardest book i've ever tackled and the finest introduction to Early Greek thought that i have ever seen!

This is just the best modern rock song of 1998. The opener (title) and last song are the highlights on the cd, while Isobella provides a nice 3rd song, though I'm the first to admit, she's an aquired taste. Even if it only had the title track though, its honesty, build up and come down (over 7 whole minutes!) might just make you play this one song over and over again. Can't wait for tigermilk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Epic Rock","review":"The Beatles had \\"Hey Jude\\". The Rolling Stones had \\"You Can't Always Get What You Want\\". The Smiths had \\"That Joke Isn't Funny Anymore\\". Soft Cell had \\"Tainted Love\\". Wham had \\"Careless Whispers\\".And Belle & Sebastian, thankfully, have \\"This Is Just A Modern Rock Song\\".

You will be activated by the Samba energy which s so immense that if want to get the kids out of bed in the morning and wakening. You might try this one!Wonderful to get people on the dance floor and activated. Excelent Party music because you cannot be serious when this record is ON AIR. You do not have to drunk or profesional dancer there before you realize you will find yourself jumping and having fun. The record includes also one Jive and samba-reggaetonMany very good competition Samba tracks. I love these tracks to dance at the competition. This album recommended for Dancing Schools and competitions, Disco and DJ.s should have this record anyhow and the party is on!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read","review":"I thought this book was great, much better than the last couple I read from Hubbard and Dietz. I loved the protagonist, the plot, everything about it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read","review":"It really caught me as it is a fast paced novel. Overall it was good but ending seemed abrupt with all the explanations of everything in the last 2 to 4 pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"The book could use practice...","review":"This book was written, clearly, before David Brin had \\"practiced\\" his writing skills to full effect. Characters are very flat, especailly the clicheed and obvious antagonist. The premise is interesting and the first 25 pages strong, and while some concepts are addressed with a flair that would come to be known as distinctly David Brin, it is painfully obvious in this attempt that he was more scientist than author at this point in his career. In fact, it makes an interesting study to see how far someone can go, how great someone can improve if they just... you guessed it... practice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has Potential, But Didn't Quite Work for Me","review":"The book has a cool premise, but the execution is shallow at best, boring at worst. A little more character development and a little less trying (and failing) to mimic Star Wars' dialogue would have been an improvement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip it -- read The Postman or Earth instead","review":"Brin starts with an interesting idea, but seems to just write himself into a hole. The conclusion is sudden, and feels like Brin is just desperately filling in the aforementioned hole. He's done much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brin had fun writing this one...","review":"If you are a physicist (like this reader), you will be rolling on the floor laughing. If not, you will simply find the book very, very funny. Brin sneaks in everything, from parodies of Star Wars to bad Latin puns. So it falls in the standard hero-goes-to-strange-country-and-makes-good, complete with Helpful Sidekick and Beautiful Damsel. So what? Brin obviously had great fun writing this one. I had fun reading it. Hope you do too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic departure from hard-core Sci-Fi","review":"I've read everything Brin has published. He weaves a very real and believable story, usually based upon real science, or real theory.This book was obviously a departure into fantasy. I found The Practic Effect to be a fun light-hearted Sci-Fi fantasy. It was interesting to explore the notion of, \\"What if physics and natures laws worked differently, somewhere else?\\" It was, of course, written very well, in Brin's cinematic style."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rediculous Scientific Premise = Rediculous Sci-fi Story","review":"I read the book long ago, about 8 years ago, I think, but one thing I do remeber is that the story revolves around the premise that the more you use an object, the more suitable it becomes for use. In other words, you can turn a zipper into a tree saw, with a little \\"practice.\\" Does that sound like it makes sence? I thought not, and neither does the book, it sucks. You will see other reviews appollogizing for the fact that this is an early David Brin book, and is not as well written or developed as his other books, yet the book gets for or five stars from these reviewers. I say the book should be judged for what it is, David Brin or not. A crappy sci-fi story with a weak premise and cardboard characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"A book without a cover","review":"Exactly that is what I got ordering this book. The service in itself was quick enough. However, I think it is not done to rob a book from its cover! Without that, the book loses some of its appeal, besides the tearing off of the cover being an act of vandalism.With the cover attached, the rating would have been the full five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"TIME TO RE-MASTER, GUYS.","review":"Westbound has a great catalog. Who knows what else is in there. This is a real decent one, although not the best, but since Westbound is rather scare you have to have it. However, some of these tracks have now been reissued on other Westbound compilations in better quality. This disc is from the early 90s and has a bit of a shrill sound, while Westbound has been getting really great sound these days, like on Wsetbound Northern Soul. Time to re-master."},{"rating":"2","title":"HP creates another excellent product","review":"I've only had the 6540dt for a few days, but from what I've seen so far, HP continues to make the most solid, high quality inkjets on the market. Not only does it operate well, it's attractive and yet even looks well built metal plate front. It's fast, with very sharp print quality.After over three years of owning the HP Deskjet 932C and being extremely happy with it, I was thrilled to see this new model up for sale at a very good price for all the included features.If you're in the market for a new printer, give the 6540 a serious look."},{"rating":"1","title":"Might as well buy a white elephant","review":"The initial cost of this printer is low.

The singing is very good, specially Hovorostovsky's Count di Luna. The only somewhat weak singing came in my opinion from Villaroel's Leonora, who is not the right type of soprano for the role, and cannot cope well with Verdi's difficult score. However, her singing is very emotional, as is the case with the rest of the cast. The sets, even though transported to the nineteenth century, are wonderful (specially compared to the Met's nonexistent and boring sets) as are the costumes. In fact I find the period change to be a welcome change to the traditional staging. As other reviewers have mentioned, it gives the production a film-like feel.Rizzi's direction is very exciting and the 5.1 DD sound is very very good. Special praise to the chorus! Far more exciting than the Met's, this production is highly recommended!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great singing, but too DARK on the stage","review":"Great, and actually outstanding singing, but unfortunately the too dark stage almost destroys the whole performance.

However, this highly dramatic scene has its cost - Cura was not attuned to this physical assertion. Dmitri actually gave an account of this scene in the commentary part - he gave credit to Cura, being a tenor, for making this scene dramatically effective. Judging from the performance, however, the credit actually goes to Dmitri, whose singing and acting (in duel) go on simultaneously in a high level without any sign of strain either way. A really great singing-actor. His di Luna is so adorable that really saved the production.Cura's great duet with Yvonne Naef was also strained. Excuse me for comparing his Manrico with Pavarotti's.

Fantastic"},{"rating":"2","title":"Alone in Its Greatness","review":"This unforgettable album by Frank Sinatra of Rod McKuen's words and music is among his best work. Haunting, evocative, lonely, aching, it resonates in the heart and stays in the mind. Beautifully arranged and produced, its shows how Sinatra changed with the times and could sing virtually anything with greatness. He certainly gave Rod the highest compliment with this album--he obviously took McKuen's work with the greatest seriousness and sense of responsibility for interpreting it with sensitivity and depth. A great album many don't even know exists."},{"rating":"2","title":"McKuen Fan Enjoys Sinatra","review":"This is an older CD and has Frank Sinatra singing some Rod McKuen songs and reciting some of the McKuen poetry.Being a McKuen fan, I like the sound of Rod's scratchy voice which somehow imparts his passion for his subjectbe it loneliness, love, or old age. Alas, McKuen is not heard on this CD.But, the package that Sinatra has elected to showcase provides a nice mix for thinkingabout your own getting up in years and where you are going next with women, wine, travel and life in general.All of us are alone at times and Sinatra - with McKuen's help - captures the essence of life alone - as a single man."},{"rating":"2","title":"I enjoy it, I listen to it in the car on a rainy day","review":"If people can get past Frank's previous albums and the sort of songs he performed, they may perhaps find a place in their collection for this album. It helps if you are a bit more sensitive - the lyrics may then make a bit more sense. If you compare McKuen's lyrics to those of Porter, Mercer and Gershwin, it is no contest, so don't bother.My description above for a listening environment really seemed to add more to the experience. In a way, 'For only the lonely' is a thematic description for these song lyrics.They are about relationships - love, with other people, with your own self.There are also spoken word interludes, which was a first for Frank on record, I believe.Frank sings well and the arrangements are appropriate - really, you will never hear anyone else sing these tunes, so why not take a chance on it?You are likely to find the LP used, so that makes it easier again.I would ask people to give it a chance - see what you think."},{"rating":"2","title":"The legend and the poet create classic mood music","review":"A relatively obscure album that should be in the library of all who love Sinatra. Rod McKuen is relatively obscure these days, which makes this album a treasure.

It is my favorite Sinatra album. It is so deeply personal and etched with a humanity you will not find on many recordings. The production values are top notch and Sinatra delivers in a big way.

The album inspired me to dig deeper into APP's back catalogue, and they've certainly released more memorable records than this.However, there is more to this album than \\"Don't Answer Me\\". \\"Prime Time\\" could easily have been a massive hit had it not been completely ignored by the radio. \\"Pipeline\\" is a classic APP instrumental, cinematic in an almost technicolour way. However, the real standout track on this album is \\"You Don't Believe\\", with Lenny Zakatek's passionate vocal, and a techno-esque feel.Not in the same class as \\"I, Robot\\", \\"Eye In The Sky\\" or \\"The Turn of a Friendly Card\\" perhaps, but, all the same, this is still well worth a listen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just O.K.","review":"A couple of good songs was about it. It sounded a tad fay like the other one. The first song was good."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best albums of the 80s","review":"Ammonia Avenue is one of the best, most listenable albums of the 1980s. While the thematic approach is less evident than on other albums by Alan Parsons, there is not a single weak song. Particular highlights are Don't Answer Me, Prime Time and Ammonia Avenue. Don't Answer Me is one of the most tuneful songs that Alan Parsons and Eric Woolfson ever wrote.The remastered sound is exceptionally good. This is due both to technical expertise and the involvement of Alan Parsons himself. While some older albums actually sound less good when stripped of the fuzz, the works of the Alan Parsons Project gain in crispness and clarity due to their instrumentation and electronic sounds. I would not buy this CD for the bonus tracks, though they are interesting and varied. I particularly liked the Shadows inspired version of You Don't Believe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Moving smartly along ...","review":"Well, let's put it this way ...I bought this when the vinyl was first released. Went with all the other APP albums I had. My 700 or so vinyl discs have since been entrusted to an old friend.I've since purchased *almost* all the APP CDs that I once had on vinyl. Not this one.For me, Pyramid was the pinnacle -- 5 stars. Love the rest of the first four, as well as Stereotomy and Gaudi -- 4 stars. I'd give 3 stars to Vulture Culture and Eye in the Sky. But this one and Eve just didn't do it for me.On a tangentially related note ... if you haven't heard Godley & Creme's Goodbye Blue Sky, try to find yourself a copy. A rollicking good time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album, great to hear it once again","review":"Ammonia Avenue is an album mainly about scientists. The title song has always been one of my favorites. It can be considered as a summary of the topics of this album, in an excellent fashion.Prime Time is nice, but if you have ever heard Alan Parsons live, you will certainly agree that the live performances, with incredible solos by Ian Bairnson, are still superior to the album version."},{"rating":"2","title":"A solid album--more pop oriented than their others","review":"I liked Ammonia Avenue from 1984, especially Don't Answer Me. But my favorite song on here is Prime Time, and it deserved more airplay and attention than Answer got in summer 1984. I heard it in Conyers, Georgia during a road trip in summer '84 and loved it. Don't Answer Me is such wonderful acoustic guitar playing--sometimes the Beach Boys' 1988 Kokomo borrows from that song. I'd have to say that Ammonia was their most pop oriented album, as Alan Parsons and his band load this album with lots of pop hooks that's a far cry from their '70s progressive rock period. It was just as strong enough to compete with Lionel Richie, Cyndi Lauper, Tina Turner, Huey Lewis and the News and other artists that dominated the charts of '84. The rest of the album is just as strong and musically deep. I didn't think that they would top 1980's Eye in the Sky but they sure did with this one. This is just as much a classic as their other albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engine Noise","review":"Got the 100QR because it was recommended by a friend.

The analog needle reacts quickly, making it suitable for fast probing of multiple points.

I love over-the-door organizers and thought this would be a great solution for hat storage--and it wasn't. I don't know what would be, as folding up hats to fit in a shoe organizer doesn't sound like a great idea either. I took the organizer to work thinking I could use it to store office supplies, etc, but the door hangers only work for standard doors--not the nice big wooden doors at the office.

Also allowed me to organize them by college, pro team, and golf.I did not use the provided hooks, but instead used my staple gun and stapled it to the door. Even if I had used the hooks, I would have had to secure the corners and sides somehow.

I own four of their albums--not all--so please excuse me if I'm not qualified to rate this piece of crap. \\"A Deeper Kind of Slumber\\" is one of the best albums I boast in my vast collection. \\"Gaia\\" and \\"Wildhoney\\" are a unique masterpiece in their own right. \\"Judas Christ\\" is the only album that made me waver (ever so slightly).But what the *expletive* is this? This doesn't even sound like Tiamat. It doesn't even sound like a cheap rip-off. It sounds like a garage-band that stole the name and went on Napster in a weak effort to sell a few copies to a dying lot of bored fans. This isn't just bad, it's TERRIBLE. This band was one of my favorites. I couldn't believe this was happening so I actually did a double-take just to make sure my drink hadn't been spiked.I wish it had. I wish I was drunk.

This movie was way too sad. I don't like movies like this one, and can't stand them because it is just too sad and depressing. The terrible abuse and bad things that happened to this boy was just too much to take-and when you watch the scene when he is in military confinement talking to Denzel's character about why he can't be intimate with women and the very next scene showing the CAUSE of it then you will see exactly what I am talking about. Just too depressing, sickening, stomach-turning, and agonizing the things that happened to him.

Indexing, stats collection etc is also very poor and there are no discussions on internals (to save us all from reading the code!).The replication chapter was OK, but I would seriosly suggest that the modelled replication model for load balancing is a really bad idea and a maintenance/cost nightmare.For a prod dba from Oracle or SQL, you will be very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential for any serious MySQL User","review":"This is a very helpful and informative book.

The authors clearly and explicitly describe how to setup and manage replication, and how to deal with failures and failover. There are plenty of architecture diagrams, accompanied by lucid descriptions of the good and bad points of each one.The sections on query and server optimization are first class as well. There are plenty of vignettes drawn from Jeremy's real-world experience running MySQL at Yahoo.My only criticism is that the book seemed too short.

Good in European films, less good in those made in Hollywood.A good music-hall singer,discovered by Edith Piaf (who put him in her shows -- and her bed). Sometimes less good: there's an occasional whiff of fromage on some songs. But Yves gets away with this because he's so utterly charming otherwise.He was a womanizer and a devoted husband. He conducted multiple affairs -- Marilyn Monroe was the one most of us pretended to be scandalized by -- while remaining happily married to the sensual, sultry Simone Signoret until the day she died.The point is, these contradictions ultimately work for the music.The overall effect is unique. A little odd. Occasionally cheesy. But charming and seductive -- all the more so if you have some decent Bordeaux in the house.A little like Yves himself was, I suspect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"This Book is Excellent!

Another review on this site suggested that Blech offers no solutions to the causes of anti-semitism. Actually, he offers this important insight--unless the major religions (Christianity and Judaism) and their leaders change the hatred and bigotry in the Bible there can be no end to anti-semitism. The very use of the Bible with its inflammatory words against Jews in the Old & New Testaments, will ensure that people continue to be filled with animosity against the Jews.Blech offers an answer--rid the Bible of its inherent ant-Semitism and start a real dialogue among Christians and Jews. One may not like Blech's views (seeing the truth is hard for many) but that doesn't mean they aren't accurate. And we certainly shoudn't shoot the messenger.Arthur Blech has written a courageous book.

Most Americans would not choose to go to Okinawa for quite a few good reasons... The content of the video was a little bizarre - the host talked to a bunch of western bar hostesses in Tokyo, sang horrible karaoke in front of a bunch of Japanese women, and then got on his soapbox about animal rights... And the horrible filler of the host on the ski slopes...

It was funny, unusually presented and diplayed different aspects than what can be normally found in guidebooks. The only negative was the selection of expats being interviewed in this report. It gave the impression that expat women can only earn their living as hostesses in sleazy bars and nothing else. If you are looking for a serious travel report on Japan this is definitely not for you. But if you would like to see the younger, hipper and more unusual side of Japan- you will really enjoy this !"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fine introduction to world cultures","review":"Overall, this is an excellent series. The host has a sense of humor and doesn't take himself too seriously. The cultural aspects presented are interesting and enlightening. It's a forty- five minute video, so it isn't going to cover everything, but the videos do make a good introduction to different cultures and stimulate questions and discussion. If you are a social studies teacher using the LP videos in the classroom, make sure you preview first.

But through the odd juxtipositions that McDaniels is able to blessedly, and wickedly, un-find, he creates tremendous psychological arguments in the smallest of lyrics. You may find yourself laughing outloud and then unavoidably realize there's some real darkness underneath this surface texture of humour.

Padnos's honesty about his own motives and feelings give this book a rare freshness.

Would not recommend at all. Check out the Kino version, as they tend to do good job at transfering old silent films to DVD.The 1 star review is not reflective of Griffith's film. It is one of my favorite silent films and probably the most ambitious film ever made in terms of casting, sets and the enormity of the timespan of the four separate stories. This film is probably much more representative of Griffith's acievements than the racist and way outdated \\"Birth of a Nation.\\" So this film deserves to be preserved properly, not in this bastardized cheapy version. Alas, I got what I paid for :-("},{"rating":"1","title":"Intolerance is intolerable to watch!","review":"Perhaps highly innovative in its time, this film is hopelessly dated and, at three hours in length, difficult to sit through. The first couple of hours seem to drag as the film jumps between four separate and convoluted story lines; though the last hour with its actions sequences and rapid pacing isn't too bad. Another problem that I have with the film is that it is overly preachy; Griffith practically clubs you over the head with his Victorian ideological message."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ponderous: a kind of writing","review":"Being a fan of the philosophy Honderich does, I admit to being dissapointed at the sort of re-telling his life has recieved. The clarity and knowledge that exist in his professional work are translated here...to the most tedious degree. One senses a Continental cloud descending as one attempts to remember the last page read. He was dating who? His colleague said what? The nerve...and the boredom. After reading the life of Ayer retold by another, I wonder if Ted should have waited for posthumous recollection. He seems to be leading the same life as his mentor, minus the dash. Proceed immediately to the last chapter and philosophical summary to retain your interest.Honderich maintains an excellent web site, devoted to issues of determinism and the ravaging of his critics. I suggest you visit there instead of these pages...it's free."},{"rating":"1","title":"'The World We Knew' is not really worth knowing as a CD","review":"This album has too few really good , worthwhile , emotionally affecting performances - those things are the reasons many people listen to Frank .The tracks I return to are the title track and \\"You Are There \\" for the melodies , \\"Drinking Again\\" for the arrangement , atmosphere and delivery , as well as \\"This Town\\" which is tough and punchy . As for the rest , it is really disappointing .I suggest you find a friend who has this CD and somehow make up your own compilation .

The treasure here is Billy Jones last great live performance. His rendition of \\"Prisoner\\" and \\"Holiday\\" are worth the price. Of course Hughie always shines.

Awesome slasher flick. What more can you ask for Savini's effects were great in this film. Its great to see the behind the scenes Gore effects and theres no censoring here. The extras were great.

Check out any of Blue Undergrounds DVD's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tom Savini is good at them there special effects","review":"Savini's effects are the highlight of this flick. For once you get to see his stuff without the editors messing it up. Probably what F13 would have been, had it not been so heavily censored.The movie is SLOOOOOW in the middle, but the effects make it a must have for Horror/Savini fans. When the girls throat continues to bleed and bubble underwater in the pool i was hooked. You just don't see that very much. Shocking! Scandalous!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring Horror Movie","review":"The opening of The Prowler takes place on Avalon Bay, 1945. A girl named Rosemary and her boyfriend end up murdered on the night of their graduation dance. Fast forward 30 years later, 1980- the killer has never been found. Now there's another dance taking place and the killer is back to kill the teens with a long knife and a pitchfork. The killer also has a connection with the war from the 40's.This movie was incredibly boring and the killing with the pitchfork didn't do it for me. The long knife was cool but this movie just dragged on and on. The characters were very uninteresting and the killings weren't that great.This was your typical average run of the mill horror movie with the same old plot and lackluster characters.Special Features: Audio Commentary with Producer. Director Joseph ZitoSpecial make up effects Tom SaviniTom Savinis behind the scene gore footageTheatrical TrailerPoster and still gallery"},{"rating":"2","title":"Underrated, unusual slasher gets A-grade DVD treatment","review":"To say THE PROWLER is any kind of great film is simply untrue. However, the whole thing has an eerie, unsettling, dream-like quality to it that carries it through the slower patches and makes the film's near-total lack of coherency and logic much easier to take. The tension is kept taught throughout, and with top-notch scoring, photography, gore effects and direction, makes for a surprisingly effective and repeatable horror film. Just make sure you watch it in the dead of night! The Blue Underground DVD has a fine anamorphic transfer that is as good as the original negatives will allow, some fascinating on-set footage of the make-up effects, an impressive stills and poster gallery that is definitely worth ploughing through and a superb, hugely entertaining commentary with director Joseph Zito and make-up maestro Tom Savini. Very much recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most creative death scenes to date...","review":"As a long time fan of slasher films, I have been disappointed with the Friday the 13th series and the Nightmare on Elm street series and not to mention the Halloween series. The more sequels there are, the more outragous the storylines. Its a insult to the viewers intelligence. The Prowler, is straight and to the point...to the point of a large pitchfork that is. This movie is what a true fan of horror/slasher films is looking for. The murder scenes are very elaborate and very creative. With special effects by the master Tom Savini (creepshow, Friday the 13th) its a rollercoaster ride of who done its."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheesy","review":"I bought this movie and Pieces. I thought both were cheap and cheesy. I like a good scarey movie combined with the slasher factor and neither of these fit the bill (to me anyway.) Maybe if I were watching these-in the 80's- I would feel differently, but they did nothing for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painfully boring","review":"I bought this film knowing that Tom Savini did the gore effects...well that didnt save this horrorible slasher. First off most of the movie is just people walking around in the dark with no action, talking, or plot going on at all. The murders, while nice and gory are few and far between. The killers outfit and the story on why he is killing is soooo lame I want to laugh and cry at the same time. The ending is pitiful and not surprising at all. I love horror movies, but this one is not worth the time. Get My Bloody Valentine instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"childish waste of money B-movie","review":"I like slasher-movies very much, and I thought I was in for a treat with this one, since the director is Joseph Zito. He directed Friday the 13th part 4 (in my opninion the best of the series); but this I think is a stupid, boring, predictable, amateur B-movie. Lots of scenes are too dark, sometimes I just can't see a thing, even when I adjust the brightness of my TV and lay my eyes ON the screen, I can't see nothing several times. Bad movie, if you're curious, rent it, but don't waste your money buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Weak Entry in The Slasher Film Era","review":"This film is a by-the-numbers slasher film from the early 1980's. The characters are very dumb and do all the wrong things and get themselves killed just because it is required by the script. No one in their right mind would do some of the stupid things these characters do. Its all very much a standard slasher film. The killer in this film is a guy dressed in an army outfit so that is a bit different from many of the killers in slasher films. The only thing that helps this film to stand out are the amazing gore effects by the legendary Tom Savini. Some of his best work was done in this film. If you are a gorehound, then this film will be worth viewing once for Savini's gore effects. Otherwise, skip this boring film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Moves at a glacial pace, but nice FX","review":"This film seriously moves at a glacial pace and is not all that scary. It has some decent acting and the effects are great, but if I had to see the lead characters slowly walk around a dark house with a flashlight one more damn time I was going to scream. Boredom mius threats is NOE suspense. Also, the ending left me a bit cold. Meh. Just over-rated because of a two of the kill scenes, in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't believe it's 150 watt!!","review":"There is no way this amp is 150 watts!

I was a little iffy because of the varied reviews; it seemed to have as many bad as good. Turns out the QC on these is horrible, I know sometimes you get a bad egg (I work on computers, you can't catch em all) but that being said the QC on these amps leaves alot to be desired. First of all, I paid $[...] for a NEW amp, and I got a refurbished one. But hey I could overlook that if the speaker in the amp had actually been mounted to something inside, not just flopping around. And to top it all off the cover on the voltage switch had been messed with before I even got it. Avoid this brand and spend a little bit more money to get something with better quality.

It doesn't have any good features. It too quiet; even when turned all the way up. It also sounds horrible! When I was first starting to learn how to play the guitar, I thought that this would work out for me. Boy was I wrong.When starting to learn how to play the guitar, you want to have have good gear to be able to sounds good. If you have bad equipment, you sound bad. If you don't like what you hear, you may think that your just terrible, and just give up. It's really important to have good gear.That's why you do not want to buy this amp.

The T3 stylus differs from that used with other Palm Pilots'. Like the device, it expands. Boxwave's version does even more--it holds a small ballpoint pen tip for that critical written note. After years of MACs and BlackBerries, I've just gone back to the T3. It is a lightweight powerhouse that conveniently does what I need, quickly and with few mistakes. Old fingers still manage to print Graffix, reliably. The battery is long lived.While I'm at it, let me rave about Boxwave. This company has remarkably useful devices which can be used wherever you go. My favorites include charger/adapters which can be used in cars and plugs around the world. Boxwave's designs are smart, prices are reasonable, they take up little space, and hold up well.Good company."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT ORIGINAL ARTISTS","review":"Maybe I am ignorant or fail to do proper research before purchasing, and perhaps it is my fault for assuming the \\"one hit wonders\\" would all be performed by the original artists.
