Blood, sweat and tears were put into this thing and it really shows through the camera lense.So the story doesn't exactly hold up but it is still interesting.In the commentary by the director he explains where he got the idea for this movie and what he was trying to say.

The packaging is not designed for shippment. Save your money, buy something else.

The roaster was cracked, so I sent it back and reordered another one. It was fine, except for excessive wax coating on it ( Which I still haven't got it all off yet).

I'm unhappy with the way the lid fits on the pot. There is no lip around the edge of the lid or a recessed area around the edge of the pot to hold the lid in place. The surfaces of the outer edges of both the pot and lid are flat and if the pot is tilted slightly the lid will just slide off. I've never seen this on any other cast iron cookware and I own many pieces of cast iron. I would not recommend this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bayou Classic Iron Roaster","review":"Roaster was cracked up one side. I returned it and the second one was also cracked up one side.

I would be late to work because of it, then while i was at work all i would do is think about how i have Felicity to go home to(I know i am crazy).

The camera work is at best routine, and tends to reveal the weaknesses of the staging, the stolid nature of the acting, and the rather inappropriate casting from a visual point of view of the two female leads. The subtitles are farcically incomplete and there is no libretto or any other useful information. Yes, the singing is distinguished, and Anne Howells is a delight, but as a whole this is highly disappointing. Since this DVD is not worth watching, and Lucrezia Borgia is given a much better performance in the 1977 recording (still available on CD transfer) with Sutherland and Bonynge in better form than here and with Aragall, Horne and Wixell vocally at least as satisfying as Krause, Howells and Dean, only a very devoted Donizetti fan will want this DVD.

This volume abounds with both aspects of his thought and skill. As a result, this is useful reading for either people interested in Patristics, specifically Patristic thought on Genesis, or for those interested in Late Antique history.Much has been written on Chrysostom but honestly, there is nothing better than going to the source and this is a very readable English translation, though without the Greek original.

Perhaps the book could have redeemed itself if it were a little more engaging than a dead fish, perhaps a few red-herrings to keep us going. I was very disappointed. I expect books to be more than just manuals.All in all this book may be useful only to SSL implementors with an already excellent understanding of security/encryption.

For instance, header field sizes are never mentioned. On top of that, the book is now 10 years old and is badly obsolete. Can in no way be recommended as a result."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Complementary Perspective on the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising","review":"The members of the \\"Jewish Military Organization\\" (also known as \\"The Revisionists\\") who fought during the Warsaw Ghetto uprising all perished.

I agree there are some unnecessary statements of the bleeding obvious, and the constant switching between male and female gender can be confusing.My major criticisms of the CD's are the male speaker sometimes pronounces a Thai word differently to the female speaker, and also that there are some words which are mispronounced to the point a Thai native cannot understand them.I was thinking of purchasing the more comprehensive Simon and Schuster Thai lessons ( $200 - $350 ). However, I believe the money would be better spent on having Thai lessons in Thailand. This basic Thai CD collection is probably suited to tourists who want to communicate with Thais on a very limited basis."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't Hear First Word or Sound in many sentences","review":"On my CDs, the first word or sound on many sentences is clipped or missing.

With Cupid's Darts, though, I have to say that I agree with some of the other reviewers here. Kenneth and Aimee - and the anti-hero, Francis - held little interest for me. It was Psyche and Harry who provided all the humour and interest, and I really felt as if I was just skimming this book in order to allow me to get on to Psyche's story.This is disappointing, because I usually rate Harbaugh's books much more highly. I do feel that I'll be rating the final book in the trilogy higher, though!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Utterly pointless","review":"While I was totally enchanted with Cupid and Psyche, I could not care less about the title characters: Aimee and... what's his name again?

Unfortunaly, the director has made bad choices regarding the sets ... and the costumes. They are so exaggerately wide that the characters seem to be sitting on the border of their bed! And what about the make-up? All characters have white faces. You could believe they are dead. All this deconcentrates the viewer. I was so frustrated that I stopped looking at it and did something else while listening. I would recommend to buy the CD version with Cecilia Bartoli instead. If you buy this one, listen to it, but turn your TV off!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great simple story, beautiful illustrations, poetic writing","review":"This book has a simple yet appealing story that kids can relate to (going on a journey, trains, a favorite stuffed animal and family).

The book offers personal stories how mantras were utilized by the author and the effects they brought about, history behind deities and their names, and a large number of mantras, their meaning, and suggestions in what situation to utilize them. I highly recommend this book to anybody who would like to try a new focus for their mind throughout the day, as reciting a mantra brings about a peaceful state."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I was looking for","review":"I had been searching for a reasonably priced, audio source of Sanskrit Chants.

Your show was completely one sided. Why did you not speak with anyone from Tim's family? Why did you not speak with any one of the seven other Detectives that had worked this case and believe that they got the wrong guy? Det. James Broderick and then Prosecutor's, Jolene Blair and Terence Gilmore, went after Tim to further their own careers.

The book is filled will real-life color photographs of what to expect during a hospital stay. It really prepared my son in a realistic manner verses \\"cartoon\\" or \\"drawing\\" style books. Through the photos, he understood what a hospital room looked like, wearing a gown, getting an armband, and seeing Doctors and Nurses in their scrubs and masks. This book also pictured medical equipment used for vitals, X-rays, IVs, and lab tests. By describing the pictures to my son prior to his surgery, he was not afraid at the hospital. Additionally, this book is not directed at any particular reason for being in the hospital, but rather what to expect when you are there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great to help small children prepare","review":"This book was a great help when preparing my 2.5 year old son for his operation. He knew what to expect and luckily, the preliminary exam such as taking weight and blood pressure even followed the exact order as the book. Some of the text was a bit too advanced for him, so I just simplified as I read it. The pictures are very 80's but so are a lot of hospitals. He was not at all frightened by what happened and this book was a big part of the reason."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outdated","review":"I bought this book because my 3 year old son was getting his 3rd set of tubes and adnoids out.

I like this book and feel that it is well written and one of the better ones for this message."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spanking has nothing to do with sexual abuse","review":"As a social worker I get so weary of hearing about the evils of spanking. This book claims that by spanking a child you we touching their genitals and leading to sexual abuse. That's outrageous. Whether you agree with spanking or not there's a huge difference between a calm, rational adult using spanking as a means of discipline, and an out of control adult hitting as a means of coercion and control. Her understanding of the Old Testament is also incomprehensible. Spanking and sexual abuse are two completely separate issues and should not be confused."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Graphic","review":"We bought this book to begin the \\"private parts\\" talks with our 5 year old and 3 year old. We did not end up using it, though, because the illustrations as well as the text are too graphic. May be appropriate for a child who has been abused, but not good for kids that have not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Plain speaking is necessary","review":"I bought this book to read to a four year old foster child whose behavior indicated she had been abused. She hung on every word, staring into my face. My 9 yr old became enlightened by it and wound up making a police report against an abuser. She was angry that I hadn't told her what abuse was when she'd first come as a foster child. The thing is that I HAD read her children's books about sexual abuse, but apparently she didn't understand their message. This book is very clear, with its poetic repetition and first person wording \\"I do not share, No one touches me down there. Those are MY Private Parts!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Every parent/guardian should have this, and so should teachers.","review":"As the non-offending parent of a three-year-old who was molested by her biological father, I have tried to find the best materials for my daughter and myself. This book is written in rhyme which children love. It is FUN to the child, but also makes them think. Although I believe it is intended for children who have not been abused, it actually resulted in my daughter \\"talking\\" about what her daddy did to her. That is a good thing when you know you are not supposed to ASK the child, or lead them, but yet you are instructed by the \\"professionals\\" to seek counseling and to TEACH THEM ABOUT GOOD AND BAD TOUCHES. I HIGHLY recommend this book and truly believe it should be required in daycares and early school years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont be fooled","review":"by the pic this item isnt as cute as it looks. you can hardly notice the itty bitty jewels when you get it home.

First of all this is no where near the quality of Stomp The Yard. The acting is bit horrendous and the sets looked straight from your local high school play. I understand it was a low budget film, but come on man. I really wish a large film company was invest money in another GOOD Black Greek film, but what can you do. Overall just wait until they air this on BET Starz or grab it as a quick rental at Blockbuster."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible representation of black greek life","review":"Being a member of a Black Greek organization and I participant in step shows during my college days, I watched this movie thinking it would remind me of a great time during my college years and that it would be along the lines of Stomp the Yard. The only good thing about this movie was the fun I had in laughing at how ridiculous the acting and the step routines were, as well as the unrealistic plot. Save your money, absolutely not worth the price. This was one of the few movies where I have been amazed at just how horrible it was! The only reason I would watch this movie again would be if I needed a good laugh, not at any well written comedic scripts, but at just how horribly bad this movie is."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible","review":"Do not purchase! Not only is the acting poor but the plot and shooting is low budget. I bought this not anticipating it to be good but I didn't even finish watching the whole thing. At some point it was no longer even amusing on a low-budget, this is crap-level and just became pitiful. Also, the copy I had skiped and froze repeatedly. Someone probably threw the mess against the wall. I repeat, do not purchase. Worse then phantoms and gigli."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good enough","review":"Come on, guys. This is just about as good as you're gonna get nowadays. Yes, the ol' girl is past her prime. Yes the tenor is squally. But when will you hear a better cast? Not in our lifetimes, I'll bet! (Though try the Opera D'Oro CD with Corelli and Sutherland.) The production values are pretty good. Orchestra is fine. Most of the cast hit most of the notes.

Okay?"},{"rating":"2","title":"glorious!","review":"A grand farewell performance of Dame Joan Sutherland withsuch very competent supporting cast.

However, that was a very good decision to say farewell to all her fans in this glorious and very seldom performed opera.She still had a very good stage presence and did not have to \\"die or go mad \\" at the end.The final farewell scene was impressive, I don't think any opera singer ever had such a sumptious farewell occasion. It showed how her fans loved her and would missed her.That was in sharp contrast to how Pavarotti bid farewell to her fans in New York.Both occsions would be well talked about and remembered.I wished they have taped the OONY concert performance of the same opera at Carnegie Hall last year.That was a memorable performance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money unless....","review":"Ladies and Gentlemen -- Unless you want a memento of Dame Joan Sutherland's last performance, I agree with another reviewer who said DO NOT BUY THIS DVD. The opera is boring and senseless, the production and direction is acceptable at best, and the singing -- well, lets just say it leaves much to be desired except for Amanda Thane. Clifford Grant was painful to listen to most of the time and while Anson Austin (tenor lead) has most the notes, he has no clue how to sing convincingly. Dame Joan was shaky and only appears in Acts 2 & 3 of this 5 act opera. Acts 4 & 5 are mislabeled as only Act 4 on the DVD insert. If you want to see La Stupenda in something worthwhile, try the Norma or Anna Bolena with the Canadian Opera Company or her Lucia from the Met. MAYBE, the only redeeming thing on this DVD is the 28 min. credit cue point at the end when she is on stage AFTER the performance is over."},{"rating":"2","title":"New Testament Commentary by MacArthur","review":"The book came in good condition when promised.

I know they are there in Linda's pen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Welcome Back Carlotta","review":"Linda Barnes brings back one of my favorite PI's in THE BIG DIG. Carlotta Carlyle is a remarkable creation. I thought so at the start in her famous \\"Penny\\" short story debut. I still think so now.

A great work by a great writer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING!","review":"I hate to say it because Barnes was my very favorite mystery author, but I think this series is dying.I actually fell asleep 4 or 5 times while reading this latest book. There is little suspense or tension & very little of anything interesting to keep one's attention at all.Carlotta has became just another adult PI & all the funny minor characters are either missing or given short shrift.

So sad to see this happen because she is a very good writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a page turner","review":"This was my first Carlotta Carlyle book, and I thought it was boring.

A Klingon sleeper-ship from the 23rd century is about to awaken it's crew who will still believe the Federation and the Klingons are at war.While the premise for this episode is weak, Suzie Plakson plays K'Ehleyr very well. She is the perfect foil to Worf and it is easy to see why they fell for each other. However the idea that the Klingons would have a ship full of sleeping Klingons ready to fight the Federation at some future point seemed a stretch to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"People Power Explained","review":"This is a compelling book with well-supported arguments. \\"The Unconquerable World\\" explains why ventures such as the U.S. in Iraq are doomed to failure.My favorite section is the one dealing with the collapse of the Soviet Union. Modern American myth has it that the U.S. was solely responsible for the \\"defeat\\" of the USSR - through Afghanistan, the insane weapons race, etc. While these surely had their contribution, Schell describes the rise of people's movements in Eastern Europe that, without actively intending to bring about the demise of their oppressor, did just that.I highly recommend \\"The Unconquerable World\\" for anyone wishing to understand social and political change, and the very real possibilities of non-violence as a path for these changes."},{"rating":"2","title":"How the world works explained well","review":"The book my be getting a little old now, but I think it still applies thoroughly. The basic point is that nuclear weapons make conventional war impossible between major powers and guerrilla war (now called terrorism) makes military subjugation by outside powers largely impossible.

A crime! This superb suspense-thriller is second only to DELIVERANCE in the \\"survival horror\\" sub-genre. The story is intense, the characters are believable, and the mysterious stalker / killer is actually frightening. Hal Holbrook (THE FOG, CREEPSHOW) is perfect as the central figure in this creeper. His odyssey is violent and ultimately tragic. A classic! I hope this will be released on disc someday, before all discs have gone the way of this VHS tape!..."},{"rating":"2","title":"forest dwelling killer","review":"This is a powerful, surreal and frightening film. Like Deliverance, It's mostly about the very thin veneer of civilization. Shot in a cinema verite style, the brutality and horror seems almost documentary like, unlike Deliverance where there are practically signposts saying \\"meaning here\\", this film allows the horror and absurdity of itself unfold itself slyly around the edge of the frame. (consider the brilliant satire of having the surgeons chant \\"take him apart! take him apart!\\" as they dance around the campfire. And the eerie shot of the forest dwelling killer standing on top of the hill, a shadow against the sun.)Wheras Deliverance was all about northern white guilt, the doctors in this film have something to be guilty about. I think \\"Rituals\\" is great but the film reveals it's limitations, it's lack of guts, and it's prettifying of nature. Ultimately \\"Deliverance\\" is a superior film."},{"rating":"2","title":"BRILLAINT!","review":"This book has changed my life. I thought astrology was a joke, that you couldn't base your life on it.

It is truly sad that this axe-man never really got top billing or rec'd much commerical success. His guitar licks are truly music to the ears. Marino's first solo, \\"The Power Of Rock & Roll\\" is a close 2nd to \\"Juggernaut\\", but I still like this one best... possibly for the magical and celestial feel I get from \\"Strange Dreams\\". Other good songs are \\"Midnight Highway\\" and \\"Maybe It's Time\\". No crazy metal or lite pop here - just your basic blue collar hard rocking tunage.

The first \\"Little House\\" book came out in 1932, and the books in Laura Ingalls Wilder's series dealing with her South Dakota years, beginning with \\"By the Shores of Silver Lake\\" were first published in 1937. So it is more likely that Rose, while editing her mother's books for publication, used (I hate to use the term \\"plagarized\\" but it almost fits) her mother's children's books as ideas for her own (she also did this with \\"Let the Hurricane Roar\\"). Both \\"Free Land\\" and \\"Hurricane\\" (reissued in the 70's as \\"Young Pioneers\\") are probably only of interest to those interested in Rose Wilder Lane, whom I believe was better at editing other people's material and writing short stories than actually writing entire books on her own."},{"rating":"1","title":"way too large","review":"i ordered this necklace thinking that it would be small and dainty. it is actually quite large and cheap looking. i was really disappointed"},{"rating":"2","title":"MUCHISIMO MERENGUE","review":"AQUI HAY MERENGUE PARA TODOS LOS GUSTOS.

It's pleasant to look at, and the singing is fine. The main problem is the balance. The orchestra is much too far in the background, as if the engineers mistakenly considered it to be accompaniment to the singing. As a result the spectacularly colored orchestrations, the harmony, and much of the DRAMA (!) of this work are lost in this video.

If you've seen the movie, \\"Young Guns II,\\" you'll remember Bushy Bill Roberts who claimed he was really Billy the Kid. History has made Billy the Kid into a legend, creating much mystery about the famous outlaw. Most people believe that he was shot by Pat Garrett in Fort Sumner, New Mexico in 1881. After reading this book by Helen Airy, it's hard to believe that Billy the Kid was shot at his early age of 21. Airy will convince you that he lived to be an old man going by the name of John Miller, his not so famous alias. Read about interesting \\"facts\\" on the Kid that may lead you to believe that history has it all wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well written book on John Miller","review":"Helen Airy wrote a convincing book for John Miller's case, but at times, even she seemed unsure of the accuracy of what she was writing. She documents the stories and beliefs of Miller's friends and family who believed he was Billy the Kid. The problem with the book is that most of it has been proven to be pure fiction. But, I do have to confess, it is fun reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"True Bellever","review":"This book convinced me that Billy the Kid did not die that fateful night in July 1881 - but lived to be an old man, dieing in Arizona in 1937. Yes, he was shot by Pat Garrett, but when those preparing his body for burial noticed he was still breathing, they secreted off his body and buried someone else in his place.Despite all the compelling interviews by those who knew John Miller, what convinced me was comparing the photo of Billy as a teenager with that of John Miller. The resemblance is uncanny.John Miller's body was exhumed in 2005. If his DNA is ever compared to Catherine Antrim's (mother), history may have to be rewritten. Don't hold your breath. Those who make their living off the legend of Billy the Kid being dead and buried at Fort Sumner are quite possessive of their \\"property\\" and unlikely to let the body be exhumed, assuming it's still there. A flood washed through the area in 1904 and may have washed the bodies away."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good beginner's guide book","review":"I have been learning about and exploring the topic of reincarnation for a long time now.

This book provided that for me. Contrary to the other books that I had read in the past, this book talks about various methods and how to utilize them for your own self discovery. Michael Talbot not only explains how to use these methods in a way that anyone can follow, but he backs it up with some documentation of his own experiences as well as others. I feel that if anyone wants to learn more about their past lives and themselves as a whole, this would be an excellant starting point.

Shocking, stunning reality of Sant Masters true abilities comes to light.His other books, such as above, are must reading for any seacher and will save decades of wasted time. Lane's character is above reproach ,remarkable. This man put his life on the line telling the truth.

His books shock you to the core of your being and are legendary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing polemics mar the value of this book.","review":"I have of course read David Christopher Lane's book on Eckankar, but find it disappointing because although it may be true as far as it goes it seems so polemical, so lacking in a kind of religious empathy or sense of balance and complexity, as though he were just out to find only the negative aspects of Twitchell or the movement."},{"rating":"1","title":"A largely unfounded treatise with an axe to grind.","review":"Little more than innuendo and rumor designed to attack an easy target. Mr. Lane has been on a 25 year warpath against any religion which remotely resembles his own. Eckankar falls into that category and thus is fodder for his grist mill. Some of his other works are even worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"a waste of money","review":"I wanted a way to inject solid marinades (i.e. large chunks of garlic, etc)into meat, so my choices were between this item and the Ronco injector. I made the wrong choice. While the description claims solids can be injected, the bellows design is miserable, half of your marinade stays in the bellows and the clean-up sucks. It isn't even worth the time to do liquid injection, as a regular needle injector is just as good, and you don't have the big cleanup. I never use this device and if I hadn't wasted $25 on it, I would throw it away."},{"rating":"2","title":"guam native","review":"The best injector, especially for deep fried turkey. Large bits can be injected, like Italian Dressing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Battery Hog","review":"I have long been a fan of SI-5 and have owned flat panel speakers from each generation. Others would disagree with me, but the first generation is still the best.These Gen3 speakers are extremely portable, have a good sound, better range than one should expect, and an improved power system over previous generations. Within that power system lie the problems that lower my rating of this product - it is sometimes extremely difficult to open the battery cover (hardly a blip on my review if that were the only problem) and this is something that comes up more often than it should because these speakers are battery hogs. Even without the bass turned on and, it seems, even without the speakers turned on at all, the batteries drain. On multiple occasions I've watched a film on my computer one night with new batteries in the speakers and no troubles. The next night, the quality of sound immediately dips with whatever I start watching, after only 2 hours of prior use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Explanation","review":"The book is a 130 year history of a Lutheran Congregation in north central Illinois, St. John's Evangelical Lutheran Church on the Hill, near Princeton, IL. It covers the birth of the congregation, from its German immigrant beginnings, its growth through the ministries of many pastors and congregants with special programs, to the 1980's. Each pastor of the congregation over the years is highlighted as well as special events and happenings. Photos are included, as well as favorite personal stories from various members of the congregation. The book was a project commissioned by the congregation, written by a Wartburg Theological Seminary student, from Dubuque, IA."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sibling Slam Book","review":"This book was bought for my daughter because her brother has Autism and sometimes that makes for some interesting living situations. She really liked reading what everyone wrote in the book and it helped her talk more freely about her feelings. The book made her realize she is not alone - which I really liked! It also helped facilitate conversations with our mobile therapist and my kids together. I would highly recommend this book as an escape and a way to start talking to your other \\"special\\" child. It is not a \\"fact\\" book, but it does work to get the family talking. My kids are 9 (daughter) and 7 (son)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tri Fold Lund","review":"Love the Tri-Fold Tonneau cover, I just wish it fit a little better.

The battery has a defect that I've never seen in any other battery of any type: it holds charge just fine (the computer will run for 2 hours with Wi-Fi and everything going), but it takes about a week (no exaggeration) to fully charge from empty to full. As you can imagine, this kind of defeats the purpose of having a battery at all; really, you can only use the batter in emergencies when you have no access to a power outlet, and even then, no more than once a week."},{"rating":"1","title":"Battery for Toshiba","review":"The first battery I received did not work with my computer.

Used equally over 4 months with two Mead offerings this notebook's front cover and a number of pages disattached completely with the back piece of cardboard on its way while the Mead notebooks were in fine condition. Also, notes taken with a Bic mechanical pencil would be smudged and faded on this book's pages while remaining clear and dark on my other notebooks.I will not be returning to Ampad notebooks and I believe my foray into top-bound books is also over as their ease of writing is outweighed by the difficulty of flipping through and searching your notes."},{"rating":"2","title":"I', a child of God - S.O.G.","review":"I really enjoiced this CD.

Granted, she filmed it two years ago when she was seventeen, but she was terrible. So was the rest of the movie. Cinematically, it wasn't even that beautiful. I would say the only good thing about the film was Kristin, and she didn't have any lines practically. Miranda Richardson was tirelessly annoying, as was the rest of the cast. The script is a wreck. The worst part about the film is that it had the potential to be great. A dark version of the classic fairy tale. Bring it on! It wasn't that dark, nor was it even vaguely interesting. However, I'll be buying it anyway, such is the beauty of Kristin Kreuk. Her acting in the film isn't great, but her charisma is captivating."},{"rating":"2","title":"The fairest of them all is Kristin Kreuk","review":"I saw this movie when it first came out on television a few months ago, and wanted to watch it again right away. Now with it on DVD, I can watch it whenever I want. Kristin Kreuk is the perfect young lady to play Snow White, she has the natural beauty of Snow White, and played Snow White flawlessly.Unlike the Disney version, this version of Snow White sticks closer to the Grimm tale, taking the mild horror aspect, and balancing it with the enchantment and hints of comedy and irony.I can't say that this DVD is packed with extras, but there are a few there. A commentery track I was hoping would be there wasn't present, but there is a short behind the scenes program and a Neutrogena Commercial featuring Kristin Kreuk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost a Great movie but...","review":"The only great actress in this movie is The Evil step-mother and Snow White is plain boring beautiful, they could focus less to find a beautiful Snow White and find a better actress with charisma, then the movie could have been Great. It's a very good movie, mysterious and creepy atmosphere and beautiful landscape and costumes. The dwarfs gets on my nerves, if they will only been dwarfs like they used too and if Snow White will had act good the movie will be a 5 stars but the only person who shine in this movie is Miranda Richardson as the Evil Step-Mother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Um...no.","review":"\\"Horrible\\" doesn't even begin to describe this rendition of \\"Snow White\\". There was so much wrong with this version of the fairy tale I don't even know where to begin, so instead I'll just focus on the Number One reason you should save your money: Kristen Kruek.Awful. Dull. Lifeless. Talentless. Kristen Kruek.She brings her lack of acting ability and lack of enthusiasm for her trade over from Smallville to inflict it upon this movie. I really don't care how pretty she is...she was, from a talent perspective, the absolute WRONG choice for this, or any, role.Avoid this movie at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible","review":"When I saw the preview for this made-for-tv movie, I couldn't wait to see it. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. The characters were annoying, the acting was bad, and the plot was terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really isn't that great.","review":"I didn't like this one. There was a jagged feel to the way the scenes lurches around and the acting--especially the dwarves--was bad enough that I couldn't immerse myself in the story.However, the imagery was breathtaking. Unfortunately, it wasn't enough to save the film."},{"rating":"1","title":".....\\"who is the C R A P P I E S T one of all??\\"","review":"This pedestrian attempt at storytelling has to be the most pathetically ridiculous interpretation of Snow White that I have ever seen. I should have known better than to spend ($$$) this film, considering that it was made by the same nincompoops who butchered Alice in Wonderland in 1999. I could write pages and pages about this film. ...PLEASE DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY ON THIS VERY LAME FILM. IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A LIVE-ACTION VERSION OF SNOW WHITE, SCOUT AROUND FOR A USED COPY OF THE OUT OF PRINT 'CANNON MOVIE TALE' VERSION!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So What? (instead of Snow White...) would be a better title","review":"I could tell by the previous reviews that the majority of the positives came from males obviously smitten with KK. While lovely, she came across as a porcelain doll instead of an accomplished actress. The only truly entertaining part of the whole movie was Miranda Richardson's contribution. Once again, you can detect the absolutely wonderful time she is having with the role. She was as delightful as she was in Merlin.[Recommendations:]There were some comments about the dark side of the fairy tale. If you want dark, check out \\"Snow White, a Tale of Terror\\". Though it may not perfectly follow what the Grimm bros. had in mind, it certainly captures a darkness that is intense and disturbing. Sigourney Weaver gives the title \\"wicked stepmother\\" new meaning!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting take...","review":"I found this enjoyable as a movie, but there were times when it seemed rather...flat. Some don't like it because it doesn't follow in the steps of the original animated version by Disney, but even THAT didn't follow the original fairy tale. In the original, there were no dwarves, but I like the dwarves of this one better than the animated one, especially with the way they incorporated the days of the week and the colors of the rainbow. The special effects were excellent.... Elspeth was a bit too vindictive and nasty for my tastes, but, hey, you can't win 'em all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hallmark does it again","review":"Another disappointing delivery from Hallmark, which is a pity, as Arabian Nights was excellent, and Merlin was pretty okay. I confess I was disturbed on one level: there was something terribly \\"Willy Wonca\\" about it. I think it was because the dwarves looked like oompah-loompah hybrids in their ridiculous rainbow costumes. The exceedingly wholesome and annoying dwarves are named after the days of the week (the Sleepy, Dopey, Grumpy thing was a Disney additive and no doubt copyrighted. In the original story they were nameless...) and these friendly fellows can - hold your breath for this one - conjure a magic rainbow and transport themselves about the countryside! There is also a giant dwarf dressed from head to toe in appalling yellow, apparently to inject some humour ... [shudder].Leave this one on the shelf, folks; if you are above four years of age you might find it sickening."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE","review":"I am HUGE fan of Fairy Tales and always love seeing different adaptations of different Grimm's Tales, but this movie was so ridiculous and boring that it put me to sleep. It's very rare that I watch a movie and want my money back, but I want my 15 dollars back!! Don't waste your money on this \\"film.\\" Don't even waste the energy watching it if it comes on cable, it's horrible! If you want to see GOOD adaptation, get Snow White: A Tale of Terror starring Sigourney Weaver. I had to give this movie 1 star or the review wouldn't go through, but I really give it ZERO stars. I'll be taking it to a white elephant party this Christmas...on second thought I won't even do that, no one should be put through the torture of watching this movie. Go with the Sigourney Weaver version!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Snow who?","review":"Is this really a story about the famous Snow White? Who ever made this should never make another movie again! The story is horrible, it does not follow the storyline from the original Snow White. The acting is even worse, Snow white has the same expression on her face throughout the whole film, the prince is a whimp and the dwarves?! Oh my god, the days of the week?Miranda Richardson was the only good thing about this movie. She completely stole the stage from the pittiful Snow White. This joke does not even deserve one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull as tombs","review":"Watching this program on ABC induced extreme trigger-finger on my remote. Sure, it was beautiful: Kristen Kreuk was gorgeous, the prince was cute and the special effects were nice to watch. But beauty does not a good film make! I was so looking forward to seeing a new version of the story- one with substance- but \\"Snow White- Fairest of Them All\\" definitely did not deliver on that count. Snow White herself barely had any lines; so how were we supposed to care about her as a character? The only mildly entertaining part of this production was Miranda Richardson's evil queen, but even that got old after awhile. Oh, and by the way, I will shoot myself if I ever again hear \\"You are. You are. You are the fairest of them all!\\" repeated ad nauseum!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid and Scary!","review":"Me, being 12 now still remember this movie from when I was 6, and it still to this day gives me nightmares, and I don't get scared easily.It was a horrible film, and totally re-written, it's not at all like Disney's Snow White."},{"rating":"2","title":"Snow White","review":"Excited to get this video - very happy with price and DVD. Our granddaughters have watched this movie at least 4 times already."},{"rating":"2","title":"Snow White-The Fairest of Them All","review":"I really liked this movie. It was a completly different take on Snow White. It had very good special effects. And the actress for Snow White showed a lot a depth to her character."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Beauties Here","review":"This is a really bad attempt at retelling the Story of Snow White.I was one of those poor souls who saw it on tv when it first aired. I am still surprised that they have it available on DVD.There is nothing magical about the film. The plot line is week and the acting is worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Of the Worst","review":"A lot of people have been giving this film a lot of credit and I can't quite get the why part in that. There are many other Snow White retellings that are far better then this. Such as Tanith Lee's \\"White As Snow\\" a great book for young adults and adults alike.\\"Snow White-A Tale Of Terror\\" staring Sigourney Weaver as the wicked step mother. So please save the money and look for a better retelling for Snow White."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I was lead to believe.","review":"This movie did not deliver what I understood the description to promise. It had moments of greatness, but they were underminded by the ridiculousness of the additions to the traditional Grimm's Fairy Tale.I love Snow White, played by Kristen Kreuk. Had she been given more to do, or had her life been more visited, rather than focusing on the silly witch-queen, the movie would have been great.The days of the week were just horrible. Don't get me wrong, the actors were great - Sunday, Saturday (the man who played Willow), and Monday were great - however, they should have been the dwarfs, not the silly days of the week. Wednesday just plain ruined everything. Disney's version of Grumpy was played much better.This movie is not worth watching...unless you have absolutely nothing better to do. But check it out from the local library...don't pay money to watch it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spectacularly Bad","review":"This version hyped itself up to be a dark, seedy version of Snow White. So, I was stoked. Snow White is almost an obsession for me. It's always been my favorite tale. Imagine my dissapointment when I watch this C-Grade version. It's so kiddiefied it's unbearable. Where's the dark? Where's the scary? Nowhere to be found unfortunately. The character of Snow White is so dullingly two-dimensional and good for goodness sake that you just want to smack her. Miranda Richardson tries, but can't get past the shoddy script. The chick from Smallville may be pretty but that's it. The only highlight is Warwick Davis (From Willow) who continues to be one of my favorite actors. If you want to see a REAL dark and scary version of Snow White (that's DEFINATELY not for kids) go and rent Snow White: A Tale of Terror. That'll scare the wits out of you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still Sounds Great","review":"16 years after this CD was released it still sounds great and after seeing the band live last week I can say that they still sound every bit as good live today as they did in studio 16 years ago. The other reviewers have covered the technical merits far better than I ever could, this album just strikes a chord for me because the time when it's songs got radio airplay was one of nothing but good memories for me. In any case, buy this CD, sit down, and give it a few good listens. It talks about so many things that everyone goes through in their life, its just sad that Doug Hopkins took his own before he could enjoy the appreciation this album received.John"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great edition of a classic album, does cost a bit more, but worth it in my book","review":"This was a suprise to me when it was release, about 10 years after the release of the original album, but as a fan, I bought it. The first disc is the Classic \\"new miserable experience\\", and the the second disc is a Collection of songs from their original album prior to this one \\"Dusted\\", and a couple of eps released that were hard to come by. Great music overall, worth the extra money in my book, and now more affordable for everybody else on Amazon. Check it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"gin again","review":"This is one of those CD's that you will listen to until you are sick of it, then you will put it away, and a few months later, you will pull it back out and the cycle will begin again. My favorite tracks are Hey Jealousy - \\"you can trust me not to think, and not to sleep around...\\" Until I Fall Away - \\"What the hell did you expect to find, Aphrodite on a barstool by your side?!!\\", and Cheatin' for the greatest steel guitar riff ever; and. there could be no more cleaver excuse line than, \\"you can't call it cheatin, she reminds me of you!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best of the 90's","review":"This CD has a special place in my heart. The songs are well written, the musicianship is supreme, and it's just an over all class effort. There is not one song on here that I don't like. Most fans will remember \\"Hey Jelousy\\" and \\"Found Out About You\\" from the radio. However, this CD is packed with quality songs. \\"Until I Fall Away\\" is a well composed and sentimental ballad that can tug at your heart. \\"Allison Road\\" is a fun up beat song with a country flavor to it that's just contagious. I grew up listening to this CD, and in my humble opinion it has stood the test of time. Just a quality recording you will enjoy having in your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bought this album used as a whim . . .","review":". . . and found it becoming one of my favorite albums.

Before Alternative Rock was cool, The Gin Blossoms were kicking around Tempe, Az with the pieces of what may be one of the greatest albums I've ever heard. \\"New Miserable experience\\" was one of the major albums of the early 90's when Alt rock became big. Songs like \\"Hey Jealousy\\", \\"Found out about you\\", \\"Mrs. Rita\\", \\"Hold me down\\", and \\"Lost Horizons\\" give testiment to the skillful guitar work as well as Robin Wilson's distinctive voice. This is a CD that goes well in the car or in your room while hanging out. This is deffinatly a CD to check out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great \\"road-trip\\" disc","review":"Whenever we hit the road, you can bet \\"NME\\" is in the ol CD bag. It is just a monumental songwriting masterpiece. \\"Hey Jealousy,\\" \\"Until I Fall Away,\\" \\"Found Out About You,\\" \\"Allison Road,\\" \\"29,\\" and \\"Pieces of the Night\\" are perfect.A great album."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Gin Blossoms Album So Far","review":"This has most of their hits and the best songs. I like this album quite a bit, but my only complaint is that there is too much sameness. This is one band that needs to try something new, for crying out loud! Just about every song has the same thing: emotional, crackling-voice lead vocal, a clean guitar, a dirty rhythm guitar, a very typical-sounding bass guitar, and drums. That's it. Somebody needs to tell these guys to buy new effects pedals or something. Having got that off my chest, what the band does with this limited sonic palette is actually pretty darn good. It just gets a little monotonous on repeated listenings to the entire album. Taken in smaller chunks (like their singles), these are nicely-crafted pop songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Their best album EVER!","review":"This is truly the gin blossoms greatest album ever. They have most of their best songs on this album like Hey Jealousy, Until I Fall Away, Found Out About You, and Allison Road."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mope, mope, mope. Jangle, jangle, jangle.","review":"Yeah, a great album. First bought it when I was in my early twenties and scarily enough, it still holds a lot of emotional resonance for me years later.The only thing is that, catchy hooks not withstanding, a lot of these songs all sort of blend together. You know - there's this girl, and she's dumped/betrayed this guy, and from the plaintive, needy way he sings about it, you can sort of figure out why. It's the perfect record if you're going through some post-adolescent angst but it might be a little irritating if you're past the mental age of, oh, say, fifteen."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Definate Favorite!","review":"This album is packed with some of my favorite songs. I got this as a gift for my buddy who took me to Vegas and Gin Blossoms were playing just for the company my buddy works with. You could go right up to the stage, no security like at a concert venue. Got to high five the band and took pics up close and personal. It was awesome. I've got most songs on my MP3 and listen to it in the gym. Makes for a great workout."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST SURPRISE EVER","review":"My friend told me I had to hear this cd, but not being a big bluegrass or country music fan, I put it off. Who knew what a mistake that was. I absolutely LOVE this CD. There is not one song on this CD that I don't like...even The Fox is a great song!!! This CD is in my top 5 favorites of all time. It has also opened up a whole new world of music for me and I love it!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Fusion","review":"I'm a lover of Celtic music from waaaaay back...and have also been a big fan of Alison Krauss and Union Station...but don't care much for the kind of bluegrass music that dominated the scene for so many years, with the hammering, repetitive bluegrass banjo driving and dominating what ought to have been a really enjoyable tune. I wasn't sure about this group, but I heard a snippet on the radio that I liked and thought I'd give them a try. They are wonderful, with a sensitive blend of bluegrass, Celtic, traditional folk and country influences, and whatever else fits, into a rather sweet and sincere sound that shows their absolute devotion to the music. I highly recommend them, and I will definitely buy more of their CDs."},{"rating":"2","title":"What took me so long to buy this","review":"The light house song has you wondering did this happen for real. That song alone you can play all day. The mandolin puts you in a hypnotic trance. I really enjoy what I call story songs. Also reminds me a little of Harry Chapin and Jim Croce, you could listen to the whole album on the road, rainy days, or sipping hot chocolate day dreaming, Alison Krauss music as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Won't Leave Home Without It!","review":"I can't say enough good things about \\"Nickel Creek\\". I stumbled across them accidently while watching a Christmas special on CMT and didn't even wait to preview the CD, I just went right out, bought it, and I love it! As soon as I heard \\"Reasons Why\\" and \\"The Lighthouse's Tale\\", I was hooked. Of course \\"Out of the Woods\\", with it's harmony and awesome instrumental ending and \\"When you Come Back Down\\" are also incredible, and don't forget a kleenex when you here \\"The Hand Song\\". I've already gathered a group of friends and family to see them in concert and I can't wait! I'm also a huge fan of Alison Krauss & Union Station (Alison Krauss produced this album) and I'm sure that Sara, Sean and Chris of Nickel Creek will see the same success as them. Do yourself a favor and buy this CD. You, and everyone who will want to borrow it, will love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Uncommon Talent","review":"It's not often that I find a CD that I simply can't grow tired of playing. I first heard Nickel Creek on \\"Prairie Home Companion\\" nearly a year ago and was amazed. I couldn't forget them and finally requested the CD for my birthday.It hasn't left the car's stereo since.From soaring melodies to short solos that showcase individual talents, it's not often that you hear arrangements this tight and polished. Not a fan of bluegrass? Folk music? Acoustic instrumentals? You will be when it's this accessable, yet subtly complex. My grandmother cooked this way; outstanding meals that made you automatically reach for seconds, yet all the more enjoyable if you took the time to chew and digest what she was offering.Grams had 75 years of cooking experience behind her apron. What else is this trio going to accomplish before they can buy their first beer?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Touched my heart","review":"I have enjoyed the pureness of Allison Krauss' voice for years. While listening to CMT, I heard Nickel Creek, and, not knowing who they were, assumed it was Ms. Krauss. When I saw this new group, it instantly stirred something within my heart. My fiance surprised me with the CD, and now it is all I listen to! Sara's voice is so real, true and pure...the harmnoies are so soothing and melodic, and the instrumentals are beautiful. You have to listen to this CD, I promise it will touch your heart and soul!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fab!!!","review":"I first heard NickelCreek on NPR, I think on the Hudson River Sampler. Their rendition of \\"the Fox went out on a chilly Night\\" was way more fun than I remember it as a child's folksong. Instrumentals such as \\"Ode to a Butterfly\\" and \\"the House of Tom Bombadill\\" provide good rolicking fun!The blending of voices and exciting riffs on guitar, fiddle and mandolin belies the musicians' youth. These are very talented musicians and I look VERY forward to hearing their future endeavors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great From Start To Finish!","review":"After seeing a few Nickel Creek Videos on CMT I was instantly hooked on their sound. This CD is refreshing to hear in this day and age of \\"Pop/Country\\". The band sticks to traditional Bluegrass and sometimes Celtic ideas. The musicianship is remarkable and the sound of the recording is top-notch. A great mix of up-tempo songs and hauntingly lovely ballads make this CD a welcome edition to any collection. Do your stereo a favor and play this CD often! P.S. The group's fiddler Sara Watkins is beautiful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect","review":"this cd has a great mix of both vocal and instrumental tracks. Sara Watkins' voice is a bit thin, but at the same time it suits the mood of the songs. all three are virtuoso players on their instruments. This cd provides perfect background music."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic already","review":"If you like a combination of bluegrass and Irish folk music, you will love this album. It is hard to believe that these performers are as young as they are, but their creative talents and abilities to blend together are very hard to believe. I am not a huge bluegrass fan, but caught sight of them on a retrospective on TV and was absolutely knocked out at their skills. A delight to listen to, and well worth any acoustic fan's CD rack!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful CD that keeps on giving","review":"I love this album. From bluegrass to folk to celtic, Nickel Creek shines. Their vocal harmonies are so perfect it is as though they were made for one another! The lyrics found throughout the album also make it clear that Nickel Creek is a band of real substance, and true humanity. It is clear that they make music because they love it, not because they want to get rich and famous. This album is probably the best album I've purchased in the past 5 years, next to David Grisman's \\"Hot Dawg\\" album. Buy it now, and share it with every music lover you know. Nickel Creek will transcend any and all genre barriers and make fans out of anyone who hears them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bluegrass is back and better than ever!","review":"The wonderful thing about true musicians is the feel they have for combining things. In the case of Nickel Creek, they not only combine feeling with virtuosity, they also bridge the chasm between pop music and bluegrass. Not to worry, Bill Monroe fans; this is not pop music, but the average Celine-Dion-listening American (such as my wife) will find this a very accessible style. My only additions would have been a cover of a good high-speed traditional, and maybe a steel guitar or dobro.

Maybe it's the innocence of youth or maybe they're great musicians -- maybe both!! My only objection is that the CD is not long enough. I want more!!

Do your psyche a big favor and get this CD!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ok it's not bluegrass...Is that really so bad?","review":"On their debut Nickel Creek reaches across a variety of genres to make some truly original music. Sticking with trad instrumentation and with production by Allison Krauss, they stretch beyond the confines of one particular sound and in the end make a delightful mixture. The vocals could use a bit more emotion, but the sheer joy of their playing comes through. I know traditionalists have been less than pleased with this, but I found a lot to enjoy here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!!!","review":"I saw Nickel Creek play at Billy Block's \\"Western Beat\\" in Nashville recently... and wow, what talent! Incredible energy, incredible licks, and incredible talent. You will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"I was recently gifted a Pro-ject Debut Carbon turntable. I've wanted a turntable for years, but couldn't pull the trigger on one due to either extremely cheap products, or extremely expensive ones. When I saw the carbon come out, I felt as though I should just go for it. After listening to several albums, I knew I made the right choice. It sounds amazing! Much better than CD's or even my high resolution audio files. It has exceeded all of my expectations. Anyway, more to the point, even though all of the records I played on it sounded absolutely fantastic, this Nickel Creek album outshines everything else I have in my collection. You can close your eyes and picture the band playing right in front of you. Every little detail is there. It's so beautifully done. Whoever recorded and mastered this album knew what they were doing. I can't stop listening!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Blue Grass!","review":"A very young group that cut their first albumn before they cut their teens.

I would really enjoygoing to their concert...can't wait for their next albumn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nickel Creek","review":"This disc is OK. It sounds too much like Alison Krauss for my taste. Her music is too austere - not enough picking. They seem to be pretty good, the music doesn't appeal to me. When it comes to Bluegrass, I like Del McCoury, Ricky Skaggs, and Blue Highway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"It's definitely not bluegrass, if that's what you're looking for save your money. It's more enfluenced by Celtic and jazz, I think. Some of the songs I really like, but top to bottom I don't think it's that good. I just saw them live at Wintergrass in Tacoma. They are talented musicians and have great voices, but the style they play just doesn't appeal to me very much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland music to doze by . . .","review":"This music is really, really, really boring.

Have these guys ever considered picking up an electric guitar. The songs are what some would say a fresh batch of sunshine I read that line in a magazine about this trio once that is very corny to say about music. The quality is there and the songwriting is some what there but these guys are young if they want to get on the main country circuit they need to electrify themselves put some slick arrangments on there music and the two guys should put on wranglers and the gal in the middle well she's all right.

I'd never heard of Nickel Creek until just a few weeks ago when I happened to catch their video of \\"Reasons Why.\\" I immediately ran to my computer to order the CD. In the couple of weeks since I received it, it's all I've listed to - in the car and at work. The musicianship is superb, while the songs are beautifully written and arranged.

After seeing Nickel Creek at Merlefest a few months ago, we have finally found a CD we can both listen to. There's hope for her yet! Every year at Merlefest, one group gets all the buzz, and this year it was Nickel Creek. That buzz was well deserved. Their harmonies are heavenly."},{"rating":"2","title":"bluegrass and more","review":"These guys are fantastic. I love artists that take a style and bend it until it becomes their own thing.

Three highly talented musicians do what they do best. The album is wonderfully raw and unique. the voices are great, the instrumentation is magnificent and there is the right mix of vocal and instrumental. I personally would not call this bluegrass, more folk-based with bluegrass influence. Best tracks are the opening two, The Fox and When You Come Back Down.This album is just faultless. It has a unique feel, the right balance of vocal and instrumental, excellent talent, immaculate production and raw ability shown to the full."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Bluegrass Music to come along in 10 years.","review":"The first time I heard Nickle Creek was on The Grand Ole Opry and the first time I saw them live was at the Grand Ole Opry 75th Birthday celebration. I lost two pairs of socks, both times Nickle Creek blew them off. I had to pick my chin off the floor several times. In other words these kids are grrrrreat ! ! . I'm so glad to see the younger generation getting exposure to pure unadulterated music. They have their own style of Bluegrass. Unlike todays copy, cloned, bubble gum country music, these youngsters are a breath of fresh air for us older folks. I'm proud of them and hope they keep their music as pure as it is for years to come. Go out and git ye one ! !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Extreme Depth of Musical Ability","review":"This CD was my introduction to Nickel Creek. All three of these musicians are phenomenally gifted, and each shows expertise in their respective instruments. The music is well balanced, expertly written and executed perfectly. The songs are meaningful, and thoughtful.You do not necessarily have to be a fan of bluegrass to enjoy this, as it mixes traditional bluegrass with modern twists."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic!","review":"The Nickel Creek CD that brought them to the mainstream and it is one amazing collection of songs.

But I was so enchanted, I immediately bought the CD. Sara Watkins's voice & fiddle still mesmerize me.It's now December 2001, and I am just beginning to appreciate and enjoy this CD. Some of the bluegrass and celtic elements were a bit too heavy for me to jump right into. I adore \\"Ode To A Butterfly\\", \\"The Lighthouse's Tale\\", \\"Out Of The Woods\\", \\"Reasons Why\\", \\"When You Come Back Down\\", \\"The Hand Song\\", and \\"Pastures New\\". The others seems to drag the album down a bit, but overall this CD is excellent. It's a great album to introduce yourself or a friend to bluegrass music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nickel Creek","review":"Since Chris Thile is a member of this band, I got two of their CDs. NICKEL CREEK and THIS SIDE. Music reviews can be so subjective, can't they? They're technically quite accomplished musicians, but somehow they bore me. I can't explain it. They just don't touch me in what the locals would call my deep heart. Same problem I have with Brahms. Sorry, mate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is this inspirational or what?","review":"I heard Nickel Creek on Music Country the other day (The Lighthouse's Tale) & the song was so inspirational in that the gentle strings of this band make me wanna start writing music."},{"rating":"2","title":"NOT BLUEGRASS","review":"I gave this CD 4 stars to be fair to the musicians and their talents. They are excellent to superior musicians. However, I bought this CD, because I heard they were an upcoming \\"bluegrass\\" band. This is not bluegrass, not real bluegrass. It is a folksy, almost jazz sort of music but not bluegrass. Because I don't enjoy the bluesy, jazz takes on bluegrass, I was unable to enjoy this CD, but I don't think it makes it a bad CD, just not my style of music. I agree that the musicians are spectacular, but I just wouldn't listen to the CD again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing.","review":"It is the number of errors in this book that I find so frustrating! It seems obvious that no one took the time to proofread it. I picked up this book to do some french revision and by the time I got up to lesson 8, was ready to throw it in the trash. Accent marks are used only sporadically (sometimes ecrire, sometimes écrire...) They especially seem to have problems with \\"la rue Whitehall\\". In the french text, It appears as \\"la Whitehall street\\"!The pluralization errors have been irritating, too. If this is intended to teach a beginning student proper French, I feel it will do nothing but confuse him/her.I do NOT recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Poor, and Confusing","review":"Even though this book gives decent information about French pronunciation, which is a very useful way to not only learn how to speak the language, but have a grasp on how to say new vocabulary as well, it starts getting confusing once it just randomly jumps into passages, expecting the reader to all of a sudden know how to comprehend the written language without grasping grammar first. Maybe it would have been useful with the aid of an audio CD, but unfortunately it doesnt have it. And another problem with this book is the way it randomly presents new vocab when it has nothing to do with the context of the passages. Possibly a beginner can get through this book, but it would unfortunately be a long and tedious chore that will eventually bore one out of their mind! There are so many great french learning books out there, and this is NOT one of them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best way to learn French.","review":"I used this book about 15 yrs ago and it made it super easy to learn. If you want to learn French this is an excellent book to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too slow and randomly written; poor teaching tool","review":"This book assumes students of French cannot learn rules of grammar. It is a slow, plodding work that teaches by memorization. It does not start out, for example, with the rules for determining the gender of French nouns. If you do not know the gender of a noun, you cannot figure out the articles, etc., that go with the word. There are occasional \\"rules\\" in the lessons, but they are not organized in a coherent fashion. This book is suited to people who have no capacity for learning rules of grammar, and who have oodles of time to kill."},{"rating":"2","title":"frontier post","review":"A model local military history and an introduction to the colonial era of southwest Michigan. For nearly a century this fortified trading post served as a staging point or a target for French, British, Spanish, American, and Native American ambitions in the western country. It participated in the Fox Wars, fell during Pontiac's Rebellion, and was twice raided during the American Revolution. The authors succeed in creating that context, while drawing upon the sparse local records to paint a picture of the French and Indian inhabitants (mainly Potawatomi) and the physical site."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good price for what you get","review":"This is a typical white gold ball earring. It's small (5mm as stated), but is a great price at $15 versus the other prices when you shop around. The post is a bit long which is annoying, but acceptable. The backing is miniscule so if you have clumsy fingers it may not work for you. But if you happen to lose earrings easily but require gold earrings for allergy reasons like me, this is a good buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"forgootten 'toons","review":"brings back memeories watching these cartoons whe my brother and i were kids..just wished there were additional episodes that we remmbered but were not on the tape..also wish the original sound track was available..(classical music(..otherwise a great value and very enjoyable"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple concept but soooooo fun!","review":"The idea of the game is fairly easy to grasp: you go around trying to redeem your family's secret recipes from exotic places around the world. There are 4 kinds of chocolates: bars, squares, infusions, and truffles. Each kind has a bunch of different recipes. I am almost done with finding all the bar recipes and about half way through the squares and i am still soooo addicted! The little missions you receive which often ultimately lead to a recipe or money range from simply meeting someone at a certain port to spending a ton of time and money trying to produce a certain amount of chocolates.

Doctor Who has always been about friendship and respect. It is one of the last bastions for good,innocent adventure, something you wouldn't be afraid to leave out for the neighbors to see. But this book is not one you would want your kids to get hold of. There is far too much negative sexual aggression in it. ...P>This is _not_ Doctor Who!If you're into cyperpunk or dark fantasy this may be your type of book. If you're expecting a good Doctor Who story this is not it."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a cracking read","review":"'The King of Terror' is yet another fantastic novel by the great Keith Topping. If you loved his previous co-written efforts (like 'The Hollow Men') then you will really enjoy this non-stop cascade of imagery and word-play. A clever novel, depicting violence but not glorifying it, discussing relationships but not being over-taken by them, 'King of Terror' is a terrific read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A combination of espionage thriller and space monsters!","review":"With a ludicrously over-the-top title and a plot that seems to have been cobbled together from about five different novels, it's hard not to love The King of Terror. I could be wrong but I think the author got a tad carried away halfway through because there are one or two chapters where the plot stands still, but this is wildly ambitious and never-less-than-fun ride. I particularly enjoyed its very British take on a few US sacred cows. It may not be for all tastes - the Turlough kidnapping subplot, for example, has received a lot of negative comments in the past. I must admit, though, I found the idea of a stereotypical \\"alien abduction and probing\\" being doen by aliens on ANOTHER ALIEN to be really, really funny. I suspect that was the intention."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rug Power!","review":"...so called because it sounds as if there's a pretty thick rug over the speakers. I recently found an old box of cassette tapes from my childhood when I used to record off the radio, using a built-in mic, onto cheap fe tapes. This sounds worse than any of them. The only appreciably different mix is that of Raw Power itself, which has atrocious backing vocals - thankfully taken off the finished version. The radio broadcast is amusing but the djs only play more rough tapes which don't sound particularly different. You don't need this album!!! There's a reason Raw Power is held in such high esteem - it was a pretty wonderful record that sounded just fine the way it was released the first time!!! Try and get a vinyl copy of that, or an original CD reissue - get the Iggy remix if you have to, but leave this one in the bargain bin where it belongs."},{"rating":"1","title":"UNNECESSARY","review":"This CD was a popular alternative to Bowie's thinly-mixed version of Raw Power for many years, but now that Iggy's superior sounding re-mixed Raw Power is out there really is no need to buy this CD unless you are a diehard collector. The first seven songs (same sequence as the Raw Power CD minus Shake Appeal) sound good, but the numerous alternate takes are horrible sounding. Buy the re-mixed Raw Power instead, and if you're curious about the alternate takes, check out the Studio Sessions CD - three of the alternate takes appear here as well as other outtakes from the Raw Power recording sessions - it's a much more interesting CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Muffled and Unremarkable","review":"This selection of Stoogiana is worth a pass. The demos herein are not up to standard, and the production sounds as it were strained through cheese cloth, a Melita filter, and petroleum jelly. Get Iggy's remixed \\"Raw Power\\" and know what recorded mayhem should be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Historical value","review":"This CD is not exactly what it promises to be. Maybe the first seven tracks really are the original, pre-Bowie mixes of the album, but not with the sound quality they would have been released for sure! They don't sound as if they were taken from the original tape. By today's standards, they have near-bootleg quality. So buy this CD for what it is: a piece of history. You'll enjoy listening to the alternate mixes and the radio show. Unfortunately, the best version of \\"Raw Power\\" is still the originally released one, which may not be available anymore. The version available at the time of writing has allegedly been remixed by Iggy himself, but not for the better."},{"rating":"1","title":"underwhelming","review":"The cover of this collection of classic TV themes makes it look like it's a winner, but when you see the track listing and listen to the compilation overall, it's very disappointing.The collection has gathered popular TV theme songs but there are so many that you do want that are not here: Facts of Life, Different Strokes, Maude...a lot of the kitschy songs are omitted, preventing this from becoming a true guilty pleasure.

I suspect, but don't know, that it needs to be updated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Holocaust story for everyone","review":"I have read a number of books about the Holocaust, but this one is different. It gets inside the mind of a teenage girl who is separated from her parents and grouped with 100 boys and girls in the same situation. They are on the run from the Nazis, first in Belgium and then in France. On one level this is an adventure story of the highest order as Inge moves from one dangerous situation to another. On another level, it is a psychological study of a survivor, and of the burdens that it brings. There is little in the way of sentimentality. Rather, it is about real feelings and inner conflicts. I couldn't put it down, and find myself thinking about it long after finishing it. I purchased six copies to give to family members."},{"rating":"2","title":"A different look at the Holocaust","review":"Most books on the Holocaust reflect the horrible trials of those murdered or sent to Concentration Camps. This is a story of a young girl sent by her family to Belgium from Germany before the war. She is tossed into the whirlwind of war and her separation from her family is greatly traumatic for her. She faces her difficult teen years as a refugee in Southern France. The North of France is occupied by the Nazis, who ultimately control the French Government, both north and south. Each year she grows closer to her 18th birthday, she is painfully aware of the French laws will allow her to be turned over to the Nazis and deported. She is not alone in her travail. This story tells of the genuine goodness of those who helped shelter her and get her and many of her friends to Switzerland. There is love, loss and decency. A really different prospective. Should be read by all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Janice Harper","review":"What a singer! What a voice! why this CD has not become a great hit for her I will never understand.

This CD was released a few years ago with dialogue in-between the songs. Its now more like the original LP from 1968, but far from complete. If they truly wanted to release a great \\"Special Edition\\" soundtrack, they should have included the fantastic score by Irwin Kostal/Sherman Bros.

The melodies get stuck in my head and I don't mind the kids listening (and singing along) to most of it. The problem is simply that this CD is created from a bad master, which leads to audio glitches on Leave Her Johnny Leave Her, a buzzing sound during Grey Funnel Line and skips all the way through the title track, Home from the Sea. It is a shame that an otherwise beautiful album is so error-stricken. Try a different album or skip over those three songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK not the best","review":"The CD,it only has a few good songs like \\"I'm a Believer\\",\\"Heart and Soul\\",\\"Listen To The Band\\",and \\"(I'm Not Your)Steppin Stone,besides that its all down hill.A couple of songs on it were made after Peter left.\\"Ceiling In My Room\\" really brings it down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"Decent movie with poor to bad acting, but it never ended.

This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Rich, jaded people in search of \\"something more\\" journey to Morroco and end up shattered and destroyed against breathtaking cinematography. It's all supposed to be about spirititual enlightenment but it comes off as pompous and preachy. Nothing subtle here.

I began with the orignal Palm Pilot. My Tungsten E is awful. The Palm OS is still the best, but something has happend with manufacturing quality control. The power button problem, heard about often in reviews, showed up within months. Mine no longer operates at all. I turn it on by using the other buttons and need to let it shut itself off using the time-out function. This, of course, makes poor battery life even worse.The other major problem is that I can no longer even use graffiti because the sensitivity in the writing area of the screen is all but gone, despite the fact that I used protective screens on it. I now have to use the typewritter screen to enter data.At this point I'm so upset with Palm that I can't see rewarding them by buying another as a replacement."},{"rating":"1","title":"The whine from the screen is driving me crazy!","review":"Two weeks after I bought my Tungsten E, the whine started.

The tech support isn't very helpful - the thick Indian accents make the technician difficult to understand and they just read through the same list of trouble shooting techniques that you can find for yourself on the PalmOne website. At this point I have spent around 8 or so hours trying to get it to work without any success.

I had a much loved Palm 105 that was perfectly adequate. However, the Tungsten E is a joy. The display is superb and the range of features extraordinary for the price.My only gripe and it's a minor one is that if you're used to six weeks' life from AAA batteries, you have to get used to a weekly recharge of the lithium battery. Palm claim that 'average' usage is 20 minutes/day. If you use it for much longer than 20 minutes, you'll be recharging frequently.Palm really do have a winner here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not reliable","review":"I had TE for 11 months now, just died last night.The reason I picked TE are:1.

The price was decent, I wasn't going to spend >$200 on an electronic organizer.Now, I regret my decision very much. $200 worth of equipment is not cheap for me, and spending $200 I expect the instrument to last at least 5 years. I am not one of those people that like to change to new product every year (nothing wrong with that, it's just not me). And it is not worth it to get it fixed either due to it's poor warranty, if you could even call it that.My next PDA will not be a Palm/PalmOne made, I simple do not trust their product anymore.

For one the battery life stinks. It could just be mine but it has a battery life of a couple of days. It has NO PERSISTENT memory! So when the battery goes so does the info. I though I could do a work around by making sure it was charged every night. Guess what? I never was able to consistently charge it and then I was back to an empty palm. Heaven forbid you go on a trip and forget the charging cord. AND to top it all off it has a battery attached to the motherboard so if you want to change it you must either send it into palm or by another and do some work to open the case with non standard screw driver and then solder a connection to the batter.Yes sure it has a beautiful screen and great functionality but without battery life it's only use is a paper weight.So run away - very far away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware!!!","review":"I've owned my Tungsten E for less than a year, and I am very displeased with it's performance for a variety of reasons, but most of all because of its defective battery system.

This, of course, renders the unit completely worthless, since it only works when plugged into the wall. Oh, and by the way, Palm sells this product with only a 3 month warranty (as opposed to their usual 12 month warranty).

Then, to make matters much, much worse, the software on the PC (Palm Desktop) started crashing every time it was launched. So now I have no way to get at my databases, and no PDA.

(A Palm Pilot is not very useful to me if I can't hear the alarm!) Their sham of a warranty on this product is 3 months and I could not convince them that it was a bad way of doing business if they did not replace the unit 'cause I would tell all my friends about it. Hope all of you out there heed this advice and avoid this unit.Too bad. I really like the feature set of the Tungsten E. But an unreliable handheld is an unlovely creature.

For an additional $75.00 I could purchase a new one! Additionally, who ever heard of paying a flat rate for repair without a diagnositic?

IT IS THE ONLY TUNGSTEN THAT HAS 90 DAYS WARRANTY. Other models all have 1 year. Pretty smart Palm! Obviously they figured out this one can't last long.Ok, about the problem. It won't turn on any more, no matter what you do, soft reset, hard reset, etc. I figure it's either the power switch or the screen.

The first one was my own fault, I dropped it on the floor and the display cracked. The second one was a Tungsten E which lasted a little less than 2 years. Then it started to behave erratically, leading to a complete breakdown. Because I assumed it was some bad luck I experienced, I purchased another Palm, this time a Tungsten 2E. It has functioned for about 2 years, then when I wanted to switch it on, it remained black. Dead.I loved the functionality, and I am really helpless without the hundreds of contacts, my to-do list and my agenda. But a PDA has to be reliable.The Tungsten doesn't come exactly cheap either. What happened to the price? As far as I can recall, the last Tungsten I bought for $200,- or so. Factory new, not refurbished. Now I have to pay over $400 for something which typically breaks down within two years? Is this a joke or so?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Piece Of Trash","review":"This is a VERY basic unit with good screen visual. There is no way that you can get DAILY tasks on the same DAILY calendar page, either on screen or in print. What is more, one cannot even isolate DAILY tasks so that the only way to view tasks on computer or Tungsten e is to view (or print) the entire list of tasks! This is an awkward form of task management.Five days after arrival, the hotsynch stopped working despite everything I have tried as well as the advice of long time tungsten users and our firm's professional computer consultants.Attempts at support have resulted in forever re-routing ending with clueless people unfamiliar with the Tungsten e or the English language.The only use for this silly excuse for a PDA is as a paperweight.

It's essentially unusable as a PDA - which to me implies something you ues AWAY from you desk for productivity.Simply: the battery will run out after maybe one hour of use. Stupid. Worse: you can't replace the battery when it wear out.So, for $200 you get a plug-in, disposable PDA. If that's what you want, well........I think a quote from another viewer sums up Palms strategy for the E:\\"Most of the minor issues with T|E will go away if you spend double and get a T|T3.

When we called to ask for the correct charger we were told the part was on 10 day back order but that we could purchase direct from Palm's website and receive it by the next business day! No way will we purchase anything else made by Palm. Palm's customer service SUCKS! They've outsourced so you need to understand Farsee to speak with the customer service reps in India and Spanish to speak to the repair site in Mexico.

Palm says on its website it does not support a Win 7 64 bit sync interface, which it is responsible for providing - no driver written, with no expected availability date.

The software seems to be very immature, even though it has been out for quite some time.Palm needs to get a grip on quality.They need to stabilize their software.They need to stop gouging the public on support of their buggy product.The only reason they have any market share is that seemingly there are no better/reasonably priced products on the market."},{"rating":"1","title":"Burned by the 90 day warantee!","review":"I bought a Tungsten E assuming I was getting a \\"good value.\\" But, after about 5 months, the digitizer failed.

If you would feel bad about throwing away $200, be warned!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Anything Less Than One Star?","review":"I rate products on how they perform their advertised functions. The E performs its advertised functions but with 2 glaring flaws that make it a dud. First, the battery is of low quality. I had to take my first one back because it did not want to hold a charge after only a week. I later found out that this is a common problem. Considering you only have a 90 day warranty I would say buyer beware. Second, the screen will often crack for no apparent reason other than stress from the unit being assembled wrong at the factory. After 60 days my screen cracked for no apparent reason. It was sitting on my desk in perfect shape one moment and the screen was cracked the next. Not even the short 90 day warranty covers the screen and Palm will charge you $100 to replace the screen. If you insist on buying the E then go ahead and get ripped off further and buy the extended warranty...you will need it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long Live the Palm Pilot!","review":"I was beside myself when I realized that Palm no longer made/sold the handheld Palm Pilot.

I had some problems downloading the softwear and the owner of the company, Eduardo Vaz, telephoned me from Canada, ON A SUNDAY, and walked me through the process.The TE works flawlessly, I am back 'in business' again and I couldn't be happier.

The processor is very fast and what surprized me most is the quality of the multimedia capabilities.When listening MP3 the sound is Really great and very loud. I use it only in the 1st third of the volume. Also you can watch videos with fairly decent quality. (I whatched a full south park episode while waiting at the laundry).Without the SD card the device becomes rather dull, since you can't use the multimedia capabilities.

I could take it out of my purse when I got to work, set it in the cradle until I left the office. It was always charged and ready to go. This one has a bulky electrical cord to charge and a separate cable to hook to your computer to synch. This makes it more trouble to synch with home and office computers for me.

I am listening to it right know using my computer speakers. While driving, I place the E in a dash mount holder and plug my cassette CD adapter into the headphone jack and listen to my music. Better then a CD player... no skips!!If I had one complaint/wish, it would be for Bluetooth &/or wireless networking built in. That's in the T3 model, but at a lot more in price. Also, a user serviceable battery would be useful, although I have had no problems with mine.In Canada, my unit came with a 1 year warranty. If you purchase it, make sure you get at least 1 year coverage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Think about this: Why do they offer just a 90 day warranty?","review":"Purchased in December 2003. By April 2004, battery would not hold a charge for more than a few seconds even after overnight recharging. Useless. I checked the warranty: 90 days. So I'm stuck with a $200 piece of junk that I had just started using.Generally speaking, if a company has confidence in its product, it will offer a fairly long warranty period. If they offer just a 90 day warranty, there is generally a reason why. In my opinion, Palm has no business taking $200 from a customer for a product that they has so little confidence in. So I'll look at another company for my hext handheld. What you do is, of course, up to you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product, I looked at everything else 1st","review":"Decided the Tungsten E was the way to go...doc sharing out with excel out of the box, easy connect with Outlook. As a long time Microsoft user, I wanted Windows for my next PDA, but seeing all the features, there was no reason to buy anything else. I really liked the design of the Clie, but EVERY store I went to look at them, every on wouldn't power on, but the tungsten right next to it always did! This is a great product...I was even happily supprised to find out the USB interface also (trickle) charges the battery (don't need to carry the AC adapter around with me if I need to charge at home)."},{"rating":"1","title":"No guarantee","review":"I loved my Tungsten E at first--at least for the first 4 months; then it quit working and I had to perform a soft reset periodically. Lo and Behold! There is a REASON this is one of the 3 Palm PDAs that only has a 90 day warranty as opposed to a ONE YEAR warranty. It quit about 10 days after the warranty was up. Now, I have to perform a soft reset every single time I start up, which makes it highly impractical for whipping out and entering a Dr. apt or phone number on the spot. I am very unhappy because all this info will be lost unless I purchase ANOTHER Palm product. I suppose a solution would be to take my chances with another Tungsten E, which I am happy with WHEN IT'S WORKING, and purchase an extended warranty. Or I could buy a Tunsten T3 for an additional $200 and get the 1 year warranty. Or get another brand and lose 6 months of data. So annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazon info doesn't list the SHORT 90 day warranty","review":"The only way I found out about the 90 day warranty and shoddy customer service was to read the reviews that customers have provided. Amazingly, Amazon does not list this info in the technical data or anywhere else I could find it. I have to say that I am very disappointed in Amazon for this lapse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Differences to other Palm devices","review":"If you are considering this device, please be aware of several differences from many of the other palm organizers currently available.1. The screen on this unit seems to be much softer than the other palm units I have owned. In my opinion it is too easily scratched.2. The warranty period for this unit is only 90 days. After that you might as well buy a new unit.3. This unit uses the OMAP processor. I have encountered several software vendors whose products will not run on this unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Last Chance for Palm","review":"I've used the Palm Professional, M105, M125, M130 and the Tungsten E over the last several years. Purchased the Tungsten in late January 2004. The first problem was the Navigator not working unless it was pressed several times (right out of the box). After attempting to get an answer out of Palm for several days, I was informed that was normal until it was used for awhile (didn't say how much for how long). Yesterday, the power on/off stopped working. It can be turned on by using other buttons but now I have to set the feature that turns it off after no use to one minute. I've spent the day reviewing specs/features and I'm moving to the land of Dell. Why? This thing cost $199.00, only carries a 90 day warranty and it was handled as gently as a newborn baby. I compared this with an Axim last January and can't believe I missed the difference in features and warranty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Faulty and dismal warrenty","review":"I purchased a Tungsten E in May 2005 and only used it 3 or 4 times. In October the device decided to show only half of the screen. I tried everything on Palm's web sit to troubleshoot it, but no use. This product only worked for 6 months and now is dead after 3 or 4 uses. Total amount of usage was approximalty 2 hours during this period. Look for something else and possbily from a different company as PalmOne produces second rate equipment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keeps dying!!","review":"While it is very reasonably priced, it is still not worth $199. Why, because it only works part of the time. In the last 85 days I have had 2 different Tungsten E's die on me. The first crashed (wouldn't do anything) after 16 days, luckily Office Depot replaced it without any problems. This one lasted over 2 months before it locked up. BUT, before it died, it would not sync properly. It said it was syncing... but it never did anything.** If you buy this, be sure to get an extended warranty. **"},{"rating":"1","title":"For what it is worth...","review":"I purchased my Tungsten E in 2/2004. Was happy with it,no problems. Worked well for what I needed it for. Four months later it died, no matter what I did to it at the advise of internet support, it remained dead. I called their customer support hotline two times. The first time I was on hold for 30 minutes and never talked to a person. The second day I waited approximately 15 minutes and talked to someone who said my only option was to send it in and they would charge me an outrageous $125.00!! A new one is only about $50.00 more dollars. I have to wonder about the quality of their products if they only give you a dismal 90 day warranty and then it dies 4-5 months after purchase. It was not excessively or harshly used. The power button on my husband's Tungsten E has not worked since within approximately 4 weeks of purchase. PalmOne support is less than mediocre. Consider another model before buying this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Support stinks!","review":"This is a follow-up of my prior review. I have received a replacement product (not new as was mine) and it does work for now. I asked that they simply replace the Velcro strip on the back of the case since it can't be purchased from them on-line. After 3 calls to support, they refuse to help me with this 10 cent part. I've never been so frustrated with a product in my life. I'd think twice before you buy a Palm product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality and poor service","review":"Problems have ranged from very poor battery life to functions \\"locking\\". I've had extremely poor service. After less than 6 months my E died completely. With only a 90 day warranty I have no recourse and repair from Palm is $150+.

I cannot recommend Palm to peers and would not purchase another."},{"rating":"1","title":"BUY AT YOUR OWN RISK","review":"I purchased my Tungsten E Handheld in January and yesterday,March 23,the handheld would not turn on. I tried to work through Palm Customer support since it is covered for 90 days from date of purchase and WHAT A NIGHTMARE. If you speak Indian or Pakistani you may be ok but, it was like talking to a machine with no clue of what you are attempting to describe to them. Everything was like scripted... so... I contacted Amazon and EUREKA!!! in spite of their 30 day return policy, they are sending me a replacement unit. Let's see how long this one will function; after reading some of the other reviews, probably not to long. I bought this based on positive reviews and now it seems I have purchased an expensive piece of junk.

I had purchased TWO Tungsten Cs that both went down with bad screens.

I love the OS, but I sincerely hope that in the future they leave the manufacturing to Handspring, which is now part of Palm. All I can say is that I hope this merger results in real synergy, and does not result in Handspring PDAs which have the same abysmal quality control record as PDAs made by Palm.

The image we get now on the screen is like a piece of burned paper ash. After talking to his collegues at work, my husband found out that cracked screen is the #1 problem in all Palm products!

Read this","review":"Battery life is very short, software is slow and when it goes out of charge you lose all the data (except what's in the memory card) and you have to reinstall the software. On top of that BE AWARE that if you have any problem after 90 days, you will have to buy a new Palm (if you like the idea) since the repairing costs are $125+$39.99 + taxes. To call the Technical Assistance you have to add $25. My Palm after only 8 months does not turn on anymore and since batteries are non-user replaceable Lithium, my only option is to buy a new PDA, NEVER AGAIN IN MY LIFE A PALM.A lot of other clients had my same problem and this could really be a defective product.I want to underline the outstanding quality of Amazon's Customer Service, not responsible for the insulting low quality of this product. It will be a great pleasure for me to keep make my purchases on this site and I suggest it to all my friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whining noise","review":"I would give this handheld 5 stars - it has all the functions I need plus a nice bright screen if (and that's a big if) I could actually use it. After 90-day warranty expired, my unit started making a horrible whining noise that is coming from the screen - I don't even want to turn it on anymore, because I can't stand the noise. I don't think I'm buying another PalmOne product, just because they let so many people down by refusing the fix this defect. Just do a search on google to see how widespread this problem is. As far as I am concerned this kind of thing is next to stealing.

This is apparently very common for these units. Check out some of the forums around relating in particular to the battery problems. I checked with Palmone and it will cost $120.00 to replace the battery plus shipping (they will only replace at Palm). What is the point in buying a $200.00 unit if you have to spend another $120 after six months? You are better off buying a Zire."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Product","review":"The Tungsten E is a great PDA, especially for the price. It is powerful enough to handle my documents, games, ebooks, contacts and calendar, and doesn't have a lot of the \\"extras\\" that I just don't need- I've found that when you combine a phone and camera and a PDA, none of them work quite as well as I want them to.My only complaint about this PDA is that after about 6 months, it started to make a very high-pitched buzzing sound- I don't hear it unless it's right next to my ear, but it is definitely there. My coworker has a Palm Zire that does the same thing. Neither one of us is bothered by it, but it does seem like something Palm ought to fix."},{"rating":"1","title":"No support","review":"We purchased this item in October, 2003.

When I finally thought all of them were solved, the hardware problems started. First the on/off button started to \\"sink\\", getting harder and harder to push. Now the headphones and external speaker doesn't work at all, so more than half the functions I bought this product for are out of service. THIS IS MY FIRTS PALM AND I?M SURE IT WILL BE THE LAST ONE!!!! Some of my colleagues at work bought other similar products from Dell and HP and all of them are really happy with their investments. So there you have it, this is way all these big companies one day sadly are either bought by a bigger one or simply disappear from the face of the marketplace...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Product, Terrible Support/Warranty","review":"My first experience with hand held after my trusty HP 200LX. The functionality was great and I used it easily and quickly for 3 months. Then the Palm stopped working entirely - wouldn't turn on at all, 15 days after going out of warranty. Cost to repair $125. Palm told me to send it back to Amazon...as I might have better luck there.Most likely the last Palm product I will ever buy...and I'm not bashful about telling my friends my opinion either. If I ever risk another purchase of a Palm product, I will execise it to the nth degree while it is under warranty.By the way, the HP is still working flawlessly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe this will help with the warranty issue","review":"Based on the reviews I have read here, I have decided to definitely pass on this product. The wealth and depth of feedback, plus the fact that people DO return to the site to give feedback 6 - 12 months AFTER purchase does attest to the quality of this forum.I don't mean to speak out of turn or raise hopes falsely, but as regards the 90-day Warranty, has anyone attempted to avail themselves of the \\"Purchase Protection\\" (or similarly named feature) that ofen comes with a major credit card? These features typically state that that the manufacturers warranty is doubled up to 1 additional year, if the item was purchased entirely with the credit card. I just looked at one of mine (Visa), and see that although there are exclusions, hand-held devices appear not to be excluded - YMMV.Just a thought for those who find themselves with a toasted T|E outside the 90-day warranty mockery offered by Palm."},{"rating":"1","title":"The warranty is worthless","review":"On first appearance the Tungsten E is great value for money. As time progresses the flaws emerge...If anything fails after the first three months one might as well throw it away - the warranty is worthless ($129 or more to repair a $155 machine). The power button may fail - mine failed ten days outside the warranty.The battery has a very limited lifespan, and it cannot be replaced when it fails.Caveat emptor"},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute garbage...","review":"Not to repeat thousands of others experience, but straight out of the box my Tungsten E won't hold a charge more or less at all. Charge it full, let it sit on the desk turned OFF for four days and it's lost everything. Genuine piece of garbage. As others have said customer service is non-existant.NEVER BY A PRODUCT FROM PALM. PERIOD.Follow that advice and you can't go wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy unless you're rich & have lots of spare time","review":"The product itself would be great if it were reliable. After a few months (after the stingy warranty expired), my battery died. This was a big surprise, since my PDA was plugged into the charger about 90% of the time. The replacement battery is only available at Palm and costs about $125 plus about $40 more for shipping, etc. Add in your time to fuss around with this. What a rip off! I chose a Tungsten E, because I am retired and didn't have the money for a more fancy brand. I cannot afford a new battery. To discuss this matter with Palm, one must pay $25 just for the phone call. No thanks. I have signed up for a class action lawsuit and am planning to contact my Attorney General and the Better Business Bureau. I hope you do too if you already own one. Once the battery is replaced, it will most likely die again in a short period of time, since the product is clearly defective."},{"rating":"1","title":"I loved it... until the frickin thing self-distructed","review":"I got one for christmas and it has been with me every day. I loved every aspect of it. The speaker quit working on the third day, but the rest of it was really coolBut recently it died on me. Completely inexplicable. I didn't drop it or anything. It worked at night (luckily I did a hotsync) and the next morning it began crashing. After a bit, it never turned on again. I called Palm and they basically told me to pay 125 bucks for a refurb or cram a sharpend stick into my southern orifice.I will never purchase Palm AGAIN! Please Boycott!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"TUNGSTEN E is E- !","review":"Do not waste your time. The Tungsten E is almost useless. The set up was terrible. Tech support took 3 calls and hot synch is still not correct. The battery is almost non-existent; after full charging it will \\"magically\\" dissipate without ANY use. Then the fun really begins - ALL my data is then lost - this has happened 4 times in the first 30 days of owning this. Oh yeah - when hot synch does work (rarely) it requires COMPLETE resetting of the entire unit ! The Vx I had for 4 yrs was perfect. The Tungsten E gets an E- instead of an F- because the screen lights up nicely (for a short while!). Heh Palm - get tech support personnel who are willing to take the time and not rush you off the line. I'll never buy Palm again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well enough for me.","review":"I have had the Palm Tungsten E for 6 months. I have an expansion card in it. I have several dictionaries and books on the card and have installed databases on the handheld itself. I've downloaded trial software, deleting and undeleting, and have had no problems. I have had to do a soft reset twice. It syncs easily.One complaint so far is that the battery doesn't hold a charge very long. Maybe 2-3 of hours of continuous use. Another is that I don't like making \\"k's\\" with grafitti, and grafitti in general can be very annoying when I am writing quickly.I would recommend keeping it in a sturdy hard case. From reading the other reviews, sounds like it can get banged up easily.But this is my first Palm, and I am pleased with it for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"can NOT add bluetooth!","review":"I just wanted to clarify the posting from \\"uojfe from Eugene, OR USA\\". Althought bluetooth expansion cards exist, the Tungsten E can not use them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incompatible with docking stations!","review":"The software did not \\"update\\" my old Palm software so after I had THOUGHT I'd installed it, I had to uninstall the new software, uninstall the old software, reinstall the new software, download the extra software, sync with the new software, and then I tried to sync my data. Several hours later with no luck, Tech Services said, \\"many of our customers find they have to remove their laptops from the docking stations and connect directly to their laptops EVERY DAY in order to sync.\\" If you have the time for this inconvenience, it looks like it might have been a very nice handheld. Not me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"I bought the Palm Tungsten E for my 14 year old son last christmas...Everything was working just great until June ...so it only lasted 6 months!He took good care of it but suddenly it locked up and there is no way we can start it again even to reset it!So , what's the deal? only for 6 months!!!!And buying that online makes it even dissapointing because I can't get a possitive answer from them. I never have had any problem with the site, but with electronics , that is not a good idea to buy them from internet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea - lousy battery life","review":"Bought one of these for my partner last year. Works fine for her, but the battery barely lasts through a day's use. If she forgets to plug it in overnight, it's useless the next day (no power left). All other Palm devices I've owned (and that's been quite a few!) have a considerably longer battery life. I'm looking to buy her a holiday replacement to her E right now...so if you're thinking of getting a Palm device, I recommend steering clear of the E.Giving it 2 stars because I like the Palm...but if I was rating on battery I'd give it 0 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Service","review":"As you scan these reviews, count the number that applaud Palm service and responsiveness to problems. Then count the number of reviews that mention Palm service. No contest.When calling to replace my E's battery, I was told - get this - that once I allowed them to charge my credit card $161US, THEN they would tell me where to send it for battery replacement. I had to ask twice just to make sure I was hearing correctly. My business partner had the identical problem, bought a replacement battery on the internet for $40 and soldered it in place himself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two models dead and counting","review":"I was very dissapointed to read the rest of the reviews, as I thought that maybe I had just had a bad run. The Palm was bought for me as a Christmas gift 2003 (with an extended warranty). After 2 days, before I even got a chance to successfully upload the software onto the Palm, it froze and squealed. I had to wait for the battery to drain to turn it off.The retailer was very good and got me a brand new one pretty much straight away. All was good for a while, then the battery started to drain quickly. Now it won't turn on at all. This happened a couple of months ago BTW. After reading the rest of these reviews, I don't even think I'll even bother. April 2004"},{"rating":"1","title":"MORE LIKE A DOORSTOP!!","review":"I measured everything correctly. Set it up exactly how the instructions directed(EVEN DID IT TWICE,just to be sure). The thing came crashing down on my head after two pullups!! Called for assistance,but got none. Got rid of it already,i have a tower gym on the way. Really wanted this product to work, but to no avail."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good surprise for a change","review":"I was pretty skeptical about the quality of this items but the reviews were excellent so I took a chance. Turns out it is an excellent little pull/chin up bar for those days when I don't feel like braving the elements outside. Great for just grabbing a set when you walk by. Surprisingly stable and yes it actually stays put. It is NOT a dip, pushup, situp bar. If you are doing knee ups with the special attachments you better be a midget. They cheapen their product in my opinion by trying to make it out to do everything. Only real complaint is they needed another set of foam padding for the pullup bar. (Inside and outside of the close grip handles) Easily rememdied with some pipe insulation but they should add it themselves.A very good pull bar for the house."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Parts and Poor Design","review":"Having fully assembled my Creative Fitness Door Gym and placing it in the doorframe to my bedroom, I began to place weight upon it while gripping the thin foam horizontal grips provided. The cheap grips slid off the horizontal bars with almost no force. After sliding them back on and placing my weight onto the Door Gym again, The attachment point on the lower bars began to bend almost to the point of breaking. I weigh 155lbs. Hardly a weight that should cause issues with a Door Gym made to withstand years of pull ups and the full body weight of individuals. I am disappointed in the cheap materials used to construct the Creative Fitness Door Gym, as well as the poor design which allows the bars to nearly break when any weight is applied. Don't buy this Door Gym. You will not be satisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"be careful, it might not fit your door","review":"I loved the concept and was trying to have a chin bar for my daughter without drilling into the house. But my older house has thicker door jams, and this didn't work for me. There should be some door specs that would have made it easier for me to know in advance that this wouldn't fit. For newer homes, it is probably a great idea."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to set up and works great!","review":"It took me no longer than 10 mins to assemble the kit.

I sent it back and seller was nice enough to give a refund. My recommendation is the [[ASIN:B004FLECVS Perfect Multi-Gym Pullup] instead. For the same price you get a pullup bar that seems to be much more sturdy, well made and will fit just about any wall size you have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Item","review":"I am using the door gym daily since I got it. It is very convenient. Just make sure you measure the door well. If the size is not correct it might bruise the door a bit.

No need to screw any thing into the wall. I was worried that this may be unstable during use. Not so. Once it's in position- it's rock solid. Very easy to put into position and remove once your done.

Easily installed and accessible during all times of the day. Its been easy for me to make a habit of doing pull ups/chins due to being able to use it during work hours. I recommend it to anyone.

That however is not the issue. My girlfriend myself and her roommate all started p90x at the same time. I got this bar and they bought theirs for less at a certain megastore that starts with a W and ends in an ALMART for less money. Putting them together, my bar had a lot more flex to it at the joints, which is not a big deal because when loaded it didn't really matter. Now I used this bar for about 2 workouts, for both pullups and a pushup bar and in doing so I managed to bend the main bar, crack one of the acorn nuts, and dent a support. Also, the lack of other grip positions sucks for p90x. I ended up having to weld this thing together to make it worth using at all, and really the difference in price between this and other amazon bars is not worth the pain in the butt.

Also, the walls themselves and therefore the door frame is too thick for this to fit.The only requirement they tell you about is the width of the door. I have many doors fitting the width requirement, but none fitting the molding requirements. Lots of houses in New England have molding just like mine.

Instead, I have to tie around it two thick wool socks, so as not to damage my bedroom door.Since then, I have seen similar brands for this device that run for $18 at TJ Max or Big 5 and they seem to be better designed to protect your door frame. Avoid this brand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well after several years of regular use","review":"I bought this bar several years ago and it has withstood probably thousands of pullups. The hand pads and door frame pads did wear down a little after all the use but taping them up solves the problem.

It felt like it was literally going to snap in half!With this pull up bar, the main bar is one solid bar, so it is very stable. The rest of the design is essentially the same as the \\"iron gym\\" so you can still do all of the same exercises with it. I highly recommend this pull up bar.

No Steinbeck (one to be fair), Faulkner?? No Barbara Tuchman, Robert Caro or William Manchester??I'm sure there's some type of licensing reason for it but I hope Amazon is working hard to get more titles.Otherwise as far as the Kindle itself they sure got it right!!Having a choice of books at your disposal like that anywhere you go is just sublime. And there's something about the screen that just makes reading such a joy and this is from someone who loves to collect books.Also, being able to make the font bigger when your eyes are tired is just priceless.So there ya go. Lotsa love here but just add more books please!JK"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not like reading a real book","review":"I purchased this Kindle on a whim, a $300 whim. If you want to turn the Kindle \\"ON or OFF\\", you have to take the \\"book\\" out of it's leather cover to turn it on, then put it back in the leather cover. You have to \\"hold\\" the Kindle a certain way as not to turn the pages of the book. I really wish I would have put more thought into this purchase, before I shelled out a precious $300.

In all fairness, Amazon did send me a \\"free\\" Kindle as a replacement although I had to hold some money initially until the replacement was ahipped. This didn't make sense but whatever. It appears that the Kindles go into a freeze state and anything you do with it is fruitless. On my first replacement, it would not get to any of the book screens but would come up with a pop up in basic gobbledigook...could not discern what it was asking you to do. The one I am having replaced now will not turn off or do anything. This happened after downloading a couple of books and charging the Kindle. Seemed pretty simple things to ask of the device.

I no longer have to make room for new books or donate old books.

After its introduction past November and being out of stock for about three months I ordered my Kindle. First of all, it is very easy to use. The navigation system is friendly user and self explanatory for being the first attempt. Reading in this device is fantastic. Preview of books and ordering through Amazon is easy. In my opinion, what makes it different is the fact that you can do highlights, notes and look on the dictionary without being distract of the main idea...reading your book. At the same time it helps you to enrich your vocabulary. Im in love with this device. Recently I noticed more new adopters of this technology in the NYC subway system.

I love being able to download wirelessly and having a book to read within minutes. Price wasn't a factor for me. I started saving shortly after Christmas and it didn't take long.

Given the technology available at the time, the RocketBook was a much lesser product than the Kindle is, but it was revolutionary and seemed to hold promise. The one problem---and the reason the product never caught on---was its price ($300, if I remember well). There are many people who can afford to pay such prices, but the average reader cannot. I think it's unfortunate that Amazon seems to be making the same mistake as Nuvomedia. Unless the Kindle's price comes down significantly, it's hard to believe that it will ever become a mainstream product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredible Waste of Money","review":"Seldom do I find products, such as the Kindle, which are so outlandishly expensive for what they do. I've often wondered how the similar Sony product has stayed on the market for as long as it has - and the Kindle is even more expensive. I can find no valid reason why anyone would want to purchase this - at $400 bucks - just for the device that stores data, one can purchase a LOT of real books - that don't need to be charged, no less.The features are also rather absurd - Wikipedia?! Since when is that considered a reliable source for information? It's also interesting to note that Amazon suggests purchasing a separate light as an accessory. On top of that, one still needs to purchase electronic versions of books in order to use the Kindle.

For instance, I am reading a Denise Mina mystery trilogy. I'm on the seocnd volume, and wanted to read the third on my Kindle, but it's not available.

Yes I can see how you can flip pages accidentally but it is something you will have to get use to. The best feature is being able to download a sample of the book.

I read a lot of technical manuals with diagrams and the screen is too small to do it justice.2. Direct sunlight on screen causes letters to wash out. I think the screen is light sensitive, when reading in super bright light such as sunlight; I have to close the cover when changing pages to keep the letters from washing out.2.

The product is user friendly and light weight. I haven't had any problems with it. However, I feel the product could be improved. A backlight would be nice so that you can read in the dark. Also a rating option for the books you have read would be nice. I like how MobiePocket lets you rate on the five star system under the properties of the books. A synopsis that downloads or somewhere you can add one in order to see what the book is about would also be helpful.

However it is puzzling that a fiction book offered by Amazon costs more for the Kindle version than the hard copy version. I think potential Kindle buyers should know up front that not all books they select for purchase will necessarily be available at a lesser price for the Kindle version over the hard copy version.

I have a very stop-go lifestyle. I may be very busy for several hours and then have 10, 30, 120 minutes with not much going on and the kindle fills in those times nicely. It is comfortable reading in bed laying down or sitting on the couch or even sitting behind the wheel in a parking lot. Could it use some improvements? Sure. #1 for me is a better carrying case. Beyond that I would like better searching on the kindle store. For example, when reading a book in a series, I want to be able to see the list of books in the series and download the next one.

No more running to the bookstore or having to wait for the mailman to come to get the next book in a series. You can also buy decal \\"skins\\" from Amazon if your interested in dressing it up a bit. Thin enough to fit nicely in a purse. I take mine everywhere. Battery life is also very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"I saw the Oprah show talking about it and immediately knew I wanted it. I had my daughter buy it for my husband to give me for Christmas. I bought a book that day and started away. Love that you can change the typeface. The buttons can be a problem, but I've found if you always go to the home page before closing down, you eliminate the problem of pushing the page turner when turning on the unit. That solved it for me totally. The battery life seems very good. I also wish I knew how many pages there were and what page I was on. I miss turning pages of a book to see where the next chapter begins to decide if I keep reading or not.Those things are minor in my eyes.I am flying over the weekend and am exited to have it on the plane and on my vacation.If more finally come in, I probably will buy them for my 2 adult kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!!","review":"I have really loved having my Kindle. Debated long and hard which e-book to buy and decided on the Kindle. I am very happy about my decision. My favorite reading is Biographies of people from 1400 to now. These books get pretty heavy. I have arthritis in my neck and shoulders and holding those books can be a challenge for me. Thought that an ebook reader might be the thing and it has been. I have read a couple of books that I would never have bought and read but the sampling was interesting so I bought them. Good reading. Love being able the shop right on the Kindle without going to the computer. It was a great purchase for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Book Lovers Dream Come True","review":"Honestly i'm one of those people who reads 4 or 5 books a week. It used to be that i was always at the book store and my house was over flowing with books, with piles of them everywhere. Now, with this device, i'm able to actually get books as i need them, and not have piles of books everywhere. I love the design, it is so easy and simple to use, and the feature to change the text sizes is great for those days where my eyes are tired after a long day at work. The battery life is amazing too, it is shorter of course if you leave the wireless connected, but otherwise it lasts for days. Truely a great buy if you are constantly on the go, or someone who reads a lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific device","review":"The only complaint I have about the Kindle is that it is far too easy to accidentally hit the page button, often simply by picking the thing up. Otherwise, after five weeks owning the Kindle, I disagree with those who complain about the slow page display (seems fine to me) or the occasional back flash. The display is great, the selection of books and periodicals is satisfactory, navigation tools are fine -- it's just a great way to buy and carry reading material. I love getting the NY Times directly to my Kindle every morning."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Kindle","review":"I've had my Kindle for over a month now and it has been working great. I been an avid reader since I was young and I've tried to keep my books collection trim, but it just takes up so much room, the kindle should really help. The downloads were easy, both using the Kindle itself and downloading from the amazon site. It only took about ten seconds or less and the whole book was installed. The controls are a little annoying till you get use to them, you can accidentally twitch you finger and skip ahead three pages. After using it a couple of times and learning where to put my hand, it hasn't happened again. The cover that comes with it is almost useless, it doesn't really attach very well so using it while reading is a chore, I just use it to store it now. I've already read two books using it and I am very pleased with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love my Kindle","review":"I just love my kindle.

If I am in a line anywhere I read, when I'm cooking or eating I read, at the gym I read, etc., etc. From reading other reviews I was concerned that the Kindle would be hard to hold, or that the page turn lag time would be annoying. I am thrilled to say that after owning my Kindle for a month I am simply in love with it. I was able to hold the Kindle without touching the page turn buttons but not in very many places. I now have the M-edge Kindle jacket and there is enough overhang that now I can hold it from any position. I find that I have learned to click the page turn at the start of the last sentence on a page thus avoiding any lag time. I was concerned that I would miss reading from an actual book, for so long they have been my dear friends. I know this will date me but it was like dumping my 8-track player for an MP3 player, it's been liberating!"},{"rating":"1","title":"kindle fire and cloud drive acess","review":"I have recently brought kindle fire and I have been using it since a month.

The ability to get newspapers, books, documents and magazines instantly downloaded automatically via the cell phone network is totally cool, and the wave of the future (I find myself searching for & buying books more often because it's just too darn easy). The functions and features like bookmarks, clipping, and creating notes is excellent and well thought out. The web browser feature is very cool for research, and is airtime free.I have only one complaint/ suggestion.

The world uses GSM for cell/mobile/portable phone service (ATT, TMobile) You can't use a Sprint, Verizon or other phone when traveling to Europe or most other places. So you can't get your news subscriptions, download books, etc. That is a HUGE mistake--it lets out most international travelers, and that is the prime use I would want to have with the Kindle or any other such device.

It isn't like this is a product that's offering something brand new... you can still read a book, newspaper, or magazine without this device.The monetary advantage of the Kindle (cheaper digital books) doesn't really do a lot to offset to the initial price.And while the Kindle does offer some limited advantage of convenience, this is more than offset by the disadvantage: the loss of the physical presence of the book itself.I cannot see any of these ebook devices becoming practical until the price drops below (perhaps even well below) the $200 mark."},{"rating":"1","title":"kindle original wireless reading device.","review":"I ordered this and i was excited about having the kindle.

I have a 200 sqfoot storage space that I pay $243 per month to store these books. My 14yr old recently discovered reading and in less than a year she has over 100 books stacked in her room. I did not want to burden her with the weight of so many books, with so many more that will come with future years of reading. With the Kindel her carbon footprint will be so much smaller. The Kindle is great for that reason alone. The only downside, and its minor, is the accidental page turning.

I am all for buying less paper in my life, I have too much clutter as it is and I do love reading. Honestly I have issues reading books and plays off computer screens and I love this device, no problems with the screen at all. It looks just like my regular books. I also don't have to hold down the pages when I'm all the way near the end of the book!

Amazon goofed BIG TIME. If Amazon really wanted to make ebooks successful, they should have provided a free utility to convert text files into ebooks, in their format. There are tons of free, public texts around for this. They shouldn't worry about cannabilizing their own sales since the reader costs $400. Last I check, the Apple model is pretty successful and they're making money off the hardware (iPod), not the sales of songson iTunes.2. The design is not that great.

In order to update, or receive a new book I have to travel South about 14 miles.In the experimental section, I have hours of MP3 material, but the Kindle plays it back sequentially thus if you wanted to listen to a particular selection you are in big trouble.I am not slamming this product.

The fact that he can look up words, or guestions, is great. This could not have been a better gift!!! Plus, the books cost way less than regular books,and you don't have books piled up everywhere.

Congratulations to Amazon for phenomenal response time on the phone, but raspberries for not backing a second defective device. I was told the warranty was over. I expected the warranty to be from the date of the replacement. I was offered a $20 discount on another replacement, but I declined. My experience is the device is too unreliable to invest more cash. It worked fine, when it worked, and I was not a heavy user. But, I will be looking to put my money in a different device. Sorry, Amazon, it was fun while it lasted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kindle Awkward to Handle","review":"The Kindle is a remarkable product: easy to read, easy to purchase, download and organize, and easy to store and share purchased books. Great product for the value. However, the product is awkward to hold and to handle. Difficult to turn on, and very sensitive to a page turn pressure, with no way to really comfortably hold the product without turning a page.The leather binder that encloses the product does protect it when closed, however when open the Kindle slips out of the inadequate little leather grips; this is true whether in a chair, an airplane, or a bed lying down. And, god forbid you should fall asleep and find you have turned 30 or 40 pages.The material of which the Kindle is made (plastic) is good. Not too slippery and a feeling of solidness. Could you add ridges to the plastic to permit a grip for holding it? Or could you design a better leather case from which it does not slip."},{"rating":"1","title":"Early adoption = lack of features","review":"This may be the beginning of a new trend that will help to cut down on the use of printed paper, which is a good thing, but at $399, this device has a huge markup, and huge net for Amazon. There's absolutely no reason why this device should not cost $100 or less.Early adopters, enamored with a mobile e-book, who are willing to spend an exorbitant price for a gadget with a tiny screen, are forgetting the fact that newspapers and magazines are printed in color. Although a novel would be great on this little screen, I wouldn't want to deal with the eyestrain of using it daily to read periodicals.Like any technology, it's just a matter of time before a new model is offered for half the price, repeat, repeat, repeat, and you have a $49 e-book with color.

While I can easily handle all of the file transfers by USB, the Kindle can also be easily used by the technophobe who doesn't even have a computer.I've used the email file conversion service quite a bit, with few problems.

I don't have an issue with buttons or cover. I love everything about it. I download samples and books almost on a daily basis. I have found a wonderful book light that works well for me when needed. My kindle doesn't fall out of its cover. If I could ask for any improvement at all, I would like for there to be some type of folder system for cataloging my books and samples.

It is great. You save money, trees, space, and you can \\"carry\\" as many books as you want with you. The only kinks I would have to say are: You have to be careful when you first handle it to not turn pages accidentally, and be careful when inserting the Kindle into the cover because it isn't always secure inside the cover. Lastly, if the power button wasn't on the back, which means you have to lift it out of the cover, then maybe it wouldn't be given a chance to come loose and fall out.

This is not a big issue but an annoyance which may be corrected in future incarnations. I have read the pros and cons regarding the cover. After trying some of the recommended tricks to keep the Kindle in place, I have to come down firmly on the side of those who say the cover needs redesign. It's OK as a protector, but I shouldn't have to install Velcro to keep the Kindle from falling out. That's my main complaint.

I wish the power on/off button were in the front and that the page turning bars were a little smaller. I feel like this device can be hard to hold onto without turning pages or pressing buttons.

Amazon claimed it was my fault and charged me for a replacement, but I think that it's a design flaw for a portable device to be so breakable. Even if you do buy this, be warned that you should treat it more like a fragile laptop than a mobile phone or, you know, an actual book.Also, there are real problems with battery life - it worked as advertised for about a month, at which point a daily charge suddenly became necessary.

We tried the hard reset on this and it still would not remove the lines on the screen. I contacted customer service and all they told me was that it was defective and that since it was a month over the 1 year warranty that they can only replace it if I fork over some more money.

Worse than that is if you hit the 'back' button by accident, which is very easy to do, it will take you minutes to refind your page. The page numbering system is not intuitive at all, the cover should never have been created because the kindle keeps sliding out of it.

I will howver try it again after they update the hardware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can be made a lot better","review":"It is a good product however it can be made a lot better:- Can have more titles to choose from. I was very disappointed by the selection. Amazon can take feedback from from current users and obtain the kindle version of the titles which have the highest demand. It does not make sense if you have a great device and no good books to read. It is something like buying a great LCD TV and having no good programs to watch on it.- As with any new device/format, the customers will be a lot happy if they can get at least their first kindle book for free. I was really disappointed when I came to know that I had to spend 15$ more after spending about 390$ for reading my first book on kindle.

So I can't get the books I want.Then, the little numbers on the screen and the work keyboard are so small I must use a magnifying glass to read them.

No need for a computer, like my girlfriend's Sony reader. I can hear about a book I would like, and voila I can download it in a minute.

I am more pleased than I even anticipated. Kindle is exactly what its supposed to be. An electronic book. I can easily download books, it has a long battery life, its easily transported,I can read it anywhere. Buttons on either side make it easy for me, as a left handed person. The buttons are a little easy to press accidently but this is not so bad considering how many times I have dropped a regular book and lost my page or tried to read at the beach in a breeze while pages flapped. While I am sure feature lovers will want a device to do everything (phone, music, instant internet and e-mail) I find that for my needs, with book storage out of control at my house, Kindle is all I need it to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tickled pink","review":"One of the best things about the Kindle wireless reading device is taking this book with me when I go places.

I seems to have a couple of design flaws, one of which is that it's hard to hold without accidentally hitting the bars that cause the pages to turn. That's annoying, but overall the kindle is really a remarkable advance in reading. It will certainly go along on our vacation in October!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting product - very good at what it does","review":"This is one of those products that could go either way with regards to consumer acceptance. The eInk is an amazing technology (http://www.eink.com/technology/howitworks.html), providing the Kindle with a clear display in any environment and insanely long battery life (about a week). Kindle's use of EVDO wireless is really cool too. Hopefully Amazon will keep it free as this is a great selling point.Kindle's are supposed to read Word documents and I'd really like to see PDF support. This thing would really take off if regular people could copy a PDF or DOC file to the Kindle and have it appear in the loaded book list, with no extra steps. I tried to convert a PDF myself and with the Amazon service, but had no success.So if you have a spare $400, buy one. I mostly read tech books but only found a couple I didn't have to load onto the Kindle. Kindle books are less expensive than hardcopy books, and reading / annotating them is easy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great if you live in the Whisper Zone","review":"Kindle is wonderful. However, before buying, make sure you live where the Whispernet works. Huge parts of the US are Whisper-free zones. I need to wait until I drive through a served area. The published maps are only estimates of the true area. Some are twenty to thirty miles off. This mostly relates to Blogs that are updated daily... because I can wait for books or get to an internet connection, from time to time.AS for the device-it is grrrrreat and the savings for a committed reader are substantial. I showed it at the recent family Turkeyday gathering and think a couple of them will buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful gift idea.","review":"The Kindle is awesome.

I take it everywhere with me when I know I will have to sit and wait. It is more private than reading a book. Most people are nosy and ask what are you reading and will peer at a book. With the Kindle, they don't even ask. They don't know what it is.I can't wait to see what type of new software that will be coming out for the Kindle.Just wish more outdated books were on Kindle.

I bought a Sony eReader too so I could compare. At $100 less, $50 worth of free books and 100 Free Classics I decided to send the Sony back and keep the Kindle. Not having to be tied to a computer is a great feature. For the first Kindle revision I'd like to see some password protection provided. Right now, if we lose our Kindle, someone could shop away on our charge cards until we've realized we lost it and get a phone call to Amazon. I'm really surprised Amazon didn't at least include the opportunity to password protect prior to purchases.Other than that, and a few minor inconveniences with pages turning when I don't want them to I LOVE IT.

I can only read hard cover books so this is a much easier way to read without taking a lot of heavy books with me. Easy to use once the book has been downloaded.

The screen legibility is excellent, in bright light or in dim conditions. However:1. The case is awkward to handle without inadvertently flipping pages, because almost the whole right edge is a \\"next page\\" clicker.2. There are awkward gaps in the ranges of available titles. For example, I recently downloaded John Updike's recent sequel to \\"The Witches of Eastwick\\", entitled \\"The Widows of Eastwick\\". But I decided I wanted to re-read \\"Witches\\" first- but \\"Witches\\" is not available as a Kindle edition.I'm still glad I got it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth every penny.","review":"At any given moment, when my heart longs for a book with desperation and in my rural town, I know it's no where to be found, I remember my Kindle; my soul calms...quenching my addiction is only a few clicks away. I take out my Kindle, carefully-reverently-fold back the black cover, wake the screen and search. Within minutes, my book has arrived.--The only thing I wish for the Kindle: I wish it had the technology to read any book to me. I'd like to be reading along, then go to drive, click a button and then on the very page I finished reading from, Kindle would begin to read to me. Once at my destination, or say through a Wendy's drive through, I'd like to stop the reading aloud feature.

It is so easy to use. I was so pleased to see that when it arrived some of the books were already loaded and ready to use. Another great thing about the Kindle is that you can charge the battery at any time without waiting for it to be used up all of the way. I know that I will be able to take it along on a trip and not worry about needing a charger.

It was easy to set up and use, and best of all lots of free Kindle books available from various sites, all you have to do is \\"google\\" free Kindle books, and up they pop! When I travel it is not 3-4 books, but just one sleek, light weight Kindle, I am over the moon! I must admit, I think it could be a bit less expensive, which is for reasons that it puts it in a category where everyone cannot afford it, and my other feedback is that Kindle books on Amazon should be less than the $9.00 which I believe is a bit steep for an electronic copy. The speed in which a book gets delivered is amazing and almost magical, and I am definitely a walking commercial for the product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great.

Its really easy to hit \\"back\\", \\"next\\" and \\"previous\\" buttons unintentionally and the case has a lot of sharp angles that are not all that great for grasping for long hours. Love the dictionary function. Before Kindle, I didn't care enough about words I didn't use/know to pull out a dictionary, etc, but with the easy lookup feature, I always look up words I haven't seen.

The Kindle lead me gently back into the world of books--via technology that doesn't feel so cold, intrusive, and inpersonal. I feel much calmer with the reconnection with books and reading that I grew up with. I appreciate the economic savings of the Kindle books themselves and the convenience to carry so many books with me at one time. It is light weight--especially important to someone with back pain--and I can carry enough books to suit whatever mood I might be in.

I appreciated the tips from other users on how to keep the Kindle in the cover with velcro while reading. The cover itself is very nice quality and I can't believe that Amazon won't come up with a design modification on the cover to address this problem.

(I've had it for 2 hours) It's very easy to read and ordering and downloading a book was a snap. From previous reviews, I expected the download process to be more instant than it actually was. It was more like a 5 minute wait. That's really not bad, considering I wait about 45 minutes for a movie download from iTunes. Also from previous reviews, I knew the included cover was not going to work that well. I used the elastic thing to hold the Kindle in place, but found it annoying; especially since it covered the track wheel. My husband came to the rescue. He attached the adhesive backed velcro circles to the back of kindle and to the inside of the cover. It holds it in place perfectly!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Old Timers perfect gift.","review":"I purchased this for my father who, over a matter of 5 years on the computer gets confused between a left click or right click on the mouse.

The ability to read and learn is what has advanced mankind. Now Amazon wants a monopoly on what we can read on a device we own. Why can the Kindle on read proprietary files? What if I have other eBooks or other files (I have 100s of pdf files that are loaded with knowledge)? Why sell us a $400 product that can only be used for files only Amazon sells? I liken this to a monopoly. Please Amazon, open this up!

It runs circles around this thing, many models are much cheaper than the Kindle and even the slowest model runs circles around the Kindle. Also, you get full color and PC functionality in addition to being able to read books and magazines online that you download, have full wireless functionality, and less portable bulk.Amazon: you can dress this gadget up all you want.

The item never even left the Kindle department until July 8, even though Amazon sent me an email on July 5 stating that item had left the facility and was in transit. No one from the Kindle could even provide a reason as to why.

I was disappointed to learn that I couldn't load any ebooks from my computer, and had to pay for translation services and download my personal documents through Amazon. I may be a klutz, but I found the device too hard to handle. I couldn't turn it on without losing the cover, I flipped pages trying to put the cover back and everytime I had to handle it, and I found I could read a page much faster than it would turn a page, which became frustrating.

I would like to have a handle on the botton edge, something like a hand held mirror, making it easy to hold without accidently turning pages.(this happens often with my artharitic hands.) This handle would also have a feature that could become a small stand for the Kindle to rest on a tabletop,creating a hands-free position. This handle/stand,could be made of something like a heavy stainless steel wire, or perhaps aluminum. As for a protective cover, it should have a zipper for protection. The present cover (or case) doesn't hold the Kindle securely, and it frequently slips out of the cover. The on/Off button should be on the front of the Kindle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to handle","review":"Kindle keeps falling out of the leather cover. Why bother with cover?

I'm glad to see Amazon's reader if only because it will get people used to ebooks. But this product has a few wrong-headed concepts. First, the price is ridiculous. For $399 you can get a Treo 680, load hundreds of ebooks onto a SDHC card, and also use it as a computer, email client, game player, PDA, and MP3 player. PLUS, and this is critical--the 680 is small enough to hold in one hand comfortably, and to have on you all the time. Portability is a key to an ebook reader IMHO. A 680 is just big enough--and not too small. You can read it easily, but you can always have it with you. You're sitting someplace and bored--pull it out and read a chapter. The last thing you need is another device to pack or carry, however.

The Kindle's font seems to be clearer even tho the backgrounds are the same. And, wow, the wireless ability is awesome! I thought about waiting for the 2nd generation Kindle, but from what I've read, I thought it best to purchase the current one because of the buttons, the memory card slot and keyboard layout.

But I've had a bit of time to cool down and I actually think this is a bad product and service that will beget better products and services in the not too distant future. The device will come down in price. The DRM will be hacked so books can be used on other devices. The device will be improved.

Hard to see except in bright reading light.2. Reception on the Whispernet (Amazon's propietary wi-fi delivery system) VERY spotty. I get the NY Times delivered daily (supposedly) to the Kindle, and often it doesn't come either cause I'm in a dead spot (like all of Western Massachusetts) or for no good reason even when I'm in NY.3.

Of course, one might wonder why you would need to save, highlight and take notes, etc. on your latest copy of Harry Potter, DaVinci Code, The Secret (insert latest crappie popular title here ad nauseam)...If you're interested in reading books that don't suck, save your $400. You can always purchase most of what is available on Kindle in a few months at a yard sale.But hey, other than that, great product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle: Made from re-cycled Commodore 64 computers","review":"This was the funniest, AND MOST ACCURATE, quote I've yet read.

So whats with the hefty price!Amazon better rethink this price fast! Maybe people will buy it for the \\"wow\\" factor, but your never going to get the majority of people to buy a glorified PALM pilot!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No to DRM","review":"I can understand Amazon's desire to maximixe profits but I can't help feeling that they are shooting themselves in the foot. I would be happy to buy a reader as long as I control what I read. Amazon deliberately makes it impossible for you to directly upload books from sources such as Project Gutenberg or to upload PDF documents. Imagine if Apple only allowed you to listen to its downloads from Istore and told you that you couldn't listen to your MP3s from your CD collection? I foresee competing readers in the near future that will eat Kindle's lunch by allowing an open platform. Shortsighted on Bezos' part."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm looking for convergence. This goes the wrong direction","review":"I think Amazon missed completely with this product.I have used my Pocket PC as a reading platform for years. While I would love the bigger screen of the Kindle, I would never trade access to my regular e-mail, access to my existing ebook library, PDA tools etc. etc. for a divergent device like the Kindle.Instead of getting into the (wrong) hardware business, Amazon should have gotten together with one of the companies that is already getting ebooks right.This will be a short lived piece of hardware and strand the ebook libraries of those who buy in."},{"rating":"1","title":"good idea, bad design","review":"The kindle is an innovative device and is very useful.

Basically, the kindle is boring and ugly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bleeding Edge, not so \\"edgy\\"","review":"Well let's have the truth. The Kindle isn't really the bleeding edge, is it? The electronic book reader goes back years. Attempts include laptop versions, PDA Versions, load from your PC Versions, tablet PCs, even the eBook, on and on. None of them got there.We got our fist Kindle and well - it locked up every 15 minutes or so. I'd say there is some bleeding. Even the double super secret reboot procedure didn't get the job done. To Amazon's credit they replaced it with the minimum hassle possible. Our second Kindle doesn't seem to have this issue.So now the product review... Somebody finally got there. Of course the technology - electronic paper giving you real battery life - is major advance. Amazon's ability to deliver selection is another big plus, but the real hit is the EVDO connection. Get a new book, magazine, newspaper wherever you are now. Two thumbs up and it made a great Valentine gift.P.S. Amazon... get me color and we're hooked forever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice but beware of Screen Problems","review":"The screen went out after reading just 1 book on the Kindle. Amazon kindly replaced it with no hassle, although everything I did on it was lost forever like the blocking off important information. The new one arrived, but it was not programmed for me so it has yet to be used almost a month later. Had I known I would lose all my important information due to faulty screens, I wouldn't have purchased it in the first place. It is nice but beware of screen problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couple of \\"nickles\\"","review":"Works well, except:1) flimsy battery cover constantly comes off.2) what an incredibly poor cover for the Kindle itself!3) I miss not being able to watch while on takeoff landings, or taxiing.4) Miss not being able to share books with friends not having kindle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't Work for Me","review":"I live in Montana and there is no service for the Kindle here, something I didn't see in the fine print until delivery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle= bad news","review":"i think people really need to think before they act when it comes to the amazon kindle. Everything these days has turned into technology and inspite of the fact that technology is great i think once books can be stored inside a \\"machine\\" thats scarey. People who truely enjoy reading enjoy turning pages, and the smell of book, and the weight of books.

But think about the charm that comes with reading a book and turning the pages with your bare hands that will be lost by the use of a digital books.

The industry will shove these down our throats anyway, and they will trot out the \\"cost saver\\" arguement for print and material. Don't hold your breath on cheaper prices because of this. It all gets charged, just like all other downloaded information. Replacing tools with technology is great. Replacing art and experience with it is disaster for any culture.

Since I received the Kindle as a birthday gift in early August, I have not purchased a single physical book. Because I don't need to. I read that the goal of the Kindle was to make itself disappear, to allow the reader to immerse herself in the world of the book without noticing the delivery device. It took about a day and a half for the Kindle to do just that.For those who think it's ugly, why are you looking at the Kindle? You should be reading a book!For those who want color, better web browsing, etc., it's a book! That's all it is. Not all electronic devices should do everything.If you love to read, the Kindle will greatly increase your quality of life."},{"rating":"2","title":"good product","review":"So I've had my kindle for a few days, and I have to say I rather enjoy it. I will not call it a perfect product because it's definitely not perfect but it's convenient. The major problem I have with the product it the next page button that takes up the whole right side of the product. The slightest touch of that and you can easily lose your place. As a college student I find the lack of available textbooks for the kindle another issue. Other than those complaints it's a great product incredibly easy to read, a large collection of materials to read (except for catcher in the rye being completely unavailable on amazon for kindle). I already have most of my coworkers and family members wanting one of these. I would recommend this product for people like me who usually read 2-3 books at one time and are notorious for carrying them around with them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love It!","review":"Every positive you've read in every review is absolutely true! I love books and had serious doubts I could adjust to an electronic version. It was easy! the Kindle is so light and the screen is very easy to read, so it's actually better than holding on to a book while reading in bed. One feature that has really come in handy is the ability to change type size. I will be undergoing cataract surgery soon, so right now being able to increase the type size is wonderful.I hope Amazon never loses the \\"experimental\\" features, because we already used them to find restruants in new cities when we travel.

Although I have had my Kindle for almost two months, I still laugh at myself as I continue to resist the urge to turn the page with my hand. An imperceptible click of my thumb does it for me! The Kindle is the ultimate in ease of reading, which leads to my next thought. Having been a military mom for the past six years, my thoughts are how the Kindle, and an Amazon.com gift card to purchase reading material, could benefit recuperating injured members.

I'm a student and have to read hundreds of pages of PDF journal articles each semester. I love books too much to replace them, but I'm open to the idea of digital books for my studies. Anything has to be better than reading off laptop screens. However, this doesn't support PDFs and the wireless network isn't available in my area. In a few generations when they realize the market of students and business people, sign me up. But for now I will continue to read off laptop screens."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overal, I love it","review":"Overall, I love my Amazon Kindle. Actually, this is my second Kindle, the first one froze up and would not work within a few days of receiving it. But Amazon sent me a replacement by overnight Fed Ex. Great service.My only complaints, if you can call them that, are that the Kindle does not stay securely in the provided cover. I think a bit of Velcro can fix that. Also, the on/off switch is very inconveniently placed. Why on the back, where I have to get between the Kindle and cover to access it? Why not on the top or side?The display is great, I love being able to change the type size, and having the ability to download sample chapters of books before I purchase them, is realy nice.I'd buy another Kindle if this one were lost or stolen, and several friends of mine have bought Kindles on my recommendation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kindle is Revolutionary","review":"The Kindle is a revolutionary product -- easy to use and easy to read. You can download samples of books and if you like them order right from the Kindle without the need to use a computer for downloading. Also if you have trouble reading traditional font size books the Kindle has several larger and smaller font sizes to choose from. The Kindle is durable and lightweight. I would highly recommend this product -- it lives up to the advertising."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"I travel a lot and it's wonderful to be able to do so without hauling a carton of books. I find the Kindle to be very comfortable to handle and I appreciate the ability to adjust font sizes. The only thing I'd like is the ability to zoom into images.

So, imagine my dismay with a week to go before Christmas - and not only has the thing never shipped - I now get a little cheerful snowflake-clad announcement that it won't even arrive until AFTER Christmas! A MONTH AFTER I ORDERED IT! Maybe Amazon shouldn't be hyping their products if they can't build enough of them to deliver for the holidays. Maybe they should put their current ads on hiatus until they can at least fill their back orders. I am VERY disappointed. At this cost point, had I known that the product would not reach me by the holidays, I would have simply purchased something else.Shame on you, Amazon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Have book . . . will travel","review":"I purchased a Kindle to easily carry books with me while I travel, wait for kids at appointments, etc. It fits into my purse/briefcase and lets me read anytime (5 to 10 minute sessions as well as several hours at a time).

This is the way to go!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"Overall, I love the Kindle.

The ease of buying and getting the book right away is great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sprint Means US Only?!?!??!!","review":"I don't have this product yet but was very interested and ready to buy. Sadly, it's apparently stuck with Sprint and their EVDO (therefore CDMA) network, so it appears it will never work outside of the US.

It was very frustrating to keep losing my page and having to look for it. I think the next page button on the right side of the machine covers too large of an area and it is in the way. It also goes all the way to the edge, thus increasing the chance of being hit my mistake. I will buy a Kindle once they have redesigned it so one can hold the machine comfortably without worry of hitting the wrong button my mistake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deal breaker: No support for PDFs or other text documents!","review":"I have always loved the idea of an e-book reader, and I've been waiting for someone to get it right.

But then I realized that it does not support PDFs or other text file formats.What am I going to do with the hundreds of e-books I already own?What if I buy e-books from other vendors and want to read them on this reader?In an age where everyone is moving towards providing an open platform to content creators and consumers, here is a device that will tether me to using its service. And that, for me, is a deal breaker."},{"rating":"1","title":"useless without PDF support","review":"As a professor and researcher, I'd love to have a product that would allow me to store, carry, read, highlight, and annotate PDF files of peer-reviewed papers.

Better yet: Dear Apple, please come out with a competing and characteristically graceful variant that also supports PDF. I'll cheerfully be first in line to buy one!

There's potential here, but it's WAY too early!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Discouraged","review":"I am sorry to say that the Kindle wasn't all it was advertised to be. I gave it to my husband for his birthday and have already returned it. Why? The design is such that it is almost impossible to hold in a relaxed position without inadvertingly turning the pages. Then once you turn the page-unless you are very careful it is difficult to hit just \\"previous\\" page. Also, we had several times when it would just freeze up and had to be reset before we could continue-and of course, had to go back to the beginning of the book and once again find our place. I am also sorry it doesn't have a back light. Once improvements are made in the design, I feel it could be a great product. But, for the price and the problems I experienced-I was very dissappointed. Amazon was wonderful in crediting me back after I returned it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to travel with","review":"I have enjoyed this product and has come in handy when traveling recently.

I took it on a cruise with me to Mexico and wasn't sure if I'd be able to access my books but they were all there and I was able to easily read in the bright sun without glare or difficulty. I'm excited to see frequent additions to the available downloads through Amazon. If you enjoy reading and want to save space not dragging around several books- the Kindle is a winner!The page forward is only a tad slow until you get the hang of it. Once you do, it's seamless to hit the button and forward just in time to finish the last sentence. I took the advise of other Kindle owners and put the velcro strip on the back to affix it to the case and it worked beautifully. Without it, you're going to drop or loose your Kindle!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loving my Kindle","review":"I knew that I would love this product.

While I found it useful, it recently developed lines on the screen that make it unreadable. It is slightly beyond the one year warranty period.

Kindle has to be held in a certain position to avoid pressing the previous page or next page bars (a design flaw). This position within minutes produced the numbness and tingling of carpal tunnel syndrome.I use 2.0 diopter reading glasses. Even on the highest print size, without glasses, the print was fuzzy unless I was in direct sunlight (outside) then it was ok.It was too large to fit in my purse or coat pocket and the bookcover does not fully protect it. The cover should be zippered.Otherwise, I really loved it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mobile Library","review":"The greatest thing about this product is that it is a mobile library. Most people don't have a plethora of space to store their books. This device could revolutionize the future of reading.The downsides are that it is extremely expensive and then it costs additional money to add books (about $10 or less a book). Secondly, there are only so many books you can get and most of them are more current and mainstream. If you are a fan of books that are older and maybe less popular, you're out of luck. While the demand remains for this product however, the list of books will grow.In short, I would only recommend this product for people that can't keep books with them for space or because they travel a lot. If you already have a large book collection, I wouldn't go getting rid of it for this product. Besides, what if your power goes out for a week and you can't charge it? What are you going to do, stare at it?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Why not?","review":"I just placed an order for mine last night and I can't wait for it to arrive. I'm not sure how I feel about all the features yet since I haven't seen one in person, but I ordered anyway. With the free shipping and amazon's 30 day return policy I figure I have nothing to lose but some time if I don't like the way it works! I saw that books ordered are also returnable within 7 days of purchase, so that gives me a solid week to decide whether or not I like the product. I'm really excited to have instant access to that many books at once, usually I carry a pile of books with me and this will (hopefully) really reduce that load."},{"rating":"1","title":"Charging for blogs???","review":"You know this Kindle really grabbed my attention when I first saw it. I thought this might be something I would want to purchase. That was before I saw that they plan on charging for blogs that I can go read everyday for free through my browser or RSS reader. Amazon, you got greedy.. I would of spent loads of money paying for books and magazines to be downloaded to my Kindle, but instead you had to go for all the cash and charge for something that I can get free. No thanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great investment!!! Saving me time and money!","review":"I've had my Kindle for about a month now and love it! Was very easy to use right out of the box. In fact I ordered a couple of books before I even received it and sure enough they were there when it arrived. I've been able to use the wireless feature anywhere I've been with no problems. The device itself is easy to use as well. My only negative comment are same as many other users have pointed out -- the page turn buttons are so big, it's easy to accidentally hit them. And no backlight means I had to buy a clip-on light to read in bed and night, but that's no big deal. The convenience of the device really makes up for it. I would definitely recommend to avid readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Near perfection in portable print...","review":"Kindle knocks me out on an ongoing basis. It's the sort of device we geezers dreamt that a bounteous techno-future would produce. Light but not flimsy, vastly readable, portable as a paperback, and constantly renewable. Just to have a solid book of history on hand to wind down with before bed--not too many breathless escapes or astounding unforseen plot twists to juice you up--I ordered TRUMAN by McCullough. I remember toting the hardcover around when it came out. Even holding it up to read in bed was a workout. It downloaded in a minute and is an engrossing joy again. I change print sizes according to whether or not I'm wearing my glasses, which means switching to bigger type in bed--instantly! I love that it always returns me to my exact place in each book I'm reading. Only drag is the search function, which doesn't allow a search by author--yet. With luck, Kindle will solve that too. A sweet deal!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Showing everyone the joys of Kindling","review":"I love my Kindle and demonstrate to everyone I see at meetings and informal gatherings. Great product.

I like not having a monthly fee and having the internet, and play music while I read. The design needs to be a little better. I keep moving the pages because of the position of everything. That part takes a little getting use to. It really is a marvel though. I am sure the design will improve in time. I think it is worth every penny. It is neat that Amazon also keeps my purchases stored and I never permanently lose anything. This is a brilliant little device. It is very nice for a reader and it should make Amazon very rich and save me some money. It makes reading and buying books easy and fun.

I'd rather borrow the books than pay $12.99 for a bestseller. I'm a little miffed, obviously. KINDLE SWINDLE they could have given us early purchasers a gift card to lessen the KINDLE SWINDLE damage.

It's already pretty impressive in that respect.- The price point of books \\"feels\\" right, but that might be because i'm used to buying hardcovers.All in all, I don't think the Kindle will completely replace books, but I could easy see my book reading ending up 25%/75% print/Kindle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Present Ever","review":"I treated myself to the Kindle wondering if I was doing the right thing - But fear not, it is everything you would want it to be plus more.

It took a few days, but I now have trouble going back to a \\"book\\". The kindle takes a little while to get used to, but once you do it's hard to put down or go back to a paper book. The only problem I have with the kindle is that it is too difficult to share a book you love. I believe there is a way but the other person needs to have a kindle too.

I put off buying it because of the high number of negative reviews. In short, don't pay any attention to them. You will LOVE this thing! I was also apprehensive about the complaints about accidentally pressing buttons. I haven't had any problems with this. It is quite easy and comfortable to hold with either one or two hands in or out of the cover (which I think works quite well). There is plenty of room for your thumb(s) below the screen and above the keypad (just see how the person in the video holds it). So what if the power switch is on the back, just put it to sleep so you don't hit any buttons inadvertently, take it out, and use the switch. You can just leave it on and recharge it every night - no big deal. Or turn off the wireless switch and use it longer. Some people complain about the tiniest little things!

Due to high gas prices I am not taking the public transportation to work. I can do my reading with my Kindle.

Also, the sheer number of books for purchase far exceeds the Sony. Once I saw Oprah's TV show where the Kindle was showcased, and the price was reduced by $50, the decision to order it was made.

Not only do you have to go through crazy channels just to get a Kindle here, once you get it, nothing works, it is a very expensive paperweight. Who would ever think that a download of a book couldn't be downloaded outside of a geographical border??? If you are outside of the USA, DO NOT BUY THIS.

I take it with me everywhere I go. I love to read, but always carrying books around isn't convenient or easy, but taking the kindle everywhere is very easy. The battery lasts quite a long time. I leave the wireless off until I need it so that also helps prolong the battery life. I needed more to read while on a recent trip and I had new material downloaded in less than a minute. I like that I can change the font size because when I get a little tired I can make the font bigger...how convenient is that!? I love the built in dictionary. When reading conventially I don't take the time to look up words because I know what the context of the passage is saying, but with the kindle it is a quick task to look up a word.

Yes, there are areas that need some work... page turn button placement comes to mind, but the really important functionality is outstanding. The display is crisp and easy to read, even at the smaller font sizes. The whispernet connectivity works seamlessly. To a lifelong book lover like me, it's little short of a miracle to think of a title you'd always wanted to read, pick up the Kindle, and have the book in your hands in a minute or two.For those concerned about the high price, it may help to think of the the $399 as a $33 per month 'network connectivity' charge that lasts just a year, after which both the Kindle reader and access are cost free."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oprah's Delight","review":"I am so pleased with my new Kindle.

I can carry around the pile of books that I usually have on my bedside table in a compact device no larger or heavier than one book. It is particularly great for traveling and airplane reading. When I see a book that I am interested in, I can check it out instantly, and I can download the whole purchased book in 30-60 seconds. I can easily underline or save passages from what I am reading. Importantly for me, a senior, I can adjust print size to very comfortable reading. The battery life is excellent.There are a few things that can be improved.

It is better than my \\"regular\\" books because sometimes I am in the mood to read something else ... now I don't have to carry several books with me. I also read while I am dining alone and can see if there are any new books I might be interested in.

It's misrepresentation and false advertising to promote this product as if you could do \\"everything\\" with it that you would do with a book.

Also, I find the built-in dictionary far too basic for me; most of what I read was written about a century ago, and the vocabulary includes many obscure or old-fashioned terms. A larger dictionary would certainly include them, though, so I hope they'll update it soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's fantastic","review":"This is the best gift I've ever gotten.

But who designed this thing? I've seen clock radios from the 1970's with more style.

This would be similar to note-taking that you could store either within another file on the Kindle, or at least refer back to through a bookmark. 2) This device could truly be revolutionary if there were either an internal dictionary or web-linked dictionary (e.g. via m-w.com) that would allow you to double click the world to grab its definition.Any other users think these would be good additions?

It is great for those of us who like to read at meals, sice it takes up a small space. It is easy to read in normal light.The only minor negativies I have to say about it is that if you leave the Kindle alone for a few days, the battery has discharged enough so that it will not turn on until you have recharged it. Also the handy case provided with it has a retining band tohold in the Kindle. This band really gets in the way of using the menu wheel and makes turning it off and on unnecessarily difficult.

PDF has become the de facto standard, its use is becoming more common, and there is nothing on the horizon to replace it.To design Kindle to be incompatible with Kindle is a show-stopper. Until Kindle is able to support PDF so that users can seemlessly use the product in conjunction with their established working procedures with PDF, it will be all but useless.Although Amazon has reasons to exclude PDF from Kindle, some of which are nearly impossible to overcome - such as document copyright security - perhaps, sometime, the designers of Kindle will recognize the urgency of the need to overcome the PDF issue nonetheless, and find a way.Until then, Kindle is merely a gimmick, with only limited serious application.Dan N"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to Amazon standards","review":"For a company that I have loved solong as Amazon to put out sucha blatantly commercial and INCONVENIENTto the ordinary user product asKINDLE is a shame.I have thousands of files to readon my hard drive - why have to gothrough processes and pay to read themon your product?"},{"rating":"1","title":"After buying thousands of dollars worth of books ...","review":"I have not used a kindle, but after buying thosands of dollars worth of books, I am insulted that I am being asked to buy this from amazon.

I found that as soon as I finished one book, I went and ordered another directly from my Kindle. It's VERY hard to put down.I also liked the ability to adjust text size so if I couldn't find or didn't want to wear my glasses, I could still read comfortably.

I think it adds injury to insult to charge a loyal customer for returning a defective product. The charge is $79.99, not a small fee. The Kindle is expensive to start with and then to have to pay to return a product that should not have been released until they worked out their issues that really sucks.

The Kindle has no weight and is easily manipulated with options of previous page, next page on both sides of the device.The Kindle is definitely worth the investment. Not only because it is such an advanced way to read a book but, in addition, you also don't have to order a book and wait for it to be delivered by mail. All at less cost.Last, but not least, you can talk to a LIVE support person who is helpful and knowledgeable.

When your fine motor skills are impaired, even a large tab like the Kindle is hard to control. This is the one thing I like about the MacAir.

As well as this, Amazon promotes the sale of books in proprietary file format to use on this device. For these reasons, the device is 'defective by design'. I personally refuse to buy products that seek to control the use of the device by the purchaser."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoying the Kindle","review":"I have greatly enjoyed the Kindle... it's easy to use and unlike readingon my laptop, I can enjoy reading without glare bothering my eyes...so easy to download books... the battery has a long life which means I don't have to remember to charge every night... my only complaint, and it's a small one, is that the bookcase needs to hold the device better. It allows too much movement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Indispensable at the nail salon!","review":"So I think I've found the \\"killer app\\" for the Kindle: reading at the nail salon. Since you don't have to turn pages, and you can use the side of your palm to advance the book, it makes the logistics of reading much easier! No more wet pages, no more messed up manicure.Now if I can just find a way to beach-proof the Kindle, I'll be all set. So far, I'm too worried about sand getting in it to take it with me.Finally, I wish Apple would get a hold of the Kindle and do some redesign. I use the Kindle on my train/subway commute, and I always seem to be accidentally advancing or backing up pages as the train/subway bumps along."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kindle- almost perfect","review":"The new Kindle compares well to my other readers and better than some. I like it much better than my Sony because: the page turning buttons are much easier to use, the directions are much clearer and I LOVE the wireless connection the the book store. Works like a charm. The help desk is great too.Only downside- I WANT IT BACKLIT or a decent reading light. Neither of the lights offered by Amazon fit properly (ordered and returned same) My old ROCKET of 1999 was backlit. Why can't this be????I don't want to hear the techno-whines, please. People 10 years ago figured it out- you can too, and for less than $200.

I didn't time it but it was more like 30 seconds than the minute they tell you. The screen looks just like the pages in a book - you soon forget you are not looking at print on a paper page. If I get in low light I may want to make the print bigger though, to make it clearer. I have it set at \\"2\\" and I can go up to \\"5\\" in font size. I am very satisfied with my purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kindle","review":"Would like the previous and back button to be smaller and at the top on both sides so that while you are holding it-you don't hit the button accidentally. Also, would like the on/off and wireless button on the front so that you do not have to turn the unit over and take it out of the holder. Would like the holder to be more secure- too easy to drop the unit out of the holder. Also, needs a light. It is a great concept and it is wonderful for trips when you want to read but do not have the room for all of your books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dave and Kindle","review":"I found the Kindle to be very easy to start using. The connection to Amazon and download of my first book was extremely fast. Would have liked to be able to download a book while on vacation in Bangkok Thailand.The only negative side is that it is easy to hit the next page on the right hand side when shifting the Kindle in you hand. Possibly could consider reducing the size of the next key device. Another slight irritation if you are in a hurry involves the scroll button to move the cursor to the menue, etc. If not careful, when depressing the device it often moves up or down in your finger is not perfectly centered. Could consider reducing the sensitivity to reduce those errors in scrolling. These are both minor items and do not detract from the enjoyment of using the Kindle.

One recent download was clearly scanned in from hardcopy using a cheap optical scanner. The optical character recognition process was very poor and the error correction program even worse: there were so many spelling/\\"tranlsation\\" errors that the book was essentially unreadable. Comparison with hard copy clearly showed that this was Amazon's problem -- not the hardcopy publisher's.If Amazon is going to charge readers full or near-full price for e-books, they have a responsibility to provide a product of the same quality as the hard copy.

I can't wait to finish this book so that I can get on to the next book. It just seems so much easier to read off the Kindle than a regular book. Paperback, hardback don't compare, cannot compare with Kindle. No bookmarks to move around, no fingers to lick inorder to turn a page, and I don't lose my place should I happen to fall asleep. Plus the fact that I can review a book before I decide if I really want to read it, that is really great.Just one thing. If you could change the closing ability of the leather case. Something more in the line of the method used for closing the box the Kindle comes in. Elastic bands wear out quickly and then the cover is less apt to contain the device safely.

I enthusiastically bought my Kindle when it was initially announced in 2007 but recently, the screen went completely dead and nothing I do on this end could revive it. When I called into Amazon to look into options for repairing the Kindle 1.0, I was essentially told there are no options. I can choose to put down another $180 for a refurbished Kindle 1.0 but that was it in terms of helping repair my Kindle since I was out of warranty. Even if I wanted to pay to repair my Kindle, I was told that option wasn't available. The customer service guy was nice but essentially told me I was SOL.

It is very difficult to find a way to hold the Kindle without inadvertently turning a page (or three or four). With a few tips from others online, I have learned to deal with it, but definitely feel they need more finger-gripping places when they make Kindle 2.0.

And is continually working harder to keep it that way despite greedy record companies push to change that. Some IDIOTS WILL NEVER LEARN.

Kindle is not this. Kindle is bad for several reasons. First of all, it will soon become obsolete to pocket computers, which the New York Times reported are in development by Google. And at that point, these wonderful books will be on digital screens, right next to pornography and MySpace. This is leading to the diluting of information in general, and anyone who denies it is naive. What has happened to the value of holding a book in your hands? Of spilling it coffee on it, of cracking the cover, of writing snarky comments at the author? All of this is erased for a clean digital screen which admits no pencil smears, no dogearing pages, no pulling the book down after 30 years and smelling the old book smell. Putting my favorite books on a computer screen is terrifying and, for knowledge, tenuous. What a wretched invention."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just rating its look...","review":"I am glad that so many beta testers have chimed in but there is a problem with this device and forgive me for judging Kindle by its cover but that is the problem here. As many electronics manufacturers - including Apple - have proven over time... its all about the interface if you want to sell a hand held device. It looks like the interface, button layout, keyboard, etc. were an after thought. Great looking screen - lousy interface and case design. Please do a total redesign of the case - remember that the iPod sold because people wanted other people to see them with the iPod because the iPod looked cool - why do you think that the iPod ads showed a white iPod and headphone wires on a black silhouette?

Also, I find I can read faster with a smaller page. I can really get right into the device, blocking out all distractions. Since I am an environmentalist I like being able to save all those trees, too.At first I resisted the idea, thought I had to hold a book but then I looked at my overflowing bookselves (I'm a book collector) and thought maybe I better get the thing.

Although my DRM protected imusic and other protected software came back on-line fine, my eBooks from Amazon (using Adobe format) did not. I contacted both Adobe and Amazon but neither was helpful at all. Amazon went so far as to tell me that the 30 day window was up - there wasn't a 30 day window on the Digital Library when I purchased books in the first place.

I've used it for several hours a day since receiving it and have had no problems with any of the advertised features. Unfortunately, there is a serious design flaw, namely, the page-turning bars. These are situated down the entire length of both sides, so that the only place to hold the device is along a thin strip at the top and a few places in the bottom third. If the Kindle is in its holder, the cover also can be used. Although hardly insurmountable, this problem is absurd, since there's absolutely no reason for such extensive bars. They accomplish nothing and create great a huge, unnecessary nuisance. I've been reading \\"analog\\" books for 55 years and never found page turning an onerous task.

I would primarily use it when I travel as a way to not have to pack multiple books or make a decision before I leave what kind of mood I'm going to be in during my trip.However, the biggest drawback I see (and the one that will keep me from purchasing this until until it's resolved) is that a paper back book I can read on an airplane from the time I board until the time I land. A kindle has to be put away from the time the doors close until 10,000 feet, and then again when we land.

And there are books available that I'd never dreamed would be in electronic form. I'm learning Danish and there was my Colloquial Danish textbook in the Kindle bookstore! When I come back to a book, it remembers where I left off. The Whisper Net is great. And I've got a dictionary and encyclopedia with me all the time now.

I've owned the Sony one and it's OK, but found it frustrating always having to connect the device to a Windows only web site. The Kindle is easier and I like the screen and navigation better. Also, don't lose sight of the fact that the books are much cheaper than their paper counterparts. Double Cross by James Patterson is on sale at Target for $19 bucks. I got it for $10 on the Kindle.

I have ALOT of books around my house that I have started but not finished or even looked at in years. I find I am reading more than before and that is what I wanted to do.

Now you can switch from one book to the other easily without losing your place. Increase your vocabulary effortlessly with the built in dictionary.

I bought it because I was under the impression that it would be useful and efficient for my university work. However, half of the time the files do not send to the kindle and when they do they are not fully there. It is also slow and unresposive. I would not recommend paying anywhere near 150 for this product. Thoroughly disappointed and irritated."},{"rating":"1","title":"not AGAIN!?!","review":"The kindle is one of my favorite gadgets to use. I love how easy and convenient it is to download books and have them instantly available on the kindle and kindle library. It is a great concept except for the fact that the first kindle I purchased lasted for two glorious weeks then froze, rendering it completely useless. After I received my replacement kindle I downloaded some school textbooks and a couple novels. In the middle of the novel, (one that is impossible to put down), my brand new kindle FROZE. Again. I was devastated that one of the best books I have ever read was ripped from my grasp yet again, not to mention my extremely expensive textbooks were not available to me during class. I wish I had a device that was worth the $139.00 I spent on it!!! If I can't use the device due to technical difficulty, I guess it doesn't really matter how ingenious a concept it is..... Wish I spent the money on some old fashion paper books instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kindle, the future of reading!","review":"I received my Kindle as a birthday gift, so I can't speak to the high price tag on it. I love it! The books are downloaded instantly. I hate being without a book to read so the fact that they are downloaded with in a minute is fantastic! I purchased my books through my computer and not from the Kindle itself, because I have a lot of them on my wish list already. Some have put down the design. Yes, it could have a smaller right side page forward button. I do hit the buttons on accident sometimes, but it is new to me and the benefits to the Kindle far out weigh the minor flaws. I like the fact that I can keep the books when I am done without taking up anymore space in my house. I also like the fact that the books are usually a little cheaper in the Kindle version. I would recommend this to any book lover!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great buy with lots of great things wrapped into one electronic book!!","review":"This was a wonderful early birthday gift to myself. I never dreamed that it had the web on it and for free. I sure hope that amazon keeps it that way because I pay enough for the internet as it is. The only drawback was having no color but I am sure amazon will fix that with a future generation of these that come out. Plus being able to download the books you want isn't bad either. It just doesn't have all of the books for my studies on it which is kind of another drawback. But I can't give this handy product any less than 4 stars. Whose not to say that those books won't be available in the future as well as many others. Plus I can take it in my car and use it to look up addresses when I want to find something which is something I can't so with my laptop."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing kindleI am not sure how i ever lived without this i read a good10 to 15 books","review":"i want to know how i ever lived without the kindle i read 10 to 15 books a month and with this i NEVER have to shop for books and not find anything in the store its all at my fingertips"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kindle","review":"After purchasing the Kindle, I have read more than I ever have my entire life!

I have had this second device 363 days and it just crapped out too - same problem, lines and bars on the screen. I was told it is no longer under warranty and that I just have 'bad luck\\". I could replace it with a discounted refurbished kindle for $79- why would I? My track record is that this device is not good for very long......The 2 service reps just apologized nicely and couldn't offer anything better or any assurances that a new device would be better.

They really need to improve the manufacture of these devices.Roberta"},{"rating":"1","title":"Expensive Three Year Investment","review":"This consumer owns a first generation Kindle just out of warranty period. The product's screen is wearing out. The cursor moves upon and down the left margin and defines the initial word on every line then jumps about the page when a menu selection is attempted. Higlights appear suddenly and screen lighting fades in and out. After numerous attempts to correct the problem with customer service support, I've been informed that there is NO FIX.That being said, I asked for compensation toward a new product and was told by Jim, 694813, that I would be compensated $20 toward a reconditioned Kindle Touch or 3G Wi-Fi.

As of January of 2012 I have 120 archived items. I loved it! Christmas 2012 I recieved a Kindle Paperwhite and have read 2 books since and there is no comparison to my original. The only good thing is the light. I don't like the fact that you can't see the page you are on, changing pages is awkward and takes several tries every time, but if you even tough the screen my mistake it changes. The fancy bookcovers instead of the list of items is not an improvement and the other book covers that are I suppose to make me buy other books are not welcome. I am very very disappointed with this new device and will most likely go back to my old one. I would not recommend the Paperwhite to anyone and I was a big fan of my original."},{"rating":"1","title":"A better choice!!!!","review":"This product is extremely over priced.I've used it for reading 5 books before I bought an Ipod touch... Let's take a moment to compare what you can buy with that amount of money....You could purchase a brand new Ipod touch. With that you could listen to music, audio books, watch movies/tv shows as well as view web pages and get up to date news/weather, but you want to read E books, you need an E book player right? Well guess what.....The Ipod touch does that as well and works great!!!Oh, btw, it has wifi too and the only time you really have to plug it into a computer is when your charging it. That is unless your using a wall socket or cig lighter to charge....For the money I would get the product thats prooven to make people happy as well as meet all needs and beyond.

Even the guys on the phone werent able to figure out the issue.I think the eINK technology has not integrated well with the amazon product.

A Kindle would reduce that to one light-weight reader. BUT the Kindle won't read pdf files without having to send them in via email to be converted. Businesses don't like this because it violates confidentiality - what kind of business would want their unencrypted business plans and financial reports going through email to be encrypted and then back as equally unencrypted pdf documents? I'm a management consultant dealing with corporate compliance and all of my clients have strict policies about confidentiality with many of them having encryption software required on portable computers. Amazon is really missing the mark on this and since the Kindle is based on LINUX, it should be fixable. After all, it would increase sales and I'm sure Amazon would like that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too expensive, not enough titles","review":"This is a good idea, but the price is way too high and the selection of book titles is too limited.

I have yet to read the instructions, but had no problem using it to read right out of the box. I finished a book over the weekend and the battery remained strong. As for the comments about page turning, it is really easy to hit those buttons. But it is really no big deal to return to the right page. It certainly is a lot better then losing a page in a traditional book. I was able to use the search to find the introduction of a character that I had forgotten about.

I find it easy to buy and download books from Amazon and what a plus not having to buy and carry all those books, not to mention the saving in cost of hard back books.

I called customer service and explained my problem hoping the representative could tell me how to go about looking up selections by author. But alas I was told that was not an option within the browse function. I find it hard to believe that I'm the first person who tried to browse by author. After all, every bookstore I've ever browsed through, after being sectioned by topic, is then alphabetized by author. I think browsing by author would be a lot more useful than browsing by price. Whether the price is highest to lowest, or lowest to highest.

Every time I turn it off I also change pages. The next page on both sides is convenient, but the right side one needs to be smaller & located lower like the one on the left.I keep inadvertently turning pages because there is no place to hold on to the book by the sides or to pick it up without turning a page forward or back.Can I disconnect the right side page turn?

What's your problem, publishers??","review":"I like the Kindle very much. I couldn't disagree more with anyone who has any problems holding the device or using the buttons - it couldn't be more ergonomic or easy to use.My only complaint at all is that most of the books I want to read aren't available on the Kindle. I'm not sure why publishers wouldn't all want to do it -- I would pay full price if I could just get the books. Just a sample - I want to download 2666, Replay and The Name of the Wind, and all are unavailable via Kindle. I can only hope this is a fairly early adopter's issue and that it will be better in the future because so far I've been frustrated with that. But the device itself seems great. I love that you can read in the sun unlike a lot of laptop screens.

No more having to go to a bookstore to buy a stack of books...I just pick from the terrific selection at the Kindle Store and one minute later I can start reading away...no matter where I am. Even though I have had the Kindle for barely a month I can't imagine what life was like without it. I have absolutely nothing negative to say about the Kindle.

That is also the only thing that keeps this review from having 5 stars. The page turn buttons are so large that it is easy to hit them and skip to the next page before you are ready.

What are the chances Amazon didn't go to Adobe and try to get them to sign on? Zip. Zero. Adobe may have looked at the proprietary nature of the Kindle, concluded it was going to flop and decided they didn't want their name associated with a product failure of this magnitude.I could be wrong obviously but PDF is the 800 pound gorilla of document formats. Obviously Amazon tried for it - and they failed.Another likely possibility is that Adobe has already made agreements with another large company to develop an eBook reader. Think Google, for instance? Who else out there is large enough to make Adobe spurn Amazon?Would Google be interested in a GPS enabled wireless device capable of displaying HTML and PDF files? It's a rhetorical question.My guess is that six months from now we'll see other superior entries - ones not quite so proprietary and fully able to render PDF."},{"rating":"1","title":"They let the engineers do the aesthetics...","review":"That much is obvious. Apple brings in artists to do their product designs, it's why they always end up in MoMa's industrial design gallery. This...looks like the pure-mathematics engineers designed it. I'm sorry, but it's terribly ugly and unappealing, it looks like part of a fax machine made in the 1990's. It does not entice you to pick it up like an iPod Touch does.As to functionality, $400 is WAY over the mark for a device that nickel-and-dimes the consumer for all of its content. For that business model, they should have gone with the inkjet printer paradigm...the printer's $79, but they keep selling you ink.And as to the e-ink and all...can you tell me exactly what this device can do that a ten-year-old Palm or nearly twenty year old Apple Newton can't do?

I was as excited as she was. This is definately the \\"wave of the future\\". I can see students carrying their Kindle instead of carting a load of books around in a backpack all day. It is so fast and easy to use. It easily fits in a purse so you have it with you at all times. I can even read several books at the same time which I didn't like doing before because I didn't like carrying them all with me. You never run out of reading material since the Whispernet is always with you. I bought 2 and gave one to my sister.

I look forward to the future of these products and for the proliferation of e-books, as not everything I want is available right now, in this form, but this is early in the game. Great job!

It is a curiosity. Once you get used to it, it is superior to holding/transporting big heavy books.It is a bit expensive still, though you do save a little on the published book price. Hopefully the price will drop dramatically on the standard (current) device as they release a new version."},{"rating":"2","title":"The First REAL Book Reader","review":"When most people think of the Kindle, they anticipate the experience as being like that of reading a computer or LCD screen. That is exactl what I had expected as well before I received my Kindle.Once I opened the box and turned the Kindle on, however, I was really pleasantly surprised! The lettering on the screen did not appear \\"computerized\\" at all, but in fact looked exactly like the print in a typical book. You can make the letters larger, and they remain very clear and not distorted at all.The battery lasts about a couple weeks on a charge, however, I recommend that you turn the wireless feature off when not downloading anything, otherwise the battery life is shortened considerably.I urge anyone who loves reading, especially those who like to read more than one book at a time, to at least give this product a try.

It is supposed to hold the Kindle in place for easy reading, but it doesn't. I am using the elastic band on the case to hold it. Also I wish a light was built into it.

Otherwise I am delighted with it and wish I had gotten it sooner."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great first E-Ink machine","review":"Kindle is easy to use (as long as you are a US citizen, copyright issues make it unusable anywhere else).

Overall a usable and efficient machine.Unfortunately it has frozen on several occasions, needing a hard reset, an easy but cumbersome procedure. You do not lose any books in memory with this procedure.I would like a night setting so I can read it in subdued light. Maybe reverse the font so that letters are white and background black? The buttons to turn the \\"page\\" or go back are too large and easy to press by mistake. A clamshell design would help to protect the screen more.

Its true that the buttons could be better located but that is really a very minor flaw. The biggest flaw is the Kindle \\"book cover.\\" It is terrible! Needs a complete redesign.

It would also be useful to have a way for the cover to act as a desktop stand for hands free reading.Thumbs and fingers have inadequate real estate on the device and are constantly hitting the \\"Next Page\\" or \\"Prev Page\\" buttons.Enhancing web browsing and emails (without limiting it to Google/Yahoo addresses) would be awesome second generation features.Thanks for a really terrific product.Regards,Atul Kanagat"},{"rating":"2","title":"Oops!

The book list is padded with junk no one will ever read - hence this is a \\"Potemkin Village\\" of an e-book device. They gloss over this fatal flaw but it will do them in soon if it is not fixed.

I am not disparaging the device itself, but rather the fact that service is not available in my area. In fact, the closest area that has service is Tucson.

My recommendation is for anyone considering a Kindle purchase to await the obvious upcoming epiphany by Amazon that some form of lighting mechanism would significantly increase the usefulness of the device.PS: Why aren't more of those thick, heavy travel guides available on Kindle?

The books are cheaper and with the new 'light' I can read anytime anywhere. I use my sony just for books and have no need for the newspaper or blogs as I have a computer at home and a laptop for that. I wish I would not have waisted (my opinion) the money on this. I find the Sony and its new cover w/light a much better product for the money. I am an avid reader and find that the fonts do not tire the eyes. I would recommend the Sony for folks who need the book for books only. If you want an all-in-one well.....for what its worth, save your money until they get a 2nd or even a 3rd generation."},{"rating":"1","title":"I liked it until it died--after only TEN DAYS","review":"I thought this was a good product that I would enjoy taking on trips. After ten days (on May 2), my Kindle died. Won't turn on, won't charge. I sent Amazon an e-mail and just got a form response. Not a good experience for a $399 item. (Added on May 5th: I was able to resent my Kindle and get it to work again--so I hope this was an isolated experience.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another reason for the Kindle","review":"I haven't sifted through all the reviews, and I don't own a Kindle yet, but my reason and excitement about wanting one is slightly different from others I've seen. And I think it's valid and should be considered. I'm sure I'm not the only avid reader out there with arthritic hands, and the thought of being able to hold a book without having to prop it open somehow is SO inviting! I can see where the physical bugs such as the page forward and back paddles should be revamped. And personally I'd like to see it a little smaller. But all in all, I don't know if I can hold out for the next generation before I order one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review of Browsing Kindle","review":"Although I love the Kindle, browsing for books to buy is tedious bordering on impossible. Leafing though thousands of pages, with 6 books per page, soon discourages me. Then there are the six or eight repeats of the same title to go through. I like older books, especially older mysteries, but there is no way to browse. If it were possible to skip to location \\"***\\", as we can do when locating a page in a book, that would improve browsing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing, but not yet for me","review":"This product looks great. I love the idea of not wasting power to hold an image in the screen. That's almost enough for me to buy it. But I ask myself, do I need this? I have a Palm T|X and an iPhone both with free e-readers. Those two eat battery power a lot while reading. The necessary auto-lock always interrupts my reading too.So what's keeping me from my new Kindle? First, I would need to push myself to read more. That might start with my existing library of unread books. Second, I would also need some wifi in this device. While the battery life will vary, wifi is always faster.I also am a HUGE fan of Project Gutenburg and free books. From what I've read, the Kindle opens texts from Gutenburg very easily.I bought the 2nd gen iPhone, Maybe I'll get the next gen Kindle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"We had this Kindle for 1 year and two weeks. At that point it died completely, and Amazon would not honor the warranty because it was two weeks over. A product that costs $350 and lasts only one year is not something I would buy again, or recommend to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!!!","review":"Wow! I got my kindle this morning and it \\"knocked my socks off\\". I feel as if I have seen the future and it is here in my hands. I have not been able to put it down all day. I am an avid reader but was reluctant to purchase the Kindle because I was sure the reading experience of a Kindle would not be as satisfying as one from reading a traditional book. It has also been said that you have to take time to get used to the Kindle. Neither of these concerns proved real for me. I found I loved the Kindle the minute I picked it up and am sure Kindle and I are going to have a long and satisfying relationship."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware","review":"Beware, Amazon charges more for some books on Kindle than it does to buy the hard copy. How does this make sense? A fully digital version of this book that will be read on a device you paid for is substantially more expensive than a hard copy that requires trees to be cut down and turned into paper, printing, binding, and shipping? Is this price fixing in digital publishing?"},{"rating":"2","title":"love my Kindle","review":"I am happy with the Kindle. It does all it says. My only complaint would be that the design makes it possible to turn the page accidentally, like when you are moving it, when it is not in the sleep mode. Not to big a deal, but an annoyance none the less. Other than that, I love the ability to change the font size. I have ordered another one for my in-laws and a clip on light for myself. It sure makes packing a heavy book around much easier!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love my Kindle","review":"I read constantly. My husband says our bedroom looks like a library.

All the features of the Sony ebook reader, with the additional of being able to access the Kindle book store wirelessly. Also comes with a built in dictionary that is handy (Sony does not have this either, although the Rocket ebook did have this feature). It's smaller than any of the Rocket ebooks, but a bit larger and thicker than the Sony ebook. I like the buttons for the previous and next pages, although they are easy to hit at times. Sony's prev/next page buttons are a little uncomfortable to hit. I find that the prices of the books are cheaper than the same books on Sony's Connect store. Overall I am very happy with the Kindle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work for people with poor eyesight","review":"I specifically chose the kindle because of its large font size option.

The Kindle can easily fall out of case or sometimes when I try to secure it the back comes off and the battery area is exposed. Also the on/off switch is located inbetween the Kindle and case and the Kindle sometimes comes loose when I switch it on or off. Other than that it is simple to use and if I have a problem the Kindle Support Team is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the Kindle","review":"I've had my kindle for a month and have found myself not wanting to put it down. Its easy on the eyes even when I was reading on the beach (screen didn't glare nearly as much as normal white print pages). Books download fast and there's a big selection (as long as you don't want TSR/Wizards of the coast titles). Only down side is the page turning buttons are too large on both sides and its easy to turn a page when you don't want to. Other than that its great so far and think anyone who loves to read should think about one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stories in a gadget (with a bow to Steven King)","review":"I love the convenience of buying a book whenever and wherever I want. I love the adjustable font. Being able to read sample chapters and reviews is a big help in making my selections. The pricing on new releases is fantastic.On the downside, I don't like waiting a week for the Kindle version to be available. Although there are thousands of books availlable, many older, out of print books are not available.All in all, I agree with Mr. King's review in Entertainment magazine that it is a wonderful gadget."},{"rating":"1","title":"3rd Kindle 3 and still have to reboot to use it...everytime","review":"There is something seriously wrong with 1) the device and 2) customer service. I've sent two kindles back in the last three months...each time for the same reason....I have to reboot the device to read...its absolutely frustrating now that I have my 3rd and it is not working. I've asked customer service if there is a problem users in densely populated areas are having and they have no answer other than \\"we'd be glad to send you a new device\\". I was told by one customer service person that there is a 3% defect rate...I can't believe it given my experience.

I am an old-fashioned reader who loves the feel of paper and pages, loves the smell of ink and books, and needs the ability to write in every book that I own. Moreover, although I am fairly tech-savvy, I do not need to own the newest or most current fad, just because it is new. I waited to see if the Kindle or another reader would make it past the early stages. After seeing the Kindle and other readers, i decided that only Amazon has the versatility, look, and selection that I want. The Kindle is a joy to read. I have had no issue with the battery life or with accessing content when I am traveling or away from the center of a city. I would love to be able to read it in the rain (as I love to walk and read) but that is not feasible with any of the readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy","review":"They don't tell you that you can only download books from Amazon.

He told me about all the features and how much like actual paper and ink the screen looked. I just smiled and nodded, knowing I had the Kindle all wrapped up and ready to give him on our anniversary the next day. He is on cloud nine. He loves that he can browse the Kindle store wherever he is and he can get magazines and newspapers, too. When we travel, my husband and I each bring at least a half a dozen books apiece and it can really weigh down the luggage (he brings closer to a dozen). You have to figure out exactly which book or books are going to come in the carry-on and which ones in the suitcase. Now, with the way airlines are charging for baggage, it'll be particularly nice to have all of his books in a simple paperback-sized Kindle.

Reading heaven has returned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun to read again","review":"I am 57 years of age, as a result I have used reading glasses for years.

The electronic ink is highly visible, even in the bright sunlight and the device has the \\"feel\\" of a book in your hand. The battery life (particularly with the wireless radio turned off) is exceptional. The book samples are a really great way to decide if you would like to purchase a book.

This is tedious and leaves me with less time to read. I have complained about this repeatedly to Amazon with no results. Also keep in mind that the Kindle is fragile and the case does not securely hold and protect the fragile Kindle. At the same time the case provides a false sense of security. You think the case is holding your Kindle. I picked my Kindle up, it slid out of the case, and fell on the floor. It only dropped once about four feet and now it is worthless. Kindle support advises it will cost $180.00 to repair. I am retired and watched my Kindle like a hawk. I am also a registered nurse accustomed to handling costly devices. Customer Support was excellent. They answered my phone call promptly and professionally. I strongly advise using VELCRO to attach your Kindle to the case.

My only big criticism is that I would like to be able to organize the books according to my own structure. The prebuild sort is just by title, age by download date or author. The author sort isn't consistant because older books in public domain often use the author's first name: Emily Bronte sorted under E instead of B.

To me, this seems to be a fallacy in pricing, as much of the price of a textbook is derived from the cost of printing into a hard-bound text and the Kindle version removes the cost of a text printing and, therefore, should logically be offered at a much greater cost reduction than the minuscule reduction that Amazon Kindle Edition provides.

The future reading devices may be somewhat different -- multifunctional computers perhaps, but this e-Ink display, the wireless delivery via cell phone network -- this is where we are going, and it is great to see Amazon taking the lead with such a usable device that is encouraging people to read again.I love my new Kindle.Way"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic for low vision","review":"I have been an avid reader since grammer school. A diagnosis of low vision several years ago drastically changed this. Large print books and recorded books are wonderful but I was amazed to find that much of what I enjoyed reading was not available in these formats.The Kindle is very easy to use, has six different font sizes and I can take it anywhere. The number of reading choices in materaial to download is wonderful. I love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Can a lifelong reader take the plunge and go totally digital?","review":"I have always been comfortable in my room with my four bookcases and my collections of favorite authors. However, I have gone past age 65, and collecting doesn't motivate me as much as it used to. I just want to read. I've read between 15 and 20 novels on my Kindle, and I have become a fan of this e-reader. (The process of clicking to purchase a book and then watching the download to my Kindle fascinates me. It's mezmerizing!)I have just about decided to order a second Kindle. I am comfortable with having my digital library of books stored on my Kindle and at Amazon. I am confident that I can contine to maintain my trusty laptops and my Amazon account, so I don't really need to have dead-tree volumes any longer. I can certainly find enough to read among the Kindle offerings. I've talked myself into it. I'm going to order another Kindle. Do I need another? No. Do I want another? Yes."},{"rating":"2","title":"kindle","review":"I am enjoying my Kindle. It's a little difficult to hold sometimes as it slips out of its case on occasion.

I can change the size of the text for my old eyes and carry more books in less space. The only thing that I really dislike is the fact that the Whispernet technology is not available in my area and that I have to use my USB to download books. This means that samples are not available and that obtaining other forms of media is more difficult. Other than that, I love it. I would hope that Amazon would consider another carrier for the Whispernet technology."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a bad idea!","review":"What a bad idea!Few people are going to pay hundreds of dollars for a reader to enable them to read books that they then have to buy.The only way to sell eBooks is through standardized .pdf format and the free Adobe reader, or through a proprietary eBook reader that is given away free or at very low cost.I've sold thousands of my specialized eBooks in .pdf format that anyone can read.

It'll be great if it's even lighter3) Color. I like to see pictures in color.4) Screen size. The screen could be longer if you move the amazonkindle logo & rolling button some somewhere else.5) Dictionary details. It'll be great if kindle could provide pronunciation (actually say the word so we can hear the sound) and example of how to use the word.Apart from the above, I think it's a great product.

Kindle makes it easier to concentrate and I read longer with less effort. The cover is bad news as are the buttons and the on-off switches on the back. These are the biggest flaws to me. Best of all it has been exciting to learn something new."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic even for a first model","review":"In the age of iPhone, this product feels like some sort of an odd device from a previous century. There is nothing to be fond of. There is no color. There is no feel. The screen is too small. I like the idea of not wasting paper if I can, but this is a bit too much of a price for that. The built-in dictionary is one nice option. However, how hard would it be to build in some options of English-Other Language dictionary as well? I hope the next version will be a substantive improvement, but the starting point feels like like the old brick cellular phone. So, there may be another 20 years of evolution before it becomes something worthwhile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks awful","review":"I would be a possible buyer of this Amazon gadget, but it just looks awful.

Over the first day this occurred to a newspaper subscription that also did not download.After wading through too many pages to discover a link to support, I finally succeeded in creating and sending an email to support. I have yet to hear from anyone.The hardware itself looks great but also needs work. Application buttons run into the sides of the unit, and upon picking up the unit, almost always end up accidentally prompting an application.Had I received a prompt response from Amazon, I would have held off on this review.Kindle has potential but needs work.Mr. Bezos, you have let down your loyal consumers. Buyer beware."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kindle: Wonderful Electronic Book","review":"I purchased a unit for my wife and one for myself after seeing and getting a discount through the Oprah Winfrey show. I absolutely love mine. The best feature for me (at age 67 and a contact wearer) is the ability to increase the font size which is especially important in dimmer light situations such as in bed. The ease of using a reading light and hitting an advance button and NOT turning pages is also very convenient. One aspect I don't like is the leather cover which is necessary to attach the reading light. It does not want to contain the Kindle very securely. I prefer holding the Kindle without it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kindel is pretty cool.","review":"We bought the Kindle for our 9 year old daughter. She loves it!!!!!

I am now addicted to this little white thing that goes everywhere with me! What I love most about it???? Books...INSTANTLY available while I'm sitting in my easy chair! What I dislike most about it? It's too easy to change pages...I find that I need something to \\"hang on to\\" so I don't prematurely turn a page.

It is the best device out there to simply put all of your books onto one device and go! It's easy to use and easy to read, even in the sun.It's easy to shop for new books and get this... newspapers, whenever and where ever you want! PS with no fear of the paper being blown out of your hands while sitting outside. No hand cramps from holding the paper open, no akward glances from the person sitting next to you while your trying to hold the paper open.Simply put, this device is only for those readers who are technologically savvy and willing to pay for the simplity of this device.Also, Amazon's service behind the Kindle is better than that other companys, whose name is a fruit.

Instead the day's edition (of the WA Post) is ready and waiting at the bedside table. Even with minimal light, it's an easy read from bed.In addition, I'm convinced that I'm reading more news AND spending less time at it than before -- whether from a print edition or on the web -- because there are far fewer distractions to divert ones attention.I also find it a great way to read fiction and cope with a lack of available space in my bookcases. I'm less enthusiastic about its usefulness with books that I want to browse or that cry out for frequent references to earlier material."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally - a book reader that feels like reading a book!","review":"I have owned just about every generation of these - always in the hope that the next one would be a good substitute for taking a suitcase full of books on vacation. I've tried Franklin, Sony, you name it... None were acceptable. So when Kindle came out, I had to give it another try...Amazon nailed it. This is wonderful! I can set the type to be read without glasses, read on a crowded train, download tons of sample books I want to read then if the first chapter is good, I have the rest of the book in a minute. I've now finished 5 books and still haven't found a reason not to love it. It's not a novelty item anymore - it is going to be my constant companion. I'll still buy signed 1sts of authors I collect, but for books I just want to read - Kindle will be it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can Not Use In Canada","review":"After purchasing this product and before I actually even received it in the mail I received an e-mail stating that I required a US billing address and US Bank issued credit card in order to purchase any of the reading materials.

It allowed me to purchase it using a Canadian billing address and Candadian Bank issued credit card, with no warning stating I could not download any products onto it without valid US infomation. I had to pay for the return shipping on a product I couldn't even use. This information should be stated on the main page of the Kindle website and not buried at the bottom of the FAQ list.

Half of the magic of reading is being able to hold a book in your hand, write in the margins, feel its thinness or heft.

For starters you can't use it outside of the US which has not been mentioned anywhere in all the fine print. What happens to people who live outside of the US are they not allowed to have the same luxuries and privileges as those in the US. OK so the wispernet doesn't work outside of the US but we can still download books from Amazon via the USB cable, right, wrong.

I did that and then they told me that there was \\"A known network error\\" that they were correcting and that my Kindle would be bricked for at least 1 more day. The only good things about this is that they are on the ball enough that they knew about the problem before me, and for my troubles they gave me a $30 kindle store credit (yay).

That I can stay in bed on a Sunday morning and \\"go get a paper\\", is something that will never cease to amaze and tickle me. That alone is worth the cost. I've seen complaints that it takes too long to turn pages. I hadn't noticed that, maybe because I automatically got into the pattern where I know at what point on the current page to press the next page bar so that I am comfortably at the bottom of the page when it turns.

Those page turn buttons should be smaller and the on/off switch should be bigger and on top or somewhere other than the back. Still, after 1/2 an hour, I was comfortable with the unit. Screen is fine, buttons work great.The list of books grows and I hope to see millions of titles soon. This unit will not replace my library but it will make travel more comfortable.

After a little while, however, I learned to subconsciously avoid those buttons and could read at ease. I love the different font sizes and the pictures were a lot clearer than I had imagined they would be. Even though this device is still not perfect (and is rather expensive), I feel that it is worth it for any serious reading. The only problem I foresee with my Kindle is a financial one. It makes it way to easy to order books (delivery really does take under one minute). Even though they are at much lower prices than hardcovers and most paperbacks, I'm sure that my bill will add up very quickly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost perfect","review":"I love my Kindle, despite its imperfections.

True, it supports fewer titles, but for me at least that is not the main objective. The Sony Reader is smaller, lighter, cheaper, and gives me the flexibility to upload onto it anything I want. No wireless? No problem. That's what my blackberry and laptop are for. I need a reader - I'll let my Blackberry do the rest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adaptable - ME!","review":"I received this device as a gift, and what a WONDERFUL gift it is. Lung disease is robbing me of strength, and hardback books were becoming more than I could handle. THIS Kindle book reader I can hold.Yes, I hit the forward button far more than I would like, but the more I use it the more *I* have learned to adapt to it. Just like any device, if you love it, you'll learn how to use it.The biggest joy is no more reading outdated, cheesy magazines at the doctors' offices. I was reading Douglas Adams at my last visit and my BP was great! :)Thanks to my dear sister, this is the most enjoyable, most practical present I have ever received."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy with my Kindle","review":"I'm 92 years old, still working and reading at least one book a week, not to mention newspapers, newsletters and business and engineering magazines. My Kindle has become a right arm. I enjoy browsing through books, taking samples and especially being able to adjust the print size on the screen. I can highly recommend it to anyone of any age. It brings back the ability to read for me at leisure time. In closing, I can't say anymore than \\"Good Work Kindle.\\" Bravo!Mort Silberman"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Perfect Fit","review":"I love my Kindle. Here's why:- In the rural area I live in, being able to have a major newspaper, such as the Washington Post, delivered directly into my hands every morning is a feat never before accomplished. Until I got my Kindle, that is.- It fits in my purse. And I have a very small purse. So I can just whip it out whenever I have time to kill: at the doctor's office, on my lunch break, getting my oil changed, etc.- No monthly fees. That's bloody amazing.- All those new releases that are only available in expensive hardcover? Cheaper on my Kindle! Heckuva lot easier to carry around, too.- Whatever book I want to read is instantly available. I no longer have to hunt a title down at the local bookstore, only to find that they don't have it and it'll take five days to order it.Does the Kindle check my email, let me read PDF business documents, or maintain a contacts list? No. The Kindle was designed for you to READ. Not to be your Blackberry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kindle for newspaper rading","review":"This product has been a great success for me.

A support person was very helpful and after we tried a number of solutions, he volunteered that a new device would be sent. This was done very quickly and no further problem. The first one was obviously just a fluke. The device works very well and the ease of ordering new selections is amazing. I recommend the Kindle to anyone interested in a more convenient form or reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"This is great. Is small but plenty big enough to read and lite.

I had seen the drop test video and thought nothing of it, except now my Kindle doesn't work. The toggle that allows you to view the menu, etc no longer depresses. I called customer service. The device cannot be repaired. The warranty does not apply, but I could replace the Kindle for $180. I have uploaded several books, 6 of which I have not yet read, and will not be able to.

The position of the left and right turning buttons are ill-positioned. Everytime I went to pick it up, I turned the page inadvertently. I also found it to be slightly bulky; maybe because the turning button takes up the entire left side of the Kindle. Amazon really needs to go back to the drawing board on this one.Sony's Digital reader is not only more affordable ($299) but is designed a lot better. The only good thing I can say about the Kindle is that the screen and e-ink are crystal clear. My recommendation is to wait until Amazon develops a better version of the Kindle."},{"rating":"1","title":"No direct document import???","review":"I've been playing with a borrowed Kindle and like what I've seen, with one major exception.

That said, I will NOT be be buying the product because it does not allow you to directly upload documents from your computer. Reading paperwork (PDFs and Word docs) on my e-reader would be the NUMBER ONE reason (and justification) for me buying one. Until they sort this issue out (and don't make us pay to read our own files!!), I will not be buying the product.The Sony Reader at least takes a stab at trying to handle user created documents.

Newspapers I already get (like WSJ and NYT) are $10-15 a month! The advertisement didnt mention that all these online magazines are 2-3Xthe print cost.4. The \\"book\\" to use it (how to use email on your Kindle) costs $3.00!And its a big advertisement.5. The \\"cover\\" doesnt fit it. For $400 the cover should fit.6.

Also being a senior citizen, I really like that feature of being able to change the font size, which is particularly helpful when the lighting is less than adequate.

The $50.00 discount for having watched Oprah is what made me decide to purchase the Kindle. I have found it easy and fast to buy books. They are delivered within a few minutes, and I can be reading the book before I can turn the wireless connectivity swith off.

There are so many adjustments you can make to enhance your reading experience, like font size etc., this makes the average reader enjoy publications like never before. While the price is a tad high, if you're spending $20 for a hardcover, and read with a great degree of frequency this is for you. It will pay for itself in no time.

The wireless feature and the website support is so much better than the Sony's cheesy PC application to put content on the device. I also found that the time it takes to turn pages is handled much better on the Kindle. I find that I am reading more, now that I have this device; it's simply more fun! I take it everywhere and the wireless coverage is great. I think this product is a home-run and I can't wait to see what Amazon will do with it next!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic money-saver and convenience for serious readers!!!","review":"I've had my Kindle for 5 months and have taken it on 2 week-long Carribean vacations as well as reading non-stop at home. Its fabulous, easy to see and read, small and handy, with extremely quick downloading of books. I've read over 30 books in that time.Its more than paid for itself a few times over with the saved shipping charges plus the discount price for new books.Plus, its wonderfully convenient not having to lug around books or wait weeks for sellers to deliver a load, etc.Even for the casual but fairly constant reader this is a MUST.A few books I've wanted were not yet on Kindle, but this thing is so convenient that I'm going to wait for them - there's SO much to choose from its no problem!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth the wait","review":"I waited about 5 weeks for my Kindle and am extremely happy with it. I'm reading more than I have in a long time. I carry this with me to work, on the bus, just about anyplace that I can get in a few minutes of reading.I know some people have had an issue with the page buttons on the sides, but it really doesn't take any time to get used to holding it so you don't accidently turn the pages and even if you do, it takes less than a heartbeat to get back where you were.I also haven't had any trouble with the cover. It doesn't seem to be that hard to set the Kindle in place and it's quite easy to flip the cover to the back and secure it with the elastic strap. It's not difficult to slip my finger behind the Kindle while it's in the case to turn it on or off.I love having a whole library with me in one tiny package. It's also easy to shop for books at Amazon.Over all, this is a really great product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kindle","review":"Overall really like this product.

I do not go out of my home, so this gives me some real independance I have missed over the last few years.

I finished a book and ordered another on the subway yesterday....never interrupted my reading on the hour long commute, when I would otherwise be staring at the walls.I've read more after purchasing the kindle than I have in years!Hopefully the next generation Kindle will enhance the ergonomics and make this a killer product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My review of the Kindle","review":"The Kindle I bought in July was a gift for my son.I bought a Kindle for me after seeing Jeff Bezos talking about it on the Charlie Rose show. I ordered one right away and love it. However, I wish one could fine tune it a bit. I have an eye condition called Macular Degeneration. It would really help if I could make more of a contrast between the background and the text. Also it would help if I could make the text larger. I already have it on the largest size. I am currently reading a book that has larger print in the first sentence of each chapter, so I know it is possible.Sometimes I am surprised at the unavailability of a book. So far I haven't been able to access \\"Fearless Fourteen\\". I know you carry the author's other books, so why not this one?I think it is great that one can read a sample before buying. Also, like the Save for Later, and the ability to look up a word in the dictionary. Most of all, the instant gratification of downloading a book so swiftly.Maxine Owen"},{"rating":"2","title":"my kindle","review":"I purchased 2 kindles.

My mother was recenltey diagnosed with pulminary fibrosis and Lupis so she really has alot of down time to read since she is on oxygen now full time. She absolutley LOVES IT! I could not have bought her a better gift. Her favorite features are: she can get her books in large print & the kindle is so light weight she can hold it for hours without her arms getting so tired.

Also, in a few months I will be taking a 10 month trip, and I will have enough reading stored in my Kindle for the duration of my trip.On top of everything, it is easy to use, light and small enough to carry anywhere, and I love the fact that it is not computer-dependent, that is, if I buy a book, it gets uploaded in no time to my Kindle.Probably other users have found faults or Kindle features that they wished were different, but I am thrilled with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Amazing!!!","review":"I am an avid reader, and this product is created for that person in mind.

I had several people come up to me and check it out, and it was really easy to show them how to use it! Others suggested books while sitting by the pool, and I was able to select a sample right there! I am on my 4th book on my Kindle, and love it!

When I began to tackle clutter in my home I realized that the dozens and dozens of books were a contributing factor. The Kindle not only addresses that problem. It saves me money. The books are less expensive, even new releases. It's also good for the environment. There's no packaging for shipping and no printing. Another feature I really love is that I can adjust the size of the type. Yes, I should be wearing my reading glasses, but with the Kindle, I don't need them. This product is very easy to use.

They should stop advertising something they cannot offer. It's not fair. I wanted to get this as a gift for Christmas, but I refuse to pay three times as much, which is what it's selling for on Ebay.

I understand that some may find the $400 price tag steep, as I did, but once you pick it up and feel the entire bookstore at your behest inside it, you'll never regret your purchase.~One more comment: I went through reviews ad nauseum before I invested in one and noticed one specific thing between the positive and negative reviews: a vast majority of the negative reviews are by people who haven't even bought the product, just decided to \\"Review\\" it on speculation.

I kept the wireless off, and the battery lasted over a week. The only drawback I can see is lack of light. It would be great if there was a built in light for night reading.

Right now, you can get the Palm's T|X with its large color screen and SD card capability for $200. It's a great deal, and the backlight makes this thing actually usable for reading in bed while your mate sleeps. In addition, the TX with ereader software can access tens of thousands of books, too. Plus text files, pdf files, and just about any format out there. AND, if that weren't enough, the price of ereader books are usually HALF the Kindle price and there are MANY free ebooks out there as well.Sure, I'd like to play with an epaper screen and have a little more screen real estate, but not at the prices Amazon or Sony want. They are trying to make the next iPod hardware/content thing and I say no. The Palm TX is way more than acceptable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of lack of service in your area","review":"I love my Kindle but I have to leave my house and drive 10 minutes up the road to get it to work. After I bought it I found out there are dead zones all over America. I am not exactly in the boonies. I live on the Eastern shore of Maryland on the water. The problem is Verizon has my area locked in. So check your cell providers before you buy a Kindle. I think Kindle likes Sprint in order to work. Anyway, you can check maps on the Internet or call Kindle Support. They know exactly where the dead zones are.I think this technology is great and it will improve. $399 is a lot of money when you can't use an item as it was intended in your home home. 4 stars if I had service!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Underwhelmed","review":"As many previous reviews have noted, the button placement is poorly thought out.

It's not a perfect device, but I've thoroughly enjoyed using it over the last 2 weeks. Here are my thoughts:What I like:* The screen is great. The refresh is minimally disturbing if you click next page a few lines before you finish the page. The e-ink is sharp, crisp and does not leave your eyes fatigued.* The ability to change font size.* Wireless connectivity through EVDO works very well. I love being able to download a book at a moment's notice.* The ability to carry several books at one time.* NYT Best Sellers for $10.What I don't like:* The price. I do think that this device should not retail for more than $299, and I expect Amazon will lower the price down the road.* Paying for blogs; the price of newspaper subscriptions. I have no plans on reading anything but full books on my Kindle.* Web navigation is clunky.I do hope Amazon will lower the price of the device and improve the web browsing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kindle is pretty cool!","review":"I really like my new Kindle because it is lightweight and easy to use.

I am almost done reading my first book on it, Duma Key. The size of that book alone prevented me from buying it in print format and lugging it around - on my Kindle it was manageable! I am a frequent flyer and the Kindle has simplified my reading habits. No more leaving a book behind because you are almost done with it and don't want to carry 2 books for the trip. No more buying a full-priced book in the airport because you forgot to bring a book.I keep my Kindle in my purse so I can take advantage of down time everyday. It is very convenient.The reason I didn't give it a full 5 stars is soley due to the design of the buttons. The first few times I started reading I was pressing buttons all over the place! Whoever designed this thing gave it absolutely no thought or testing. I hope the next version deals with that aspect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Gift I have ever purchased","review":"I purchased the Kindle for my wife as a gift.

The possibilities are endless, I love the fact that you can listen to songs, surf the web, buy books and other things quickly, and a whole lot of other stuff. i have already compiled a list of over 50 books to buy on the kindle. This thing makes it so easy to buy books instead of wasting time and money to go to a bookstore, what i want, i get quickly. I even got one of my friends to buy a kindle instead of ipod touch, in just a few hours. Plus, i got the 40 dollar rebate which was really great. The book cover is great and really helps in keeping the kindle from falling. It is pretty easy to use once you get the hang of it and for me the buttons are just perfect. The keyboard is easy to use and doesn't feel awkward to use at all. A must-have for voracious readers like me and my friend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even great products have flaws","review":"This is a great device, truly game-changing. It certainly has flaws, particularly in the area of overall design but the wireless connectivity through sprint providing access to the kindle store and enabling wireless delivery of content is amazing.

I'm in the habit of reading several books at a time and regardless of where I leave off it never loses my place. Downloading new books is a snap and the connectivity signal is strong. I usually download a sample and if I like it, I'll then download/buy the book. The price of most books is considerably lower than buying the hardback. Traveling is now a breeze. Instead of lugging several books in my carry-on, I simply pack my Kindle. Even though the initial purchase price is rather steep, an avid reader will soon justify the purchase. The downside, if there is one, is the difficulty of turning pages accidentally. There is really no convenient way of grasping the Kindle and not hit the \\"next page\\" bar. For those with eye problems there are several size fonts from which to choose. I'm recommending this product to all of my friends.

And having the ability to search, highlight, and clip pages is great. But the killer app is the always available Kindle store on your unit. It is so cool to be able to browse for a new book that you just heard about or wanted without having to hook up your unit to your computer.

I think that this version of the Kindle is great, and hits the target that it is aiming for which is the wireless reading device. I have seen other reviews trying to say that if you have this you dont need a portable PC or something and that is just bunk. However for the goal of a digital version of books and magazines it succeeds admirably.Without reading the manual it has iPod-like ease of use, crisp graphics, and for me near perfect size and weight. My main complains would be that I wish there were a lock switch so that you dont accidentally change the page as you are reading and WiFi support. Finally, the idea of charging $10/month to read a blog that is free is just insane. I dont mind overpaying for books and magazines, but they really need to rethink that blog and internet content part."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"This product is one of the greatest things to hit the market.

My one disappointment is that many of the books I thought I could download - I must've thought I had all of Amazon at my fingertips - aren't available, so I end up buying the book, anyway.

I am sure Amazon.com can afford it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give it for FREE since you will force us to purchase from your store!","review":"Amazon has dropped the ball on this product. 1. once you purchase the books it should be under your ownership for life. DRM is a big mistake and will force more people to find ways to copy. If I lose my books, I'm not going to pay again and will find a way to obtain it free. 2. The device is overpriced, Amazon can make more if they lower the cost of the device since people will start to buy only from them. 3. Give it FREE if we purchase X amount of books per month. If not I have no plans to purchase this and will wait for Apple to come up with a better idea via iTunes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sony PRS-505 is waaaaay better","review":"Borrowed this device from a friend of mine who was an \\"early adopter\\". I spent a full week with it, and read 2 full books. Overall? Not impressed. The design isn't as streamlined as I'd like, and the e-ink is less sharp than on Sony's PRS-505. The wireless feature is neat, when you can get to an area that supports it. Page turning takes longer than the PRS, as well. The color is hideous.Overall, I'll take the Sony. Sleek silver, more streamlined, better clarity, a full $100 cheaper, and I can download my own stinkin' files with ease, and for FREE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really","review":"Not interested.

Plus, I have no desire to have yet \\"another\\" device to lug around. DRM is a big turnoff as well. This product misses on many levels. I'll stick with audio and real books for now.

The largest font is like reading in 'large print' but there are so many titles to choose from compared to what comes out in large print books. Love, love, love the selection I have available with Kindle! The only problem I have had is losing my place. Ugh! No page numbers! So I have learned to use the bookmark everytime I put the Kindle down. I LOVE to read! With Kindle I read more often and more of what I really want to read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the Kindle!","review":"I gave the Kindle as a gift to my father (almost 80 years old & an avid reader), not knowing if he would take to the new technology or not. Yes, I did assist him learning the ropes, but since he has had it, he LOVES it! He takes it all over - swimming pool, travel, cruises, etc. He has ordered several books on his own & really enjoys the larger font sizes & the portability. It was a GREAT gift!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Completely Happy","review":"I have had a number of glitches with my Kindle so I cannot rave about it. I sure like the idea of it. My husband loves his and has not had any problems. So I keep working through mine hoping I will fall in love with it also!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Could be a perfect 10 ... but","review":"I love my kindle, and Amazon has certainly gotten more out of me in book sales because of it. There are however a few areas where the kindle could stand some improvement. First, as has often been said in various on-line reviews, the buttons on the side, for turning pages, do get in the way, thus causing the frequent inadvertant page turns. Then, there is the issue of the DRM. Amazon's flavor, once of the popular mobi format, is somewhat of a concern. If there were credible competition for the amazon online store, coupled with the kindle hardware, I would have purchased that instead, just to get away from the odeous DRM."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a word about he screen","review":"Forget about the price, copy protection, and lack of PDF. The key point is the screen and this is where the product fails. Eink is a great idea that just isn't ready yet. The screen can at best be described as grey with type rendered in something just short of black. The contrast is so poor on this and other devices like it that use in other than well lighted conditions is too great a strain on the eyes.If I had it to do over I would wait until they had a display with greater contrast and the background at least approached white."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too expensive, clunky, and ugly","review":"This unit is way too expensive.

Books are a nice break from the digital world. Also there is an artistry and feel to the book which I enjoy. Books have different shapes and looks to them. When I read art books I like big beautiful art reproductions in books which this machine can not duplicate with the screen size it has. It is great to have a big huge art book on my table that people can flip through. Overall, I prefer the experience of reading a printed book over having an expensive machine to read books in a form that I enjoy less."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"I had read many of the reviews during my decision process and while I love my Kindle, I do agree with many of the comments. I wish there was a better way to keep the Kindle itself in the case. It has a tendency to fall out unless you hold it in yourself. That bugs me the most. I have found that if I use the elastic strap diagonally across the top right corner it will stay in and work just fine.I do enjoy being able to have some access to the internet also. I hope they continue to improve it.It was an early Christmas present and I really am thrilled with it. No more suitcase full of books when I travel.Overall, I highly recommend the Kindle."},{"rating":"2","title":"From a real owner","review":"I applaud Amazon for their willingness to allow people who have never touched the device to flood their site with 1-star reviews. I hope the resulting mediocre score doesn't deter anyone. As an owner of a Kindle and both generations of the Sony e-Reader, I can say the Kindle is a giant step forward.The various pros and cons are well-described in some of the other reviews (if you can find them among the bloviations and misstatements of the ignorant), so I will only mention my favorite and least favorite features:Favorite: A genuine reading experience. The transparency that Bezos says he hoped for is really there: once the novelty of the device wears off, it's all about the book.Least favorite: The page-turning buttons are huge and over-sensitive. It's very hard to pick up the device, or change positions, without accidentally turning pages and losing your place. Perhaps this will get better with practice.Overall, this is an outstanding product."},{"rating":"2","title":"kindle","review":"I am using my kindle on the go, mostly, and find that I have to find the sky in order to download (most ER's are basement level).

Otherwise, Great Product."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Kindle","review":"I really like my kindle. I use it everyday.It is very easy and convient to download books. I love it! And using the free.kindle to send my DOC files to be converted and then sent back to me to download to the kindle is so easy and fast. Accessing the web is a great feature.There are only three things I recommend changing:1. The \\"next page bar\\" on the right gets bumped very easily. Should be smaller.2. The \\"SD card slot\\" should be located in a more convient place so you don't have to take the back of the kindle and easier to change.3. The kindle keeps falling off the little hook on the book cover. When I go to put it back on I bump the next page bar which advances the pages. And also the back cover comes off. Maybe pins to hold the kindle in the book cover."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kindle Review","review":"Great way to read. Downloads are really fast.

Unfortunately, the wireless service does not work in Alaska (or Montana). Amazon was apparently unable to point this out during the order process even though our Amazon account is registered in Alaska and the ship to address was Alaska. They do mention the lack of coverage on the website, but should make it much more prominent or provide a warning when someone selects shipping to Alaska or Montana."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to review","review":"It is difficult to review something one cannot use.The advertisement was misleading. The Product Overview gives a lot of details but ...It implies that Kindle can be used around the world as per this extract from Product Description - Introducing Kindle \\"With Whispernet, you can be anywhere, think of a book, and get it in one minute...\\" There is nothing that says Whispernet is solely accessible in the States. And not having a credit card issued by an American bank as required for this purchase, prevents me from downloading to my computer.It seems a very good product and I would love to use it but not living in the States makes it impossible to connect to Whispernet.

I recently went on vacation and I took along 7 books... in my Kindle. I like the ease of downloading books instantly and I like the dictionary look-up."},{"rating":"2","title":"EASY READING","review":"Love my Kindle. It is easy to carry and light weight. I don't have to run to the bookstore if I need a new book. I can just download it in seconds. The only fault I find is that the page turning system is so easy that you can inadvertantly fastforward several pages in error, then you have to go back and find your spot. I like that I can look up words very easily. It would also be nice if there was a light for night reading in the Kindle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the Kindle !","review":"Bought the Kindle for my husband as a birthday present. He absolutely loves it! The compact size and ease of use are just as advertised. The screen is easy on the eyes and the weight/size make it easy to hold for hours of comfortable reading. No having to flip the book around or strain to see the words on the page printed next to the spine."},{"rating":"1","title":"worse purchese ever","review":"In within 2 weeks the Kindle's screen was bleeding. I was sent a second one that did not download the books from day one. By the time Amazon was ready to send me a third one, one month passed since the first day of the original purchase and they would only give me a refurbished one. Despite their claims that refurbished kindles were better than new ones, I decided to give up and ask for money back. Because the over 30 days purchase I was not re inverse fully, very unfair since none of it was my fault. Also I did not like how there was hardly a place to hold the book without flipping pages for you. I would wait for the next generation of Kindle."},{"rating":"2","title":"No coverage overseas","review":"I work in Egypt, home in the USA twice a year, finding this device of little use -- no coverage overseas.

Also the lack of color is a major drawback. I would expect future models to cost less and eventually add a color display.It should also have a handle or wrist strap. It is inconvenient to have to carry it around like a book all the time.For now I will wait for the price to drop in a few months. I might try it out now if Amazon offers a 30 or 60 day trial. Then wait for a price drop OR find that I can't live without it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This agression will not stand man!","review":"Simple put...it's alpha product that simply doesn't fit the bill. Used it for a day and returned it. The cons out weigh the pros. It's supposed to be simple to operate, but I found it not so simple. I had to hard reset the devise because it froze up. Connecting to the kindle store in the NYC area just didn't work. Returned it within 24 hours of use."},{"rating":"1","title":"eBooks and Battery are Serious Issues.","review":"My first problem with this reader is that after spending $399 for it the ebooks cost $10 a pop! My iPod was cheaper and yet I can get music and tv shows for less than 2 bucks. It seems that eBooks should be much cheaper. I guess if I am going to spend $10 on a book I will just buy the book. When this goes obsolete I will still have my book.The battery is weak and needs a charge almost daily, especially if you are an avid reader. I travel a lot (for the day and back) and do not want to haul around a bunch of chargers. Until the battery is improved and the costs come down (which they will knowing technology), I would wait on purchasing this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great concept but not so great physical design","review":"I really love the ease of use and the light weight nature of this product but it is very difficult to hold. They didn't design anywhere for your fingers to go and I constantly find myself clicking the 'next page' bars when I don't want to... It is annoying and i'm sure the next version will address this issue. Too bad I didn't wait!!Aside from that issue (which is rather important), the device is great. The reverse out print takes a little getting used to on every occasion but after a few minutes, it is mostly forgotten.I LOVE how much easier it is to use while reading in bed, but again, this is when the problem with the awkwardness of fingers comes into play..."},{"rating":"1","title":"my mistakes","review":"I purchased this when it was a special on the Oprah Show, and I made two mistakes. I did not check to see if my area received Sprint Wireless, which it does not. I have to travel 20 - 30 minutes to get to aa area I can download books. My second mistake is I wanted to wait to use it because I knew I was having sugery and would be layed up.

I have a 3G iPhone with a FREE eReader app called Stanza. I can read the exact same books that the Kindle does plus all the other features of 3rd party apps including PDF support.If Amazon really wanted to sell this thing they'd subsidize the cost and create a membership package to a virtual book club. 99 bucks for the reader and 29.99 a year for the club would the sweet spot for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"more useless, pathetic technology","review":"The pathetic tech-twerps, who spend their lives in closets, will invent anything to replace the sensuous, the tactile, and the simple. I love the look and feel of books. From the artful covers to the informative jackets and everything in between, you can skip pages, read in any order you want, highlight passages, and appreciate the style it's published in.

I can get Mobi books from most e-book vendors, like My Bookstore and More and Fictionwise. So unlike Sony, there's pleny of places for me to find material to put on it.The one and only thing stopping me from purchasing this thing, and the only reason for the two stars, is the price. If it were half the price, $200, I'd snatch one up this minute.Five stars on the device (much improved over the early photos, ick!), but two for the cost.

The deal breaker for me though is that the device dose not do the one thing I had hoped it would do... text-to-speech output. I will buy this or any reader like it that will allow me to listen to, as well as read the books, blogs, news that I wish to receive. I realize that the typical speech output of text-to-speech is not that good and that there is an Audible.com option, but I find the content far too limited through that source.

So it makes sense to make this device B&W.; Color just requires more power.3. No wireless charges. If am in US.Now the questions:1. What if am out of US and in Asia which uses GSM predominantly. Will the wireless work worldwide? or do i need to download the content to my PC/Mac and Sync it? Or do i need to survive on WiFi?2. What about replaceable batteries? Can i swap a battery? Where is it available? Is it difficult to change it?3. is it liquid proof? What if i pour water or worse, coffee onto it? Will it sizzle and burn or survive?

I keep the type at a fairly large size, because I have found that I \\"scan-read\\" very quickly that way. It is so light that I fold over the leather case and take it with me whenever I go out. I keep the wireless switch off (unless I am downloading) and the battery seems to last forever.I've already downloaded 6 books and it is a bargain for me to buy a favorite author's older novels for 6 or 7 dollars, as well as the best-sellers for a few dollars more.It is a marvelous device."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kindle, Hoping for Flame.","review":"This thing is great. I like everything it does, but I'm already watching for the next generation hoping for a few improvements. Smaller page turn bars; I'm afraid to move my hands for fear of flipping a page. The dictionary is awkward and doesn't recognize words as they are sometimes used in literature. I wish the screen didn't blink when the page changes. A back light would be very handy. Maps and pictures are very difficult to see; both color and larger images for these features would be good. Finally, the library of available books is limited. I'm hoping the entire Amazon inventory can be available for the Kindle.Again, I love this device. I can't imagine having to travel again lugging a bunch of books around.

I have even ordered a second one for backup.I get all my newspapers, magazines and blogs delivered to me each morning before I wake up With out fail. The try before you buy option with sample books and 15 day trial period on newspapers, magazines and Blogs, helps not to waste money on what you buy.Literally...out of the box and I was reading within minutes.And should you have a concern or question the customer support staff is so friendly and helpful. They even e-mail you a question after the call to make sure that all concerns were resolved.You can't beat it. It's so much better than the Sony eReader. I had the Sony for about two weeks and then found about the daily delivery of newspapers , magazines and blogs with whispernet, I switched almost immediately to the Kindle.I will look forward, however, to them making a better book cover to hold it in...but for now the black one will do.I very satisfied customer (and I'm really picky)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Books Unavailable on Kindle!","review":"I could get neither Beautiful Boy nor Tweak for my Kindle.

I have already downloaded books and started reading! I'm an avid reader and must say I enjoy the ability to carry all the books I want to read on vacation with me in this one unit! It's very user friendly and wonderful to hold instead of a cumbersome book. I can adjust the size of print to my comfort, and order any book I have wanted without having to go to my local bookstore, and have it on hand to read in usually less than one minute! The only suggestion I would have to make it even better would be to have the ability lighten or darken the background of the print for reading ease.

I was looking for a solution to enjoy my passion for reading without accumulating a lot of books since we move around a lot for work. I had gone to the library, yet wanted to eliminate the extra trip. The Kindle was something I had to save for and it was worth the wait.

It was always indoors, within the recommended temperature range.)By midsummer, it \\"thawed\\" enough to become usable again...for a few months. Then, in the winter (again, while always kept in the recommended temperature range) the ink froze for good.Back then, Kindles were several hundred dollars.

Today I tried to buy three books through the kindle store and was not able to.

What is this? My credit card is honored globally but not for Kindle?Now I am told to pack up the kindle and send it back, and a \\"sorry but that's our policy\\" !!! Well I'm not happy in Arizona."},{"rating":"1","title":"PDF support, deal breaker","review":"The lack of direct pdf support is an absolute deal breaker. I have been patiently awaiting this release and I find the product quite disappointing. While the EVDO support seems interesting it is ridiculous that all content must be added via this link. When the device is capable of directly being connected to a computer via usb, it is silly to have to transmit content via Sprint to be converted (and be charged for this service). The price of the device is high but not necessarily out of range when looking at the alternatives, most directly the Iliad and the Sony Ebook reader. Being a technology consultant I patiently wait for the day when an eink device comes out that would allow me to read all of the technical documents that absolutely dominate my profession without jumping through hoops or paying as much as much as a low end notebook computer. Truly disappointing and I can only predict that this device will fail unless hacked to be more usable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wireless did not work","review":"I give the Kindle a 1 star because the wireless does not work even though I am in an area that it should work. I guess I received a bad one and that was disappointing. I give Kindle support 4 stars though because they answer quickly, even at 9:00 at night. They are very courteous and helpful and even though they did not help me fix the problem they are sending me a brand new one in the mail to replace it. I can still use the Kindle with a computer to download books until I get my new one. On the down side, it will take a couple of weeks to get a replacement and I am not happy about that part of it. Thanks to Oprah they have a back log of orders to fill."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Late-Adopter who loves Kindle","review":"I bought Kindle to use for reading on the bus and subway as I go to work each day. I am not an early adopter, but I was intrigued by the possibility of storing so much content in so little space. There are several books I have not read because they are too large and heavy to lug around. Kindle is much more compact. The screen is great; after a while I almost forget it is not a book. My only complaint is that when I transfer trains I have to turn it off. If I carry it around turned on, I will turn pages unintentionally (or the cover of the Kindle can press the \\"select\\" wheel). Overall, however, I congratulate Amazon for a great product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does what I expected. Great concept.","review":"Fun product! Makes reading books easy and love the ability to carry many with me - or grab off the wireless whatever strikes me. Works well for newspapers like the Wall Street Journal. Tried a magazine - Time. That was a poor fit for this device, especially the Time implementation which does not even try to bring over any graphics. This is not a tool for enjoying magazines from my experience.The screen is easy to read. However, I find the buttons down the left and right used for turning pages to have a very fragile plastic feel to them. I am concerned they won't last a long time - very flimsy feel of thin plastic.I have found the ability to pull down samples of books to be a great feature. This try before buy approach works well with the Kindle concept."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wish list","review":"There are some things I think this needs before it's perfect.1) Nothing replaces a paperback until I can read with it in the tub. I don't necessarily expect it to survive me dropping it in the water, but it needs to survive the intense humidity of the tub-reading experience. The device would therefore need a seamless case, with pressure-sensitive regions for buttons (depressable regions would be nice, for feedback).2) It would be nice if the screen could illuminate. I know the e-paper doesn't work with back-lighting. But some form of illumination across the face or from in front would be great. Heck maybe even a place to clip a light for it.Otherwise I think the Kindle is great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not under the pillow!","review":"I was given my first Kindle a year ago, and three Kindles have packed up on me within the year. I only used the Kindle to read in bed, and kept it under the pillow the rest of the time. I can only assume that the pressure of my head on the pillow has destroyed the screen somehow, so I would advise against keeping it under the pillow or alternatively advise keeping it in a case.Amazon readily replaced the first two that packed up but unfortunately the third time was just outside the one year warranty period. After one year, there is no repair option, though Amazon may offer some concession on a replacement.On the plus side, I was surprised that I readily adjusted to the Kindle format and found it much easier reading in bed with the Kindle than with an ordinary book.The moral is be very careful about putting any pressure on the screen when it's not being used as Amazon are reluctant to admit that the device is vulnerable if you inadvertently pressurise the screen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Used to be happy","review":"After being an avid reader of books, the first time i used a Kindle i was sold on the product. However, after having owned my Kindle for just over a year, 376 days to be concise. I turned it on one night and noticed lines across the screen, this has got progressivly worse over the past few days to the point where i am unable to read.I contacted Amazon who kindly told me that i was out of warranty but could buy another one that was re-conditioned.Having dealt with the excellent customer service over at Apple, i was amazed at quite unhelpful they were.So after this, i will be buying either the Nook or Kobo to see if they manage to last longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless product","review":"I got a Kindle for Christmas last year. Didn't want it then, put it on a shelf. Finally drug it out the day after Thanksgiving, decided to try it. Charged it up. At my house, it can't find a Wi-Fi network. Plugged in the USB cable, apparently I can charge it with the cable, and nothing else. Tried to \\"eject\\" the Kindle using the user manual, nothing. It will charge all day long, won't do anything else. Tried to buy an ebook. Amazon took my money ok, the book downloaded to the PC somewhat ok, but it won't show up on the Kindle. I have thrown it back in the drawer, and it will stay there forever. Glad I didn't pay money for this thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great","review":"Great, another nail in the coffin of bookstores.

Claims about wireless service (through Sprint) are greatly overstated, especially for parts of the country like mine not served by Sprint. While it is possible to download books via the computer (and I did read two novels downloaded to the computer and moved to the Kindle), that isn't what I wanted to be able to do. Further, I was unable to download magazines and newspapers to the computer. Several emails to Kindle support did not address the problem. The third reason I'm returning the Kindle is that books other than best sellers are not available. Why wouldn't Amazon make all award winning books and authors (e.g., Nobel, Pulitzer, Booker) available, regardless of publication date? I would have loved to use and keep the reader and will keep my eyes open for improvements. Based on where I live, I am unable to get my money's worth and am returning it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Kindle could be so much better","review":"The Kindle is an acceptable e-reader at best. It's real value is with the deals that Amazon is making with the publishers and the cell connectivity.I have 5 criticisms of it:1. When it is powered on, it is difficult to pick it up without turning a page; I would put the buttons along the back sides so the screen could be larger (assuming #2 below is not possible);2. The screen should be touch-enabled; it could then be full length, with a keyboard that would appear only when needed (the screen refresh time would have to be reduced to make this work well, but there is already a big latency between the key press and the appearance of a letter anyway); this would also remove the need for the the roller thing to select from menus;3. The bottom right and left corners should be rounded off so it would be more comfortable to hold;4. The power switch should be on the front;5. It really, really, really needs a hierarchical, folder-based storage system for content."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arrived Broken Right Out of the Box :o(","review":"Well -- I arrived home from work today and found my Kindle had been delivered.

So I called customer service and they told me I had to call a different toll-free number for Kindle support (866-321-8851) but that they were available 24x7. I called the number and was told that they were only available during the hours of 6a-10p Pacific (and it was 10:05p). So much for a positive experience with this device.

It's so easy to use! If you are far sighted (like me) you'll love it because you can enlarge the font! If you like to read cheesy romance novels but don't want others to know, you'll love your Kindle. I love the fact that I have access 24/7 to the latest books on the New York Times best seller list, and can download a book in seconds,(in my jammies) while never having to leave my home. I love it that I can preview books before I buy. I love it because it fits in my purse!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Reading will never be the same","review":"Light, extremely portable, user friendly.

It is convenient, easy to use, and a good selection of books to download. The only frustration I have is the buttons are mistakenly pressed and I'm constantly going back and forth. I would prefer the buttons to be in a spot that I don't push all the time. That's just me though. The cover that comes with the Kindle is useless. I mostly keep my Kindle out of it unless I'm traveling with it. All in all, it is a very good device and I enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great reading device","review":"This little device is awesome, especially the cellphone connection to replenish books. The only negative is the sharp corners on the bottom which bite into your hands after a while. I tried reading with the book cover, but found that to be uncomfortable. Also I would recommend against using the entire right side to go to the next page and the left side for previous, just a small section would suffice. I am forever moving to the next page or previous page when I shift the hold on the unit. Also I would recommend a smoother transition to the next/previous page. The flashing in between is a little annoying. I would hope that with enough feedback the next edition will be perfect. Still with all the aforementioned issues I am going to buy a second one for my wife since she keeps using mine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kindle Review","review":"Kindle: Amazon's New Wireless Reading DeviceThis is a wonderful invention!

The audio function is a very nice feature for music while reading and audio books and will be even better when it has more sphisticated controls. Controls however for turning pages are not well placed and cause one to often \\"accidently\\"turn pages.

I really enjoy being able to preview the first chapter or so of the books I am interested in before I buy them. One of my favorite features is the Daily Kindle blog which provides reading recommendations and updates me on books being considered or winning various awards. It's like a personalized version of the New York Times Book Review. The web browsing is clunky, but convenient to have in a pinch. I prefer to do my surfing on a real computer, and read when I am ready to read. I love the digital nature of the books -- no trees are used, no storage required for the books I buy, and I can use it with one hand. The down side is that I cannot loan the book to my friends, but I can still give them recommendations and I save money per book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A piece of Junk!","review":"I bought one during the Amazon sale for $137 with no pop up ads.

Didn't get it wet. Amazon tells me I can purchase a new one. The warranty is only 1 year. I don't know that I even want to purchase another.

I wish it had a few more features - like being able to journal and write notes to myself. I've made suggestions but so far only got an acknowledgment and not an answer. The downside is the cost of books (I'm a library user) but there are a few sites where you can download Kindle versions of books for free.

I am an avid reader and find that books are great organizational challenges. To maintain a library electronically certainly frees up space.I have had my Kindle for a couple of weeks now and have read three books on it already. It lives up to every positive review that I had read prior to my purchase. Due to the reflective nature of the screen, I find that the text is actually easier to read in the Kindle than in a paper-based book. Also, ordering books is a snap (I have not read a newspaper or magazine on it yet, so I cannot comment about how effective that would be).My Kindle is plain white. Jazzing up the color offering would be nice. Other than that, I have not complaints."},{"rating":"2","title":"I <3 kindle","review":"I love my Kindle. I've been reading so much now that I have my new ebook reader. I love the e-ink screen because it's so easy on the eyes. It doesn't look anything like a computer screen. And the wireless connectivity without needing a monthly bill is awesome. Being able to access wikipedia and google from anywhere is essential. Finally, I love the fact that I can try a free sample of a book before buying it and then having it download in less than a minute when I do decide to buy is simply amazing. The ebook selection is only going to grow. The Kindle is revolutionary!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best gift ever","review":"I just got mine this week, and I have not been able to put it down.I love how the screen isn't a glowing screen, it actually looks like ink on paper. You can buy books in an instant, even get the first chapter free, to see if you'll like the book! You can even go on the internet, though, I still am finding this really quirky.I have a teeny complaint, and that is that the page buttons are very sensitive. If you're reading sometimes you'll accidentally hit one of them and then have to re-find your place. It's quite easy, but a bit of a pain.I have never received such a great gift. It's like having a library at your disposal! There are so many books to already choose from, and more coming all the time.I highly suggest to anyone to buy the kindle book, or even paper book:The Complete User's Guide to the Amazing Amazon Kindle -by Stephen Windwalker.Yes it's a user's manual, but it's more! It helps walk you through all the tough stuff, and even some of the stuff not explained in the manual."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome book reader","review":"pages turn accidently and the lookup in dictionary is a little cumbersome, but those are minor.

We read during the entire flight not disturbing any of the people around us. I liked the fact that I didn't have to carry my usual 4 or 5 books with me by just downloading my choices in my Kindle and at a fraction of the price of a hardcopy book or newspaper. We really got a lot of attention with both of us reading everywhere we went. Kindle fits in my handbag so I carry it everywhere and pull it out to read and make notes everywhere I go. I can't recommend it enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"game changer","review":"I was a great skeptic of an electronic book. I am a passionate fan of reading and books, and I couldn't imagine changing the experience. My kids gave me the Kindle and there is no going back. I have only read one book not on Kindle since I got it. I read the NYTimes review of books and if there is something I want, I check the Kindle Books offerings and if it isn't there, I just don't read. I feel really bad about this. I love the look and feel of books, but I love reading a book on a little slab that i can take everywhere and always find my place and switch books with ease. that is why it is a game changer; once you start reading on a Kindle, there is no going back."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE MY KINDLE!","review":"I love my Kindle and the fact that I can travel with so many books all contained in this small parcel.

I would like to see additional news agencies represented other than MSNBC and the BBC, especially Fox News.I am now on my third Kindle, the new Kindle Brightpage and love it.

I felt a little guilt too so I returned it.I was at work shortly after that and one of my customers started talking about how wonderful her new Kindle was! I rethought it and Oprah came on with a special for it. I decided to cut out my cable and I reordered it. I have read 2 large books on it now and love the convenience of it fitting in my purse. I have the perfect new book light that fits it.

The screen is very easy to read, and being able to change the font size is really a plus. There are so many cool features and everything is really easy to use. I was also very pleased that it is compatible with [...], since I already had a subscription for that service. The prices of the downloads from Amazon are very reasonable and FAST. I like the idea of having the \\"real\\" book if it's something that I really love and want to lend to other people, but I read so many books that I just get rid of...this is such a \\"green\\" way to read books. So, I just mentioned one of the downsides to the Amazon - you can't loan books to other people unless you give up your Kindle. The only other downside that I can think of is that the page turning mechanisms are on the sides, so I find it difficult to find a place to hold the Kindle without accidentally changing the page.

Amazon is charging ebooks almost as much as the real paperback versions that you can keep forever. How long does the kindle last? Is there anyway to save the purchases you made onto another device? Like a computer? When you exceed the space limit do you have to start deleting the books you bought to make room for the new ones?The main point i'm trying to make is does all the money put into buying these ebooks go down the toilet once the kindle breaks, or just stops working? I wonder how long the life expectancy is anyway, maybe 5 years or so?I think this would be a worthwhile purchase if the ebooks were alot cheaper than buying a paperback that you would have forever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too expensive","review":"TOO EXPENSIVE!

I want & need one so badly (severe arthritis), but this is too much to ask anyone to purchase it for me.

The one problem I have is with the page turn keys, they are easy to touch even when you don't mean to, as when handling the Kindle. The delivery of the Kindle books is outstanding.

It was almost mystical that I could order a book to review on my lap top at work and then have it on my Kindle when I got home .

I don't know if it's possible but it would be nice if the Kindle had a backlight for reading in the dark. The cover leaves a lot to be desired. I only use the cover when I'm not using the Kindle. As other readers have stated, maybe a third-party vendor will make a Kindle cover that is more useful. Also, it would be nice if Kindle had a choice of colors because I would not have chosen white.Yes, there are a few things that I would change but they are cosmetic.

If you don't believe me, read the first Chapter of Italo Calvino's \\"If on winter's night a traveler\\".The other MAJOR downfall with Kindle is that it severely limits the amount of books one can access. It is difficult to find anything which is not considered extremely mainstream and probably isn't on at least ONE list of some sort (bestseller, Oprah, etc). Can you imagine walking into a bookstore and ONLY having the tables with the books currently being pushed available for reading?

You can't lend. Can't sell on ebay like you can a dvd when you're done. If you bought it for $10 why can't you sell it if you want? Because copying an ebook costs nothing so the copy is therefore has no cash value. Then why did you just pay $10 for a copy?

Somehow I imagined it wouldn't be right to read a book without feeling the pages and enjoying the heft of the thing. But in a very short time I fell in love with the Kindle. Progress always makes us miss the past. I'm sure some people would still enjoy riding a horse to work or hell, even telling stories rather than reading them in print (damn that Guttenberg and his new fangled printing press). With the Kindle I can carry scores of book with me. The screen is terrific and easy on the eyes. The only down side is not being able to tell how many more \\"pages\\" you have to go before you finish a chapter. Once they work that out, I'll have no complaints at all.

On three occassions now, he has shared an interesting \\"find\\" with his Kindle that I never have, nor spoken with anyone else who has made the same discovery. On these three times that he has turned on his Kindle, the script has come up positioned horizontally, not vertically. It caused him no problem to read, in fact he rather liked it.

I live in Motown (quickly becoming Notown). Kindle proves that there are still brains in this country but that the intellectual center of gravity has shifted west. I made a deal with my 12 year-old son. Cut back on internet computer games to 15 minutes a day and I'll buy you one. He kept his word and has read about 1200 pages in the last five days - all on the Kindle. He's happy. I'm happy. If people think this is a waste (or want to whine) they can stay in the cave and continue to watch reruns of Friends or play World of Warcraft - to each his own. This is one instance in which the technologies of the virtual have brought us back full circle to the real. Kindle deserves recognition as a cultural breakthrough which will lead to even better product. Amazon should team up with Nicholas Negroponte and put one in each child's hands."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slick unit - but I wouldn't pay this price for it.","review":"I was one of the test users. It's pretty slick and mostly easy to use - much of the usability feedback was pretty nit-picky. I also suspect that if I'd had a manual I could have figured out some of the questions I had about navigation, but I think that was part of the testing - to see how well we could use it without direction.That said ... $400 is not a price point that interests me at all. I would pay half that perhaps, but only if I could also read things in different formats; I purchase frequently from Amazon but I also use my public library heavily. The inability to get ebooks from other sources would make this product considerably less attractive to me, particularly at a $400 price point.I have had jobs before where I traveled extensively for work and I could see this being a much more attractive product for someone with that type of lifestyle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me","review":"I think that this is a very good idea, but it's not for me.

I live in Missoula, Montana, which is one of the largest cities in the state. It turns out that the wireless connectivity that the Kindle requires does NOT work in Montana. After several tech support calls they admitted that there is no coverage in Montana. There may also be no coverage in other states, such as Wyoming and Alaska. This means that the Service component of the device is useless, and that many, many people may be duped.

I still go to the library for my books while she stays at home and reads. She is thrilled with it. She reads it indoors or out. The picture is clear even in the Arizona sun.It is expensive and is a one trick pony. There are many other things I sure we would like it to do and it is expensive.

However, it's not in color which is useful when reading technical books on a device like this or articles in the papers. I like graphs in color. Buy the next version that comes out. Forget this one.

For those of us who live on a \\"Sprint\\" fringe coverage area it would be great if Kindle/Amazon went with a service such as AT&T; and/or Verizon because they both have much greater coverage than Sprint.I know this has just come out and I look forward to the FINAL touches being put in place"},{"rating":"2","title":"I am in love, luf, lust.....","review":"Well after having Kindle in my home for a couple of months, I think?, I really enjoy it more than I thought I would.

I have recommended this to all my reading friends, and some people I don't know, but they see me using it & ask questions. There are a lot of books out now that I would have waited to read until they were in paperback (I hate lugging around big hardcovers), but now I have the ease & convenience of my Kindle.

Otherwise, I think it is wonderful and very useful. I can even read while walking if I make the text larger; fun! It's also entertaining to browse the store and download samples.

As it sits on one side and the Kindle on the other, the screen is still lit and frozen, although in the Off position. My sister's terrific Christmas present to me is worthless.

Here I am on holiday in a foreign country and the display cracked while in my luggage. Don't believe the picture in the product listing showing it being put bare into a back pack or surviving a drop. Kindle's screen is very fragile and if not well protected will crack with slight pressure. Mine didn't get any hard knocks and still cracked. I think this is a nice product idea but not nice enough to justify the price, nor is it robust enough. I really don't care if it is as heavy as a book, as long as it's just as tough. It should be able to be dropped from several feet, should have a built in cover if the display needs protection, and it should use the usb port for charging, not require a different charger."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware - but now a satisfied customer","review":"Loved our Kindle, despite known ergonomic immaturity. BUT within 3 months the screen broke and Amazon has no recourse for us. No accidental damage policy was available to purchase, they don't offer any repair service, they won't allow us to buy a new one at a lower price. They tell us all we can do is throw our $400, 3 month old Kindle into the garbage and buy a new one. The screen is fairly fragile - so only buy this if you realize your risks of losing your investment.Update 10/4: After writing Amazon to let them know of our disappointment over having no alternative for repairing our broken Kindle (we did NOT drop it), Amazon has resolved our complaint in a fair manner. I am so impressed that Amazon heard us.

The screen is very good and easy to read, just like a regular book. It has lots of neat features, marking/saving quotes in a book, searching, and the on-line access worked very well. It worked anywhere in my home, places our cell phones did not work. Down loading was very fast. I found I missed having a book, and the handling of the Kindle was awkward for me. I kept accidentally hitting the page forward/back buttons, there was little room to hold it. It is a little bigger than most paperbacks, it does not fit into your pocket easily. Most Kindle book prices are $9.99, compared to buying paperbacks, that is little high. It uses an electronic format that is not compatible with other electronic formats, so you can not use most other electronic formats.

Being able to buy books on Amazon.com is a huge win even if the content library is still too small. Wireless delivery makes using the device much easier, no desktop syncing software required.My primary complaint is that the device is incredibly flimsy and too big. I far prefer the form-factor of the Sony Reader, which is both sturdy and compact. The Kindle's big flimsy next-page button got a plastic strip ripped off it the second time I threw it in my carry-on laptop bag, despite being in the book cover. I repeat, the _second_ time. The sony reader has weathered many many airplane trips in that same bag without hardly a scratch -- and it takes up less space to boot.

I'm sure if you study the manual it is probably useable but it still has a long way to go before it will be able to replace the usability of a book. Aside from the usability issues the display refresh is appallingly slow i couldn't imagine the suspense waiting to see the next page of the book.

So you can buy a $10 book on amazon for about $7, or pay $7 for the electronic version that ONLY works on this device. Let's say you're an avid reader like myself. What if you lose your device? It gets stolen? Broken? Not only are you out your $400, but also whatever you've spent on reading material to populate it, that you now have to re-purchase to replace.

Also, the Amazon store sells older books for nearly nothing. I am also discovering this is a wonderful way to learn of new authors and give their work a try.My biggest tip if you decide to buy is order on Amazon as soon as you are able and then wait it out.

I found a way to switch the mode to \\"fine\\" which gives you more light, but it will not record.Then it has this annoying auto focus mode that won't turn off. So my camcorder will be in a tripod taping something and it goes in and out of focus the whole time (meanwhile the subject is not moving and neither is the camera, so why does it do that?) UGH!I can go on and on...bottom line? Don't waste your money! It is not very user-friendly at all and the quality is not great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Camera-Easy to Use","review":"Great camera-easy to use. I got this for my parents as a gift and they are able to record, take photos, upload photos without any problems. Quality of video is great. Quality of photos is not a s clear as a my digital camera, but still a nice feature to have."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is a good deal for a normal user.","review":"I am attracted by this camcorder like many other guys by the hard disk drive function. I have used it almost 10 days and admit it is good. The camera of this machine is just so so,so don't hope it can be substituted as a camera.It can record the real world satisfactorily. yes there is some delay,when you displace the camcorder fast. when there are at the same time a shadow and a place under sunshine in the eye of camcorder, the camcorder will be puzzled for a while.So if you have excellent requirements,you will be disappointed. For normal users, It is good enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"negative five stars","review":"The camera is great, but the main purpose of it is to import it to a computer. They claim its Mac compatible, but you have to buy hundreds of dollars of additional HORRIBLE software to get it to work. Their \\"mac friendly\\" claim is a lie and misleading. I was thinking plug in, imovie, happy. Thats what the salesman led me to believe too (because they claim its mac compatible). I'm taking it back tomorrow. PC USERS: Have fun. MAC USERS: Run while you can."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Tapes Needed","review":"Have really put it through its paces yet. But had purchased it so that I didn't have to deal with tapes which is a common thought. I've had a previous JVC product not from amazon but purchased locally. Used it for years. It was a miniDV camcorder. Still works however wanted to be able to record nonstop without the worry of the tape running out. Not sure about battery consumtion yet as mentioned by other reviews. But if more than one is carried it shouldn't be a problem. The usb provides a direct link into the computer to which windows media player, etc. Picks up the recorded media pretty quickly and allows viewing of recorded media. Which is a nice feature. Unlike tapes where one would have to record to VHS first... Overall I like it thus far..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A promising start to a new series","review":"The Egyptian pharaoh Akhenaten has been the subject of many, many novels, most of which I have read. P.C. Doherty is the author of many books, most of which I have read as well. I must say, however, that as novels about Akhenaten goes, this one is better than a lot I have read. And, as a book by P.C. Doherty, this book is also somewhat better than many of his medieval mysteries and a hundred times better than his other ancient Egyptian mysteries (The Slayers of Seth, etc.) which are marred by abysmal research and ridiculous plots. It reminds me a little bit of Naguib Mafouz's novel of Akhenaten, \\"Akhenaten, Dweller in Truth\\", but the plot is far more convoluted. I look forward to seeing how the series progresses."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Evil Spirit Out of the West -- Awesome Egyptian Fiction!","review":"I found this book on Amazon and ordered this book, as well as the other 2 books in the trilogy. I have just finished reading this and cannot wait to dive into the other two from this series. If you love historical fiction, with an emphasis on ancient Egypt, don't miss this author. It is very refreshing to find a read that I enjoyed so very much."},{"rating":"1","title":"too dry","review":"Perhaps this would be a good book for a hardcore medieval history buff. The author lays down facts and geographies and genealogies, but all from an observed distance. One never feels what it is like to live in those times or in that style and culture. There was no excitment; no feel for the adventure. Too dry for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"a better option","review":"This book is mainly for the hardcore Cid fan, (and outside of Spain how many of those can there be?) If you're more interested in the set and setting, i.e. the history of the Spanish peninsula during the Moorish occupation, you would be much better served reading \\"Moorish Spain\\" by the same author. Still, this book is well put together and is not a bad read in itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Historian book","review":"This book gives a great environment of the CID.My wife being a decesdent of the CID is a great picture ofhis life and times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awdaghast","review":"The people of Awdaghast were berbers, but they were not \\"white-skinned\\". They were light brown and likely ranged from yellow in color to black, like most other Northern Africans today who live between the northernmost edge of Africa and the Sahel. Thoughout all known history, this region has been a mix of the peoples who frequently migrate across it. To label this city in particular as \\"white\\", as if some barrier existed between it and the black cities around it, is ridiculous. This is especially true, considering that the city was founded by blacks (soninke) and was abandoned as the people (everyone - berber and non-berber) moved further south to more fertile lands."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Helps","review":"I have been using this product for about 6 months now, it really does relieve the pain associated with my osteoarthritis in my hip.

This book, however, was a big disappointment. The authors spend too much time discussing their views of trans fatty acids, flaxseed oil, antibiotics, and other subjects and very little time on coconut oil. Out of the 84 pages of text only about half actually discusses coconut oil. It's like the authors didn't know enough about coconut oil and had to pad the book with other subjects. The authors have no background or training in science or medicine and make several inaccurate statements and misinterpret some of the studies cited. Although I believe coconut oil is one of the good fats, this book did not present a very convincing argument. I thought the book was a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many problems...","review":"From the moment we received this printer there were problems. First problems started when papers would continually jam in both the document feeder as well as the paper tray. Next it would not print from my computer or scan. I've had to download new drivers several times to try to fix several of the problems. Now I am receiving another message stating paper misfeed. I've searched high and low through all the compartments in this machine and there is NO paper misfeed. Assuming it's a bad sensor? Anyways, it won't print, scan, email, fax or photocopy anything. This machine is extremely fussy and not at all user friendly. So needless to say I have a $900+ printer that is fully non-functional taking up space in my office.

I tried to enjoy this novel, but the poor writing and unrealistic characters made it impossible to recommend to anyone. I can see how some people can overlook the poor quality for the unusual story, but I found it difficult to ignore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chutzpah is right!!!","review":"Dershowitz has balls all right... still trying to absolve himself from the liberal insanity of defending OJ, he pontificates and trys to justify the defense of his daughter's assaulter\\\\potential rapist.Everyone is entitled to a equal defense, and Dershowitz's try's to illustrate this by defending an octegenarian Harvard scholar accused of murdering a Nazi War criminal. Prandus the Nazi war criminal had murdered the professor's family during WWI. The only mind sicker in this tomb than the Nazi Prandus is the author.A word of mental health to Mr. Dershowitz stop writing looking for absolution and go speak to a rabbi."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Self Centered Revisionism and Hypocrisy from this Clown","review":"Dersh obviously carries a lot of personal guilt inside for the Holocaust and refused to let go. So here through his main character he creates a way to pretend he's brave by getting \\"revenge\\" today for something that happened 50 years ago. Honestly, if Dershowitz is so torn over killing innocent people that he can't let it rest than why vigorously defend such an obvious murderer has OJ Simpson? Does this mean that the Goldman and Brown families should knock off Dershowitz and his kids?Basically, this guy is \\"Just a Hypocrite.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Gag","review":"The first thing this author needs to do is learn the proper use of the words \\"who\\" and \\"whom\\". I also found it distracting that the college-student daughter calls her father \\"Daddy\\" and that he constantly refers to her as \\"sweetie\\". Gag me. I agree with the reviewer who stated that this is Judaism at its worst. I have read many wonderful and moving books with Judaism as their focus. This was not one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"this guy is Nuts with a capital \\"N\\"","review":"in this book, mr. self righteous himself strongly advocates extracting harsh penalties on the innocent off spring of criminals. in that case, most his clients kids would need 24 hour guards."},{"rating":"1","title":"dershowitz as we know and love him","review":"Trash, trash, trash. What else would one expect from the most embarrassing member of the scholarly legal profession and from a man who has singlehandedly done more than criminals to debase the American legal system."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best Books...","review":"I've read in a long time. Dershowitz writes a book that asks a compelling moral question. The characters in this book are incredibly likeable, and it is amazing the way Dershowitz makes the reader feel compassion for a man who committed horrible and unforgiveable acts years ago. This story portrays two sides of an unthinkable, yet very real, historical tragedy. Does a person have the right to seak revenge on a person who years ago, during the Nazi era, committed unthinkable acts of malice? Read this book and you will be intrigued."},{"rating":"2","title":"what a great book","review":"this was the greatest book i have read in years and has a very good revenge mark for the holocaust."},{"rating":"2","title":"A compelling view of justice only Dershowitz could write.","review":"This thoughtful novel brings to light the triple sword of justice as it relates to the Holocaust, the inequities of the legal system, and the ever- present dilemma of enacting a punishment that truly fits the crime. This is the second-best book I've read on the subject. As Dershowitz looks at the Holocaust from the legal perspective of one person's act of revenge versus justice, in his classic novel - Abraham, Isaac, Jacob & Zev - Jerry Marcus examines the Holocaust from the dual perspectives of one's personal responsibility to remember the atrocities, and society's responsibility to expose the roots of anti-Semitism and speak out against both its overt and subtle forms."},{"rating":"1","title":"A ridiculous story and distorted Judaism.","review":"This book is so bereft of any value that despite my having a library of thousands of volumes, I had to throw out my copy of Just Revenge, as I saw no justification for keeping it, and there is no age group or anyone at all that I'd recommend it to. The story is absurd, and placed within the context of a heavily distorted Judaism, and supposedly Jewishly observant family, where father condones housing daughter and lover, and where a \\"great professor\\" of Jewish philosophy is mouthing statements that are repeatedly ridiculous. The only thing that became clearer to me is why the author's children want out of Judaism. This book has no value AT ALL."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horredous","review":"As a writer, I had this urge to redline sections of this book that should be axed and to send my edits to the publisher. This book is self serving, poorly written, egocentric and boring. It is poorly written, poorly conceived and poorly executed. The author has a brilliant legal mind--he should stick to writing non-fiction. Editors should stop pandering to successful writers who want to write novels. My concerns regarding this book have nothing to do with the content or the subject. This is just a poorly structure book, a waste of time in this era of plentiful reading material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Book","review":"\\"His writing has been praised by Truman Capote, SAUL BELLOW...\\"I just saw this and had to say, \\"Nooooooooooooooooooo!!!\\"That's the publishing game for you. I guess a few plaques on the wall are always more useful than actual writing ability."},{"rating":"2","title":"The thin line between justice and revenge.","review":"This was a very good book with some good twists and turns. It shows how close the line is between justice and revenge. How does the avenger decide? Where is the line crossed?This book is heartbreaking in a way in that it gives examples of how people's live are changed by a single act and how they fulfill their lust for the truth to be made clear: Justice or Revenge?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Brilliant Man!!","review":"Mr. Dershowitz is by far a brilliant professor and attorney. He speaks the truth and does not pull punches. His fictional work is also wonderful. I think he is disliked largely because of his work on the Simpson trial.Right is Right, and Wrong is Wrong. Alan does not care whether you are white, black, brown, or green, he speaks the truth about any subject matter. He is god's gift to the legal system!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another circus and SHOW by DerSHOWitz's victimhood.","review":"Well, I was wondering how long it would take this Showman and hindsight Attorney who takes on cases after they are decided would write a novel? Most of the novel reminds me of his views on making up defenses for the guilty so many think he is wise? The book is a very poor attempt of a second guessed lawyer writing about being involved with a victimless hero. Alan is better at creating fiction in the court room rather than creating fiction in books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why Is This Guy Still Being Published?","review":"Dershowitz is a wacko as dangerous as skinheads hiding out in log cabins in the woods. Here he advocates extracting revenge on the innocent relatives of crime perpetrators. This guy's next book (and let's hope there won't be a next) should be written behind jail cell bars. He belongs there for inciting violence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"We had to read this book my criminal law class. The actual story line was fairly realistic, but the way Dershowitz writes is too predictable. Each chapter seems to represent a single distinct thought, which takes away from the overall story. The ending was so cheesy its not even funny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some flaws, but thought-provoking","review":"While I agree with the criticisms that the character development is week, and the dialog often unrealistic, the story is strong, and the concepts presented are thought-provoking. Given the material he wanted to present in a fictional setting, I think Dersh did an admirable job of crafting a story around it. Despite the dialog problem, the English flows well. And the ending, while somewhat saccharine, was, I felt, appropriate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful, Corrupt, Sick","review":"This book asks the question: \\"Is it right to commit unspeakable acts on innocent family members of criminals?\\" The answer is of course \\"no.\\" It's how one bad acts never ends and it's not even interesting. It's just nonsense. But in Dershowitz warped world anything goes. This guy is dangerous. What can you expect from the man who defended OJ?"},{"rating":"2","title":"I highly recommend this book for bookclubs","review":"This is a wonderful book for a group discussion. I hope Mr.Dershowitz writes more books..I will read them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought provoking and moving","review":"This book makes you FEEL as well as think about an extremely disturbing moral and legal dilemma. It tempts readers to sympathize, if only for a moment and if only at a very human level, with the desire for a terrible act of revenge against a former Nazi butcher, including the death of innocent family members. It then turns around and invites the reader to sympathize, if only for a moment and at a very human level, with the desire for vengeance by the son of the former Nazi butcher. Finally, it forces readers to decide what kind of punishment the law itself is entitled to impose. The most \\"annoying\\" thing about the book is that it NEVER oversimplifies, on either legal or moral issues. It will really engage readers who are not satisfied with pat solutions, and are willing to learn something about themselves from their own reactions to a very suspenseful told story."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books...","review":"I've read in a long time.

Developoment of characters is flawed and uninteresting. The author uses great liberties in describing how our legal system is applied in a jury situation and some of it is actually inaccurate. Book does not create much suspense and many of the plots are given away by his use of present tense rather than past tense when describing the alleged murders of the Prandus family. The ending leaves you hanging and does not really address the issue of revenge murder. The book was a waste of money and the author should stick to teaching what he thinks the law is at Harvard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hugely necessary and important","review":"Fascinating: one review complains that the book is too slanted toward an African-American perspective, and another that it's too slanted toward a white perspective. What better proof that this issue is still unresolved? In fact, I can say having READ this book, unlike some reviewers (cough, cough) that this is very measured -- and gripping. I'm proud to be an American, but ashamed both that this could happen, and so recently, and -- more -- that we're all so ignorant about it: so many people have this fantasy that the sorts of pograms that killed Jews in eastern Europe have nothing to do with us. Well read this book and learn about pograms, American style. Chilling and vital."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice","review":"Excellent CD!This CD takes you back in style.

One curious point: with the exception of Maria Alejandra, it appears that all the acts on this CD feature male vocalists.This is a strong CD in general, but my favorites include the following: Tonny Tun Tun's \\"Caminando,\\" which features a particularly aggressive vocal style; Ronny Soler's seductive performance on \\"Como Duele\\"; the surprisingly gentle-sounding lead vocals on K-Libre's \\"La Quiero y La Quiero\\"; Proyecto Nuevo's fun \\"Papi Chulo\\"; and of course, Maria Alejandra's sensual, passionate rendition of \\"Me Equivoque.\\" If this CD doesn't get you hot, you'd better check your pulse!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Quality But...","review":"This adaptor is fine but it would be good if Grant made available a variety of extentions....this two inch one was TOO MUCH for my application.

It will discourage you from day one because it sounds terrible and is harder to play (poor design & construction).

The sheath is good material. The strap part are two elastic bands with velcro through what could also double as a belt loop on the sheath. The issue I have is in order to prevent the knife falling out there is a button clasp which you have to use two hands to undo. With the elastic bands it's not possible to use one hand to unbutton it without additional support, which is a problem if you want it on your arm. Would have prefered velcro there. Getting the velcro around the arm was difficult to say the least.

Most of the chapters read like religious partisan rants. Rahula spent the majority of the book addressing what he felt were misconceptions about Buddhism without really explaining what Buddhism is. I agree with the reviewer who said that the second chapter was pretty much a nitpicking semantic jeremiad on the word 'dukkha.'That said, the book contains one of the greatest lines of all time: \\"So Pukkusati went out in search of an alms-bowl and robes, but was unfortunately savaged by a cow and died.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"full of it","review":"It's too bad this book has become a leading authority in the US on Buddhism, because it's, well, full of it!Walpola Rahula asserts, for example, that \\"not a single drop of blood\\" was shed in Buddhism's spread across the world. Maybe he thinks the violence of the Heian monasteries' armies, the Kayin Buddhist army, the centuries of capital punishment and mutilations in Buddhist Tibet, the Korean monastic wars, etc etc should be blamed on al-Qaida or aliens or something.This book pretends that Therevadin Buddhism is the Buddha's only legitimate heir, speciously applies the Buddha's teaching on the relevance of India's gods to the question of God's existence, ignores all hard questions of doctrine and dialogue, and just generally propagandizes like a drunken Steven Segal.I was really let down by this famous book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"This is a good book for all those who are guided to find out more about Buddhism without most of the one-sided different sects.

Cooker worked fine when only 2 burners were lighted, but when all three burners were lighted and we tried to turn them all the way up, all three burners shut down. Also, the frame gives minimal wind protetion to the burners. A better/taller wind deflector would be much better when cooking outside.

Beyonce does an amazing job being sexy and spiritual and Cuba Gooding Jr. shows off his gymnastic capabilities with ease as well as his ability to poke fun at himself.This is certainly no cinematic wonder nor is it a deep character study with contrasting plot lines - however, just watching Beyonce perform in the choir scenes and listening to the incomparable O'Jays is enough reason to buy this DVD.

Why? Because it's such a pleasant, feel good movie with a genuine sweetness to it. When it comes on cable (even though I've seen it numerous times), I can't help but watch it. I love the music, I love the humor (Mike Epps displays his usual comic brilliance) and I love the classic character types (the \\"holier-than thou\\" churchlady, the big city type who finds fulfillment in his small hometown, etc.).That said, I have as many highbrow tastes as the next girl.

Beyonce' is an excellent singer, which makes up for her \\"just okay\\" acting in this movie.

If you don't feel better at the end of this movie than you did at the beginning, YOU'RE DEAD!! This movie is not only entertaining, but it also teaches a wonderful lesson in personal values. Cuba's character starts out directing the choir of a Church in the town of his youth, only for the promise of an inheritance of $150,000.00 (contingent on them winning a gospel choir contest..), but ends up doing it because it's the right thing to do, and turns down the money.

This movie CERTAINLY will!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun characters and great music","review":"I think most of the criticism for this film is probably accurate, but it's hard to avoid being charmed by Cuba Gooding, Jr. and Beyonce\`. Cuba's cnergy and enthusiasm, coupled with Beyonce\`'s musical talent and beauty, cover any thinness in the story, predictability, or editing missteps.There are so many zany and charming secondary characters in this film that they are hard to keep up with, and each one adds a little depth to the film.The musical numbers are nearly transfixing. By far, they are the highlight of the film, which showcases a number of worthy talents.Also very valuable (and sadly, rare) this is a film that the whole family can watch, relate to, and enjoy. There are lots of good messages about forgiveness, acceptance, teamwork, humility, etc. that would be valuable for humankind in general.Lots of laughs, great stars, good messages, good pacing, amazing musical numbers...what's not to like? Highly recommended for the whole family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Light hearted enjoyable movie","review":"We've seen this premise many times before but that doesn't take away from this movie's charm. There are no surprises here. We all know that Cuba Godding's character will undergo a change of heart but it's okay. The driving force behind this film is the music. It's upbeat gospel that really gets your feet tapping. Gooding is funny in this vehicle and although he is capable of much more serious work, he's very good at this kind of role as well. I must also mention that it was very nice to see Melba Moore who hasn't been seen anywhere in quite some time.There is no nudity of sex in this film but it is mentioned a time or two. There is very little if any foul language.The Fighting Temptations is a great Saturday afternoon movie. I also suggest buying the soundtrack. There are a couple of songs that were not including on the soundtrack.

The only downside is that the tea light lasts much longer than the liquid at the top therefore you need to keep an eye on it and either replace the water/essential oil or blow out the candle. Other than that, I am very pleased with this product. The item was shipped before the initial expected date. I would purchase a similar item again from this seller."},{"rating":"1","title":"smaller than expected","review":"Overpriced and doesn't look good after a few uses.

A lot of complex things are explained in a easy way and with the minimum amount of calculation, which might put some people off. It's halfway between a technical course and engineering course.This book is heavy on the practical applications, this will boost your knowledge about the subject (as if you had been working in the area for ages). I would like him to write more books."},{"rating":"1","title":"crap","review":"The Author goes into extensive detail and tends to go on and on and on. Its definitely not a light read and its very hard to follow. The diagrams are not labeled very well and rather simple and stupid. Definitely not a good resource book or to keep forever. He doesn't explain things in black and white and tends to drift off on tangents in which you get lost in. I loved the class but hated the book. The book could have been written a lot clearer and to the point. If you don't have a PhD, good luck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Translation","review":"Rudd's translation is a pleasure to read.

There were beautiful baby flip-a-faces, but only one word for each page. To my surprise,he was delighted. He immediately mastered the baby's facial expressions and the word that was associated with each expression. Now, he makes me read it with over and over so we can together make the baby expressions, and say the words. He especially loves the last page when the baby is sleeping, and we both put our fingers to our lips and say, \\"Shhhh\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"There's just not much to it","review":"My girls love the flip-a-face books, especially Big Little.

In this case, a definite yes. I'll leave in depth character reviews to sites better suited for it, but all three girls are likable in their own ways, and their interactions are well handled. The supporting characters are less well established, but still convincing. None feel redundant or out of place. The animation is CGI heavy with respect to the rockets and support equipment, but otherwise smooth and easy on the eyes.As other reviewers have mentioned, the only real disappointment is the lack of a dub track, though since I prefer subtitles anyway it was a moot point for me.All in all, a nice series for scifi fans and general viewing alike."},{"rating":"2","title":"The pills really work!!!!!!!","review":"The first time I took one of the pills I felt very relaxed.

Can be fined tuned enough to leave foil or braided wrap in tact and the center wire undamaged, which is always the challenge. I does require a few practice attempts to set it the way you want it, so be prepared. Once you've got it it does a fine job. Be sure you read the types of cable it works on in the ad for the product. It is not designed to be a universal tool but works well for the fittings described."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coaxial Stripper","review":"These are by far the easiest way to cut insulation on 6 gauge wire. Comes with 3 blades, I removed the two outer ones and saved them as spares. Left the center one there and adjusted blade cutting depth so as not to cut wire strands. Wah-La!

Read it to understand what might have happened had Americans chosen to go over to the \\"dark side.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"John Wayne, Walter Brennan, Ward Bond - how can it miss?","review":"But it does. Vera Ralson is part of the problem, she's pretty but bland in the role of Wayne's new bride who sweet-talks him in going to the title state so they can run a riverboat business, but the real weakness is the overall look of the film. An overabundance of rear projection and rather obvious indoor/outdoor scenes gives this 'outer' a distint fake feeling. Duke is amicable in the lead, Bond makes a sturdy villian, Brennan is fine doing his Gabby Hayes impersonation and the film has a rousing climax, but it never rises beyond it's B origins"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass on This One","review":"I had high hopes for this movie, being it had Wayne, Brennan, and Ward Bond. However, my hopes were dashed with each passing scene. The plot is weak and confusing. Director Joseph Kane obviously believed the more action, gunfights, and fistfights he could add would make a better film. He was wrong. The action is overdone, actually ridiculous at times, and rather than add to the movie, it detracts. The love story is equally implausible and ridiculous. All in all, this is a very disappointing movie. Made in 1945, it is a very immature western, lacking the depth of plot and characterization that bespeak good films. This is a \\"B\\" western all the way, and if if comes your way, get out of its way!kone"},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining Movie!","review":"Each to his own opinion but I found this movie a lot of fun. I laughed out loud several times and the movie moves at a good pace. It's early John Wayne and I thought all the actors did a good job. If you're a Leonard Maltin wannabe then you'd probably prefer Wayne's Hondo or Searchers.

Beyond that, I can't really say I enjoy some of the dialogue and acting in this show. It feels dry, and the emotion completely drained in some of the scenes. I do like the banter between Grimm and his partner though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad disks!","review":"I love the show and this should be clear since I paid for the set so the review is for a product. Disk.1 had deep scratches on it and it wouldn't play. 3 episodes skipped, showed pixels and then the disk stopped and showed the dvd menu. I'm sure it's the poor paper packaging that damaged the disks.

I really thought this series would be amazing (as he co-produced Grimm). I had high hopes and couldnt wait to see it. Unfortunately, I was so bored after only one episode I turned it off.

When that got cancelled, I was convinced that TV had died and we would be stuck with cruddy reality TV forever.Then Grimm aired. I love this show. The cool thing is that you don't have to see every episode to understand what's going on. Not that I'd miss one anyhow.Check it out! It's awesome!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Getting better","review":"I started to watch them both Grimm and Once Upon a Time almost at the same time. I like them both, but as time pass I am liking more the Grimm show. Once Upon a Time still a nice story but I am just bored to dead with how the \\"good\\" people get beating in this show, it is like they have no self esteem at times and they just let others walk over them. But Grimm has become more interesting, a lot more darker indeed at times, it is becoming a really interesting show to watch. I will like to know a lot more about the Captain of the Police(I think that is what he is), he is intriguing and the actor does a good job. You just don't know enough about him and he seems to have a lot of power but hard to guess how powerful he is, or what is really his role. I have never seem him transform into nothing and still he seems to know everyone, even the Grimm Reapers have respect for him. So yes it is a good show to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely loved it!","review":"This is an awesome series, very entertaining to watch.

Would have rated it as 5 stars.However, had to return the set due to a bad Disk 1 and Disk 5. Disk 1 had deep scratches and the picture would freeze and it couldn't clear itself and move forward. Two episodes were affected by the scratches, the other episodes were okay on the disk. Disk 5 also had several scratches. The set was purchased NEW from Amazon. Had to rate the item as a 2 star.Went to the local Walmart and purchased it again NEW and checked Disk 1 before I tried to use it. Again, Disk 1 was scratched similar to the set from Amazon. Played Disk 1 and this time the pixels started to separate on the screen and distorted the picture and faces. Obviously there is a problem from the manufacturing/packaging process.

One very nice feature is the deleted scenes for almost every episode."},{"rating":"2","title":"fun to watch","review":"If you don't take your supernatural shows too seriously you'll enjoy this. The main character doesn't understand the world he's been dropped into and is supposed to protect the normal people from. But he is a good cop. He recruits the first well behaved monster he meets to be his guidebook and strange things ensue. I particularly like the reluctant sidekick. It has some potential but may not draw the following for long term run.

Although I find it inappropriate to draw any conclusions when I read his words (I respect the Man too much), these private letters cast a different shade from which you can gather some concrete material about what his life, and hence his writing, is really about. Provocative, a clean read, and after reading this, I think anyone will have to reconsider many of their \\"wacked-out\\" thought regarding Burroughs, be they good or bad thoughts.

The English version only serves to point out the weakness of the libretto. Janet Baker, always a totally dedicated artist, copes well with the soprano role of Mary - a role better recorded by Sills, Sutherland and company. Rosalind Plowright sounds consistently hysterical as Queen Elizabeth and her diction is totally unintelligible. David Rendall fares little better and the only person who comes through is John Tomlinson as Talbot. The sound is very good.Question: when is ENO, or anyone for that matter, going to record \\"The Magic Flute\\" in English - now that would be worth it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fav","review":"Absolute favorite of my daughters.

BUY PLOTTO!","review":"In 1928, William Wallace Cook wrote Plotto.Nowhere did I find any reference to Plotto in Plots Unlimited wherein the aut...(no I cannot really say author) state that his entire book, Plots Unlimited is an unabashed ripoff of the 1928 book. What kind of a person steals not only another's idea but does so almost down to the layout, page by page? Are you that devoid of ideas, you must steal them? I think it is disgusting!IT DESERVES 0 STARS.DON'T BUY THIS BOOK! BUY PLOTTO, IT'S EVEN LESS EXPENSIVE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your dollars; write your own plots.","review":"Unless you are the writer of failing sit-coms and drugstore paperbacks, I suggest spending your money elsewhere. There is little here that the serious writer has not already entertained and/or discarded in his mind(most likely discarded). The plots, unlimited as they're proclaimed to be, are quite limited in originality and scope. By scope, I mean to say that the offered plots are confining, both in structure and action. All things considered, I would not reccomend this book to anyone, especially not to writers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nearly Impossible To Use","review":"The idea behind this book is great, but in reality it's nearly impossible to use. I had high hopes when I purchased it but was very disappointed once I read it. The directions were confusing, and the whole book is too disjointed to be helpful. Because it was so expensive I tried several times over a year to read it and glean something I could use just to justify the expense. Each time I would walk away no better off than I was before. It's too bad the author didn't take the general idea of this book, simplify the directions, update it, and definately make the whole thing user friendly. What a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"A science text book might have been more helpful","review":"This isn't the most user-friendly book I've ever read, and the plots are straight out of a bad 80's soap-opera. It might help get your brain going when experiencing writers block, but I doubt you'd get your money's worth out of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's all the Hype about?","review":"This book, like the other reviews say, isn't much help. It's basically the plots for old movies that I've seen once or twice, but are way before my time.

(Just checked it out from the library)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Phenomenal and fascinating","review":"This is a wonderful video of Argerich playing two fantastic piano concertos. Of the two, her Prokofiev is the outstanding performance.... Just brilliant. The audio quality and video quality are both completely fine, so I am not sure why some people are complaining about that. There is a good balance of camera work on her hands and her face, although at some points one wishes the camera angles were better since in one performance her hair masks her face quite a bit. But that is a small quibble. I have watched it through three times, and it is really great. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Speechless","review":"I just finished reading this novel not 5 minutes ago, needless to say, I'm at a loss for words. I was disapointed with the chapters including Cammie and Adam. I don't much like seeing them together and I don't like the rapid change of personality within Cammie. I do, however, love the chapters with Anna. I have to say my favorite part of the book that kept me on edge was the chapter where Anna and her father were at the Airport. It had so much emotion that I got a jump in the back of my throat myself and I could feel my face heating up. I can't wait until the next novel, hopefully there will be a lot of Ben included. I was sooo waiting for Ben to show up in the last chapter, was kind of upset when he wasn't, but then as I thought about the ending, I was some-what satisfied.Great Job Zoey Dean, Keep it up for the sake of teenage girls everywhere deep in emotion due to your text."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even Better","review":"Zoey Dean makes \\"The A-List\\" an even better series with Tall Cool One. Anna Percy struggles with finding herself and becoming her own person with life after Ben. She sees everyone hooking up around her and wonders if a one-night stand would do her any good. I was excited to see Anna and Sam get away to Mexico and away from the influence of everyone in Cali. It was also good to see that Sam is able to in some ways come to terms with being \\"overweight\\" compared to the rest of her friends-and to find a hot guy in the process! It is also relieving to see that Cammie is actually a real person; she is not all cattiness and hormones, she does have feelings! The way this book ends is keeping me waiting for more (especially on the Sam front, now that she's found her \\"prince\\"!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"You Get What You Pay For","review":"Overall, I was very disappointed in this item; there's a reason it's such a cheap price and they're trying to get rid of them. It's a smaller guitar than I expected, and the strings are poor quality nylon -- the 1E string snapped on me as I was tuning it, five minutes out of the box. Also, because it doesn't have a trust board, you can't restring it steel strings. The \\"tuner\\" it comes with is just a pitch pipe (with a tinny sound at that), and the other \\"accessories\\" aren't as great an added advantage as you'd think. Personally, I returned this after the string snapped on me. I'd recommend this guitar only if you're an absolute beginner, and even then, you'd probably want to learn on something a little more durable than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay AWAY!","review":"This guitar is really cheap, so it doesnt surprise me that it's made from a nameless company, the tuner is just a pitch pipe.

The guitar was of horrible quality as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good beginner guitar","review":"If you or your child wants to learn the guitar but you're not sure if it'll take, this is a good instrument to start on.

The guitar did not come with the carrying bag and accesories as stated either. This may have been just a screw up with my order, but there was another complaint like mine under this seller's feedback. The guitar smelled terrible, like chemicals.

I purchased this guitar for my son and it has a very nasty odor to it. Smells like some strong chemical. I also bought a guitar for my daughter (pink baja) and it did not have this problem. I tried playing this guitar, but after 10 minutes I thought I was going to faint and my nose was burning so bad. I will be trashing this guitar and buying my son a different one. I do not need him to end up in the hospital with some kind of ventilation poisoning due to the chemicals used on this blue guitar (I'm thinking it is from the varnish). One more thing, this guitar is very cheaply made. I bought the pink baja and this one at a similar price. This blue guitar is a piece of junk that will be thrown away.

Movie! Lots of Laughs!","review":"I'm not really a Kelsey Grammar fan but I must admit he was excellent in this movie! There are so many great scenes in this film but the one that gets me howling every time is when Buckman, the cook onboard the USS Stingray finishes eating a plate of baked beans while they are suppose to be running silent. Not only does he create an \\"explosion\\" of noise from eating that \\"magical fruit\\", but then the fragrance begins to permeate the sub and the reactions from the rest of the crew members is priceless!

It was truly a pleasure to hear them all laugh without reserve."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Wife Will Be Pleased","review":"Did you like Dumb and Dumber? (yeah me too). I usually like that kind of humor, and I really liked Down Periscope. The weird part was that my wife (who doesn't like goofy humor) likes this movie too.

You will not see this film on AMC so buy the DVD and you will not regret it! Rip torn is really funny in his few scenes and the crew, hand-picked to fail, have some characters that you will remember long after the movie is over. Every time I prepare a whole chicken for supper I can't help but laugh and say, \\"What's that on your shoulder?\\" \\"Ah, a parrot?\\" \\"Don't let it fly away, that tonight's supper.\\" Don't miss the ending credits when the Village People sing, \\"In the Navy\\" with the crew doing some crazy things!I watch it at least twice or three times a year and always laugh.

Why it took so long to get this to DVD one can only guess. Perhaps Paramount was trying to drop its inventory of VHS blanks; I know I've worn out a couple on this movie. Good family movie, almost reminiscent of old Disney slapstick humor and one liners. To bad the movie execs are not intuitive enough to make a sequel to this one.

That was the first and only time I have left before a movie concluded... I just could not continue with the film after all of the fart jokes, and the like. Worse still, the jokes were not even funny in my opinion (and yes, you can have funny base-humor). Maybe I am just too old to enjoy such low-level comedy and writing as was used in Down Periscope, but I think this has to be considered one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I apologize to all the other reviewers that enjoyed the film quite a bit... I guess it just wasn't for me.Possible alternatives in the same kind of comedy genre (but in my opinion much better) include Something About Mary, American Pie and Mystery Date.

Uh...no. It's pleasant and innocuous, but totally predictable (except when it overindulges in being ludicrous). Grammer doesn't have much to work with here; stilted dialogue and \\"action\\" scenes which lack action. This is all augmented by some painful and/or pointless mugging from the supporting players. Ouch.I actually enjoy a simpleminded comedy that makes me laugh - but this one simply didn't. Grammer is reasonably charming (albeit totally one dimensional), and Rob Schneider is predictably annoying. Virtually everyone else in the film is a cliche.I'mn clearly in the minority here, but have to say that this just isn't a very good or very funny film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stands the test of time","review":"I had never seen this movie in so many years until now and I must say liked it.

It makes \\"See Spot Run\\" seem like \\"Ulysses\\" in comparison, with roughly one sentence or phrase per page.Go figure why a publisher would issue such silliness!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book.","review":"This book is very interesting. It contains many ideas for adventure, excitement and romance in BED! It's a great love resource book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Educational","review":"I found this book exceptionally educational and inviting.

This purchase was well worth it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent classic in Continuum Mechanics","review":"I have read this book from cover to cover and have done all the exercises in it and cannot find a better book to recommend to other scientists wishing to learn continuum mechanics! I believe the book contains enough details, though one definitely has to complete the exercises after each chapter to get an understanding of how brilliant is the author's approach to the subject. It is a concise, yet at the same time a very complete introduction into the topics in Continuum mechanics. Every student studying mechanics should be proud to own this classic!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WORTHLESS","review":"This book could as well be sold in the 'cooking books' section. Does not delve deeply into the math and only provides clear-cut recipes. Does not inspire the reader to really think about the stuff. I would recommend this book to nobody."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bird Yelps!","review":"This CD has lovely music, but it also has \\"bird songs\\" which are loud, intrusive, quite annoying, and most un-lullaby-like.

Have to say, I am impressed & hope they make it out here for a show. Great record & highly reccommended for those who love the feel of old school rock with \\"southern\\" flavor. Tasty guitar work & strong songs through out -- no throwaways -- all good stuff. Last track in particular is an exceptional little tune."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not hard to be OFC When there is nearly no copper","review":"Well, not only is wire size #10, not #8. But it is not copper wire. It is copper plated aluminum wire. Suppose I should have checked that shipping weight first. 100' of 8ga copper should weigh ~5lbs on its own before the insulation and packing. But the 3.32lbs shipping weight on this should have steered me clear to some other brand.Will make a decent speaker wire. Probably not what you want to use for power though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as described - Be Careful","review":"Bottom line - after years of shopping Amazon, this is the single most-misleading item I've ever received. Folks - this is \\"STRANDED SPEAKER WIRE\\"!!!! It is \\"NOT\\" 8 GA GRND wire. THERE IS A DIFFERENCE. The product description is misleading. What I SHOULD HAVE REC'D (based on THEIR description) is SOLID CORE COPPER WIRE;, - - solid core copper wire is a TRUE \\"GROUND\\" wire, not stranded speaker wire. With postal fees and gas what they are, I ended up \\"selling\\" this to my nephew for 1/2 what I paid for it......and that's the only reason I didn't return it. I'll go to a Big Box Store now and get what I should have gotten in the first place. I'll never buy anything with the \\"Pyramid\\" name on it again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"High quality, looks good","review":"Very nice wiring for custom sound systems. Looks good, very pliable, thick insulation, good copper density. Only complaint is this wire is not 8 gauge. More like 10 or 11. But still worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Magdalen Laundries","review":"I did not care for this book too much, it was more about figures and dates, than about the running/living in the convents.

Even when it was new, it took forever to iron things. I just switched to Rowanta Effective Iron, and i can iron clothes in half the time I did with the sunbeam when it was brand new. But the last time I used the Sunbeam, I couldn't even iron one shirt, as it wouldn't glide over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Good Product","review":"I've never given much thought to my iron before; probably have only owned 5 or 6 in my life and all have worked about the same - until now!

Totally worthless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bigotry dressed up as scholarship","review":"Priest Miceli simply offers another rehash of the usual charges that unbelievers deify themselves, humanity, and their own perverted desires. In reality, it is Miceli who ends up claiming, without sufficient facts or reason, that he magically knows that his own Roman Catholic faith is the One Truth. I had hoped to find something more imaginative and more thought-provoking than this, but that's really all he's arguing. And so it ends up being nothing but an angry, delusional, and a rather pathetic attack on those who don't agree with the Vatican's doctrines and dogmas."},{"rating":"2","title":"I laughed until tears ran down my legs","review":"I actually had the privilege of reading the drafts of this book because Ken Weaver and I studied Russian together at the University of Arizona. He would bring drafts for us to read before class. Needless to say, he was a disruptive influence. I've recommended this book to someone at least once a year since I bought my first edition at the U of A bookstore in 1984. However, the other reviewers are correct; definitely not appropriate for all audiences."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best iPod radio out there","review":"We got this for my daughter. She loves it because it has Hello Kitty on it. But it drives me nuts for a few reasons: the display flickers constantly now (we've had it for about a year), and the radio stations drift (it'll be set to 99.1, say, and then, after a few hours or so, will be at 99.2 or 3). But it does sound decent, and is fairly easy to use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read","review":"I read another book, same title (The Way of a Ship), different author (Alan Villiers) now out of print, a long time ago, and enjoyed it immensely. This is in a similar vein, and it captures the romance of commerce under sail, as well as the extreme challenges faced by a very small handful of men. These monster machines were operated almost entirely by hand by shockingly under-strength crews living for months on end in intolerable conditions with grievous injury or death a constant threat by indifferent gales and malevolent seas. An amazing tale which attempts to answer the question, but leaves you still wondering, \\"How did they do it?\\" If you've ever looked wistfully at a tall ship and dreamed of the romantic adventure of going to sea, this excellent tale will cure you of that notion."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Way of A Ship","review":"This was not the book that we thought it was. Derek Lundy used the title of a much better book by Alan Villiers--printed in 1970. Lundy even cited the Villiers book but it was just a book written to ride the popularity of the Villiers book.

Anything that truly resonates is borrowed from Joseph Campbell's work. Read that...or read David Mamet's work on writing (Three Uses of A Knife and Bambi vs. Godzilla comes to mind). Aristotle's Poetica. Good story writing is difficult to do but easy to explain: make the audience/reader want to know what happens next.In giving examples to prove his points, he consistently re-imagines the themes/meanings and plots of widely known work so that it fits his \\"formula.\\" He doesn't even follow his own imaginary principles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gets you into the heart and mind of the story!","review":"This book is on another level all by itself. It goes much deeper than just explaining the how and why of story. You get a chance to see how life really works. And if you're fortunate enough, you will discover the steps to take you where you want to go in life. I own both the paperback and kindle editions. That's how important this book is to me. Once you read and understand this book, your story will take on a life of its own. Buy it! Read it! Love it! It is worth the investment!"},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty amazing stuff","review":"I discovered this album by accident, and it is SOOO GOOD! Its less punk, though still some punk, and much more high energy dub/reggae. The studio did them quite a bit of justice, I'm not a big fan of the peel sessions album. The singer is amazing, her voice is unique, raw, on target and all over, with a little Colin Hay magic vibrato time to time. Really well mixed with a really unique sound; alot of the songs are similar-ish but the sound is so good its still worth picking up. Reminiscent, I suppose of looser, earlier dub-y Clash. The instant hit song is really clever, elctronic sounding almost, except nothing's electronic, very cool multi-layered half spoken vox. The \\"Grapevine\\" cover is the punkiest itemon here, & more dynamic and open than most girl punk I've heard. I also loev Ping-Pong affair & FM...

I've seen the quality work all these people do and I feel this was not really the actors fault, but the lame writing. It is supposed to be a comedy and that did not come thru at all. It had a good premise, and could have been so much more.

All things magickal are discussed and black magic is delt with as being non productive. Black magic is blasphemous to the Thelemite. Necromancy is not considered black magic, but the satanic rituals of Anton LaVey are. A Thelemite can freely practice magic associated with the Druidistic/Wicca/Neo-pagan faiths freely as it does not harm others. This book certainly did shed any last sympathies I had with Anton LaVey and his intellectual and magical philosophies. I do not mean LaVey or his followers harm, this is something I grew out of with maturity in both the intellect and magickal theory. I would not want to hex anyone right now nor in the last, I don't know, maybe couple of years. Thelema is a self betterment philosophy, not a bitter philosophy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"This is a great instuctive book of magick.

In a post-September 11 world of domestic and global trauma, the text is a must-read for all of us, not just those who have experienced abuse. Understanding the long-term consequences of abuse not only for the victim but also for those around her is crucial to creating an environment of personal safety and growth. Realizing the benefits of witness can diminish the fear that blocks so many of us from getting involved both personally and politically in affairs that rock our faith in humanity. Trauma and Recovery is not just for those in the field of psychoanalysis and psychotherapy; it is for all of us who have been shaken by the tremors of trauma - and that is all of us. Judith Herman as witness to both trauma and recovery sets a fine example for the power of testimony to change lives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Informative","review":"This book touched on things about survivors of trauma that people do not talkAbout.

The author then provides key components to facilitate the healing of trauma. Again, this is a foundational work for anyone working with trauma.

With great direction by John Woo, and a great story that gives the movie a sense of heart, characters, and amazing action sequences. Primarily, Cage is especially good, not only in his transition from the villianous Castory Troy to dedicated cop Sean Archer, but his fifteen minute stint as Troy alone makes the movie worth watching. Aside from Cage's great acting and Woo's brillian direction, the script was especially good, pooring on more than just one level to the story, like most other action movies floating around. The story takes us immediatly into a tragedy, propels us through an amazing and heart pounding action sequence, then builds up story as Archer is trapped in a maximum security prison wearing the face of the man who killed his son! What a story that is for an action movie in today's society."},{"rating":"2","title":"hard-breaking action with an elegant topping of emotions","review":"In a tivoli the FBI-agent Sean Archer and his son are merely having a caroussel-ride. A shot is heard, and the bullet meant to be hitting Archer, hits his son instead. Now the hunt begins. Possessed only by the mission of getting the murderer and ice-cold psycho and terrorist Castor Troy. During the hunt Castor is hurt and falls into a coma. But not without letting Archer know, that a huge biochemical bomb has been placed in Downtown San Francisco. A bomb big enough to destroy the entire city. The clock's ticking, but nobody knows where. Sean Archer now gets a really advanced surgery. The doctors are changing his look to the one of the killer. We now follow Archer on the bonebreaking hunt between Troy's own men, in order to locate the bomb threatening San Francisco with a terrible armageddon.John Woo did again. He managed to direct an exellent motion-picture with two of the greatest actors ever - John Travolta and Nicolas Cage.I just love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"great movie","review":"short but sweet review- This movie had great acting, an interesting and somewhat original plot and great action scenes. Definately Woo's best American work."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this film","review":"This film is totally excellent! I may be a girl but I think the action and special effects are great! NICOLAS CAGE is good in anything but this is probably my favourite of his films. He plays a bad guy to start (Castor Troy) and then a good guy as Sean Archer trapped behind Castors face. JOHN TRAVOLTA is really convincing as the 'bad guy' (Castor in Sean's body). He should definately do more villain roles. This film isn't really for young kids, hence the rating, but behind the violence of a typical action movie there is a gr8, if extreme, storyline that definately deserves a look."},{"rating":"2","title":"Travolta rules!","review":"What a marvellous performance by Travolta! From being the good, moral Sean Archer to being the evil, villanous Castor Troy, no one could have done a better job than Travolta. Nicolas Cage is not bad, but he pales in comparion with the Travolta magic. John Woo's direction deserves to be praised, the action scenes are mind-blowing and the film oozes class, in spite of an incredulous storyline. Needless to say, one of the best action films ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horny Nicholas Cage","review":"This film had plenty of action but Nicholas Cage just had to ruin it by feeling a bunch of chicks.Not to say that I'm against people getting giggy on the screen but his nonstop horniness has ruined every film."},{"rating":"1","title":"People really enjoyed this film?","review":"Okay, yes it was kinda fun watching Nicolas go to town as the bad guy.

Just like The Rock and Armageddon this film looks like it's been put thru a shredder. It's hard to understand the action scenes. Also Nic Cage and Travolta seem to be hving too much fun in their roles to bother making them easy to watch. Instead they are embarressing and too funny. I know action films must have humor but when they have too much to match the tone of the film it just completely ruins it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too LOOOOOOOOONG","review":"This movie started off pretty good, I was ready to sit back and enjoy.

Cage and Travolta are geat, they really are. That was the only reason this film gets and extra *star* from me.~Sorry!~LOL~"},{"rating":"1","title":"Woo, Why ?","review":"It is rather hard to accept an action director who admits to basing his action sequences on Hollywood Musicals of some decades ago.The story is fine, and both Travolta and Cage give masterly performances. However, Woo has no concept of moderation or excess. In one gun battle, that apparently took a sum total of 3 months to complete, Woo seems to be so aware that it is excessive that he cuts the audio, and we hear what the child bystander is hearing.Even the Marine Boat chase turns into a disaster, when the Stand-ins cannot even keep their wigs on straight. Did Woo skip the dailies, or does he like a little farce?It is utterly incomprehensible how such a good story was messed up by Woo's visual hyperbole.This story might actually might have worked in the hands of a better director, or even if the edit could be done by someone with a sense of how an action movie can work.The Highlights are definitely around Cage and Travolta, since they did such great work, but ... Woo ... WHY ????"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just another opinion from Woo's fan of his old action epics","review":"I used to like this movie when it came out. I must've been about 14 when it saw it, and I found the acion scenes to be nice, some explosions and stunts were good, the story was entertaining, and the acting wasn't that bad!That was until I saw John Woo's classics \\"Hard Boiled\\" and \\"The Killer\\" years afterward. I mean, of course when Hollywood gets ahold of Woo after noticing his ground-breaking material, would they decide to make him (and themselves, more importantly) rich with repitition.Uggh, I'll stick with his Hong Kong classics before I step foot into this pile again."},{"rating":"1","title":"RIDICULOUs \\"ACTION\\" MOVIE","review":"This director John Woo is viewed as the \\"master of action movies\\".

This is one movie that will improve with censorship and scene cutting to fit in ad breaks on TV - and yes, that does mean it is a very bad movie. There were some things that were ok or interesting but these were few and far between. Television people, I recommend at least 3 ad breaks in long boat chase to maintain interest. A friend of mine hired this movie to watch with friends. At the end they all woke up, and I think that is a really fitting comment on how good this movie is. Lastly, I just have to bag that \\"singing in the rain\\" scene - one of the most truly awful, misguided attempts to create emotion I have ever seen in a movie.

The film stars Nicholas Cage as Castor Troy, a villain, and John Travolta as agent Sean Archer, the only man who can stop Castor from unleashing a nuclear device.Woo's trademarks are all present here: slow-mo gunfights, explosive action and those perennial doves.

Excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hot as Indian curry","review":"Pigeons flying as bullets scream forward,choirgirls getting pinched on the bottom, Cage cavorting in a trenchcoat, Travolta showing how to stab someone, the sheer incredible plot line which assumes that if you change a face everyone in the world will look the same , and then again pigeons flying about make this one helluva rollercoaster ride. John Woo made a hash of Mission Impossible II but here he is just too much....a Hong Kong film made Hollywood style.And what I liked most about the film was that the message of forgiveness and starting anew which is given at the end of the film..it manages to lift a cool slugfest to something quite special.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"I have just recently seen Face/Off on tv. I can't tell you how great I thought it was. Everything about the movie was unbelieveable and the action was awesome. John Woo is the best director there is.

While that's not really meant to be a problem, it just felt strange while watching the movie. There's drug trips in this movie, siblings kissing each other hard on the lips, and countless sexual references. Normally, I think disturbing films work best with drama like Saving Private Ryan and Amistad and horror such as Texas Chainsaw Massacre. It didn't work well in Face/off. The actors tried too hard to make Castor Troy look menacing. Neither John Travolta or Nicolas Cage failed, but it felt like they overacted. Besides that it was still a good movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Spectacular!","review":"Nicolas Cage and John Travolta were fantastic...no near brilliant...in Face/Off.

I found myself rooting for Cage throughout the rest of the movie however. Travolta was truly evil. It was delicious. You gotta see this movie.

John Travolta and Nicholas Cage team up in what could be the best acting jobs by both of them. Cage starts off in the beginning as the villain and Travolta the good guy. After their faces are switched, then they reverse roles. Before this movie was released I know some people had been skeptical towards Travolta playing a villain. We're all used to seeing him play good guy characters with morals (i.e. Phenomenon, Michael, etc.). I'm sure he put those ballots to rest because he did a tremendous job as the villian. Cage also did a good job the short time he played the villian and did an even better job as the hero. The plot is powerful throughout the whole movie and keeps you motivated to keep watching.

To watch Travolta and Cage strut their stuff as the pretend to be each other only deepens your admiration of them. They are extremely talanted and to anyone who may not think so, just watch this film. You will not be dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Action Movie","review":"Two of these actors Nic Cage and John Travolta really knock it out of the park on this film. For me I'd say Cage dominated in terms of really bringing over the fact of being trapped within another man's face and life, and being that of a person you hate it was quite the performance. One highlight is of the meeting in the prison of the two when all hell breaks loose for Cage's character when he realises his nemesis has the upper hand. Fun ride from beginning to end with the right injection of emotion. This is truly a blockbuster action movie by all merits."},{"rating":"2","title":"great movie","review":"The best part about this movie is you get to see both the actors as hero and villian. John and Nicholas acted so nicely, that the idea of whole face/off surgical theme didn't look silly or matter much. Two great actors at their best..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Put the face back on... actually never take it off","review":"This movie has a great premise. Take the face of your enemy and become him to destory him. But I promise you, if you have any intelligence what so ever you will realize that this the dumbest idea ever. At least whoever the hell wrote the movie, tried to make sense out of it, tried to make sense out of cutting your d*mn face off. But the whole thing could have been avoided if they had just beat the crap outta who they needed to get the info from. Nick Cage and John Travolta have no where near the same body. How'd they change that? Yeah, John lost weight but how'd Nick gain weight? You'd have to smoking rocks in order to believe they could pull this movie off, and then smoke more rocks to think that someone could be talked into having their face cut OFF. If you buy this movie, you should also buy some Enron stock and book your flight for Iraq for that mid-summer vacation. Trust me and keep your face on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost as bad as The Jackal!","review":"The Jackal with Gere and Willis was the worst picture I have ever seen. If you liked The Jackal you will like Face/Off. Lots of action, dumb dialog, stupid plot...just plain boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"You got to be kidding me!","review":"This is easily the worst movie either Travolta or Cage has ever made. It is action without realism, shooting for the sake of shooting (with very little hitting), the camera work and action scenes are ripped off from other movies, and the plot line is totally stupid. I can't stress enough what a smelly peice of hollywood big money trash this is!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Reeks like a Bum","review":"This movie is predictable and terrible. ...Mindless shootings and explosions.. Wish i could give it zero."},{"rating":"1","title":"The dumbest plot I've ever seen!","review":"\\"Face/Off\\" was so stupid that I didn't even care what happened to the characters.....if one killed the other that would've been good but if they both committed suicide then that would've been MUCH BETTER......When in society do you take the risk of being someone \\"else\\" in order to catch a killer.......the guy was in prison but he wanted to \\"trade places\\" what a stupid plot! This was surely a waste of my money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT TITO","review":"My favorite scene in this whole very bad movie was when all of John Travoltas cop buddies were killed and all he says is \\"Not Tito?\\" Who was Tito anyway? If for some strange reason that make a Face Off 2, I do beleive they should call it \\"Not Tito 2\\".The other big thing that annoyed me about this film, was how John Travoltas family touched each others faces. At first I would imagine it would be sweet, but after a while I would just have to say \\"Stop Touching my face\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"who are these people that give films like this five stars?","review":"I read some of these reviewers and I wonder if they are making my food at restuarants, if they are saving lives in the ER or are the ones who run right out to buy some fools CD from American Idol, or talk in superlatives about the new Snoop Dog video that was on MTV. Do they sell tires in Spokane or crawdaddies in Batan Rouge?Face off is truly an atrocious film, from start to finish. Cage and Travolta have no on screen chemistry and it is so shallow, so utterly beneath me to even want to describe the assanine plot and utter paltry dialouge.For years I have thought this, and will continue to until I leave this medium, but Face Off is unequivically one of the worst films ever made. Pure trash."},{"rating":"2","title":"a good solid action film","review":"John Woo does a good job of Directing this film.Nicolas Cage does a good job without over acting like he sometimes does.as for Travolta this is his best comeback film.the other ones he just walked thru.he actually acts in this one.him&cage have good chemistry thru out.very interesting film."},{"rating":"2","title":"ITS ALLREADY ON BLU RAY","review":"I dont know why these people are crying but the movie is out on BLU RAY now.

This is one of the best action movies ever!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Refreshing","review":"The ridiculously over-the-top storyline was a joy to watch, not to mention one of the best directorial performances I have ever seen. The way Jon Woo sees scenes is totally different to anything I've seen before, and really refreshing. Can't finish without mentioning the great acting performances by Cage and Travolta, who slip into each other's characters masterfully and with style."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Hollywood action movie ever","review":"This is the most novel premise for an action movie I've ever seen. Admittedly it may lack something in plausibilty, and a lot of people have vocally complained about this, but I don't really see the problem. This is a great movie, full of inspired acting, brilliant scripting and, more importantly, action. Lots and lots of action. The amount and quality of action only Hong Kong director John Woo could manage. The magnificently choreographed gunfights and artistic use of slow motion make for some of the greatest scenes I've ever seen. Probably the only weak link in the movie is that Nicholas Cage is a much more compelling villain than John Travolta, so it kind of stings to have Castor Troy build up so much momentum that then gets lost once he starts wearing Sean Archer's face. Still, don't be fooled by all the philistines out there. See this movie, you won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome and truly creepy at the same time.","review":"Action packed and full of moments that will shock you and possibly gross you out. Nicholas Cage was eerily effective as both the insane, evil criminal and the disheartened family man. John Travolta was truly creepy in the role of the bad guy. I could barely watch him as he tricked the good cop's family into welcoming him in and basically made the world turn upside down. Was the plot a little predictable? Sure. Was it a great movie anyway? Definately! Add this one to your action collection even if you aren't a fan of Travolta or Cage. You won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"WORDS COULDN'T SAY HOW GREAT THIS MOVIE IS","review":"THIS WAS MY FAVORITE MOVIE EVER!

Travolta and Nicolas Cage","review":"This movie is one of my favorite action movies of all time. I highly recommend this to anyone who is a Nicolas Cage or John Travolta fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Twisting. Suspenseful. Fast-Paced. Ironic..","review":"This film is a staging opportunity to showcase two actors in a marquis moment: John Travolata and Nicolas Cage.The story line is absurd and the plot is thin but the magic here lies in the byplay of these two outstanding actors. Like melody and countermelody these two rise and fall, intertwine with each other, balance and finally combat one another in a climactic death song.Ego and alterego find their full expression in the plots to kill each other, good and evil wrestle together and the future hangs in the balance as these two titans square off. Cage and Travolta appear to really enjoy playing off one another (and admit as much in later interviews) and it shows. Method acting finds its zenith in these two roles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Action Flick!","review":"Sit down for the first 20 minutes and you'll be hooked into one of the greatest opening scenes packed with action of any movie. Fans of Travolta and Cage have a combined treat in this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"no cliche action","review":"who needs off the rictor scale fiery modern special effects or super heroes to enjoy a superb action flick? This film is timeless even though it reminds you of a certain time period so well especially with Nicholas Cage's outfits."},{"rating":"1","title":"30 seconds of material stretched into 2.5 hours of violence","review":"This movie was intended for the same audience that can play \\"Doom\\" and \\"Mortal Kombat\\" for hours at a time without noticing (or caring) that their brains have turned to jelly. Yes, there is a plot, but it's not unnecessarily complicated, and it doesn't need to be believable. For reasons that don't really matter, an FBI agent and the terrorist who killed his son exchange faces, so that each must pose as the other. The real point is to shoot anything that moves and blow up anything that doesn't. It's not possible to keep track of the number extras who die along the way. And it's amazing how consistently the bullets, bombs, grenades, and shrapnel succeed at hitting everyone in sight with the exception of the two main characters (although they do occasionally manage to wound each other)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great transfers on Video and Audio, few extras.","review":"This is more like 3 1/2 stars due to lack of extras, but the film itself is worth 4 stars. The best sound is the 5.1 Surround, making this loud and exciting movie come to life on the small screen. The Theatrical Trailer is the biggest extra on this DVD, and sadly it nearly ruins a great movie. One of John Woo's best movies too, if not his best movie. Still worth the money to buy the widescreen version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent action movie","review":"Firstly this film has got John Travolta and Nicholas Cage who are really good actors and are perfect for this kind of movie. There are so many surprises and really good gun fights. There is a pretty good script too. I love the part where Nicholas Cage sais 'Well if you're Shawn Arthur ,I guess i'm Caster Troy\`and then hangs up. Anyway cool movie deffinetly worth seeing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super action flick","review":"Will be a classic good guy/bad guy flick. Great action by great, professional actors with great supporting cast. One of my all-time favorite Nicholas Cage movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE DOGS B*****X!!!!!","review":"One of the years most action packed films, anybody with a home cinema kit this is a must and an exceptional film to own if you have a laserdisc or dvd player. My speakers had a really good work out as there are some excellent fighting scenes and the special effects are just phonomenal. The story line is good but a little far fetched in places, If you liked con air and the rock then this film is defintely for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST ACTION FLICK EVER!","review":"I loved this movie! it has everything you could ever want in an action film: guns, explosions, etc. Travolta and Cage are great all the way through!

Obviously, many of the dessert recipes, if not almost all of them, call for Betty Crocker mixes many of which are no longer available! Apparently, they just reprinted this book without taking the time to update the recipes. As a result, there are going to be a ton of recipes you can't make.

This is not a good option when searching for gift giving ideas. The product seems very impressive. However, the current distribution method via internet download only, at first may seem to be convenient actually diminishes convenience when it is not available for potential customers wishing to purchase through traditional retail outlets (including internet purchase).

Though the playing is not perfect, technically, as the Halle orchestra was not yet accustomed to Barbirolli's perfectionism, as is apparent in the Mahler 5th Symphony, Mahler 7th Symphony, or Bruckners 9th, it is still very high.But unsurpassable is the feeling and excitement that Barbirolli manages to evoke out of this score (and all Mahler scores, for that matter). He is definitely a one of a kind conductor, whose legacy has not been recognized, both during and after his life-time. Had he come in contact with New York, not right after Toscanini left the orchestra, maybe we would have had even more of possibilities of remembering him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't do it.

For some reason there was an academic conflict but he then proved himself outside the academy and made a name for himself directly in concert and opera houses. After his controversial competition in Wales, gave birth to a brilliant and exciting Tenor sensation in the 21st century. This recording is a must for all Tenor lovers! He displays rich and warm tonal colors that touches the essence of human emotion, and covers different stylistic demands in today's repertoire. The orchestra and chorus are indeed splendid and a joy to hear. You'll never get tired listening to this recording. The best Mario Lanza ever, with a powerful upper register. Knowing Tito, I sometimes wonder where the voice is coming from. Du e skitbra, Tito!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Need an equalizer","review":"There's no doubt that Tito Beltran has a great voice and this CD shows off his talent over a wide variety of songs. However, there seems to be a problem with the settings between his voice and the orchestra in the mix-down of the recording. On some of the tracks, the music seems to be too loud that makes him sound like singing from the back of the orchestra. The somewhat strange mixer setting also makes his high notes sound struggling and tight besides causing some tracks sound like overdubbed. I have tried playing this CD on audiophile hi-fi systems as well as cheap portables and the results are the same. The situation is especially bad in Mi Corazon Continuara (My Heart Will Go On). This can, however, be corrected using an equalizer to enhance the mid-range frequencies (especially the 1000Hz - 2500Hz range) of the audio spectrum. Doing so also brings his voice back to the front where the singer should be standing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shiny and nice design, but expensive","review":"This item is very nice looking---although it was more shiny and less substantial than I would have imagined for the price (even the $50 I paid).

Just what we all want to see (not). I haven't even been looking forward to it coming each month.

When the first issue arrived...I thought it was a promo for a up-coming issue. I was not sure which was a write-up and which was an ad. Seemed much lighter...maybe paper being used is lighter.Anyway, I realize that Southern Living, just like all of us, has to cut back. In this economy, I had rather put up with some semblance of Southern Living than none at all.

I have been a subscriber for over 30 years. What they have done to this magazine is a travesty. The things that made Southern Living special (and why so many of us saved old issues) are all gone. The articles are interchangable with the articles in any of a dozen other magazines.

Every Southern woman has to have it. It took a dip in quality in the past five years, but with a new editor the content is becoming more abundant. I look forward to it each month!

I even tried to renew one year asking SL to match the price that Amazon was offering, but they wouldn't do it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Southern Living I remember","review":"The quality of the Magazine has diminished compared to what it used to be. My Mother was a long time subscriber of this magazine and I used to love it too. The paper and binding were heavier and used staples to bind in the past. I used to archive and collect the older SL mags, But I see no reason to do that any longer. The magazine seems to have more ads, less quality Southern content than it used to have. I cannot recommend this magazine any longer at this price. I have reverted to Garden and Gun Magazine for quality Southern material with archival quality.Most of the photos and covers they show on Amazon item page looks to be from the OLD magazine setup look & feel. Seems they are riding on the old quality while delivering the new lesser quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great resource","review":"A great resource for folks who are young marrieds, young families or anyone who is new to the South.

I love this magazine. There are so many old issues that I can't bear to part with that I now have boxes for them. Something else I can say about this magazine - you can pick up an old issue and most of it will still be up to date as far as great recipes, entertaining tips, gardening,crafts and places to travel to,unless a hurricane has blown it away.

I stumbled upon this book. After looking through it, I found that it has a great variety of subjects. It's very colorful. I had ordered other curriculum when I ordered this one, not knowing what would work best and have decided to use something else (Language Fundmentals) to drive home the various grammar skills. This book is definitely a bargain given the low price and what all it covers. I can see using this book as a supplement or stand-alone, as home-school curriculum and/or as a great tool for keeping skills sharp during the summer months (which I am considering). It's a great all-in-one resource."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great WorkBook to Refresh and Beyond","review":"Took about a week to get to us, but the Comprehensive Curriculum book is in very good shape and as far as content goes, we could not be happier.

This album marks a major departure from squire's stone roses and seahorses work, so some may be dissapointed from the get go, but on it's own time changes everything holds up rather well. Squire has evolved just like any other songwriter, it's just that steps of his evolution havn't been caught on tape. Had the stone roses released an album or two in the years between their two cd's, the second coming might have been seen for what it was, and not what it wasn't, much as this album should be."},{"rating":"1","title":"He's lost it","review":"Once again I held up my hopes for John Squire's new material. and once again I've been let down. This album is only slightly better than The Seahorses album. I have only listened to this twice but don't feel any urge to go back to it again.The songs are nice and the arrangements are nice. The playing of Mr.Squire is as good as you'd expect. But there's nothing here to separate it from any other Brit-Poppy type bands."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid as stone","review":"First off, I'm a long time Stone Roses/Seahorses/Ian Brown fan, and picked up this album based almost entirely on the basis of expanding my collection of Roses-related work.This CD is a big departure from John Squire's previous works, and expresses a much mellower sound.As everyone notes, Squire's voice sounds aged and uneven, however even on the first listen I personally didn't have any problem with it. It suits the music on this album well.The only real issue I have with this CD is the lack of memorable stand-out tracks, with the notable exceptions of \\"I miss you\\", \\"All I really want\\", and \\"Sophia\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rechargeable - great, crank power - a disappointment","review":"I think its a nice little lantern - compact, good radio and the light is decent. I bought one after a power outage at the beginning of this year and I've been using it on a daily basis since it arrived. I love my garrity crank flashlight but I am disappointed in the lantern. The lantern runs a long time off a charge but takes a lot of cranking to keep even a dim light once the battery runs down. Then the little knob broke off the crank so now its just a rechargeable. I think it can be fixed but haven't followed up on that yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very practical","review":"In terms of practical use in blackout/emergency conditions, this lantern didn't work well for me. Although the radio is very good sound quality, the lantern isn't very bright to light a room in a blackout, and also only lasts for 6 minutes on a 1 minute crank. Since we were out of power all night, it got really tiring to crank every 5 minutes."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best collection I ever have","review":"I've bought quite a number of Barry's CDs, including \\"The Manilow Collection - Classic Hits\\", \\"Even Now (Remastered)\\", \\"Trying to get the feeling (Remastered)\\", \\"One Voice (Remastered)\\", etc. \\"The Songs 1975-1990\\" is the best I ever have so far.

It is rigourously researched and extremely well written. The author, a proven journalist, has no axe to grind. Now, 35 years on, the story as he relates it stands up well, based as it is on hundreds of exhaustive interviews with the key people involved and on the Veliotis tapes. A captivating and balanced history of a key part of the so-called Cold War, as well as a documentary of corporate personalities and tactics at the highest levels, together with straightforward and unembelished accounts of how men (no women other than secretaries and wives!) at the top levels of government and the private sector interacted in the panic-stricken rush to catch up with the USSR in the development of nuclear submarine technology."},{"rating":"2","title":"Values from the past","review":"This study guide will present your students with a Biblical approach to the story, Door in the Wall.

The fanfare was misplaced: this is an audience-quality bootleg recording, put out on an official CD so Arthur Lee would gain some benefit. Reviewers have commented on what a sympathetic backing bacd Shack are on this recording. Not that you can tell from listening - the poor sound quality tramples on any subtelty and renders it impossible towork out why this is such a legendary gig. If there is a recent Arthur Lee gig that deserves to be released on CD, it would be the one he played at the Garage in London in June 1994, when the High Llamas played as Love. The Llamas brought along flute, harpsichord, brass and strings to add the essential light and shade which Shack - a basic four-piece guitar band - cannot. I believe Arthur Lee said the Llamas were the best Love since, well, Love. And Sean O'Hagan said it was the best gig thet High Llamas have ever played."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite an insult to a great talent!","review":"I appreciate that the amount of Arthur Lee material available is small (a fact that will hopefully be reversed now Arthur is free and, thankfully, back in the recording studio) but this release is frankly an insult.

This disc documents the 1992 Liverpool show he did with the 4 piece band \\"Shack\\"led by the brothers Michael and John Head. The material covered is mostly \\"classic\\" era Love from the bands' Electra Records period, however they also delve into some of Lee's more recent and obscure tunes like the excellent \\"Somebody's Watchin' You\\" from his last full album studio effort recorded in '92 for the small French label New Rose (now out of print).

With a phychedelic mixture of music.","review":"The \\"Austin Powers: The Spy who shagged me\\" Soundtrack is a mix of heartful fun that will seriously have you smiling every time you listen to it. The start is the strongest. With Madonna creating a 60's inspired song \\"Beautiful Stranger\\" that will have you hopping up and down singing \\"Dahdah-dah-dahdah-dah-dah-dahdah-dah\\" THis is by far the best song. REM hands a remake of I feel fine and Lenny Kravits has his American woman full of life and agression."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yeah, baby, YEAH!","review":"I absolutely loved this CD. All the songs but one are great. Lenny Kravitz does a kickin' version of that tired old song American Woman. Thank you, Lenny. I could listen to REM's version of \\"Draggin' the Line\\" over and over (and over...) it's so good. The only noticable flaw in an otherwise sparkling album, is some guys who call themselves \\"Big Blue Missile\\". Scott Weiland should know better. Did these guys even listen to the original before recording the dog's breakfast they call \\"Time of the Season\\"? I think they could have used another couple of weeks practice.

I love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a surprise!!","review":"When I bought this CD, I was looking for only a few songs. The more I listen to it the more I like almost every song. I recommend buying this CD because of the great songs it has. From REM to Lenny Kravitz to Green Day and even Dr. Evil himself, this album is a must for any Austin Powers fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heard Madonna's on the radio--totally retro and rockin'","review":"I heard Madonna's Beautiful Stranger on the radio yesterday. She has done it again!!! Keeping the theme of Austin Powers, she has written a very retro and rockin' theme song for the movie. Sure to go #1!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"madonna song","review":"the madonna song is on uk radio at the moment and is amazing!! very her, very 60's but with a great 90's cross over club beat! im buying the album just for this track!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as uninspired as the movie . . .","review":". . . but darn close. What a letdown, especially when compared to the first Austin Powers soundtrack. The pluses: Madonna's \\"Beautiful Stranger,\\" REM's \\"Draggin' the Line.\\" The minuses: Scott Weiland's godawful butchering of \\"Time of the Season,\\" Lenny Kravitz's lackluster \\"American Woman,\\" and Mel G's completely out-of-place hip-hop number \\"Word Up\\" (isn't this supposed to be a SIXTIES-inspired album?). Dr. Evil's \\"Just the Two of Us\\" is very funny in the movie, but pretty blah on disc.The album is also pretty skimpy at under 45 minutes. Why were so many songs in the movie left off the soundtrack (e.g., the \\"Goldfinger\\"-inspired \\"Dr. Evil\\" theme)?Shame on all involved."},{"rating":"1","title":"Side one is good","review":"If you are short on money, do not buy this C.D. You will regret it. However if you are trying to get rid of a gift voucher or something side one is really good, especially the Dr. Evil \\"just the two of us\\". Really this is not a good album, as side two is rubbish. I still haven't listened to it all the way through"},{"rating":"1","title":"The movie is a lot better than the soundtrack, baby.","review":"Keeping it short, Madonna's song was as good as it got on the soundtrack. The low being a lifeless and just plain terrible rendition of \\"American Woman\\". Let's just hope Lenny Kravitz doesn't ruin any more classics.The rest of the tracks are fair, but it's not good enough for me to recommend purchasing. If anything, buy the \\"Beautiful Stranger\\" single."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD BAD BAD!","review":"What a god-awful soundtrack! Folks who loved the International Man of Mystery CD will especially be dissapointed. Would it really have killed them to do the real songs instead of half-baked remakes by REM, Lenny Kravitz and others? Such songs as Draggin the Line and Time of the Season have never sounded worse--Time of the Season sounds like a machine. Even Soul Bossa Nova, Austin's theme, gets spectacularly garbled. And FYI--After you hear it once, DrEvil's rap is no longer funny. Save yourself the dough and buy the single of Beautiful Stranger, the one good song."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great! Love \\"WORD UP\\"","review":"This CD is terrific! The love the CD from top to bottom. My favorite song is \\"Word Up\\" by Mel G. This shows she has diversity and is spicing it up on the track. I also love Madonna's \\"Beautiful Stranger\\", this shows that she is here to stay. Just buy it and you'll really like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"American Women is GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This album is an all around album.It has Modonna, Lenny Kravitz, Dr. Evil, etc. This album has a little of everything, as you can see from the artists I listed above."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a waste of time. glad i only rented it.","review":"come on payne. 2 time us open champion getting involved with this kind of junk. nice thought, but terrible follow through. ok mabye its a good video for the worst golfers but since when have the worst golfers ever cared about etiquette, thats what makes them the worst. bad format, horrible humor. this is truely for the inexperienced only."},{"rating":"1","title":"Payne should have taken a muligan on this one","review":"This is probably the worst thing I have ever watched.

Nearly everything is so common sense that even my wife, a non-golfer, thought his information to be pointless.

Referred to as a drawing alphabet, viewers are introduced to the basic shapes (squiggles, dots, and lines) surrounding us, waiting for us to see them and create with them. If the video had just a little less music aimed at very small children I'd recommend it to adults interested in drawing more impactful images on whiteboards during meetings. At every age we benefit from being able to make a doodle and grow an idea out of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"not all that","review":"I'm mystified by the positive reviews here. I borrowed this at the library, and I'm glad I am glad I didn't pay $10 for it. The fact that it was 1980s and bad child acting with bad music did not really bother my child, because he does not watch any TV so any video is a treat, but 80% of the video is introduction and fluff and the substance (the alphabet of drawing) when they finally get to it, is rushed. It would have been better to develop the alphabet over a few lessons with lots of examples, but that might have taken more than 20 minutes. Clearly the video was made back when video production was still expensive and they obviously had a very tight budget. Doubtless there are hours of better instruction online now, some appropriate for kids, and I aim to find some of it. Bottom line: library item as long as you don't have high expectations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gott has Got IT","review":"Wife really enjoyed book now if she can or will only follow it the money will be more than worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth the money","review":"common sense stuff, pharacuetical approach, anything of note is available on the internet. quite a few times he negates the use of herbs and any sort of alternative healing for lack of controlled studies with proof positive. yet, he accepts antidotal evidence for the efficacy of vicks vapor rub to cure toe fungus and a bar of soap to prevent leg pain/cramps at night. go figure!a book i do recommend on personal health care at any age is Linda Page's Healthy Healing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great starter guitar!","review":"A great starter guitar if you're just learning (like I am).

Too bad: This is not worth watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad But Watchable","review":"\\"American Warships\\" is a direct attempt to capitalize on the release ofBattleship (Two-Disc Combo Pack: Blu-ray + DVD + Digital Copy + UltraViolet), but falls very short in most regards.No plot spoilers from me; the movie follows the crew of USS Iowa (Captained by Mario Van Peebles) as it heads to be decommissioned, but strange events and unprovoked attacks by a powerful enemy interrupt the retirement plans. This is slightly better acted than most Asylum films, but the special effects were weak all the way through and the editing was often disjointed, with distracting continuity errors all the way through.This is a low budget Sci-Fi that I will not likely seek out to watch again.CFH"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time or money","review":"A poor story and acting.

The aliens didnt look that great, those big 16\\" gun turrets turn way too fast. You will also noticed there some reruns on those 5\\" guns at closeup, and of course it was computer graphics. I wouldnt pay much for this video, glad i spend 3.99 to watch it instead of buying the dvd for twelve bucks.Now i dont know if they copy from Battleship 2012, or they did. Battleship 2012 was pretty darn good movie and worth 19.99 on dvd if you want it.

With round portholes on the bridge and quad 40mms in their tubs this movie uses a WWII battleship like the North Carolina or Alabama as a stand-in for the IOWA. EMBARRASSING! Cheap CG completes this disaster of an excuse for a movie. Can I give it ZERO stars?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun for old Navy buffs","review":"Not the best made Sci Fi movie ever, but fun, and all action. Just something to throw into the DVD player and spend some time with. Went well with a big bowl of popcorn and memories of being at sea. The shots of the Iowa class Battleship were great. Post Scrip information I did not know about so watch to the end. So buy it if you are an old battleship sailor or know one, or you just want to see one of the old girls in action."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another miserable Asylum production","review":"It amazes me that The Asylum still puts out the bad movies they do. You would think that by now, they would at least TRY once or twice a year. If you're gonna make a knock off of a big budget movie, maybe you get a real FX team once in a while. This time out they decided to rip off Battleship and not only is THIS movie bad from start to finish, it's rather insulting to anyone who ever served on the USS Iowa! The aliens in this were ridiculous as were their attempt at FX --- and Mario Van Peeples was totally wasted in it. The rest of the cast though, were attrocious! Thank goodness I saw this for free on Syfy Channel, because even renting this turkey would be a waste of good money! As for everyone saying this was better than Battleship, perhaps they need to go see Battleship again. Whereas Battleship was action packed and IMO quite entertaining, American Warships was just terrible!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Art creates a friendship for a pig and an angel.","review":"This is a wonderful story with sensational illustrations that should be excellent preparation for a first visit to an art museum. The story is simple, and without introducing too many ideas, keeps children totally engaged with the characters. George Hallensleben's pictures are a compelling way to help children see a new visual world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Isabelle has issues!","review":"This story is just plain weird. This book reads as if it were written in a foreign language then translated into two or three other languages before finally being translated into English. It just makes no sense.

The bit about the \\"lovely statue\\" seems almost creepy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gem of a story","review":"This book is an absolute treasure.

I wanted the entire story to keep the silliness of the pig eating pink cake and strawberry jam, but the story got flighty. I find myself making up more story when reading it to my daughter so that it has a point. Okay for the very young who will appreciate the pictures. For a child older than three, I would think there's not enough story there."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst canes I've owned","review":"I bought this cane to replace a white NFB telescoping cane in the hopes that it would be far more durable. I'm disappointed in how quickly this cane is wearing down in just a few months. The elastic cord is already starting to fray, and the joints stick easily.

Little did I know that she would get her beak caught in the little loop that the hook to hang it is attached to, break her bottom beak off, and have to go to the vet every 2 weeks for 3 months to try and repair it, which didn't work by the way. Her beak will now never grow back thanks to the amount of space inside that little loop, and she can only eat on one side of her mouth. If it was plied shut more or smaller, she never would have gotten it caught. So thanks to this toy that I got for cheaper than it is now, I now have a deformed cockatiel who will never be normal again.If you do still get it, please be sure to ply the loop yourself so there is no space in between just to be safe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inexpensive solution for a swing","review":"This is an inexpensive and good sized swing for any small to medium sized bird (love bird to African Grey).

This can be solved with the use of other types of hangars though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!!!","review":"I don't know, I just found this book to be incredibly dull, and the ending weak.

This show was campy, mean, funny, and original. Yes, it started like a normal teen drama, but after a while you could see that the writers, and the cast just wanted to have more fun with everything. It also helps that most of the actors in the series do a steller job with their characters, and really try, and succed, at making the show something more than just a chessy WB dramedy.The set is very well done, with all twenty two episodes on six discs. The video and audio quality are great. Extra wise things are a bit scarce, but there are a few episode commentaries with the creators.The series is well worth the money. I can see this being a cult favorite for years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not what i expected","review":"when i first viewed this item on amazon, i really thought it was gonna be cheesy and kinda lame. however i was still interested in buying it so i found at borders and bought it. its taken me several days to finish it but i just finished the last episode and i really must say that i really liked it. it may not be the best show in the world but its great for entertainment and the characters can be loveable.my favorites are nicole and mary cheery but i aslo liked brooke. carmen at the beginning was a bit of a good character but she started to get on my nerves. the ending however was very shocking when she (do not read this part if you have never seen it and dont want to ruin it) says shes pregnant! is she pregnant from josh? oh wow if so thats gonna be really bad since brooke and josh just got together.anyway i think overall its a good show and i liked it a lot and i have to say that caged is the best episode."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting, enjoyable, and quite addicting.","review":"I purchased this show for my wife as it was on her Christmas list. After watching the first three shows with her, I was hooked.More of a \\"parody\\" of the usual teen drama, the show stands out in my mind from the usual shows in TV. It pokes enough fun that you don't take it too seriously, while at the same time still sticking with it's roots.The show takes an obvious turn for the \\"zany\\" during the season, which I think is for the best.If you are thinking about buying this, give it a shot! It's pretty hilarious."},{"rating":"2","title":"A solid, campy GREAT show!","review":"This series is great. I never saw it when it was on TV, but I was introduced to it by my roomie.This show rocks. I love it. It really outlines all of the aspects of highschool, with a certain, campy feel. Costumes and stuff, people living in their imaginations.It has the typical set up, the popular girls, and the unpopular group (though in my eyes, both groups are popular). How the groups constantly have conflict, and the girls who hate each other the most...well...their parents fall in love and they all move in together.Great show, great acting and great laughs! Highly reccommended!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"OMG is all I can say","review":"I've been waiting for this day since I heard the show was getting canceled.

I was expecting something unique, like Freaks and Geeks. The writing for Popular is very stereotypical. Everyone is a caricature. The actors are annoying, with their constant over emoting. Their facial contortions are distracting. This show would best be enjoyed by preteens and immature teenagers. If you are looking for something witty and smart, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Popular","review":"I loved this show when it was on tv back in 1999/2000.It's been fun watching the episodes. I love Mary Cherry, such a funny character!The one thing I don't like is just to do with the packaging. The plastic case that holds the dvd's doesn't hold the dvd's in properly, so when you open it, it looks like there is a dvd missing, but in fact one has fallen into the other slot.Overall I enjoyed and still enjoy this show and it's social commentary.

Seriously!","review":"Popular - The Complete First Season has to be the second best show that the WB produced (Felicity being the first!) Created by Ryan Murphy who later went on to create Nip/Tuck.

She meets Sam, who will become her mortal enemy, the twist is she has no other choice but to get along with her, Brooke's father is now dating Sam's mother.

In fact, it is almost as if two different people wrote different parts of this book. I found the Martin/Rachel storyline to be fairly decent reading.Unlike the master reviewer, I didn't have any trouble understanding the quote he provided. However, there was plenty else I didn't understand, and more importantly didn't care, about.I also question why the author waited until around 120 pages into the book to explain the Eschaton to us clearly.Overall, I'd skip this book. It was my first for Charles Stross and I don't think I will give him another try.-Tom"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool book, good Space Opera Stuff","review":"I liked this book - it's sort of space opera crossed with cyberpunk. There's nothing really NEW in this but it's a well written spin on what might happen if you crossed EESmith with Bruce Sterling.You've got things like nanotech, giant spacecraft, people reduced to slow-moving digital images and then \\"rehydrated\\" to become themselves again, anything you want in exchange for a story, a spaceship in a box, and not one but TWO sets of people trying competing to set up humanity for the eventual arrival of their god at some unknown point in the future. There's just tons of interesting concepts all thrown together in a wonderful goulash of a book.I'd recommend this and it's sequel, Iron Sunrise, which is not quite as much fun but still a really good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth picking up","review":"Maybe not the novel of the year, but well worth picking up for an enjoyable, fun read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stross strikes out...again","review":"Charles Stross. One of the main authors in the hard sci-fi genre. Felt it I should check him out. Unfortunately, unlike Alastair Reynolds or Iain Banks, Stross seems to utterly lack the ability to make you care about the people in his books. Read about half-way through and just realized \\"I don't care how this ends...\\" and put it down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some authors should stick with short stories...","review":"While his wordplay, setting and concepts are (as usual) nothing short of breath-taking his characters and plot developement are nothing short of yawn inducing.Stross joins the quickly swelling ranks of hard sci-fi authors whose brilliant short stories seem to hint at limitless potential and yet when they step out of the briefer medium immediatly stumble in novel form and eventually fall flat on their face(s).Stross's future bending content and stunning technopoetry-prose shimmer with a level of craftsmenship severly lacking in his novel's characters and plot growth. And until Stross devotes the that same stylized proficency to his basic story elements he should avoid novels and stick with a format where such absences can be overlooked- shorts.Stross has all all of the style and none of the content required to weave the epic stories he's trying to pen."},{"rating":"1","title":"This got a Hugo nomination?","review":"Sorry to say it but please add my name to the list of readers who found this book boring,poorly written and wildly overrated. I give it two stars instead of one because a few of the ideas in it werent too terrible and because it showed enough promise that I might possibly pick up a Stross book again. In paperback. I've enjoyed some of his short stories so hopefully he'll finda way to make his longer fiction work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read","review":"This is a great story on a grand scale.

The basis of the story that a super human AI has molded human existence is appropriate to our times since we are heading for the day when such machine intelligence might be built. If you like big stories you will probably like this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the point?","review":"Stross writes with confidence and in fine style, but I was still left feeling empty. The problem with writing about technological singularity is that it's like trying to describe the Internet to an ant. Too far outside the frame of reference of even the author.I enjoy novels where I feel something for the characters, whether it be affection, love or even loathing.

As such, I've been looking forward to reading Singularity Sky.This is a first novel and much be judged accordingly. It does have its rough edges. Like many hard SF authors, Stross has a love of technical jargon that does, sometimes, get in the way of the story. I must also note that I found the ending to be less than satisfactory and something of a cheat given the events of the story.That said, the book is brimming with fresh ideas. Stross appears to be one of the few authors who takes the notion of a Vingean Singularity seriously and that comes through in this story to its benefit. He's also better at characterization than most hard SF authors manage (which isn't to say that it couldn't stand some improvement).It is a book filled with ideas and brimming with a sense of wonder. I don't doubt that as he hones his skills, he will be an author to reckon with."},{"rating":"1","title":"overload","review":"Simply put, I had serious problems with this book. Firstly, the characters seemed one dimensional and lacking defining characteristics that make them individuals. Stross' main flaw, however, is the amount of information that that he feels is pertinent for the reader to understand. I am an avid science fiction fan but instead of reading every word about an interesting piece of equipment or a weird mutation on Rochald's World I consciously skipped over the lengthy sentences that spew quite incoherently, trails of techno-babble. The story does have some strength in its ideas. For example, the festival's interaction with societies is extremely interesting and a little more focus would have greatly improved the novel.2/5 execution, 1/5 focus, 5/5 ideas = 2/5 overall"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sudoku-Play at Joe's","review":"the games cannot be identified so that you can save them and do later.

It's an amazing subject for a story, the characters are so human and ALIVE...this book will really make you change the way you see people. The best part of the story so far for me has been the transition chapter between Book 1 and 2. William K's character - Valentino's childhood friend and notorious (but harmless) liar - what is he a symbol of..hope? a lost childhood? still thinking about that one...that's why i want to go back and drink in this whole book again.

I won't repeat all the accolades below...but will note that Eggers gives the reader just enough \\"air\\" to be able to keep on going, despite how gruesome the story often gets. This is a shocking book, but it is readable. Some very surprising parts were about folks in the US: who helps, who doesn't, why, what people want to know, what they don't want to know, what the dynamic is between helpers and helped. There are many heroes in the book--the man who leads Valentino most of the way to safety (Dut Majok) is one who deserves his own monument. Also the Japanese man whose story is told close to the end. I wish there was a page honoring these people ...assuming they were all real...but no doubt there were hundreds of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down...","review":"Excellent book.

I recommended this book to all of my friends, and they loved it too."},{"rating":"2","title":"a bit much","review":"Writing in the voice of V. A. Deng, Eggers is consistent, realistic, and an excellent story-teller. I am certain this story, although a composite of several (many?) other boys' tales, could conceivably have happened to one person, horrific as it would be. My question is what makes it of interest to people for whom suffering at such a level is practically inconceivable. Why are we reading this (as well as Beyond the Beautiful Forevers, among others)? As a novel, I found it unbalanced; as a biography, that doesn't apply. So how to judge it? The suffering, the terrible events pile one on another so that any \\"good turn\\" that occurs sounds false. Meeting the man with a bunker full of food which he shares in the midst of the horror reads like a fantasy intruding on a mind destroyed by deprivation and pain.Do we need stories about the depravity to which war drives people? It seems we do, as it continues in other places. Do you need to read this? That's the question."},{"rating":"1","title":"Haven't read it yet","review":"Hard to get into.

I had not sought out information on the Lost Boys from the Sudan and didn't think I would find this book so interesting. But it held me from beginning to end. Dave Eggers is a brilliant writer. Thanks Dave for educating me and for making the subject so fascinating and moving. And, like Heartbreaking, touching me so personally at the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Cattle or the What?","review":"A Sudanese version of the Boat People. Instead of pirates, you have the gruesome attacks of militias, lions, malaria. Instead of a sea of sea and malnourished Asian/Mexican heads, a sea of starving children (amongst them, the Lost Boys), civilians, and boys/men with fancy guns on the dessicated landscape of Sudan, Ethiopia.The book is powerful because it carries a violent voice of honesty. It shatters one's concept of stability and security. I find the various names of Valentino engaging. Also, Zone Eight is riveting and haunting. It also attacks the issue of being in limbo, being stagnant as refugees, which I believe represents all aspect of human existence, regardless of where you reside, on the wealthiest corner of the earth, or the most impoverished.I highly recommend the book because it opens the eyes of those who are blind to the suffering of others. Awareness is a wonderful medicine for those who are in limbo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"I am in awe of this book and Dave Eggers in general. If more people could read this book, perhaps we'd all live in a very different world."},{"rating":"1","title":"The title might be redeployed as the title of this review","review":"The title's teasing proverb might be redeployed as the title of this review. \\"What is the What\\", is an uneven effort. On the pro side; This is a desperate, African adventure story with a noble and honest hero (perhaps too noble in some of his confessions). To it's credit, I also thought that the majority of the dialog seemed to capture an authentic African voice and banter. Further, at times, the author's attention to detail is truly riveting. On the con side; just as often, the authentic English African translation is a little stiff and dispassionate. I believe this very good book could have used a very hard edit. It is spread too thin, attempting to capture too much of the Lost Boy's journey and struggle."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Award for the WORST Book Chosen by a Book Club Goes to....","review":"The only appeal to this book is that it appears to be \\"politically correct\\" to not only read it, but give it a review that exceeds the quality of the story and writing.

Webroot suggest uninstalling their program and running a RegClean utility, but that doesn't clear this up, I had to restore my system to the state it was in before I installed SpySweeper.

Not only didn't they know each other all that well, I didn't even know the characters, just enough to not care for either one of them. Larissa was weak and not very bright, Vincent was pretty much a jerk (a nicer term than what I'd really like to call him). I felt and saw no love between them and would have stopped reading sooner, but I just kept hoping it would get better, too bad it didn't.

I wait longer than that for some of my boyfriends and I generally like them! There was no plot, no developement of a relationship, it was terrible.

The only character I ever really cared about was the ill brother Thomas but he seems to exist just as a reason to get her into the house with Vincent and even Larissa seems to forget about him as the story progresses.I know that the intent is to craft a story about how a man who has never known love, finds it and is transformed.

The details didn't fit together well and at times I felt I was being force fed information to move the plot.

Reasons: It was slimmer, less static, mute button and no charge cradle can charge by usb. What is odd though is this earpiece has much better sound the volume can be adjusted to a much louder level than the 500 and 500v. Another negative, when I received it there was a crack coming from the blue light to call button. Now if jabra would only combine the two they would have in my opinion the best behind the ear bluetooth to date. I hope their working on it :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome sound and comfort","review":"I have tried many different wireless devices and this one by far is the best.

The story is a good mix of individual adventure and geopolitics. The nature of the conflict was a natural fit for that story, with individual agents, explorers and emissaries having geopolitical impact. I do wonder if too much credit is given to individuals. For example, Eldred Pottinger is called the Hero of Herat because of his individual efforts in inspiring its defense against a Russian-inspired Persian siege. I'd like to read another narrative of it to see if Hopkirk overhypes Pottinger's contribution."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment","review":"After reading the summary to \\"There Was A Little Girl\\" I couldn't wait to crack into the book.To my surprise the novel was a little bit like a piece of gum when you first put it in, minty and refreshing. Then as you keep chewing it looses its appeal and then with even more chewing it is completely flavorless.I also was not impressed by the racism, the judging and the language. Overall this book was a big disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Gentleman Champion","review":"It was the golden age of gentlemen racers. They wore street clothes and polo helmets, and wore no seat belts. They thought it was safer to be thrown from the car then to be strapped inside of it in an accident. It is difficult nowadays to fathom how dangerous the sport was back then. The tracks were not ringed by great big runoff areas and armco barriers; back then it was concrete curbs, telephone poles, fire hydrants, trees, and spectators. They truly risked their lives each time they went out. The danger is what made it exciting both to the drivers as well as the spectators. The drivers were heroic figures to me, like fighter pilots going out on a mission.This book captures not only the life of Fangio, but of his times. Moss, one of the very greats, was the perfect person to write an autobiography of Fangio, his friend and rival, the only driver better then him. Their battles on the track are legendary. A haunting tribute to the best driver who ever lived."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like fine wine","review":"Ibrahim Ferrer shows yet again the finesse and maturity of a well seasoned vocalist who over the years has become better and better. With the Buena Vista sound backing him up he lets loose song after song with the incredible range and confidence only a master can produce. A wonderful posthumos album with his take on several classics. A spellbinding duet with Omar and impeccable rythm that grows on you the more you listen to it. Its wonderful to compare to his more youthful works and see that what he gave up in fiestiness he more than makes up for in sheer class and charisma. A must buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Late Sixties Blue-Eyed Blues","review":"Before becoming a main stream rock super group FleetwoodMac was an absolutely terrific electric blues band.

But it's available for only $29.95 at the filmmakers website IF you're an individual who will be viewing it at home. The price listed on Amazon is the so-called tiered institutional pricing for libraries. Because libraries loan out videos or let teachers show them in class, filmmakers think they have a right to charge libraries more -- much more. There is no legal basis for this approach; it's simply a matter of what the market will bear. As long as libraries continue to purchase videos at inflated tiered pricing, filmmakers have no reason not to overcharge us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap","review":"I bought this item to show holograms for a up coming event, When it came in the box it looked like it was used and just tossed in there.

The author is a psychologist and consultant who helps companies enhance productivity and train managers.Genett's book is written in the form of a story about cousins who have different management styles. One is successful and has time for a nice family life and hobbies, and the other's life is a mess. But the second learns Genett's Six Steps of Effective Delegation and becomes as happy and successful as his cousin.It sounds hokey, but it's actually an effective way to impart these tips.

Its a storybook and quite honestly, the real contents of the book could be summarized on a single page.If you are looking for a very basic and simple book about delegation that reads like it was written for a young child .. you've come to the right place.

(I guess he doesn't spend much time watching MSNBC weekday evenings.)In the end, though, it's the liberals who end up looking silly and mean-spirited (probably unintentionally so on the part of the writer and/or director)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong Director","review":"Whoever directed the trailer should have directed the movie. As is the case in the industry the trailers our produced by the marketing folks (usually). Anyway the marketing people knew Bob's movie was badly written, terribly directed and in general not very intelligent but with a good trailer they got some of us sucked in, good for the marketing guys.Bob in the future hire whoever produced the trailer to direct and edit your next attempt at film making.This movie is just bad cinema, definitely feels like a high school project."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arrogant","review":"Roxy (the female lead) is a typical sassy, left-leaning young adult girl with a foul mouth. She is agnostic and hates religion, spirituality and the people who practice it. However, she is not criticized at all in the movie when people like her are just as big a problem with contemporary American society as anyone else is if not more so. I do not consider this a spoiler: there is one particular scene where a right-wing pundit called Roxy a feminazi upon which we are put in his POV staring into Roxy's eyes as she shoots us again and again. I felt that was over the top and revealed the directors bias. It's not only the spoiled rich girls that deserve to be shot Roxy, I wouldn't mind someone coming along and straightening you out either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only hate for the Right. . . . what about the left wing wackos?","review":"Trailer looked good, movie was not. once you see a trend of political bias and senseless violence it's just not funny.

I thought this movie would be equally funny. I was wrong. I get the idea, shooting people that are really annoying to you like the cast of Jersey Shore, but I didnt find this movie at all funny. I didnt laugh once.Murdering children, babies, teens because they annoy you? That's tough to make in to comedy, even if you are trying to make a political statement at the same time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has moments but pretty shallow overall","review":"This movie is pretty shallow and adolescent in its content, so its fitting that the heroine is a young, self righteous teenage brat. Yeah yeah her character had a bit of content but by in large the movie focuses on very sharp tempered heated debates punctuated by pretty random and pointless killing sprees. As such the movie tends to become so random and spontaneously violent that it is most fitting that the two protagonists end up getting shot and killed at the end, a fitting end to the monotony of the increasingly unimaginative violence of this film, degrading to both gun-rightists and modern liberalism at the same time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Violence warning. As a movie(piece of art), it is extremely effective","review":"I do not watch violent films, if I can. I simply do not choose to. However, I watched this for its words. No satire is perfect as society is more complex than any writer can describe.This film is something of classic quality. It will be remembered as a piece to study later.It depicts the distorted and conflicting psychology of all of us, violently.It does not lose you from the beginning until the dramatic end (that you will know and expect from the first part).

It was perfect for what it is. The acting was superb and it appealed to that person in me that is just tired of all the BS of pop culture. I found myself sort of cheering Frank for what he was doing. Not that I'm a proponent of crime but it was very good acting and, like I said, held that appeal. Definitely worth watching if you are a fan of dark comedy. I'm giving this one 5 stars. It would have been four but adding Alice Cooper to the background music in the end pushed it over to the five star rating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Taking a Sledgehammer to Pop Culture","review":"Given the pounding this movie took by professional critics, I did not expect to enjoy this movie. I am glad I gave it a chance. The movie suffers somewhat from a thin plot, but as a character study, it's great. Frank is likable and he's right. That's why turning him into the thing he hates works so well. We like Frank, so how can we endorse his behavior once he crosses the line? The movie is funny, clever and bitter. It is also sweet and cathartic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bobcat Goldthwait spends over an hour and a half conveying his deepest psychological fears.","review":"Except that he doesn't know that he's doing it, because he isn't self-aware enough to know that.Bobcat's characters are basically a pipeline for his boring ramblings about all his pet peeves, which he obviously spends way too much time thinking about, because this guy just goes ON AND ON. He is constantly acting like a complete sourpus, always ranting ad nauseam, like that guy who just doesn't know when to shut up and can't help his negativity from spilling out of his mouth like vomit. His relationship with the teenage girl is platonic, but first he spends at least five minutes justifying this fact, and then later in the movie has her slowly unzipping her dress with the door open.I gave it two stars instead of one because they mowed down some Westboro Baptist idiots. That was fun to watch. If they had just put that scene first, it would have made his character better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not great.","review":"It got a little preachy at times.

Good casting and performances.As others have mentioned, it has a small mix of 'Falling Down', but I will add a dash of a PG-13 version of 'Natural Born Killers' and even 'Juno' (ironically) to the mix.Not for everyone, read the synopsis to see if it is for you, it was definitely aimed at someone like me, and I was entertained.In a weird way, this movie is very charming.

The film focuses on how we have developed as an American society and the problems that have arisen. It is full of subtle jokes and jabs at modern America. The film has a somewhat slow development that really helps the telling of the story. Much the same as Drive, the dynamic differences between the \\"storytelling\\" parts and the action parts is magnificent. I was torn between a 4 and a 5, and would ideally like to call it a 4.5.In short, if you have the time for a film, this is a great bet."},{"rating":"2","title":"The way you dream","review":"This movie is crude but does what should be done yet can't since you would end up spending a life in jail and ruining many lives in the process"},{"rating":"2","title":"Damn Good Movie","review":"If you have any intellectual ability then you will enjoy and appreciate this film.

When haven't we run into some of the obnoxious personalities in this movie and briefly wished for some ill fate to befall them in the near future. However, this movie quickly turns into some sort of liberal nonsense and gets really preachy at the end. The most interesting thing I found was the film's use of violence. As is routinely seen in real life when liberal zealots act out they use violence to solve their problems in the name of peace. It is a really odd hypocrisy that in order to stop the unfair treatment and violence the lead character kills all those who are, in his mind, being unfair or violent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horribly Offensive","review":"I watched this through to the bitter end because I paid for the DVD, after liking some of Magnolia's other productions: Marley, Hunter, Centurion, etc. But this wreck just kept driving toward the cliff. This is a wretched exess of violence, nastiness and rage, with an attempt to justify as criticism of the mindless dribble on TV, which the lead character watches just as doggedly as the office mates and others he villifies. (How about just turn it off!!). Attempts to parody reality TV and talent shows instead show a sociopath's descent into madness and the killing so easily done in our gun worshiping society, and the innocent bystanders and accomplice he takes with him into oblivion. Nothing likeable, nothing profound, just a nothing film. Should have stopped with the dirty tampon-throwing scene. Was going to share with my friends, but this is going into the trash instead where it belongs."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring diatribes","review":"Besides the inane premise delivered with absurd violence in this movie, the actors were unappealing, the story was tedious, the writing was banal, and the constant lectures just never seemed to end.

I got uncomfortable, I was so bored."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yipes!","review":"This is one \\"disturbed\\" movie. As another reviewer stated its worse than the culture it criticizes. It started off as a spot on satire and ended up more like an MK-ULTRA brainwash film for Manchurian candidates. Very unsettling but not in an enlightening way and even more unsettling that a lot of people gave this 5 stars since the nature of the film itself is the sort of thing that the character Frank hated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Evil, Yet Intriguing","review":"God Bless America is an evil movie. Yet it is intriguing. I just don't think it's fun to watch stuff like this after what happened in Colorado this year. There is even a scene in this movie where four people are gunned down in a theater. Sound familiar? I also disagree with the hate of pop culture in this movie. The main character hates a show (that is similiar to American Idol) so much that he wants to kill everyone who works on the show as well as its fans. Being a fan of American Idol, I really hated those scenes of the movie. I'm not going to say that this film didn't have its interesting moments though, because it does. It's just a shame that buried under the interesting moments, are moments that are depressing and vile."},{"rating":"2","title":"he does what you think of doing","review":"intriguing film. a modern twist to Michael Douglas' Falling Down.

I've seen other Bobcat films Shakes the Clown and his television shows. They are well made but not what I'd call crafted or intelligent. But this one is, The layers in the character development, story lines, and plot lines. The contradictions that we as people and as a society chose to accept or rage against. Well after viewing this I thought about myself and the world around me. A film that is thoughtful enough to stay with you for some time afterwards is a sign of a well made, well directed, well acted, and profound material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much, too late...","review":"After watching trailers for this movie, I was really hyped up to enjoy it. Who wouldn't want to watch a movie that gives the ol' bird to the US o' A. Well, when this movie revolves around a dated reality singing show that's been on for 7+ seasons, it's hard to even take this movie seriously anymore. Sure, the title, trailers, etc., make it seem like a comedy, but there was some real hope for a serious discussion on the pitfalls of American society.What irritates me the most about this movie is Frank's monologues. They're extremely boring and re-hashed at least 3 times throughout the movie. Roxy joining in the diatribes doesn't help as she follows his same patterns.There are some good moments. Just the scene where he attacks the reality show star in her car was really well done. Perhaps if this movie came out about 5 years ago, it would have been more relevant. For today's world, we need some of today's topics to curse America!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I hoped for","review":"I was pretty excited to see this film. I knew it was a black comedy and it seemed, from the trailers, that it was targeted at those we all sometimes wish we could \\"off\\". However, I got about half way through and had enough of the bashing on what you could tell were supposed to be conservative ideas and people. Again, I have to see another movie that can't think of anything new? Just \\"kill conservatives, that'll make the world better\\". It gets old. However, I also just got bored with it. I didn't know where they were going with the story. How could these two, after being shown on the news, driving around in a banana boat of a car, not be noticed by police or anyone else?I knew I shouldn't take the movie too seriously when I rented it, but this was just asking me to go way too far out.Too bad too, because I love Bobcat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting premise but fell short","review":"I was looking forward to this movie. The trailer was excellent, but I was looking for more witty than bitter. It seemed like a rough cut that could have been worked a bit more and made much better, and I'm not talking about the filming or effects as I realize it was low budget and could forgive that. Some of the parodies were a little too far fetched, like the doctor. A couple of times I laughed out loud but it was mostly slow and I felt the female lead could have easily been a target of the movie as she was pretty annoying.

While violent, the story line seems to be a bit disjointed, there's the odd-romance between the characters, which was cute and occasionally heart-warming, but came off sometimes as preachy instead of a stark contrast to what they stood against. It could have worked as a contrast, but there is so much ground to cover on killing off idiot americans that I would have preferred that be the focus!It was entertaining enough to get me to smile, but I was hoping for some really original surprises to make me laugh, which unfortunately weren't forth coming."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad movie","review":"Not worth my time and I wish I had it back.

Not targeting my niche, incompatible with my morals and seems to be so full of political nonsense that it kills itself in the first 5 minutes. Or maybe that was just the baby exploding in a shower of gore. I suppose it could be both. Either way, not a movie for the normal movie goer. Plus, I feel so much dumber and so much number after watching this, I'm just going to give it the lowest grade and forget about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth my time","review":"Overall a boring movie. Unbelievable dialogue, especially from the high school girl character. Not one but two theater shooting scenes, kind of sickening after the events in Colorado. Offensive untrue depiction of \\"Tea party\\" participants beating a Parkinson's patient. In the credits the term \\"teabagger\\" is used. Glad I didn't pay to see it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ignore the number of good ratings","review":"This is one of the most evil hate filled films ever produced. The protagonist is a mass murderer that teams up with a little girl who also becomes a murderer, and they kill anyone whom has a viewpoint differing from their own, including teenagers in a theater, a glen beck spoof, church members, and the cast and viewers of an American Idol spoof. If there was any message to this film it would be that media fries the brains of Americans, but this is the biggest piece of brain frying crap to ever be thrown together.

Bad movie - wouldn't watch again."},{"rating":"1","title":"dumb.....","review":"A feel-good simpleton movie for the person you know, that thinks everyone agrees with their political perspectives, only to have 8 out of 10 walk away from the conversation, wondering what planet or drug they are on.

Goldthwait only disagrees with FOXNews!","review":"This is a funny movie but it will be nice if it was \\"fair and balanced\\". Really tired of the so called independents who are targeting conservatives only. Really easy to beat on O'Reilly (he keeps saying that he is a simple man and indeed he can take it).On the cover of the Blu ray it says \\"one jerk at a time\\" and \\"taking out the trash\\". But what about the lap dog media CNN, NBC, PBS, ABC, CBS, 60 minutes, MSNBC etc? They are spewing propaganda rather than news. Still waiting to see real news on these chanels. Just now before the elections silence is deafening. I guess everything is perfect in the liberal world.However, still a funny movie.

While this movie tries to point out the toxic culture we live in, this movie creates more toxic waste than it exposes.

This movie fails both as entertainment as well as in its moralizing. Riddled with cliches and contradictions, it mistakes pretension for intelligence.

I liked it a lot. THe animation was fluid, the art was superb, and the story was very original and excellent. You might have heard there is a lot of nudity, but if you ask me, the screen time of the breasts (that's all the show) would be a total of less than five minutes, so... blah!

Relationship between two main characters (both female) seem like an affair, not like a friendship.Feeling. Just for rent. Perhaps it may worth the time due to drawings. But if you spend money... There are better things you may buy:Superdimensional fortress Macross, Sol Bianca, Bubblegum crisis chapter 1 to 4, Wings of Honneamise.If you see this movie on the shelves, leave it there and warn your friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Feel-Good Film!","review":"I just rented this from the local Blockbuster, and I loved it! I am a general anime fan: I watch any anime I can get my hands on. I loved Gundam Wing as well as 08th Team and I also love Slayers, Hyperspeed Grandoll, and Vampire Hunter D. As you can see, I'm not really picky with my anime.Plastic Little has an imaginitive storyline that is fairly easy to pick up. The animation is cute if a bit odd (check out the girls' profiles! Their noses run straight into their mouths! it's cute, but odd). It is definately NOT for the kiddies, though. However, it is a wonderful film for comedy-action anime fans 15 and up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A definite breath of fresh air","review":"I saw this movie at the recommendation of a friend who is known for anime such as Akira or Ninja Scroll, and I was expecting to see the same thing.

I would definitely recommend this to you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't even think of watching this video.","review":"\\"Plastic Little\\" is a fairly poorly acted direct to video \\"anime\\" with a story that runs for about half an hour. Maybe I enjoyed some of the goofy action scenes, but the story is so saccharine that it's insulting. The fact that this film's intended appeal more or less hinges on being physically attracted to animated characters does provide some scenes that are in a sense funny, but trust me; they are soooo stupid! The only thing that would make \\"Plastic Little\\" funny is if the studio decided to make a sequel.

There's one song in this selection that could be described as 'blues-ey\\" - the rest I don't quite know how to describe other than to say, this album ain't blues.

The album title is appropriate: Joan has travelled through many forms of music and come back home with elements picked up along the way. Takes some listening to get into these blues, but anybody with some latitude will not have any problems appreciating the songs.Listeners whose ears are accustomed to formulaic blues are disappointed because they forget that Joan's strongest quality is injecting her own spice into anything she does, be it in processed vocals, risqué lyrics or new chord progressions.

All three disks are suppose to be in color -- the studio's own website says that they are -- and yet disk two and three are in black and white.

Seriously. It's the only toy he's had that he can sit and play with for hours at a time. He isn't interested in eating, bathing, or television. He just wants his train set. The only thing that can tear him away from it is going to the park, and then he wants to bring it with him. I think my favorite use for it has been bringing a few of the curved pieces to church and setting it up on the floor near our pew. He played silently for the whole hour. It was awesome. And unlike most of his toys, he plays with this one every. single. day. For real. If you've got a train-obsessed child, this is a great toy.

For the price, this set was just what we needed and was a perfect add-on. I really like the bridge; others that I've seen are not sturdy at all. My children were frustrated playing with a set in a store once because the bridge kept falling over- the bridge was just track that sloped up and lay on top of a block. Even I could not get it to stay up when pushing a train over it. The bridge in this set is great, no toppling over= happy kids. I'm surprised that more of the bridges out there for trains aren't made like this? The pieces fit together the same way any other wooden tracks do, I didn't think they were poor quality or gapping like another reviewer mentioned. My 1.5 and 3.5 year olds can both push the trains around on the track and enjoy this toy! I like that this is a toy they will be able to use for a long time, creating more elaborate tracks as they grow."},{"rating":"1","title":"The people who give this a positive review did not play with it.","review":"The train doesn't fit under the tunnel... need I say more?

I initially purchased this set to add on to an existing brio set he had and it is compatible. However, my son has Thomas and friends trains and the wheels do not align to this set at all! Whilst it is possible to use the Thomas trains, when one wheel is in the groove of the track the other wheel falls short of the other groove causing them to derail often. This set is great fun and good quality but definitely best used with wooden trains."},{"rating":"2","title":"Product is exactly as you see it in the picture.","review":"I have no complaints about this train set. The sturdy wooden pieces interlock perfectly, and the product was packed very well. all like pieces were bound together so it was quick and easy to put together while using the color assembly guide.

However this not compatible with Thomas & Friends train sets. The trains do fit under the bridge. Also one of the magnet's on the supplied train does not work and so our child cannot pull carriages with the train. Also the wheels on the train are flimsy indeed. To make matters worse not all the track pieces where lining up. But to save a few mm's on the bridge to save money. What a shocker!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Isn't compatable with other wooden train sets","review":"My son got this for his second birthday. We already had a small set from Ikea, and some Thomas pieces. The connectors are a bit longer than the other brands, so not all the pieces are compatible. The bridge is a little short for the train, but we haven't had a problem with it. He loves it, and the train pieces are his favorite, so I don't consider this a big deal. However, if you're just looking to get some extra track with this set, I would look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Check to see if your train fits under the bridge.","review":"I love these sets. I remember playing with one (Brio) that I had when I was little, and so I was thrilled when a friend of mine got one for my son. I was soon disappointed, however to find that for my set, the train does not fit under the bridge. Or, I should say, it doesn't unless the straight track is positioned exactly in the middle of the arch. The way these pieces wiggle around, it's tricky to keep the tracks in that perfect position, so the train comes down the bridge, around the turn, hits the bridge and comes to a dead stop. Very disappointing. I don't see other people commenting about this problem, so I suspect it's just my particular set. It might be something you'd like to check, though, when it arrives at your door."},{"rating":"2","title":"My 3yr old loves it!","review":"This is a great, well-built train set that will entertain him for long stretches of time. The only drawback is the little trainset that comes with the tracks. My son loves that it includes a coal car, but when attached to some of his Thomas trains, this set is constantly falling off the back. I think the magnets may line up at different heights, so they don't have the strongest connectivity. Besides that, a great starter set!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great intro train track set","review":"My 2 year old son got this as a Christmas present and loves it (purchased by his babysitter at a local store). He likes it so much that I ordered the same set here on amazon for my 2 year old nephew. Unfortunately it was missing a crucial piece (one of the ramps coming off the bridge). Melissa and Doug's customer service dept was great and is shipping a new piece, but it was still a huge disappointment to my nephew on his birthday."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wooden train","review":"I bought this for my 2 year old to see if he'd enjoy it before buying a larger set. This little expansion is fun just by itself. It makes an 8 with a bridge and tunnel but he also enjoys making his own shapes. The curved pieces have ridge tracks on both sides so you can flip them either way. The quality is very good: he throws them around sometimes an they haven't chipped or broken. We are very happy with this and foresee the big train set for his birthday.Also, our little red train has no problems going under the bridge."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Diary of a country Priest","review":"I did not care for, not what I thought it would be, but then everyones taste is different.

This is perhaps the most relevant book I ever read, and also one of the best in whatever sense."},{"rating":"2","title":"a philosophical rather than religious journey","review":"It is saddening to read the reviews posted because this novel is not a Christian tract and in fact addresses that margin of life where one observes human behavior, including one's own, and begins to wonder where it may lead, if anywhere. It is not a religious book but in fact a philosophical one, in the guise of a journal. One can read it with Boethius, Anne Frank, Camus or maybe even John Kennedy Toole (A Confederacy of Dunces. Had to throw that oddity in...) But the point is that this book appeals even to atheists like Albert Camus, and there is a reason for that. It skims very near the glowing core of fundamental issues without lapsing into easy solutions. And it does have a plot, on some levels ironic. But irony is too often lost on the faithful, and too often the end rather than the means to understanding for the faithless. Note that in France, it is regarded as one of the top half dozen books of the 20th century."},{"rating":"1","title":"musty","review":"Don't mind old books but this one smelled musty and did not change after 2 weeks airing.

This DVD set for the TV Mini-Series \\"Lace\\" is wonderful! Even though this DVD has not been digitally remastered the picture is very clear. The sound is also very clear with no distortion. I am really pleased that this version of \\"Lace\\" is complete with no editing. Every scene is complete and presented as I remember when this Mini-Series first aired in the 1980's. If you are a fan of \\"Lace\\" I would strongly recommend purchasing this DVD set while it is available. Hopefully other TV Mini-Series will be released on DVD sets. I would love to see \\"Hollywood Wives\\" with Suzanne Somers and Stephanie Powers released in DVD form!"},{"rating":"2","title":"LACE - tattered secrets!","review":"Although neither Richard Chamberlain nor Jaclyn Smith, king and queen of the mini-series were not in this one, LACE 1 & 2 were spectacular.

It is still as good as I remember as a young girl. Lily is a nasty piece of work, once you know her story you can understand her anger but some of the things she does are over the top and downright nasty and the 3 girls/ladies had grandiose plans but there reality is something entirely different. Thoroughly enjoyed."},{"rating":"1","title":"lace review","review":"Lace was purchased for Christmas. We opened the new package to watch for the first time on January 2 and there was only one disc in what should have been a two disc set.Lace (Warner Brothers Archive Collection). It is a good movie, dissatisfied with the product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Soap Opera","review":"This is so typical of many of the miniseries of the late 70's and 80's. They shamelessly wallow in the excesses of the 'sexual revolution' and usually have sensational, lurid plots and poor acting. If it wasn't for the exotic locations and excellent photography they would be no better than your average soap opera."},{"rating":"2","title":"Childhood Memories","review":"It had been years since I watched Lace as a little girl with my mother. I've always remembered this film and had been searching for it a few years now. I was extremely thrilled when I found it on Amazon that I quickly grabbed the phone and called my mom to tell her I had ordered it and should be receiving it within a few days. She was even more excited than I was. We ended up watching it on a Friday night curled up on the sofa eating popcorn and laughing at some of the outfits. It's a great movie, and though we thoroughly enjoyed watching it, the story felt incomplete without the 2nd part. So needless to say we'll be having another movie night at my house soon with Lace - Part 2."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shortchanged","review":"I am disappointed with this DVD. I was glad that it came out because my VHS recording is quite poor now.An entire chapter is missing.

Buying this movie edition was like buying a set of 4 mugs and when you get home you find out you only have three."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sweeping epic","review":"I have been looking and looking to find this movie and now I finally own it.

This was written well and a nice easy read. I would recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"No mystery here","review":"This \\"mystery\\" is just plain awful. The heroine just happens to find letters with secret personal information left around. She is stupid enough to enter the victim's room (in her B&B;) and handle and hide evidence b/c she distrusts the detective in charge. We know he's no good b/c the author repeatedly refers to his greasy hair, and we all know unattractive people must be incompetent. Plucky heroine is conked on the head, the brakes of her bike are cut (now THERE'S an original idea) She also is dumb enough to talk to a reporter the day after the murder and then is shocked when the papers misquote her.I love a good mystery but I cannot abide stupid characters, cliches and plodding story. Two thirds of the way through - hitting next page as fast as I can on my Kindle- I find I don't care who killed him and I'm glad I only bought one of this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cranberries and Whales","review":"A delightful quick read. Anyone who has ever been to Maine - or perhaps even stayed in a bed and breakfast will enjoy the story line of this joyful mystery novel. Natalie, the central character and owner of The Gray Whale Inn shows a lot of moxie when threatened by an unprofessional officer of the law. In MacInerney's subsequent book, Dead and Berried, Natalie displays courage again by not abiding her close friend to be falsely accused of a crime by the same officer.The plot line moves right along - the array of characters are both interesting and entertaining and quite frankly, the mystery works because the reader is never sure who among the characters could be the villan. The intriguing writing of MacInerney piques the reader's interest because of the ebb and flow of the goodness (and not so good) of the characters.Read Murder on the Rocks and the second of the series and you will be watching for her next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vacation Read","review":"A light and fun vacation read.

It might not be completely realistic or a accurate in a few places, but what it lacks in sincerity it makes up for it with a lot of warmth and good feeling. No matter what the situation whether someone has just been murdered, attacked or is being accused of murder the main character is always baking something delicious. In fact so much so that it made me hungry just reading it. She also seems to have a habit of falling off cliffs, getting knocked out or crashing into bushes. A tiny wee bit accident prone. It is a light hearted read with middle aged Nancy Drew like heroine. I also loved the fact that the author added the recipes of all those delicious items the main character prepared, in the back of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Pleasant Get Away","review":"I truly enjoyed this quick read. Mystery and romance combined with great descriptions of life on this quaint island.

I am truly looking forward to reading more from this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good, at least to me","review":"I started off enjoying this book, but the typos, inconsistancies and nonsensical story line lost my interest. I have to agree with others who've posted about the negative aspects of this book. I am not familiar with the term \\"cosy mystery\\", which is used in several reviews, so I'm not sure if that was part of it. I did fast forward through a lot of the end, especially the endless trips across the water and the fight with the killer.

Centered around a new inkeeper in Maine trying to make a go of it. She's undercapitalized, and a little scattered. However, she is a nice character, with a couple nice friends.

This is a great book, the first in the Gray Whale Inn Mystery series. I don't know if it was the plot, which took many twists and turns, the characters whom you felt you knew right away, the on-target description of the beautiful Maine coast, or the fact that the author is a fellow Austinite--perhaps it is all of the above.

This book examines the different ways of exchange rate determination in Europe, based either on fundamental for the longrun relationship (cointegration methodology) or on purely statistical/econometric methodology for shortrun forecasting.

I bought this book because of the glowing praise and I wasted my money. There was no character development. Like a cheap vistorian novel, the author tells you something is going to happen and then goes into long boring detail. After 50 pages of nonsense, even speed reading didn't help. I gave up all the sadder and poorer. Where is a good Jack Higgins or Robert Ludlum or Daniel Silva Novel.

If you love auto racing, this book is a MUST HAVE! It doesn't matter what kind of racing circuit you enjoy: NASCAR, Formula One, IRL, CART, it doesn't matter. This book shows the tracks, detailed descriptions of each turn, including highlights of famous races on each course. For circuits that have changed over the years, it even shows the evolution of the changes. With stunning color photos of famous drivers, famous racing moments, and several track perspectives, and even the famous 14 mile Nurburgring circuit from days gone by. This is a book all racing fans should have sitting close by to refer to at a moment's notice.NOTE: (added 5/19/02) The book only goes up to the 1999 season, so it will not reflect the changes made to Hockenheim, Germany's circuit in the 2002 season. This is a MUST HAVE book if you have an interest in remembering the older, longer Hockenheimring that is now a thing of the past."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a gem!","review":"This has to be a one of a kind book! This book to takes you to various race circuits around the world.Although there are several obvious omissions the book is still superb.Colour photos,factual information,diagrams,etc ,make this book a great value and a bargain.Most motor racing fans will enjoy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes","review":"Wow this book was REALLY good! Surprisingly Cecily made the two most boring characters Daniel and Vanessa interesting and juicy for once. I couldn't believe what I was reading because it was so good. The only story I didn't enjoy as much was Nate because the same thing kept happening with him. Hello I need variety!"},{"rating":"2","title":"best books ever!!!!","review":"ok, I know some of you think that these books are pointless and innapropriate. Now, I usually love reading hard-hitting novel and autobiographies! Stories that retell major events in history used t be all I read. But after a while, its fun to just sit back and enjoy nice light reading. These book are sooooooo perfect for that. they are so funny and this latest one is just halarious! I couldn't put it down, and read all 8 books, plus the amzing spin-off book, \\"the it girl\\" (starring jenny) in 3 days! you absolutley have to read these books! they are a must for vacationing, long car rides, or just sitting around at home! I would give 10 stars if I could!"},{"rating":"1","title":"They Have Sex in Dressing Rooms","review":"As a parent of a daughter, I was disappointed at the twisted values of the characters. Selfish, hedonistic, material, snobish, I could continue but I'm sure you get the drift. They are NOT the kind of characters I would want my daughter to emulate, and unfortunately many girls do. For those of us that grew up thinking that a Judy Blume novel was a little daring, these Gossip Girl books make Blume look like Blue's Clues in comparison."},{"rating":"2","title":"IT\\"S IN THE SHOPPING CART ALL READY TO GO!","review":"I have to say that the gossip girl novels are not influencing on my lifestyle in anyway as the worried parent wrote in the NO! review. these are just books, a way to escape from the world. i am personally against the use of drugs and think getting drunk is really stupid, but these books are just a fun way to enjoy an afternoon. if your daughter thinks that because the people in the book get high she should too them there is a problem! but if shes just reading them whats the harm in that! i think that these are great books. they're fun and exciting and well they give you something to do that isn't boring. there are worse things on TV and in movies than in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"gossip girl # 8 did not disappoint...","review":"Although I am an exceptionally fast reader, I read this book with surprising speed. I would not have been able to do this if not for it's intriguing story lines and downright enjoyable characters. This was, by far, the best gossip girl novel yet. Between Blair's surprising graduation speech, Lord Marcus' royal appearance, Vanessa's newfound sluttiness, and Dan's stupid chioces, this book was a stay-on-the-edge-of-you-seat, laugh-out-loud, I-wish-I-were-them, and thank-god-I'm-not-them, classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Four stars? Are you serious?","review":"I actually like this series a lot, but I felt this installment was lacking. Actually, I thought that it was the worst book in the series so far. Some people are just completely out of character. Nate turns into a whiny little brat at the sight of Blair (Oh, he's been cheating on her all this time with numerous girls and SUDDENLY it bothers him that they aren't together?). Venessa turns into a sex fiend (Wait- Venessa?!). Not only that, but Blair happens to acquire a new boyfriend out of the blue... and a British Lord no less! And Serena is exactly the same: perfect. Just once I would like to see Blair triumph over Serena van der Woodsen.I'm not gonna lie: I'm going to read the next book in the series.

I sure hope not, I'd like to think that we still have good morals and values to pass along to the next generation.

The setting is a planet that has been turned into a social experiment where the residents live in the sort of simple, utopian, agrarian society advocated by Henry David Thoreau. Unfortunately, their ideal world has displaced the planet's original residents, the Pukpuks, who retaliate by setting fires in the forests planted by the utopians.The science fiction element of the novel felt subtle and as a reader I was instead drawn in by the character of Spur, a firefighter wounded while battling the fires, and the rural community that could be anyone's hometown. This is very much a novel about a damaged man trying to do the right thing, with a good mix of humor, action and thought-provoking moral questions that mirror those of our own 21st century world.Good stuff. And who knew Thoreau was so fascinated by fire?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I think I was missing 100 pages","review":"Well, it looks like I am in the minority here. I read this book in an evening and wasn't impressed. I understand what the author was trying to do, but when I read Sci Fi I want SCI FI. I want to know more! It seems like I was missing a ton of pages that explained or at least described things more. I'd like to hear back from anyone that feels the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"its a Dusey","review":"Bought this after coming back from a visit to the Dusenburg Museum in Indiana.Even a bad book about Dusenburgs is wonderful, and this is a very good book.Photography is superb, and the test and captions are informative."},{"rating":"1","title":"Adler's Duesenberg","review":"Dennis Adler's Duesenberg follows his basic formula for a book, a very competent photo album with little or nothing in the way of historical insight. He regurgitates information found in other sources and often repeats erroneous information. He performs no primary research nor provides information to make this book an important addition to an automotive library."},{"rating":"2","title":"My 1st taste of Satyricon","review":"Yes, this is my first Satyricon album and it certaintly won't be my last. Overall the cd is very good but sadly Satyricon seems to be heading towards a more mainstream approach similar to Cradle of Filth. Some of the songs have a nu-metal vibe to them and that is my main disappointment with this cd. Despite that, Volcano still has a more underground sound than COF or Dimmu's latest so hopefully they will hang on to that for their next album. Other than that its quite good and if your looking for some more modern black metal then be sure to pick this up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"This is Satyricon's best album IMO. Ten Horns Ten Diadems was better, but that was a \\"best of\\" album so it doesn't count. This doesn't even remotely resemble nu-metal. Volcano actually feels like an old-school black metal album to me. There is some experimentation on this cd, that works out very well. Any black metal fan should pick this up. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sell Out Black Metal","review":"This is (in my opinion) the first bad release from Satyricon. They have signed to Daron Malakian's label (from System of A Down!!!!!) and now they are the latest addition to the Nu Metal list. Unlike older Satyricon, this cd takes a complete 180 degree turn...for the worse. If you are a true Black Metal fan (old Satyricon, Bathory, Marduk, Naglfar, Dissection, Darkthrone...) you WILL NOT like this cd. This is the complete opposite of what Black Metal stands for...and is. Do yourself a huge favour and don't waste your money. If you want this cd for yourself I would give it to you for free! Not a single good full song on here. However, \\"Possessed\\" and \\"Mental Mercury\\" have decent parts...that's it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good!","review":"The book is not as advertised..it is the size of a matchbox!
