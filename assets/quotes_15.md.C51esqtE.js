The cast is top-notch with lots of faces that you'll find vaguely familiar; the writing and comedic timing are superb; the filming is artsy but not pretentious; the plot is a creative twist on a familiar theme. One of the funniest, most unique, and well put-together films I have seen in a long time.Sometimes these \\"independent\\" films can be a shot in the dark, and either be offensive or crappy or both, but not Baxter. I watched this with my in-laws, my parents and my husband, and ALL of us laughed: men, women, 20's, 30's, 40's and 50's, we all loved it!

I still find that I closely identify with my western sign (Gemini) but not as much with my Chinese sign (Rabbit/Cat). I know some people won't like that she calls the traditional Chinese sign of rabbit a cat, but I've had Vietnamese friends who say that in their culture it's called a cat, and that the two are generally thought of as being similar in symbolism in the east.

What starts out as being lighthearted soon becomes lightheaded, overwhelming the reader with an unbearably cutesy style. Reading this book cover to cover would be my idea of hell.

Although you might consider it irrelevant this movie undermines an awful lot of people. Most notably, The Maguires, Sarah Conlon and Alistair Logan (The solicitor who actually worked for the four's release, Gareth Pierce had very little to do with it) It fails to accurately encapsulate Northern Ireland realisticaly and is an insult to all those who have suffered at the hands of 'British Justice'. The changes give kudos to those who still believe the Guildford 4 and the Maguire 7 were guilty of those bombings. If you want to see a realistic version of events, Frank Cvinatovich's Dear Sarah should be seen. Remember an awful lot of Sheridans critics were the people he was supposed to be representing"},{"rating":"1","title":"Watchable But Predictable","review":"This snapshot about the wounds suffered by the Irish due to the British is an interesting enough story, with consistent acting (Daniel Day-Lewis and Emma Thopmpson) and realistic, credible direction from Jim Sheridan. It wisely avoids over-the-top melodrama and even provides some moving scenes of a father and son relationship. However, as the plot unfolds, the movie starts losing its interest and becomes a familiar, average story about innocent and falsely-accused prisoners. At times, it almost seems like an ordinary made-for-tv flick exposing a prison tale, and the unsurprising and expected ending doesn\`t help much, either. It also drags for too long, repeating its ideas and failing to engage at some parts. Overall, it\`s not a bad cinematic experience but it lacks the punch and wit that it should have, and ends up being not too memmorable as a result.A somewhat worthy rental, still far from a must see."},{"rating":"1","title":"Innocent?","review":"This film will doubtless appeal to those naive enough to believe the Guildford Four and Birmingham Six are innocent and that the IRA are a loveable gang of carefree Gaelic rogues."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this movie!","review":"Such an emotional story.

In this recording, Bernstein's conception of the work seems so distorted that even the Vienna Philharmonic could not make it work. Case in point is how Bernstein handled the coda in the fourth movement. The final choral is played so slowly that the listener loses the sense of the actual theme. After the choral, Bernstein chooses a tempo that is so fast that the musician's can't keep up. The result is music that does not speak to the listener. It seems that Bernstein can only create excitement by playing things faster--to the point of complete mayhem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brahms Beaten","review":"This is without a doubt one of the worst Brahms 1st symphonies ever recorded. Not only does Bernstein take an unbelievably slow pace, he insists on taking the exposition repeat. Then in the 4th movement, the tempi is so slow, the whole symphonic structure just falls apart. Bernstein is so self indulgent that the performance is just one ego trip. Bernstein's entire Brahms cycle for DG with the Vienna Philharmonic is just a disaster. Do not believe the two rave reviews also posted here. Brahms is not Bernstein's specialty. Go with Bruno Walter on Sony, or Horenstein on Chesky to here the proper way to conduct this symphony.

The wonderful descriptions of the characters, the way sub-plots are interwoven throughout the story, and the ability in all of us to relate to our school days makes this book a must-read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back to School is Murder","review":"In his second Steve Asher mystery, The Mad Season, Blanchard sharpens his craft while losing none of the charm of the first. The story is more of a whodunit than Murder at Walden Pond, but Blanchard still centers the story with his reluctant, appealing sleuth Asher. Blanchard also has a gold mine of a setting: a public school. Is there any place in the world as people intensive as a public school? They are places of shifting loyalties, lifelong friends, career long grudges... and there is a shaky hierarchy of superintendents and principals trying to impose order on a world that is intrinsically messy.

Yet, with all the ones that I chose, I bought the First Alert FCD3N model from my landlord. It is very simple, and very easy to use. It really isn't all that hard to operate at all. My only one problem, is that some of the information that was written on the alarm actually wasn't in easy to read letters.

If you have ANY common sense you will not learn anything. There are lots of lists with no elaboration; for instance \\"25 common mistakes of first time supervisors\\". There are no comments on actions one should take to avoid them, just a list. The bulleted and list based layout causes most of the pages to be half blank. This book has only about 30 full pages of text. It takes about 25-30 minutes to read cover to cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"If you have any common sense of your own, you don't need this book.

Reminscent of Bowie, The Cure, The Smiths and U2 all combined, but with a fresh, concise and coherent sound. This CD is instantly likeable and accessible to anyone who likes melody, energy and punchy, poppy bass lines. Once you get over the faux-British accent (hey, even Green Day does it) from an American band (although the lead singer has some Argentinian roots), you will enjoy this listen after listen. Also, just saw them live in SF, and they sound great!

What's with reviewers today and saying everything sounds like the Strokes? Anyways enough of my erreverant babbling, I suggest you buy this album if you want to listen to something different but not something to hard to listen too."},{"rating":"2","title":"quit comparing","review":"its so easy to compare music to other music that its almost become the only form of reviewing. how about looking at the music on its own? i guarantee most of the people that complain about elefant and praise interpol are impatient and unhappy kids that had to watch elefant when they opened for interpol.this is a good album. the guitar and bass are tight and lay down a full textural soundscape. the vocals are good. a little cheesy but i think that was the point, and they work. many of the songs are a little sappy, but i think this was intentional. you can call it bad writing, but i don't think they set out to write any world changing lyrics.its a shame that they are one of these new-something bands thats just going to get lost after the first or second album. check it out and appreciate it for what it is, not for what it reminds you of or what its not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tonight, We'll Dance....","review":"Elefant's debut album is definitely worth the 10 bucks or so in order to hear some passionate rock n roll with a slight '80's post-new wave flavor. The production is pretty minimal but crisp, and the songs are well crafted, very catchy and the singer is great.I love the homage they pay to The Smiths/Morrissey. \\"Misfit\\" should be a hit in heavy rotation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Es Argentino o se hace el Britanico????","review":"Cuando escuche el primer corte de Diego, qued�� enamorado de ��l y de su m��sica, es una rara mezcla de muchos cantantes Ingleses, su cara opaca, oscura y el video \\" Now that I miss her \\" es una prueba de eso, al mejor estilo \\" Dark\\".

Alot of the Information is NOT FACT and should not be taken Historically as so, but... it is based on what some of those people doing it now believe!

Doesnt come close to the emotion or originality of Spectators but still holds them superior to most groups in this genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment","review":"After purchasing \\"Spectators,\\" I eagerly awaited this release by Wolfsheim. Their first album had such a distinct and unique sound and I've found since its' release, many electro/synth bands have tried to replicate their style. \\"Casting Shadows\\" seems to be a lot of regurgitated dance industrial fluff, offering none of the original and crisp sound of the bands' first effort. In addition, I found the vocals rather whiney. I find the singer difficult to listen to with this one. I was quite impressed with his vocal stylings on the first record, so I'm not sure what happened. If you've just discovered this band, I would recommend that you purchase \\"Spectators\\" instead of \\"Casting Shadows.\\" The sound of \\"Casting Shadows\\" is very accessible and definitely typical. I think the album's only saving grace is \\"Wunderwoll,\\" and solely for that I will give this record two stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbearable lightness of being","review":"This album is well arranged, but one will have to decide when hearing the vocals whether this is good singing or an acquired taste for pathos. Basically the singer warbles in the same pitch over some well arranged synthpop. Sometimes retro, but also moving into \\"house\\" territory with \\"Wundervoll\\" which though very catchy can grate on your nerves. Lyrically Wolfsheim is on a higher level than most bands of this genre, but if one would go back through alot of early Gary Numan or Human League albums you wouldn't really find this release that overpowering."},{"rating":"1","title":"A BORING AND REPETITIVE ALBUM","review":"The latest Wolfsheim CD is boring. No evolution, rather a step backwards. I bought this CD because \\"Spectators\\" is probably one of my \\"top 5\\" albums. I tried, but I could not find any of the emotion and melancholy they used to have. No interesting sounds, and the lyrics are repetitive and boring. By the time you reach track number 6, you lose hope and realize that Wolfsheim sensitivity is completely gone.If you want a CD to dance poppy-electronic music then buy \\"Casting Shadows\\" (although there are better electro-pop bands). But if you want to put your headphones on, lay down and think about life, you better buy \\"Spectators\\". In conclusion: \\"Casting Shadows\\" made me yawn; \\"Spectators\\" made me cry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lanzar who?","review":"I have a 2005 Toyota Avalon Limited with the JBL Synthesis upgrade 5 channel amp 75wx4 plus 360w x1 sub I was looking for a little more power without having to make much changes to the factory system so I was recommended to add this Lanzar 5 channel amp rated at 1600 4x175w and 1x 375watt..however at high volumes the AMP continues to overload and shut down."},{"rating":"1","title":"No longer supported!","review":"This software would not load on my operating system (Windows ME) and is no longer supported by anyone!!

Consider them to be a manual for Christian living and a guide for the believer's fellowship with the Lord. This work by Zane Hodges is not only clear in its presentation, but logical and convincing in its argument and explanation. Lordship people won't like it because it takes away the inclination to be a judge of whether a person is saved. Hodges is especially clear in the explanation of John 2:28 -- 3:10 and how that passage isn't designed to be a litmus test for whether a person has eternal life, but a high, absolute standard of how Christians ought to live. A really great commentary that brings to the fore issues ignored or dismissed by other commentaries."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother ordering it, - amazon can't deliver!","review":"For anyone interested in buying or ordering this item - don't bother!!!!

This is the first from Christina Syke that I have read. I found myself getting lost and having to re-read text to see who was talking. At one point I thought the characters were still in the hotel when further on I realized they moved to the car. I've ready many ho-hum stories but rarely with such choppy dialog. With so many other books on my \\"to read\\" list, I felt this book a waste of time.For a good romantic Navy SEAL series, try Suzanne Brockmann's Over the Edge, Out of Control and Into the Night!"},{"rating":"1","title":"In Need of a Good Editor!","review":"First, there's the place where the author refers to \\"President Franklin\\" - you know, the guy on $100 bills? Let's see, what number was he?Then there's the silver Audi that follows the heroes - this is on an island in the Caribbean, mind you - that turns out to be \\"registered to a couple of tourists from Iowa\\" - who, naturally, shipped their precious car down to an island so they could drive it around on their vacation.Flaming stupidity like this makes me laugh in all the wrong places. Not that I expect that much from romance novels - they're meant to be easy, escapist reads - but the errors in this one were egregious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Going Way Overboard","review":"Although there were parts of this book I enjoyed, I can not recommend this book. I thought the book started out promising and interesting, but I quickly became irritated. As one reviewer mentioned, it was confusing to follow at times. The dialogue didn't always flow together into a coherent conversations. I also had to reread parts to make sure I hadn't missed a sentence (paragraph?). There were also times that I wasn't sure of the characters movements--were they still in the cabin, on the dance floor, for example. As another reviewer mentioned, the plot started getting very implausible about 1/3 of the way into it. And, finally, the editing problem another reviewer mentioned that caused a character to deliver prematurely at 11 months, was a bit confusing, too. If you would like to read Christina Skye books, I would recommend the Draycott Abbey books, which in my opinion are much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fast and entertaining read","review":"My first Christina Skye book, and it won't be my last. I did find myself having to reread sections at times; but for the most part it was very well written. BUT maybe McKay DID fall a little \\"too easy\\" for a SEAL.

All in all, a very enjoyable read that I would highly recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"OMGOSH! ---THIS BOOK STUNK!!!","review":"Ben Franklin was NEVER president of the US and you can't deliver premature if you've been pregnant for over ELEVEN months.

He has incorrect facts on many pages, which again is another irritating aspect of Schama but he does remind us that history is in the eye of the author. His emphases, asides and elicited facts show his background and own history and allows the reader to compile his own history. This is most certainly NOT a definitive history of Britain but a contribution to it. It may make, hopefully, others read fuller and more magisterial versions."},{"rating":"1","title":"See the TV series","review":"This book is not even close to the excellent and engaging BBC TV series from which it is derived. It contains a lot of information but it is presented in the \\"old style - school book\\" rambling of dates and kings and it does not at all make history alive. See the TV series, or buy the tapes, when available, instead of buying the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a \\"Citizen\\"","review":"If the reader is looking to Schama for another great, such as his landmark work \\"Citizen\\", you will be disappointed. This is a book that brushes over 5000 years of history on a couple hundred pages. Sure it has some nice pictures, but if you want an informative work on early English history, look somewere else. \\"Citizen\\" is Schama at his most brilliant. \\"History of Britain\\" is Schama pandering to his publishers."},{"rating":"1","title":"cashing in","review":"One understands the temptation. Even a best selling work of serious history doesn't earn the kind of money considered 'serious' in Wall Street terms. Imagine the frustration of teaching class after class of Columbia College students only to watch the little twerps become richer within a few years of graduation than their professor will ever be. Then this television company offers you, like, serious money to lend your name , the name of a serious, distinguished, respected historian, to the enterprise of packaging historical pablum for the semi-literate. Hey, everybody else is cashing in - why not Schama? It's not as though he's done anything truly evil after all. Merely lent his name to a grade B book. I presume that he didn't write the thing, I hope he spent his time writing something substantive.

They can look at the pictures."},{"rating":"2","title":"great history isn't always lite reading!","review":"A densely packed compendium of British history...can't wait for part 2. The times of the ancient Britons were particularly interesting. Reading it requires concentration but you will be rewarded by Schama's wit and comedic asides - at times a welcome relief for this intense volume. Many excellent photographs positioned near the subject matter. This book is not for the casual history reader and is probably why some people are rating it with fewer stars.Long live the king...no,the queen, no, the king...no, Mr. Schama!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerhouse Band","review":"Anyone interested in a very hard-swinging, high-energy modern big band should check out this album by George Gruntz. All the musicians are virtuoso players, and he's a virtuoso writer.

Her hikes are pretty limited to the upper half of the state, though. So if you want to hike in southern Colorado, there aren't many options in this book.I do wish she'd included all the information for each hike with the trail chapter--there's a chart at the beginning, so you have to flip back and forth between the hike information and the chart (i.e. off leash, easy, solitude, etc...). Also, the directions are a little sketchy on a few of the hikes, so take a map with you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse than useless book","review":"After traveling from Texas, we used this book to select a quick 2 mile hike on our first day in Colorado,. Upon getting started on the hike, we realized that the author's idea of an easy hike was way off base. The hike had 500 feet of elevation gain per mile and was way to steep to enjoy with our dogs on leashes (especially downhill). Later we researched the hike with another author and found the hike graded as strenuous. A local hiker asked us on our hike why we picked the such a steep trail for our initial hike. We will not use the Best Hikes with Dogs Colorado again. We will do our own research and calculate the elevation change ourselves.If you are an advanced mountain hiker and work with your dog off leash frequently, this book will probably work for you. If you are a flatlander and come to Colorado for its wonderful mountains, the hikes selected in this book are probably too aggressive for hiking with your dog."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Hikes with Dogs Colorado","review":"Very helpful, informative book..easy to read...maps are great !

It's a decent resource for getting ideas, but contains inaccurate information on off-leash and leashed areas. We specifically seek out off-leash hikes to do with our 80-lb mixed breed dog, and have several times been misled by this book.For example: The book recommends hiking Mt. Belford and Mt. Oxford, two fourteeners, notes that it is \\"some or all off-leash\\"--but the peaks are located in the Collegiate Peaks Wilderness. Wilderness designations are strictly on-leash areas.So, if you buy this book, definitely do your own research on the trails before you go.

The job on the old version was so easy that they decided to beef up the difficulty and ruined their game by doing so. The level is now unpassable and therefore you cannot progress into the final level of North Beach. Just to let you know I'm not whining, Scarface will let you play the 4th level of South Beach and it fit in w/ the difficulty of the whole game.It had taken me 2 weeks to get to the 3rd level of South Beach, and now I've been playing the same level for 2 weeks.This is a perfect example of how to ruin a great game.

It does not \\"sugar-coat\\" the topics, nor does it avoid the difficult subjects.I would highly recommend this book to anyone considering international adoption."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything you need to know- and entertaining!","review":"Davenport's book claims to provide a step-by-step guide, and she succeeds with humor and honesty. The book offers an overview that I found useful in an initial cover-to-cover reading, and enough specifics in the chapters that as I'm completing the paper chase, I find myself going back to re-read. Some adoption books emphasize the risks so much that they're unreadable, and some gloss over the risks so much that they're unrealistic. Davenport finds the right tone by presenting the experiences of many adoptive families at the end of each chapter, offering a balanced viewpoint of each step in the process. Her suggestions are concrete, her information is accurate, and her resources are useful. All in all, the best book I've found."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thorough, Thoughtful, A Must-Read for Potential Adoptive Parents","review":"This was the first book (of many) I bought as I started to research international adoption. It's been so helpful that I've recommended it to two other women in the two months since I first picked it up. It's written with knowledge, compassion and humor. Dawn Davenport presents the ins and outs of international adoption in just enough detail and with a deep sense of humanity. The appendices in the back of the book provide a wealth of information on specific programs by country, as well as guidance on further reading and research for the reader. And the adoption paperwork filing system she has developed is a work of organizational genius! This is a wonderful and thorough introduction to the wild ride of international adoption."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must READ","review":"This book on adoption is unusual in it's approach. Though the targeted audience is people interested in the process of adoption, Dawn keeps the reader focused on the needs of children. There were times that I laughed and times that I cried, but by the end I knew that I could and should do adopt a child from abroad. I can't wait to get started and now I know how. This book is like having a best friend who has already adopted to talk to at each step."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading","review":"The picture implies five items - this is misleading. There are only three items: the A/C adapter, the car charger and the retractable USB cord. Additionally, the USB cord connection to my Sansa Fuze did not fit!

I bought the kit specifically for the A/C adapter, and that works fine, so I'm not returning the kit. But I wouldn't buy anything else from this seller."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Beethoven / Bernstein","review":"As always, this Beethoven recording can easily be identified as a \\"Leonard Bernstein recording\\". His Beethoven interpretations are dynamic and marked by Bernsteinian rubato options that render this recording unforgettable. Really, really very good."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"Despite Bernstein's best efforts to provide a \\"true\\" interpretation of Beethoven, his Eroica falls flat. The funeral march is the most lifeless, slow, uninspired reading I've heard. Klemperer also takes the movement slow, but his reading is filled with grandeur and depth, not shallow, ingartiating pitty, the way Bernstein plays it. The movement seems to go on forever! Then there's the Fidelio. You would think he could pull of a simple overture. He starts out with tremendous energy at the introduction, but the pause before the entry of the french horns is too long. After the intro, Bernstein starts to slow down the tempo. Why??? It's all amounts to another mediocre performance."},{"rating":"1","title":"not good","review":"I bought two of these, one for my wheelchair and one for my scooter.

You basically walk around and control a swarm of minions to do predictable things like smash pots and chop up flowers. Woo.It should have been called Disneys Overlord. Or Fisher-Price, my first Overlord. The other reviewer is right. Your evil tasks include freeing human slaves from other evil creatures and getting food for them. After the 5 hours of tiresome play I took it back to the shop.Everyone's got their own opinions but the rubbish voice acting, rubbish \\"humourous\\" comments and complete lack of diversity in play (run here, point minions at fallen bridge, onto next room, point minions at bad guys) made sure that I fell asleep not once, but twice while playing.Cack with a capital C."},{"rating":"1","title":"Non Review --- but with a short word of advice.","review":"Game: Not my thing.My Advice: Whenever possible gamers should take advantage of the free game demo downloads available on Xbox Live before spending the cash for a game that may be lacking.

I liked this game. A LOT. I think its tons of fun once you get all the controls down and then figure out the different tactics which each minion. It is a fun mix between combat and puzzle solving, something few games actually achieve. My only dislike was the story. Not that it wasn't funny or entertaining but it didn't really give me much room in the way of deciding what type of villain I would be. Great game. however."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sit back and enjoy the mood","review":"Of all the vinyl I bought in the 60s and 70s this is the one I remember best. Perfect to sit back and listen to alone or with someone special.

If my original vinyl hadn't finally worn out I would still be listening to it. The CD doesn't have the nostalgia of vinyl but it sounds as good as I remember."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mozart Symphonies 40/41 - Bernstein","review":"The Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra has rightly been regarded as one of the world's premiere orchestras for almost a century. Under both Klemperer and Karajan, they have been particularly noted for their performances of the Beethoven Symphonies.However, this recording shows it takes more than a reputation to create an excellent symphonic performance; a lot depends on the interpretation of the conductor, and here, sadly, Bernstein did not rise to the occasion. The interpretation of Mozart's arguably best symphonies is tedious and without any inspiration, and the first movement of the 40th symphony especially displays this in it's sluggishnes and lack lustre tempo.Having heard many performances of these two symphonies jointly and seperately, I would have to say this is one CD that I wish I had not purchased. I have better, more invigorating recordings of these works, and sadly this CD is likely to just sit on the shelf, collecting dust!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time and money","review":"I bought it and now I regret it. It is useless. Buy the Aspen Publishers book by Mueller. That's all you need. Perhaps a horn book also. But, the Aspen book should do with a lot of practice tests.

I'd give it 100 stars if I could!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Soggy","review":"Beautiful playing, gorgeous sound. That will only take us so far. Abbado's rhythms have no spring to them, the orchestral colors are homoganized, the whole thing sounds slack. This isn't just a matter of tempi, although Abbado's are on the slow side. It's a matter of vision. Abbado here gives us an overly-romatic, non-ideomatic interpretation. There's little here of the Brahms who took long walks, smoked cigars and had to make his own coffee because no-one else made it strong enough for him. There's even less of the Brahms who sought the fusion of romantic sentiment into classical form. I've played this symphony and listened to many interpretations, and this is one doesn't suit my taste or what I read in the notes I played. For a bracing alternative, check out Klemperer's account on EMI, or Walter's, or Horenstein's. Even Bernstein gives us more authentic Brahms than this. Two stars for the orchestra and engineers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I expected this to be an interesting character study of four very different men caught up together in a situation that would bring out their best or worst and keep us intrigued. I was partly right--it was a character study of four men and the situation did bring out their personalities. Unfortunately the process proved to be a deadly bore, as did the men. I don't know if it was the casting ( the actors are normally very good in whatever part they play) but the whole story just failed to gel or involve the viewer and when the men returned to their regular lives, it was a relief to have it over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything is great.

An absolute steal. Couple that with Amazon's quick shipping and i'll say that i'm completely satisfied with my purchase; it's been a wonderful product and i wouldn't hesitate to buy the Webcam Pro 9000 over again if i were in the market for a new cam.

I gave this webcam to an out-of-state relative, so it was impractical to return it. I am currently using the ooVoo service for video chat; ooVoo has not displayed the same problem with this webcam.

I then did a search and found many reviews of poor focus with this webcam.. Amazon has a great return policy inwhich I used and the bought a microsoft webcam that I am very happy with, my son and I play Tiger 09 Wii online and video chat with this webcam and have a great time.

That's under Linux (Ubuntu 8.10 Intrepid Ibex), mind you -- apparently the uvcvideo driver it requires was part of the standard install as this is my first ever webcam. Now getting the HD resolutions and frame rates is more of an exercise (google for CaptureWidth/CaptureHeight and uvcdynctrl). I am currently seeing 960x720 with very decent optical quality and backlight processing but the frame rates are somewhat lagging. This may well be an issue with Skype itself or with the driver though. Overall the hardware shines but it would be nice to have a graphical utility for quick control tweaks.

Instead, we've built it into the device, so right out of the box, you'll get the best image quality possible, regardless of harsh or dim lighting conditions. Perhaps too much information, but we also adjusted the firmware to make sure that RightLight engages only when necessary.[...]"},{"rating":"2","title":"Logitech QuickCam Pro 9000","review":"This is a great webcam camera with excellent resolution.

My happiness is probably as much to do with the technology as the product - however the product is very good. There are times you will see delays, but given all the complexities and connections of users it is easy to understand. Lighting can sometimes play a role in the quality of the picture but there are numerous adjustments one can make to correct. But honestly the default is pretty good. The set-up is not terribly complicated, but a novice will require a little more time to do it.I bought two of these and gave one to my GF in another state. We have used it successfully and it works well enough where I will buy another one to send to my dad. That will tell me how well a novice can set it up from 1,200 miles away.Good product, well packaged, and arrived as expected through Amazon's delivery through a third party.

Every new conversation starts out with me waaaay overexposed and I need to make the same corrections over and over. Simple but ridiculous. Most callers don't like the audio of the built-in mic so I use a headset. Auto-follow and auto-focus functions will make you queasy.Kind of expensive for the single function I use it for, but the image quality is great and that's why I bought it."},{"rating":"2","title":"great picture quality","review":"very easy to install and set up, great video quality, lowest price I could find plus a $10 rebate"},{"rating":"2","title":"Logitech QuickCam 9000 Excellent choice for Dell and Vista","review":"I bought one of these for my Dell Inspiron 1501 running Vista.

The picture was not clear and always appeared to be out of focus, despite lots of tests and setup testing. So I returned the unit to Amazon.At this point I must say that the service from Amazon was nothing short of excellent and first class.

The picture quality is exactly the same as the old cam which is poor. I can't understand the webcam market. This is supposedly a cutting edge webcam but it takes horrible pictures compared to even the cheapest digital camera. Webcams are still treated as a gimmicky toy for kids with laptops and IM to play with. Very disappointing, save your money. Somewhere there has to be a good webcam I can buy.....Been trying to find one for years, no luck. My crappy old $99 digital camera takes far superior pictures than anyone I have tried or seen.

The software has many nice features that are easy to use and you seriously can use all of them to improve your communication, the Avatar thing is amazing and very fun to use with family and friends, I am sure one day it will be improved to be more real.

However after a short period of time - an hour or two-it ceased to work and I had to either reload the software or reboot my computer. A call to Logitech tech support , answered by a call centre in the Philipines was wholly unsatisfactory, actually a little insulting. After repeated rebooting, I tried the Logitech support again, and this time the Nova Scotia based call centre was very helpful. Still the problem re-appeared, so I gave up and returned the product to Amazon. I re-installed my Logitech E2500, which works very well, but does not have the picture quality of the 9000.The Amazon return process -which I had never had to use before- is very customer friendly, and works well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product!","review":"The Logitech QuickCam Pro 9000 lives up to its advance billing.

It has great auto focus functions, automated light settings and a very good microphone/sound settings. And it even comes with a lot of extra software options.The handle/foot is optimized to hang/ balance on a flat screen - and so, it works very well on my laptop, but doesn't really fit my big old CRT screen, where it mostly just lay on top - So I had to tape it to keep it from moving.But that's all minor - My biggest concern is that the very good picture quality is too heavy for the bandwidth of most of my online conferences. So I end up using the lowest and simplest picture quality settings anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"Logitech Webcam Pro 9000 / QuickCam Pro 9000","review":"Logitech Webcam Pro 9000 / QuickCam Pro 9000LOVE ITMY COLLEGE HAS THEM FOR STUDENT ID's AND SAM'S CLUB HAS THEM FOR THERE,MY FAMILY SKYPES AROUND THE WORLD AND ITS LIKE BEING RIGHT THEREGREAT PRODUCT AND PRICES JUST KEEP GETTING BETTER"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this camera","review":"Ordered three of these for personal use.

It then matches up its movements with your facial movements. It isnt anything too outstanding, but its fun to play around with. Anyway, the webcam itself is great.The only problem I encountered was that my light source was right behind me and shining towards the camera.

We've decided to use gmail's videochat feature to talk w/ each other, and although the video quality doesn't necessarily translate, the high framerate still does.The device mounts well to flatscreen LCD's or laptops.

The installation of the software was relatively easy. However, we did have a problem with our AOL not allowing the download of SKYPE, which we decided to use as the communication protocal. However a call to ProLogic's tech center was helpful. They just advised me to use Internet Explorer to download SKYPE.It was great seeing our sons and their girls with the cameras.

I originally purchased this product when I was running Windows Vista and it worked fine. I upgraded to Windows 7 64-bit when it became available. The cam no longer worked after the upgrade. It would not focus beyond about 12 inches of the lens. I searched the internet and Logitech web site and found that this is a common complaint with this product. There are muliple suggested fixes but none of them work. I contacted Logitech but am unable to get a response. I suspect it is because they know their product is defective and have no intention of doing anything about it. I would like to have the web cam replaced free of charge, but the Amazon warranty has expired and Logitech is ignoring me. I had a similar issue several years ago with one of their web cams. I will be looking elsewhere for my next web cam."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great cam","review":"Great resolution, love the camera.

I would fire all of them and start from scratch.I keep buying newer webcams and updating their bloated software in the hope that the drivers will some day improve, but they never do - version after version, OS after OS.They are always very buggy, especially the microphone drivers. I simply disable those in Windows 7, because they cause too many blue screens.

I set up one camera on my desktop, and another with my dad 2500 miles away, both of us using Skype. The image quality was outstanding. The right light feature worked wonders. When trying to call another friend with a built-in webcam on their laptop, the results were even more apparent, as they were more pixelated and jerky. This may parially be due to the lower resolution of their built in webcam, but it was enough to make me glad that I purchased a pair of these to keep in touch with my folks. Highly recommended if you are looking for a webcam.My only complaint is that the clamp thingy doesn't really attach to the monitor, it basically justs rests on top, giving counterbalance to the camera piece.

It's not very stable for sitting on a desk or table top or other flat surface. There's nothing included to make up for this problem. To keep it stable it'll have to lie flat. Or you'll have to find some object that will keep it at the right position / height for you. It's fine for a laptop or flat screen display but you have to keep it in the same position.

Just listen to baba yaga and here the brass and tuba blasting away as if on a football field. In many parts of pictures it seems the brass...1st horn, tuba and trombones in particular...are there to massage their own egos and show off rather than present the music for us to enjoy.A disgusting display of ego and showman ship by conductor and orchestra....and the New York Philharmonic wonder why they arent highly regarded in many circles?It is very clear here.I would advise you to stay away from this disc."},{"rating":"2","title":"As advertised but my fish aren't biting yet.","review":"Item as described and arrived quickly.

Actually, it is paper bound together with the words from a specially scanned copy of the book. The publisher aknowledges that some of the words may not be correct and it's filled with typos. They say it has to do with the fact that no editor is involved - it is merely a machine that reads text as best as it can. There's no preface, information about the author, etc. In fact, it's just basic text, much of it filled with typos.The publisher says that this is how they can give you the book for such a low price.

This recording reflects so much of what Bernstein's life was about, and that is \\"freedom\\". I own 32 different recorded versions of this symphony and this is my favorite.

The accoustics are not the greatest nor the Orchestra. You can tell they were thrown together and are not a tight group.As far as their skill as an Orchestra and their ability to tackle the challenging depths of this symphony goes...they are fine. I think Bernstein in typical fashion, over exaggerates the dynamics. He overplays it as though Berlioz wrote this. However, I could barely hear the basses (my instrument ) introduce the joy theme. They played good but not loud enough.So I think overall its great...Tempos are all a little slow but is otherwise fine here."},{"rating":"1","title":"The longest running commercial","review":"But one would rather watch the Milk commerical, at least it markets some real stuff and doesn't take 70+ labored minutes.

Their weapons already turned in - these poor guys stage a protest.

This is one of the most biased pieces of \\"history\\" I have ever read. I found it ironic that the author attacks the purity of the Queen Mother's Scottish ancestry when he has just spent over one-hundred pages tracing his own alleged descent through numerous Italian and Polish lines.I was also continously amused by his assertion that all historical figures of import are either Scottish or an actual Stuart. He claims Napoleon I as a relative and the late Princess Diana as a fellow Scot (while I'm sure she has some Scots in her family tree, probably no more than the Queen Mother!--see above). This man wants to have his cake and eat it, too, and I feel like this work undermines sincere efforts to celebrate the rich history and culture of Scotland."},{"rating":"1","title":"Odd mix of fact/fanasy supports author's claim to throne","review":"Disguised as straight history, this book is actually an polemic by someone calling himself \\"H.R.H. Prince Michael ... Head of the House of Stewart,\\" pretender to the Scottish throne. The Prince's claim is based on his alleged descent from the second marriage (previously unknown to historians) of Bonnie Prince Charles. Among the interesting \\"facts\\" conveyed in its pages are: Napoleon was a Stuart; Marshall Ney escaped execution and was carried off to live in America; all Stuart monarchs were capable, wise, and tolerant, especially James II; there is a conspiracy of British officialdom and historians to convince people that the legitimate line of Stuarts died out in the 18th century.

I didn't read the whole book, but the snatches I did read were really bad. William Wallace didn't grow up in the French court! He wasn't an aristocrat! He was an outlaw and a patriot! I truthfully didn't get past the part about Wallace, and it all left me wondering where on earth did this guy get his information from?!

I wonder if anyone has ever checked them out.

At a budget price, it is a better overall purchase (and performance) than its competitor in the Sony Essential Classics series (Clevenger/Rolla). Karajan, while known as one of the world's greatest conductors, was far from one of the best accompanists, however he seemed to revel in collaborations with horn and trumpet players (see my review of his recording with Maurice Andre). In fact, if you can stand to settle for a mono performance instead of this 1969 stereo account, Karajan made the hands-down definitive recording of these Horn Concertos in 1953 with Dennis Brain (clearly the best ever at his instrument) and the Philharmonia Orchestra for EMI."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Done","review":"It is a long and involved story but worth the attention.

At one point in the directions it states that you may just wanna make up your own rules...I tried to play the game with my boyfriend and his roommate. We played for about 10 minutes, then the gameboard and all the pieces were thrown onto the floor and i just read them the questions from the cards (which dont have anything to do with the simpsons) while we watched The Tick.

In general,I find Schama (both as an author and lecturer -- I sat in on oneof his courses 20 years ago) to be so fond of supposedly illuminating anecdotes that the flow of the history he discusses gets lost.However, in this book it works. The history is vivid -- hisportrayal of James I, Charles I, Cromwell, Charles II and JamesII are rich -- and the anecdotes work to illuminate theircharacter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreadable junk","review":"I was his biggest fan. But what happened to the author of Citizens, Landscape and Memory, An Embarrassment of Riches? Apparently he has turned into a lazy, arrogant, and smug hack. This book is horrendous. It is Great Men of History of the crassest order - it's not just that his absurd attempts to rehabilitate Cromwell based on a discredited historian fall flat, it's that he has no time for anyone outside the ruling classes. Worst of all, Schama seems content to have let other people do his research and then take potshots and speculate from the sidelines of his own book. This is trash and a disgrace to a formerly brilliant historian and author."},{"rating":"1","title":"The James Carville of Historians","review":"Schama has never gotten over the fact that England lost America and the British Empire, and that since 1915 Anerica has been financing the British government. Like Carville, Schama makes broad and provocative statements that are not supported by credible evidence. On a recent Bill Moyer's program, he claimed that America had \\"Declared itself to be an empire\\". Apparently, Schama is the only person who witnessed this \\"declaration\\". Maybe he witnessed some UFOs too. In any event, his historical evidence and method is suspect.

Away from home at a convention he has a breakdown and, on his return to New York, he calls his wife from a bar and tells her that if he comes home he'll kill her and their child. As a result of his threats he's commited to Bellevue. This is a great tale of delusion and paranoia, which feels a lot like a cross between One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest and Mad Men. The beginning, in particular, is depressingly wonderful and the book is heartbreaking, simple and raw.

It seems that post- industrial morals and values continue to repress humanity. The 'dreams' we are encouraged to nurture, by society and for Yates I think, Hollywood movies, are impossible and lead only to depression, alcoholism and ultimately insanity.

This story is no exception. The story is told from the main character's point of view, and he takes us along on his journey as he slowly and painfully exits reality to reside inside of his own head. We follow him through a nervous breakdown, a battle with alcoholism, trips to mental health institutions and relationships with the supporting characters that become strained and fractured. One of the things I found most striking about this book is that anyone could be the main character. He's an ordinary man with all the normal stresses that come with life, but he seems to lack the ability to deal with them. This is definitely an interesting read for people who are interested in the field of mental health."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alcoholism at it's finest!","review":"Right off the bat I was engrossed in this book and the storyline. From the first page to the last I was anxious to see what else could possibly take place and how the ending would unfold.

Coming from someone that leads this kind of life, as John Wilder does, the language is a given.As an alcoholic, a cheater and a man with little self esteem due to his height, he dredges thru the trials of life that come so easily with his lifestyle.I got mad and angry at how disrespectful he is with his life, his wife's life, his child's life and those around him.

The physical parts for securing the heads are poor quality materials. In short, the heads do not remain firmly secured to the pliers. You will spend valuable time trying to correct the design and manufacturing flaws and ultimatley realize that there is no way to correct them. I was not using this in a \\"heavy duty\\" aplication and it still failed. I can not recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"First things first, the attachment system for the tips to the handles is flimsy. It allows a lot of sideways movement and does not feel very secure. Secondly, they broke on their very first use. I was using them to install a ~1.5in diameter snap ring around a Ball Joint and the tips just *ping* broke right off.May be useful for smaller Snap Rings of ~1/2in, and for occasional users - but definitely not for any larger rings or someone relying on them regularly."},{"rating":"1","title":"I should have read the reviews","review":"I ordered these just to remove a keeper ring. I should have read the reviews more carefully. These are really weak pliers and would not do the job for me at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"These really are terrible.","review":"I should have known better. These snap ring pliers are terrible quality -- they bend and twist very easily, meaning your snap ring will just pop off, or pop loose suddenly. They are not strong enough to remove the internal snap ring on my standard 3/4\\" Craftsman wrench. It would be totally useless for most automotive use.On the other hand, they cost basically nothing. You get basically nothing, so I guess it's an even trade."},{"rating":"2","title":"barely 4 stars","review":"For the price it's a decent deal. This will work for you if you use it very occasionally, but if you use it often, get something else. The quality is bleh. The plastic case came cracked on delivery. I used this for a HUGE snap ring of which this wasn't really meant to be up to the task. For basic use i'm sure this will be fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst quality: do not buy except for flimsy snap rings","review":"Like Linnea, I had a horrendous experience. On the first try, one of the tips broke off. The package I bought had an additional replacement for the straight ahead application, so I simply replaced it. The same result: on the first try, the tip broke off. I was attempting to remove the snap ring on my bicycle trainer hub, which is apparently equal to an industrial type snap ring. After two of them breaking on each of their first application, its obvious to me that a replacement would not have remedied the situation."},{"rating":"2","title":"My love for the Amish","review":"I love this book,it is my favorite of all the her stories.

The band's sound is equal parts Cheap Trick and T-Rex, and is a much needed throwback to when rock & roll was a lot more fun.Penny Pills is a catchy, melodic, upbeat, and flamboyant rock & roll album, and the work of a band that seems to succeed effortlessly at what the much hyped The Darkness so spectacularly failed to achieve. I wasn't even old enough to pay attention to radio rock in the seventies, but Crash Kelly and bands like American Heartbreak and Sweden's Diamond Dogs makes me feel like I'm reliving the glory days of pure, fun rock & roll. The closing cover of Cheap Trick's ELO Kiddies only reinforces that feeling.Penny Pills will definitely put a smile on the face of anyone who misses the 70's glam and mainstream rock sound, and should please anyone who likes their rock FUN. It's all but guaranteed to have you turning it up and singing along \\"That 70's Show style\\" in no time flat!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I bought this product thinking it was an external hard drive.

So when I ordered this selection I was not disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to scratch","review":"While well produced, I was disappointed in the album - mostly because the majority of the tracks were re-recordings. Frankie Laine still sounds great - but it just wasn't the same.I bought the CD to replace a well worn vinyl album, but on listening to the CD I found the songs to all be slightly (and in a couple of cases very), different in tempo and vocal inflection - it's definitely not the album I've loved for over 30 years! High Noon in particular is quite different, much slower, with vocal emphasis changed. I'll probably listen to the CD from time to time, but not with the same relish that I enjoyed my old LP."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frankie Laine...On the Trail","review":"I love Frankie Laine, but this is not one of his best.

That certainly is the case with the two quartets in this disc. One example of this teamplay is how they negotiate the opening of the \\"Dissonance\\": even in this chaotic piece of music they achieve coherence, which gives it a whole new level of emotional impact. Similar pleasant surprises are to be found in their reading of the \\"Hunt\\". Deutsche Grammophon captures these intense performances on a nicely balanced CD, which keeps the texture from losing its transparency. Some may find the sound to be a little analytical at times, but the quality of the rest more than makes up for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I very much like this CD but with reservations","review":"For a long time, this was my favorite recording of these two terrific Mozart quartets. The Melos Quartet is overall an excellent ensemble and they play here with grace and precision. So in that way I concur with the other reviewers.But in the last couple of years I have become disenchanted with the grating and hazy sound of this CD. If you have an expensive stereo system, the sound quality problems of this release will be a problem, which is a shame. I'll add that I recently got the Belcea Quartet recording of the \\"Dissonant\\" quartet on EMI (with the k. 499 D-major quartet by Mozart) and I find that to be a very natural and flowing performance that I prefer to the Melos' fine interpretation -- and it has much better sonics.

Well, aside from the cheesy opportunism of Disney trying to latch onto the \\"O Brother Where Art Thou\\" bandwagon, I guess this is an okay album. A lot of the more modern, crappy soundtrack themes (\\"You'll Be In My Heart,\\" \\"Circle Of Life,\\" etc.) are included, and an near-equal amount of oldies (\\"Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious,\\" \\"Zip-A-Dee-Doo-Dah,\\" et al) and while there are a couple of instrumentals (giving slight plausibility to the \\"bluegrass\\" claim), for the most part this is a fairly twangless album. I was happy to see the squeeky-voiced hillbilly filly Elizabeth Cook on here, even though her track doesn&#65533;t highlight her strengths that well. Mostly this is pretty iffy.

I was worried about stripping the threads, so I did it bit by bit, crankinng it a bit wider every day or two as the leather stretched. Using a screwdriver or similiar implement in the heel end hook worked well to spin it open. It was easy enough to not use the heel stretcher since I only needed width, not length. I used Feibing's stretch spray on the boots which speeded it up some, but make sure you get this at least a week before you need the shoes. Note it's sold as a single stretcher, so buying two for a pair of shoes is a good idea."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless After Only 2 Pairs of Shoes...","review":"Have had this stretcher for less than 60 days and after stretching only 2 pairs of shoes it is now completely broken beyond use.Threading is stripped and it will no longer screw open OR closed.

I would not purchase this product again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"Disappointed in these characteristics:1) Price for one is similar to others where you get 2.2) Device too narrow so when the screw is turned to widen, it does not stretch enough.3) The internal screw tip that spreads the halves wears in to the wood making it widen even less."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money","review":"This shoe stretcher broke the second time I tried to use it. The screw that widens the two wooden halves of the stretcher to widen your shoes is stripped. You can turn and turn the thing to no avail. I had purchased another shoe stretcher from Foot Smart that I mistakenly loaned out then wasn't able to get back, and that one was far superior to this one.

When I try to get the heel part to stay put it always seems to come lose.I can't tell if it is broken or I am doing something wrong.At $16 something a pop plus shipping it would be better to get a more expensive model that includes two stretchers, instructions and better craftsmanship."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I bought Tamar Myers' book because it was recommended to me first by Amazon.com because of my purchase history and then by the reader reviews.

This medical doctor has no sense of understanding of its real value. Chiropractic is safe, natural and efffective for many aspects of general health. Certainly its value for musculoskeletal injury (neck & back pain) has been well established by the medical and scientific community which has prompted it's coverage by almost all insurance carriers in the USA.

All people have to do is get off there lazy buts and read it. over 300 people a day die from adverse drug reactions and we hardly hear about that. One incident occurs in the media about chiropractic and that streamlines. MD's are SCARED of chiropractors because we offer a way to correct problems instead of covering up symptoms that can only make people worse. This author wanted to make a few bucks and just bad mouth chiropractic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Problems","review":"There are obvious problems with scolarship too deep to even acknowledge. It would take a long time refuting the arguments. Much of its book has already been seriously cast in doubt. To believe in this book is to truly believe in sham 'evidence.'I, in general, agree that Chiropractic needs more regulation of what it CAN and CANNOT do. I do not think it can cure colds or cause miracles. To call it a sham, however, is ridiculous. Still, as long as the reader reads the information critically, the book is not awful: some of its charges are even well founded. It is indeed a great excersise in critical thinking.I would possibly give this book a 2, but the real problem comes with frequent responses from the author that rates his book 5 and proceeds to tell everyone that has given negative views (which is the majority) that they are wrong. The condescending tone is genuinenly insulting. It is also, in my opinion, unprofessional."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why the anger?","review":"I have been a biology major and am planning to attent Palmer Chiropractic next year. I made this decision because I know many M.D.'s as well as D.C.'s. I don't understand why books like this are written. Furthermore, I don't understand why any book would be written trying to insult traditional medicine. People should understand that there is a place for both, just like there is a place for podiatry, dermatology, oncology, and so on. No one can deny that the benefits of chiropractic, when applied to the appropriate ailment, are unparalleled. Books like these are counterproductive and unnecessary."},{"rating":"1","title":"science based evidence","review":"Maybe the author should have done his research before embarking on writing this piece of useless information.

It is a sad attempt by the M.D. to down play chiropractic. Scientific studies have been done and the medical profession has failed to reconginze any of them. The AMA should look at all the deaths cause by the medical profession and not the one stroke caused by the chiropractic profession. Most neck adjustments that cause strokes are performed by DO, MD and PT. Chiropractic works and they do not claim to cure disease like the medical profession. Everyone hase the capablity to heal if the there is no \\"SUBLUXATION\\". Chiropractic does not treat disease/ sickness care, it prevents it.

Tears built up in my eyes from this ill-researched, uneducated, and completely ignorant writting. My heart breaks for those who read this book without knowledge or experience of chiorpractic.

However, rather than allow fear to influence my opinion, I chose to explore the practice. One must ask oneself, \\"Should I doubt because an MD told me to? Or should I see for myself?\\" I have found countless scientific evidence to support chiropractic. I recommend that Chotkowski and Chotkowski re-evaluate their research.

A truly careful Atlas, using the widely available census date from the former Yugoslavia, showing the population of each town and section by group, and showing the exact position of the moving inter-ethnic boundaries during the conflict would be invaluable and is still desperately needed.

It's like one of those \\"full year of curriculum\\" CD Roms only much more educational, less repetitious and way more fun. I've been a subscriber since 1998 and I haven't grown out of it yet.Muse is an infinite source of odd factoids to impress your friends with, as well as explanations for phenomenons you've always wondered about, or used to take for granted. The range of articles is sure to broaden your interests.On the fun side, the comic strip cast of \\"muses\\" keep things light and appealing to all ages.

The author tries to craftily make it look like she is praising the people, while subtlely belittling them. It should be understood that there is much diversity among Mormons as with any large religious group. There were some problems with the author's understanding of Mormon doctrine as well. If you want to learn about the Mormons, learn about them from their scriptures. That will teach you more than these sorts of books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Subtle, but Unconvincing","review":"Far gentler than most attacks on the LDS Church, but still, in its subtle way, an attack. I guess it's an improvement over most of its competition, though.

Even I as a naive 23 year old studying Chinese history back in day at UC Davis I was taken aback by the sugar sweetness dripping from some of the accounts in this book that was REQUIRED READING. No need to add to what is already said in the other reviews, but it is interesting to note that the author, Charles Hinton, was a dyed-in-the-wool Marxist. How much a Marxist?

Such songs have never been my thing, and these are about the worst of the bunch as far as I'm concerned. The highlights of the set are definitely the hip hop songs, but those are also less-than-phenomenal.Even though this set is bargain priced, save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What You Might Think","review":"This disc has nothing whatever to do with Autechre. I bought it yesterday, sound unheard, thinking, at least, that it was a new mix CD. What I got was third rate hip-hop (with the exception of the Public Enemy piece) and fourth rate electronica that, understandably, has been unreleased until now. The pieces on the album have nothing to do with Autechre's style, they're horrible, and there is no effort made at creating a coherent mix. I took it back to the record store demanding my money back (literally claiming fraud), argued with the manager for a little while, and then got him to listen to a bit of a copy of Draft 7.30 that I brought with me followed by any piece he chose on this. I got my exchange.

I would not suggest that anyone buy this in hopes of increasing their ballroom dance music collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stop the cycle","review":"I am on a personal crusade to save dancers and music fans in general from wasting anymore money on this bad, bad CD. Dance Instructors beware! This CD has the tacky music box, canned, elevator loop track sound so common in seemingly bargain dance CDs. Okay. Strict tempo?--this is. Easy to hear the tempo and beat pattern?--Yes. I suppose you might want that for the strictest of dance practice type scenarios (very hard of hearing little old ladies who really want to get it right). I know my students would find this music lackluster and dull, and it would certainly be a bad idea for the energy level of any dance class or dance party. Possibly useful for people having a hard time with finding the count of the various dances included, but generally a very, very poor choice for enjoyment or performance value. This is, however, exacting tempo for American Standard in Ballroom.

Walker forces us -- poetically -- to consider our stance on questions of racism, sexism, love and faith. By doing so she causes us to look at how we align ourselves with friends, lovers and family, and what it means to be part of a \\"community.\\" I read this book the first time 20 years ago and it's themes have stayed fresh for me. A hope-inspiring book, despite the painful issues it addresses. An original novel in all respects."},{"rating":"1","title":"She has done better work","review":"This book is an enjoyable read if you have nothing better to do. I failed to be captivated by it. The characters lack the heartwrenching dramatic intensity that you find in her other works. Maybe it is because Alice Walker is such a phenominal author that people just expect so much from her. Still, this book is NOT making the cut for my personal library."},{"rating":"2","title":"This was an intense, thought-provoking novel.","review":"Walker gives a personal, human side to the Civil Rights activism of the 1960's. Her tales are ones only a participant of the period could relate, and she speaks to a wider audience than just women or African Americans. It delves beyond black and white tv footage of Dr. King and SNCC leaders and let's the readers see inside the minds of those \\"living\\" in that period."},{"rating":"2","title":"this book may be a little too deep for the average reader","review":"the book doesn't move in chronological order, so it's easy to get confused. i couldn't put this book down, i read it in three days. it depicts the struggle of not only black people during the civil rights movement, but the gender struggle of women. this book touches on issues such as spirituality, forgiveness, and truth. through meridian's eyes, we experience some of the hardships she faced."},{"rating":"1","title":"I have to agree with Reviewer no. 10, Jess D., and Jade Patten","review":"\\"Sad valor\\" in someone's eyes? A character who \\"doesn't know exactly what constitutes begging\\"? Come on. And those are just two examples of Walker's writing getting in the way of my enjoying the story. The only parts I liked were when they tried to recruit people to vote; that's where the heart of the story was for me, and that was only a few pages' worth."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Problematic novel","review":"Meridian seems to be a loose collection of events from the life of a female protagonist we can neither admire nor totally despise. The reader is led to believe early-on that the protagonist is a strong civil rights activist whom people admire and celebrate, but her much of her life is spent running from responsibility (i.e. abortions, moving from place to place). Later we become suspicious of the author's motives -perhaps the book was written to elicit sympathy instead of insight. In the end we are left with a novel that is little more than an amateur's manuscript someone was afraid to edit."},{"rating":"1","title":"A boring book that I wish I never had to read.","review":"This book started out slow and didn't get much better as it went on.

I thought this book was very boring with very few interesting parts and I would have never read this book if I had a choise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh my god!","review":"This book is so bad it defies description. The best way to describe it is to call it a fictionalized essay. At no point does Walker give her narrative over to anything like rising action, metaphor, characterization, or a believable narrative voice. Instead, she harps on her themes about the differences between black women and black men, and the solidarity that can be found between all women (oh, and how a womanist consciousness can be achieved by wearing overalls and a man's hat!) What a scream. With absolutely no ear for dialogue, Walker plods on through banal image after banal image until the final scene, which uses a crazy old woman who thinks she's pregnant as comic relief. This book is as bad in its simplistic/political way as her later work is in its spiritual/overheated way. The only currency Walker has anymore is as a public figue, not as a writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice gift box","review":"Bought this for a bracelet I bought which came in a bag.

In it's favor, there are only two attempted rapes and the heroine spends less time unhappy and confused than usual (surprising, given that she has amnesia, but who cares when you're in love?) For better research and more realistic attitudes, try Georgette Heyer. G.H. doesn't do sex though. But if it's sex you want, I have to say that the sex scenes are pretty bland and repetitive in 'Caroline.'"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overpriced at 99 cents","review":"This book is so poorly written as to be laughable. I'm only going to finish it to see how much worse it can get. The author has no sense of historical setting. The actions of the characters have no basis in reality.The heroine suffers a blow to the head, which is hard enough to cause amnesia. However, she doesn't even suffer a headache as a consequence, and manages to ride through the Connecticut wilderness (Connecticut had been settled for over 140 years at the time of the Revolutionary War) for several days. Her rescuer first knows that she is a virginal maiden, then in a flash, over the drinking of a single glass of wine, decides that she is a loose woman or worse, and that he must have sex with her immediately. Then he figures he can just forget about that, and fix her up with an upstanding gentleman in Philadelphia. Confused?

Her warm, adventurous, loving stories matched Rosemary Rogers or Kathleen Woodiwiss in sensuality, but had a wholesome sweetness and zest all their own.This debut novel is really special. Caroline is a golden-haired beauty who awakens one morning in the Connecticut countryside to realize that she has no memory of her past life. Along comes darkly handsome, deliciously commanding Alec Beauvisage, a French born rake who has just finished a very distinguished career in George Washington's Continental Army. With the war over, Alec is ready for a new adventure, and helping a most winsome damsel in distress is just what the doctor ordered!Not only does Caroline recapture her true identity, she also captures the heart of this extraordinary man.

If you're looking for practical household tips, there's nothing beyond the obvious and some tips are very impractical. For example, they advise you to keep candles in the refrigerator so you can find them easily in a power outage. I don't know about you, but in a power outage, the last thing I want to do is open the refrigerator and spoil my food. The book tries to cover everything under the sun and, as a result, isn't really good for anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outdated","review":"This book contains some rather outdated concepts. Such as advising you to store garlic in oil. This has long been warned as dangerous due to potentital food poisoning, yet the book does not include any caution about this practice.

I was also excited to hear that Kelly had chosen, a fun,light, beach-toting PAPERBACK book. (Hardcovers are ridiculously expensive and not worth the monthly commitment)Yes , 'page 166' and the other two 'romps' were well written but what about the remaining 300 pages? I think those pages were written by Judy Blume. \\"Are you there God, it's me Carly?\\"It was hard to truly develop a reader-character relationship with Raina's sons without repeatedly saying to yourself, \\"Aw, COME ON!\\" Come on, who would really believe, without a blink of the eye, without any valid professional back up, that their mother was dying! And a COIN TOSS!? COME ON!To Carly's credit, I did finish the book; it wasn't THAT bad. But you know what they say, 'bad press is better than no press'."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING!","review":"What a disappointment. There are a lot of bad romance novels out there, and this is just another one of them. Dull, predictable, and my personal pet peeve, hinting heavily at sequels. As I understand it, Carly Phillips got this on Kelly Ripa's book list by major publicity campaigning, not because Kelly happened to read it and like it. If you want to read a good, fun romance, look to Nora Roberts, Rachel Gibson, Elaine Fox, Mary Jo Putney, Susan Wiggs, or others, but not Carly Phillips."},{"rating":"1","title":"WRITING SO BAD IT'S UNREADABLE","review":"I LOVE Kelly Ripa. Watch the show every day. Also really like light fiction, romance and sexy novels. Couldn't wait to try this book. The writing is SO atrocious, so banal that I could not read it. Every scene is predictible. Sentence structure is 2nd grade level, writing actually repeats itself from paragraph to paragraph. Two pages of sex doesn't cut it, and even that is poorly written. Kelly, I've lost some respect for you. You ought to fire your research staff and get some college educated people helping you. Sorry folks, I wanted to like this. It's worse than Jacqueline Suzanne."},{"rating":"1","title":"There's much better stuff out there than this","review":"I have to agree with most of the other reviewers, this book is just not that good.

I am a huge fan of contemporary romance and am very forgiving of the genre, but I am pretty embarrassed that I read this whole book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too simplistic and predictable","review":"The Bachelor was a tad trite and not exciting in the least. There are so many romances going on in the book, the story gets a little carried away trying to make everyone find their \\"true love\\" in their own small town.

Roman returns home because his mother is having heart problems. She asks that one of her three-bachelor son find a wife and give her grandchildren soon.

Either of these would be enought to not recommend THE BACHELOR, but the combination of the two, plus the hype, have prompted me to write my first ever online review.

I am looking forward to reading the other books in this series(The Playboy and The Heartbreaker)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never quite makes it","review":"The love story between Charlotte and Roman is interesting, even touching at times. But the selfish motivation of several of the characters, including the leads, is off-putting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grimacing still","review":"I wanted to like it, truly I did. But it was such a mesh of unbelivability. Let's see, Charlotte poses for him in near nothing after 10 years of absence; her pathetic excuse for a mother is quickly forgiven all, as is her father, for years of selfish emotional abuse; they are both mature adults yet know after one night of sex that they can never live without the other; it was so pathetic and horrible. I just kept grimacing at the whole thing. Gave it two instead of zero stars simply because Carly phillips herself is the author."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Winter Read!","review":"I got this book as a gift and I finished it in one sitting!

Some books are just meant for pure fun and this is really one of those books!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So Unrealistic","review":"This book was so boring I could not get past the second chapter. It is so unrealistic to believe that a mother would trick her son's into thinking that she is dying.

Don't bother with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Bachelor","review":"I found this book hard to finish. It was boring and silly at times.

There is only so much I can suspend belief about. These people all need to move as far away from one another as possible.I can say without a doubt that Carly Phillips should find another occupation. Maybe the GAP or something. Or maybe I should become a writer because apparently they're just handing out publishing contracts to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the hype","review":"I had heard a lot of good things about this book, so I broke down and bought it, hoping for a sexy, saucy read. Instead it was...boring. It was really boring! First, the plot was unbelievable. Some old transient goes around stealing knitted panties (knitted panties?!) hoping to raise sales at Charlotte's Attic. Charlotte is the heroine of the novel and the panty knitter. Charlotte is a big yawn. Her \\"hero,\\" Roman, is flat, boring (there's that word again!) and totally undeveloped. If this is the best Kelly Ripa can choose for her book club, you can bet I will not be reading another of her picks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Put A Smile On My Face","review":"I have to say for a \\"Summer\\" read this was an enjoyable book. The premise is about three bachelor brothers. This particular book focuses on Roman. Their busy body, but good natured mother, is ready for them to settle down, get married and give her a grandchild. She fakes heart trouble to get them to feel her days are numbered.The book is written in such an uplifting fun manner. Even though there is some deception is the book it is done in a manner that doesn't hurt anyone. There is sex in this book but it's not overly explicit.There is also a \\"panty thief\\" sago that is entertaining even if it is pretty obvious who is doing it.I would recommend this book to anyone who wants a quick, romantic enjoyable read.I'm looking forward to reading the next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Star","review":"THE BACHELOR is so bad I stopped reading it half-way through.

This is one of the first contemporary novels I've read (I'm more of a historical romance person). This was a fun read. Nothing earth-shattering or profound. It's a cute story about a mother and her three grown sons. Mom wants all three sons to get married, settle down, and give her grandchildren. However, she has to feign an illness just to get the ball rolling with her three sons who have no interest in getting married at all. \\"The Bachelor\\" starts with the youngest named Roman. The second is, \\"The Playboy\\" the middle son, Rick, and ends with \\"The Heartbreaker\\" the oldest son, Chase. I am currently reading \\"The Playboy\\". So far so good. In conclusion, \\"The Bachelor\\" is a four stars. Only because there are some parts in the story that makes you want to roll your eyes...haa! haa!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Glad I didn't pay for this!","review":"I borrowed this out of a \\"book swap\\" box at my work. I am so glad that I did not pay for this book as it was totally predictable, cheesy and repetitive. I have always wanted to write my own novel, but have been intimidated to start the project.

Besides over-idealizing Talleyrand (perhaps to serve the author's own obvious political biases made clear in the Foreword), the book has many gross historical errors of fact that I wouldn't tolerate in a sophomore term paper - and that could have been avoided simply by careful fact-checking. P. just doesn't seem to take history seriously. (The list of reference sources at the end has many more items on antiques, fashion, and architecture than on political or diplomatic history.) As for the writing, some of it is on the level of a teen-age romantic novel, and elsewhere it changes to an ordinary historical narrative - so it's not always clear just what authorial voice one is hearing. This is very sloppy history indeed - the author should stick with Tom Clancy. (I'm a professor of history in Portland, Oregon.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Kissinger?

Like comics and graphic novels worldwide, the books have been attacked by the shrinkers, who apparently believe we don't care what size the images are in, so long as we can read the text. This is a real shame, as it is the compelling large-format incredibly and accurately detailed images that made the Tintin stories so fun to read to begin with.All that being said, you'll enjoy this nostalgia trip down memory lane.

Tintin is adventurous, smart and a good example to my kid."},{"rating":"2","title":"1956-1960","review":"Comic #6 of \\"The Adventures of Tintin\\" 3-in-1s has \\"The Calculus Affair\\" (1956), \\"The Red Sea Sharks\\" (1958) and \\"Tintin and Tibet\\" (1960). There's some fine stuff here, but it's not my favorite time in the series. Tough times for Herge too.\\"The Calculus Affair\\" features a new invention and a kidnapping, set in Switzerland and \\"Borduria\\". From me, 3 stars.\\"Red Sea Sharks\\" is set in the Middle East, and features Abdullah. From me, 4 stars.\\"Tintin in Tibet\\" is pretty famous in the series, and sees Tintin go out to find his old friend Chang, stranded in the Himalayas. From me, 5 stars.Kind of like his later stuff a bit better. Worth a look for fans though."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for your home library","review":"The product is packaged in a compact and convenient size. 3 books in 1 (and at a very good value) is a big advantage for ardent Tintin fans. I am very happy with the purchase & would strongly recommend the product (and others in the same series) for the all the Tintin fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"I've always been a Tintin fan, and wanted to buy a book for my son. However the format of this book was disappointing, as the original (single) story books were more like A4. The book (with three stories in one) is just too small. It's not the fact that there are three stories all in one volume, it's simply the size of the book. Why was it changed? If you're thinking of buying one of these ... check the measurements! The're not the same size as the originals."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good things in small packages, NOT!","review":"This is not a review of the content - Tin Tin will always have a special place in my life for helping to inspire an avid interest in other cultures and world travel. I bought this book to hope to do the same with my son.The book's presentation is awful. The book is nearly half the size of the original (a 46% reduction to be precise). The images are small and the text is tiny. Reading it together is a trying experience - even with my son sitting on my lap, to position the book where we can both see it and still be able to read the dialogue is next to impossible.Others have had similar complaints, though I unfortunately did not read them before purchase. I'll not be buying another book in this series. My next purchase will either be the originals from eBay or something in a digital format."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too small","review":"My wife became a life-long Tintin fan 30-odd years ago when my son was growing up. When I saw this 3 for 1 book advertised, I thought it would make a nice Christmas gift for her. As others have stated, the print and pictures are much too small to enjoy compared to the originals. Granted, Amazon specifies the book size, but who checks that? I just mailed it back for a refund."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glad to See Tintin again","review":"I grew up reading The Adventures of Tintin and recently purchased this volume for a young cousin in an effort to turn him on to these great stories. I like the new hard cover 3 story format as my old paperback copies have begun to come apart, from repeated reading of course. One thing that I noticed is that unlike the original versions which each had exactly 62 pages, the new format has not preserved this... now I know that's a little nerotic but that's something I always remembered from reading them as a young boy, the fact that each was exactly 62 pages. Herge is a very talented artist and story teller, I would recommend the complete collection to anyone who is looking for a quality adventure story!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Tintin","review":"I grew up reading Tintin and my son is doing the same now.

But now as I have gotten older and more mature I have engrossed myself in more exciting books with more complex plot structures. They are an excellent way to start children off reading, but I hope that, like me, they recognise when Tintin becomes too childish a book with a fairly boing plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't Work for our purpose","review":"Bought this for my sister who has lower back issues. Even though she's pretty small, it wasn't long enough to reach her lower back. This is designed for someone who wants to use it on their mid to upper back. She also found the ridges on it to be uncomfortable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough stuffing","review":"I was pretty disappointed with this product. For one thing, they didn't put enough herbal stuffing in it. It seemed to be only about half full. Secondly, what little there was all fell to the bottom when placed around the shoulders, which kind of defeats the whole purpose. I sent it back.As an aside, I was quite impressed with how easy Amazon's return process is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Fallout Game.","review":"This game is under rated.

I'm a huge Fallout gan and this is a very good game I'd recomend it to new Fallout gamers and huge Fallout fans alike."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rude, crude... I loved it!","review":"I had a lot of fun playing this game. It's in the spirit of the original fallout, and on the same engine as Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance, but it had way more story to it. There's a bit more as far as character interaction, and a ton of vulgarity and tasteless humor. The game also seems to be a bit longer than BG:DA. If you like campy sci-fi and enjoyed either the original Fallout games or BG:DA, you'll like this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid it.","review":"Not fallout. Not fun. You want it, I'll give it to you. Never mind I have a conscious. If your looking for that old Fallout click and fun thing, it's gone. Different sequences for your hero's path is not in here. Visiting towns... it sucks! It's Gauntlet in Fallout world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for outdoor events!","review":"I bought 2 of these to use at my wedding reception, and they worked perfectly. Just a little ribbon added to the handles and a bunch of ice, and we had a great way to serve cold drinks. The weathered appearance was perfect.

Something is not quite right about the metal. It looks more like it was painted with metallic paint than galvanized metal! Looks cheap and it wobbles.

If you are looking for a NICE, good quality beverage tub.... steer clear."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gentle Humor","review":"It's been ages since I've read such a well-written, humorous yetdeeply felt novel. Here's a high school teacher who's wise and caring, a part of his North Carolina rural community without beingcondescending toward his less educated neighbors. The funny scenesrise naturally and easily from the main plot during this one day.The satirical and serious sections likewise flow smoothly as theday's action moves on. Chappell's novel also makes a wonderfulgift for those who tire of depressing or violent stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"from the bottom-up","review":"Having read the other reviews, it is evident that the main argument against reading this book is that it reduces today's complex problems into an interpersonal issue that is \\"too simplistic\\".I don't deny that our problems as people and as societies are complex, but I do not think that such complexities are enough to dismiss the interpersonal elements that form our social foundations, even if they seem relatively insignificant. I find that akin to telling a person that \\"they don't matter\\", that any one person is incapable of forming change.This is a book. Any copy of the book is designed for one reader at a time. So it is supposed to hit the reader as a person, in a grass-roots sense. I found that it was a good explanation when I observed my own behaviors and manner of thinking. I'm a young adult; and I would much rather help myself, my family, and my community from the bottom-up than the top-down.I think this book greatly reinforced that attitude."},{"rating":"2","title":"WONDERFUL!!!

The tone was preachy and irritating to read...and no, I don't have PMS right now.

If you watch her show on TV, you'll notice how she is very, very straightforward with her advice, there is no gentle approach, and that is as it should be when it comes to handling money. This book is the same, yes, at times there are repetitions, but in each book you get something different. In this book, Suze helps women understand money, and provides a 5 months plan to save, with an incentive at the end of it. I used to be a spendthrift but have really managed to cut back on my spending, a lot! Books like Suze Orman's are very helpful to those of us who find it a struggle to retrieve our power over money, and control our spending, instead of the other way around.

She had some good points, however, her information about stocks was not what I expected. She is not as savy on this issue as she could be with more education. Her code in the book for her web site is okay but, her web site I felt was not user friendly.However, This book could be of interest to younger women, just starting out building their finances.After having read the book, and scanning it, I've not looked at it again.One other item, the incentive for collecting $100 from an investment company of Suze's choice, did not excite me.This is just my opinion on the book; someone else may not agree, that's fine. We are all intitled to our opinions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best I've read","review":"I love Suze Orman and as a 26 year old woman I was more that excited about learning how to control my own destiny by learning all I could about my money. The problem....I would like to enjoy it before I retire. Suze should change all the names of her books to. \\" Suffer now, Retire rich part 1, 2, 3 and 4\\" because that's the philosphy of her books.

This book is okay, but if you have read her other stuff, then information in this book is nothing new. Sorry Suze, but I know you need to keep making the money.I would also like to comment on the fact that the paperback edition and the electronic edition are the same price. Suze, you may want to talk to your publishers Cindy Spiegel and Julie Grau about this one. I won't be purchasing \\"The Money Class\\" until the prices comes down, if ever. Or, if it is free at the library....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful information","review":"I have always liked Suze and she has helped me get my first home a while ago with her wisdom. I just had a child and I wanted to look into making sure my son is taken care of financially in case something happens. I also am looking into helping with tuition cost of college. This book helped me with both. She explains the wills and trusts step by step. Suze is easy to understand and even learned some useful things on home insurance. There are some good websites that she cites in her book. The beginning of the book was too basic for me. Overall, a good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Advice","review":"I have read several of Suze's books and they all have excellent advice.

It's clear what needs to be done and it feels really nice to be checking the items off that list!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous!","review":"This book is just what I needed to get started. My uncle had signed me up for Kiplinger's magazine, but I just had no idea how to make sense of the magazine or doing anything based upon it. There were lots of odd terms in it and I didn't understand what anything meant. Suze's book is just the opposite. It taught me everything I needed to know about how to actually START, which is so important. I have found that the practical STARTing information is not so readily available on other money books. The text is also simple to read. Wonderful. And to the poster who suggested that this book is for the above average person, I heartily disagree. I do not have much money at all but have found the book useful. Indeed, Suze actually emphasizes building your emergency fund at the same time as you are building your retirement fund, so that you will not devote all your money to retirement and then end up with a toothbill you cannot pay. The book is great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great resource!","review":"I purchased the audio book, which I was able to get through in about a week during my lengthy commute to work each day.

So, I would recommend just purchasing the hardback so you don't end up spending double, like I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a horrible book - Save your money!","review":"I could not be more disappointed with Suze Orman's latest book. I loved the Young, Fabulous and Broke and eagerly awaited Women and Money. It is such a joke. The first 1/4 of the book is basically Suze telling us in her psychoanalytic persona how wonderful and powerful women are and how we can really get ahead finally. I don't need 1/4 of her book telling me I'm good enough - enough Stuart Smalley. Just give me the real financial details.And what really makes me mad- throughout the book (which is very very basic), she tells us to reference her website for additional info. Uh, hello? I just paid for a book and all I get is the very basic info on Roth IRA and Roth 401Ks? Not once does she say whether we can have a Roth IRA and a Roth 401K in the same year. Maybe if I go to her website, I can find out. What a joke.I would not wish this book on anyone. I think Suze should refund the money to those who purchased her book.

This is a really good book for women who want to invest but don't know where to begin. The Ameritrade offer is a real plus, and, I did, in fact, take up the offer and start a small account with them--only $50 per month--but's that's a start, and it's easy. I have them deduct $50 per month directly from my checking and place it in savings--painless and easy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wholistic financial advice and realistic goals","review":"There are two things I like most about Suze Orman and this book.

Personally I'm a saver and have been investing in both stocks and mutual funds for 10 years or so. I also a regular subscriber of Money magazine. Still I learn something new (or two or three) from the book. To me the chapter on will & trust and insurance alone is worth the cost of the book. The chapters where she covers debts, bank accounts might be a bore to some people, but you can skip or just scan through them. However, in those chapters you'll still find valuable resources.So as I said even though you might think you know pretty much already--if you read it with an open mind, I'm sure the book can give you some new and valuable info.Highly recommended!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Women & Money","review":"This is a self help book that I am actually reading all of and making true effort to put some of Suze's suggestions to use.

The Fat Director/Fat Controller has been replaced by 'Sir Toppam Hat' and the trucks are now freight cars.If you are looking for 'Thomas & Friends' stories, then this will probably be fine for you, but if you wanted to read to your children the stories that Rev.

The book came damaged. The last 10 pages were not sewn in so I returned it and asked for a replacement. The second came in the same condition. I sent it back and asked for a replacement. I later found out that Amazon will not replace a book a third time so we never got the book. Not a very pleasant experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fabulous keepsake for children!","review":"My four year old son is an avid Thomas and friends fan, complete with the videos, take along trains, train sets, etc. He loved this book and we read 2-3 stories every night until we finished it. He carried it around and would sit and pretend to read to himself, looking at the pictures. It was a great introduction for him to chapter type books, and has sparked an even more avid interest in books and reading than he had before. This book has already suffered some wear, but was well worth it and will be a treasured keepsake for a long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can The Railway Series Get Some Respect?","review":"A nice idea, putting a bunch of the Railway stories into a single volume. But in order to do this, they have to shrink, crop, zoom and slice up all the great illustrations, which I find to be much of the appeal of these books. The stories are charming but, let's face it - the writing has always been more or less serviceable, and the illustrations really help to make the characters pop. It's not difficult to track down the individual books in this series, with full-sized images, on the cheap. It would be nice if the publisher made it easier by keeping them all in print, but I think they enjoy pushing the newer books that are more closely tied to the TV series and toy line.It's worth noting that the text is changed ever-so-slightly too, mostly for political correctness and consistency with the show."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thomas the Tank Engine Story Collection (The Railway Series)","review":"As with all Thomas stories, these stories are very captive and my 3 year old son love's all of them. However, the book quality is so poor, that I cannot recommend this for anyone. The book was a Christmas present and by day 3, the pages started to separate from the binding. This book has quickly fallen apart and now we will have to throw it away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't buy this if you don't want to read to your child constantly!","review":"I bought this for my nephew's 5th birthday, however my 3 year old son wanted it keep it so badly that I ended up getting him a copy too. Both boys absolutely love this book. It's a really nice hardcover book with a ribbon bookmark. The kind of book they will be able to read to their own children one day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the original text!","review":"This book is handsomely produced, and the illustrations are lovely. But the text seems to have been altered from the original. In Rev. Awdry's original books, wasn't Sir Topham Hatt referred to as \\"the Fat Director,\\" and, after the railway is nationalized, \\"the Fat Controller\\"? But in this book, he's Sir Topham Hatt from the beginning. This might not bother most people, but I think the book ought to come with a warning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be wary","review":"My nephew loves Thomas the Train and I thought this would be a great gift. While the stories and pictures are great, I was surprised to see pages start falling out after opening it read some of the stories to my nephew.

We prefer Thomas' Big Storybook because the pictures are much larger, and help tell the stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of stories but....","review":"My child loved the Thomas line but we started noticing that there was a lot of crashing and bashing and anger between the engines so we stopped reading this book as well as tried steering him away from all things Thomas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"This book is collecting dust on our bookshelf.

Luckily the game has only six levels, so the pain will soon go away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good introductory book","review":"It is an introductory book on QFT. If you have no experience in QFT, it gives you much with easy reading. The way to indroduce a subject is as easy as one in Quamtum Mechanics. You can understand the book if you have fully know nonrelativsitic QM. The demerit of the book is to have no exercise problems. So you have to read other books to supplement your study on QFT."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dr.Benjamin Hobhouse","review":"This is a book which simplifies QFT in a way not suitable for learning the real principles and theoretical foundations of QFT. It uses the synthetic path integral approach only, whilst the canonical approach is more appropiate to understand the foundations of QFT. For this, it is not enough to know how to write down the path integral and calculate scattering amplitudes only. It is good for an experimentalist, who wants to apply the theory of QFT to his measurments and vice versa. Who wants only to have a glance at QFT (including recent developemants) without being too superficial, the book of Michele Maggiore or the book of Thomas Banks are more useful, exactly because they present both approaches. For a major in QFT the book of George Sterman can be recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent pedagogical suplement","review":"You wouldn't want to rely on this as your only source for QFT, but it provides a really nice, easy to read, supplemental point of view to other more computation-oriented texts. Ryder's use of geometry and topology is also refreshing in shedding light on gauge theories and symmetry breaking. The chapters on Renormalization are less useful, however."},{"rating":"2","title":"Basic notion of Quantum Field Theory","review":"This is an ideal one for a new comer in the science of Quantum Field Theory. It discusses the transition of Quantum Mechanics to Quantum Theory in great detail. The book teaches Path Integral Formalism and also throws light on Modern concepts Ghost Fields etc. The book also explores the concept of function and functional. Obvoiusly it does not go to discuss Functional in such a detail as that of the book on QFT by P Ramond. The book also throws light on Gauge Field Theory, Symmetry Breaking and Electroweak Interaction. Altogether the book is one of the best 'buy's for a Graduate Student in Physics. Personally I have been refering this book right since Graduate days till today for last tweleve years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just use your money on the actual album if u liked it....","review":"If liked their song \\"Right Now\\" then you should also try out Blink 182 or The Offspring."},{"rating":"1","title":"wha happened?","review":"overall a good book. it makes you think. but its clear the authors are more objective than the editor, who seems to have a real axe to grind like the bible is secondard to her feminist podium. that's tiresome. also never heard of her. is she a scholar who doesnt publish or jsut waiting for the next feminist fad to happen? the quality is uneven i suspect it's a collection of her friends only. the carole meyers book on women in ancient israel is far superior and not ideologically angry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jacquard???","review":"Comforter is a bit small for a queen sized bed; could slide off. The bedskirt also appears to be too small. I put them on a full size mattress, and find they fit right. The shams fit a regular sized pillow.Workmanship appears good. It is attractive. But nothing too fancy here.My main gripe is that this has never been within 100 miles of a Jacquard loom. Here's the M Webster definition:jacquard weave: an intricate variegated weave made on a jacquard loom and used for brocade, tapestry, and damaskThis fabric is strictly print. It is a high-resolution print, but still a print.A true jacquard might justify the otherwise laughable \\"list price.\\" As a print, this stuff is worth about 1/5th the list price, counting the little pillows and stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jacquard Comforter Set","review":"7 pc Jacquard comforter set was an excellent buy, the price alone was enough to sway me to buy this.

I would recommend this product to everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lack of Steering Wheel Support A Huge Disappointment!","review":"I'm a native of Indianapolis and am a fan of Indianapolis Motor Speedway (IMS) and like PS2 racing games. I enjoy racing around IMS in my PS2 Nascar Thunder and Formula 1 games, so I was very excited about IndyCar Series when it came out and I could race the 230+ MPH vehicles I watched many times in person over the years on the track that I know so well.But, as other reviewers have noted, there is no steering wheel support for this game (I have the Logitech wheel, which is essentailly the standard for PS2), but I don't think that you would know that from the information on the box for the game. I can imagine the look on my face when I plugged in my wheel and... nothing.The game plays OK with the standard controller and the graphics and sound are decent, but it just isn't the same as driving with a well-calibrated wheel in your hand. I'll make sure I research my next racing-related product first."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Wheel, No Fun","review":"Unless someone can figure out a way to use a PS2 steering wheel with this game, I would NOT recommend it at all. The graphics are ok (6 on a scale of 1 to 10), but without the use of a steering wheel this game is useless. You'd be better off playing F1 2002. The graphics are much better and you can use a steering wheel."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Complete Failure...","review":"DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!! You cannot use the Logitech steering wheel on this game. Why? I have absolutely no idea, but to me, it makes the game worthless. I own many racing games (Gran Turismo, Pro Race Driver, Formula One, etc.) and they ALL support the steering wheel. Why Codemasters would go through all the trouble to develop and market this game to people interested in racing and driving, but not have it support a steering wheel is beyond me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Blues CD!","review":"I was at a Jimmy Thackery show recently in Louisville KY. and in between sets the sound man starts spinning a disc that I had never heard. I set there casually listening to the disc and after a few minutes I found myself listening to it hard. I asked the sound man who he was playing and that I really liked it a lot. It was this disc. I came home and immediatly bought the last copy Amazon had. Denny's playing and guitar tone are awesome on this disc as well as his vocals. There is not a bad song on this disc. \\"Lovin' Like Blues\\" is my personal favorite. It is a bit hard to find but well worth the search, you may have to go to his web site to get it.

Highly highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bravo! You'll never hear these great pieces played better!","review":"If you've never bought any Pollini recordings before, this is a good one to start with. The performances are so totally perfected -- beautifully expressive, subtle and refined. The Berceuse and Barcarolle are among the most beautiful classical recordings I have ever heard. If you like this one, try the Beethoven Concertos collection that includes the \\"Choral Fantasy,\\" or the Beethoven Sonatas collection containing \\"The Tempest,\\" \\"Walstein,\\" and \\"Les Adieux.\\" Pollini is truly a modern day master."},{"rating":"2","title":"just what the teacher ordered!","review":"My son's percussion teacher asked us to order these for orchestral work, but it wasn't easy to find them in any of the typical music stores or sites.

The title: Best hikes with dogs:Arizona sounded like a must have book, and I haven't been displeased, the book appears to be pretty acurate on park admission fees, has good advice on hiking with dogs, and I find the \\"Hike Summary Table\\" not only very handy and useful, but an almost necessary piece of information, it tells you things like; easy on paws, 4 miles or less, unleashed okay, forested trail for much of the hike, good for senior dogs, best for well coordinated dogs,etc.The only negative for the book is that it doesn't have very many Dog Hikes in the West Valley where we are located. Maybe that'll be in the next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Hikes with your dogs in AZ","review":"As the owner of Doggie Doo Adventures, offering doggie hikes, this book is perfect for our field trips.

While we obviously haven't had a chance to use the guide yet, I did compare it against some Grand Canyon hikes we did a few years ago and against some other books I've picked up.Directions to trailheads is very clear.Information on trails is well-presented, giving more than enough information to decide if the trail is appropriate for you and your pet.Trails directions are well-written and seem easy to follow.I can't see any negatives to this book so far. It has already been a great help in deciding where to hike."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review of Kindle Sample of this book","review":"This may be a good and useful book but from the sample downloaded to the kindle it does not appear that any thought was taken to make it useable on the Kindle. The graphs and maps are miniscule and cannot be enlarged (as far as I can tell). There are some photos in the sample which may have been interesting if they were enlarged to fill the entire screen; as it is they are too small. Sections on 'how' to hike with your dog are included but NOT one section about an actual hiking route is available in the sample. Considering that the charts and maps are too small to read and that there's no way to tell how each individual trail is written up it appears that there is no way to tell if the 'kindle edition' of this book would have any use as a guide to hiking trails for dogs."},{"rating":"1","title":"It may say 100 Watts...","review":"...but don't believe it!

Clearly, there was supposed to be more content on the reverse side, but this disc has no reverse side. The film is supposed to run 146 minutes, so it comes up 34 minutes short. A real disappointment.

It is NOT John at his finest, nor his worst, there is no way you can rate his voice, his feelings or emotions, this is a total insult to those of us who followed this lovely man from early on. I'm sure he would NEVER have allowed this to be released. He certainly gave 100% of himself to his craft, and causes. I know his early works, and the latest. His voice became stronger, his concerts, though few and far between in later days were better than ever. Each song in this release deserves better than an under water sound, quality is what he deserves and truly the best we can lay tribute to. I have EVERY piece he released, though much repeat, when he grew his music grew with him, this for me is such a slap in the face. \\"Im Sorry\\" is all I can say."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing for Denver Fan","review":"Although I am a huge John Denver fan, I was very disappointed by this CD.

This one, despite the connection to EMI-Capitol, is no exception. It was recorded at 16th Avenue Sound in Nashville the year before his untimely death on October 12, 1997 at age 53 in an airplane accident.So, don't expect to hear Placido Domingo on the 1982 hit Perhaps Love (or even the John Denver solo version from his 1982 LP Seasons Of The Heart), or Sylvie Vartan on the 1984 hit Love Again. Nor do Fat City (Bill Danoff and Terry Nivert) of The Starland Express Band back him on Take Me Home Country Roads.Not horrible recordings by any means - but these types of CDs need to be better advertised as re-makes, especially if ordering on-line as there you never get to see the \\"fine print.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"An older John Denver","review":"An older John Denver is not necessarily a lesser John Denver. If you grew up listening to his music, then his voice will sound slightly different. What you hear is a more mature John Denver as this was recorded in the mid-1990s (produced in September 1996).This is just the music. The sleeve for the CD just has the cover art; there are no lyrics, pictures, or notes to read or reminisce over. I wish that had been included given his death.\\"Rocky Mountain High,\\" \\"Sunshine on my Shoulders,\\" \\"Thank God I'm a Country Boy,\\" \\"Annie's Song (You Fill up My Senses),\\" \\"Take Me Home, Country Roads,\\" \\"Windsong,\\" and \\"Leaving on a Jet Plane\\" are all part of this collection.

I chose these shoes with the adage \\"You get what you pay for\\" in mind.They look quite good in the photos here, but the pair I received were not as well finished as I had expected. The joint between uppers and soles is unsightly and poorly finished. The uppers are apparently made from different grades of leather, with the right shoe being obviously rougher in texture than the left. I have managed to reduce this to some extent by regular polishing, but have clearly wasted my time and effort, because I noticed today that the left shoe's sole has split in two, right across the widest part. Not cracked, but broken completely through to the insole.I started wearing these shoes on March 2nd and today is June 11th. That's fourteen weeks at five days per week, seventy days.97 dollars worth?

This original music doesn't have the melody, it is meant to to be played and sung at the same time. It's only slightly more difficult, so I recommend getting A Rush of Blood to the Head instead of this \\"Easy\\" piano book. It's more enjoyable to play and sounds better too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not original arangements or really even close","review":"I'm surprised that none of the other reviews mentioned the fact that these \\"arrangements\\" are very different from the originals. The melody (vocals) is in the right-hand treble clef and simple base notes in the left. These are not really the chords that are played by the band, and it is virtually impossible to sing along with what is written, unless you like singing exactly the same thing your right hand is playing. And there's not enough of a chord in the left hand to fill it out if you just drop the right and sing it. I'm fairly disappointed in this. Maybe if all you're looking for is a similar sounding arrangement and don't plan to sing, then this may be the book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Easy","review":"I don't have a lot of piano experience, however, I could play easily with this book.

It did not fail in living up to all the stereotypical shortcomings of Chinese-made. The hardware was flimsy and in the one delivered to me there was an assembly mistake which led to a failure in its structure. One of the steps actually sagged from the detached metal subassembly. The wood is not a Mahogany that I've ever seen. Even the poorly applied stain (dark brown) belies its \\"mahogany\\" description. Most of it is held together by gusset plating; not the most desirable for many reasons.

It was cracked so bad in the center of the top beam that I could actually see through the crack! It was also cracked on the right and left side of the top handle. There was no padding inside the box, so that explains it. I ordered this for Christmas for my very short mother to use in her kitchen and I was so excited to find a stepladder for her kitchen that wasn't metal. Besides the cracks, the product just looks cheaply made. Through the cracks I could see that the wood isn't solid -- it's particle.

What a disappointment!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice product....but some words of caution","review":"Heavy-duty construction makes it feel very stable. I'm using this in a work setting so it has to be safe. A few words of caution: when opening the stool, make sure it latches completely (you will hear it snap into place); otherwise, it might not be secure; when unlatching it, you have to push hard IN on the handle. Some other reviewers commented on its heavy weight: I'm a wimp and it was easy for me to lift! It folds up very nicely for storage. Great price, especially free shipping for something that weighs so much; it also arrived 2 DAYS after I ordered it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"Right out of the box, the stool we received had a large gouge out of the wood on the lower step.

It matches my dark wood furniture nicely."},{"rating":"2","title":"very stable, heavy duty","review":"This step stool works very well. It's very sturdy and doesn't wobble or shake at all when I am standing on the top step. I weigh 204 lbs. It is easy to unfold. The top step snaps into a locked position so that the stool doesn't shift while it is being used. The lever to unlock the top step is easy to manipulate assuming that it is pressed in the correct direction. The correct direction to press the unlocking lever is in, towards the middle of the stool, not down towards the floor. The stool weighs 15 lbs according to my bathroom scale. It's fine for my wife but the weight and bulky size is a bit too much for my youngest kids.Dimensions: When folded for storing, the stool is 35 1/2 inches tall and 2 1/2 inches thick. The width is 18 1/8 inches. When unfolded for use, the bottom step is 9 inches above the floor and the top step is 18 inches above the floor. It is 32 1/2 inches tall when unfolded for use.

We just had cabinets installed to the ceiling (I wanted more storage), so I wanted a nice-looking ladder that I could keep in my kitchen. This is perfect. It DOES easily fold. I'm not sure what the problem is for the other reviewers, but there is a little wood piece that sticks out of the top rung. If you push it in toward the rung, the ladder folds very easily.

The bad part is that when the ladder is set up and unfolded, the stickers on the underside are visible through the slats on the steps. It looks more like a step stool that should be in a garage than my new kitchen. I spent two hors pealing, applying Goof off and then staining the underside to make this ladder work.It is sturdy, but had I know the amount of work required to remove all those stickers, I would have not bought it.The manufacturers sure did try to cover all their legal bases on this small step stool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Looking Step Stool","review":"I am very pleased with this step stool and find it the best option out there for visual appeal.

It's not one of those albums based on like 2 songs and a bunch of fillers, though. Nope. Part of what makes it an incredible CD is that it's one of the few nowdays that sortave flows, portrays a musical story (not in lyrics, but... it's not a random jumble of songs, and it's not one big song split into different parts) that grips you in the first 5 seconds and has you begging for more in the last few.

I got this CD almost 10 years ago, and it wasn't until I heard other pianists play it that I realized how amazing Firkunsy is in dynamic and interpretation.In the Piano Concerto there are little details like the trills in the 3rd movement that are spot on. It's hard to describe in this review without listening to it first.Essentially, if you're a lover of Classical music or have a major appreciation for Mozart, this is completely a MUST have.For those who are not as enthusiastic, this is a gem of an album which is hard to find but worth the purchase as it's perfect for studying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tear-jerker","review":"Jane Goodall is my hero, and the inspiration I gather from her gives my life so much purpose and hope.

Written with some of the same stories seen in other of her books, Reason for Hope does its best to put together the scientist and the magnificent human being into one highly inspirational and motivational compendium that is sure to make you reflect upon humanity and how we can make a difference.The first part of the book repeats many of her life accounts and experiences, and the latter part is at times, quite depressing as she explores the dark aspects of humanity. But then, Goodall's intelligence is a strong stimulating force to make this a great book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"cool","review":"I loved this book. I loved it because it explained what she did and her views on what she did or why she should. I learned so much from this book. She brings up thoughts that have been argued for the longest time and seems to come up with the perfect answer. It really gets you thinking about the way you have lived your life. I also love her describtions of her adventures. They are so action packed. When she starts talking about what she saw, what she did, you feel like you are with her. The book is written in a way that you feel as if she were speaking to you and not like a big school lecture. I think it is wonderful for all ages.

If it weren't for my book club choosing this, I would have quit mid-way. Ms. Goodall apparently has absolutely no sense of humor and takes herself way too seriously (even comparing herself to Saint Paul). Her beliefs are described in banal anecdotal lists (humans are cruel--Hitler, etc. but also good--Mother Theresa, etc.) with nothing new or intellectually stimulating to think about and no scientific evidence or research data provided to support her arguments.

It's a bit difficult to read if you are, as I was then, entirely unfamiliar with the history of the Church and with Orthodox theology and terminology. But, now that I'm much more familiar with those, I have to say that this book is amazing. I think that everyone who converts to Orthodoxy should do what I did. Read it as one of the first books you read when becoming Orthodox and after living the Orthodox life for a few years read it again. It is without doubt the best book on Orthodox spirituality and theology in the English language -- the classic and the standard."},{"rating":"2","title":"A \\"Must Read\\" for Spirit-filled Christians","review":"This book is a classic in Eastern Orthodox theology which has been reviewed in detail elsewhere since it's publication in English in 1957. The only thing that I would add is that I believe this book is absolutely essential for Pentecostal/Charismatic Christians. Western Latin theology is inadequate in the light of a church operating in the praxis of the grace and gifts of the Holy Spirit.

This clogged minutes after I started using it. I am going to return it tomorrow, clog and all back to the store I bought it from. I will agree with a previous reviewer that the point where the hose connects to the canister is a significant defect as it makes it difficult for larger items to enter. However, if you are looking for a mini-vac for small jobs, like cleaning your car, I can see where this may come in handy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could be a lot better.","review":"The suction on this little shop vac is not very strong, even when it's running properly. Worse, the one big flaw in this vac is that it tips over easily if you happen to set it on the floor. Once it has tipped over, the suction ceases entirely, and the only thing that works to get it going again is to turn it off, take off the top, and put the top back on, again. Very, very inconvenient. Surely there has got to be a small, portable shop vac that works better than this one. If it were only more stable when you set it down, it would not be such a problem because it would not be tipping over all the time. I would not purchase this vac again."},{"rating":"1","title":"not happy","review":"The shop vac was way over priced and didn't realize it until I received it. .

Small enough to store and use in tight places, powerful enough to quickly suck up a gallon of mucky bilge water even when the tank is two feet higher than the end of the hose.

It has amazing suction for a tiny machine, and the basic tools are more than enough for me. I bought it to vacuum out my car (excellent for this)and for the ocassional spills on my rugs.The reasons why this is not 5 stars:1) cheap plastic.2) short cord.3) A little tricky to empty when used for dry pick-ups.While I like it and the price was right, Sears had a more powerful on sale a week or so later. It looked better made too.If you can get this for $19, buy it. If you have to do heavy wet/dry vacuuming, buy a bigger and more powerful model."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boooooooooo!","review":"Space is an issue for me. So is cleanliness. Why does this vac stink? Because the motor is less than an inch from the walls of the dirt canister. If you've used a shop vac & know how dirt packs to the filter, you may as well empty it on your floor & vac it all back up again. Putting the entire vac in the trash receptacle, then removing the top is the cleanest you can get with this. The hose doesn't unscrew; it slides between the top & bottom.The side tabs that lock are very tight; so tight that one snapped off, so I couldn't send it back. If you want a REALLY good small shop vac, go with the All Around. It may *seem* expensive, but when you get this vac, you'll kick yourself. A dustbuster would be better/easier.Sorry ShopVac- you failed with this pain in the butt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a small shop vac","review":"Don't let the name fool you, this is not a miniature version of the larger shop vacs. Yes, it is powerful, but it creates more of a mess emptying it than I've ever used it to clean up. The entrance of the hose on the inside is also about 1/2 inch from the filter, try cleaning up anything longer than 1/2 and it clogs.... I was trying to use it to suction up the little bit of hay that escapes from my rabbits cage and it is perfectly useless for this. The attachment on my regular vacuum works much better. If it hadn't been a gift, I'd have returned it after the first use. As it is, its sitting unused in my closet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"Attempting to read this book was an utterly painful experience.

The phrase \\"introvert advantage\\" appears perhaps once in her entire book, and despite what you would think, the idea that introversion is an advantage doesn't play a central role in her theory. \\"The introvert advantage\\" is a phrase that sounds good and gets hopeful people to buy the book, but in the end, Laney's message is that being introverted and being successful (\\"success\\" being defined by the psychological industry) don't make for a realistic combination. The author says the traits of introversion do have their advantages (introspection, for one) and no one should feel bad about being introverted, but the final chapter of her book is entitled \\"Extroverting,\\" which says it all. In the end, the assumption is that what introverts really want and need is to be more extroverted. In the end, the book betrays its audience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would not recommend","review":"I'm roughly 1/4 of the way finished with this book, and I can't help but notice the huge amount of obvious grammatical errors and poor reasoning. I really don't intend to be rude, but I feel like this has the writing level of a college freshman. Bear in mind, these aren't subtle errors--they are missing periods, huge amount of run on sentences, vague references, etc.. Also, there seems to be no scientific background for any of the claims made so far; most of the claims have been based on actors in movies or references to pop culture. I'm going to read up to half of the book, and if this poor quality writing continues, I'm just going to stop. If you're looking for a scientific approach (or at least slightly scientific) to this topic, this book is certainly not the best answer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book - Jam packed with great advice and lessons for all!","review":"Dr. Laney writes an interesting and engaging book; teaches us introverts what we already know, but forgot - and makes us realize that who we are is not only okay, but a gift!Meghan WierAuthor: Confessions of an Introvert, The Shy Girl's Guide to Career, Networking and Getting the Most Out of Life.Confessions of an Introvert: The Shy Girl's Guide to Career, Networking and Getting the Most Out of Life"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as Helpful as I Hoped It Would Be","review":"This was recommended to me by my therapist.

I was specifically looking for help in how to do better in the office atmosphere and this was helpful. It made me feel better about my introversion. There were parts of the book that, despite trying to say introversion can be a good thing and we should appreciate these things about us, still made it sound as if being an extrovert is better.

I realize the book has to be general to reach more people, but even after taking the quiz and scoring in the \\"very introverted\\" range, I couldn't help thinking that I should be more fearful and less confident than I feel!

It will tell you a thing or two about the inner workings of the introvert / extravert brain and from this you can learn valuable lessons on how to lead your life. Stop reading there.

Two things hint that this book was meant to be used as a tool for therapists to hand their clients-- 1) Philip Zimbardo, past president of the APA, endorses it and 2) the lack of APA reference citations in the text. It avoids extremely technical or philosophical discussions of introversion that would cause the mainstream reading audience to lose interest.This book has been helpful to those I have recommended it to and I have found it useful in my life also.If you are an extroverted parent with an introverted child or simply new to the idea that introversion is not a curse, this book will be of great value to you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"I read the book and it has some really good points about being an introvert.

The dialogue is repetitive and weak; usually involving more F-bombs than substance. The sex they advertise this game has is non-existent; it's just some black screen.

I got it thinking it would be cool since I love the post-apocalyptic genre, but the game turned out to be really bad.

You just run around with your fingers mashing the auto-aim button and the fire button. There's no strategy or skill involved, it was just boring.

Jay does such a good job of seamlessly painting the backdrop that you provide your own gray snap-brim fedoras, pleated trousers and red suspenders, the billowy hairdo's on the women and the running boards on the rounded black sedans.

He blends them together in a tale that is a page turner from start to finish, with the biggest surprises at the end.The writing is first rate, with enough description to make the characters and setting pop to life in the minds-eye. And not too much to get in the way of the action. But it was not without fault. Some of the surprises are easy to see coming, though they are still a little surprising as you see them set up. The narrators inner monologue got a bit repetitive. And there are occasional bloopers (within pages of each other, characters are pulled up \\"by main force\\").

It worked fine for us semi-closed for a few months but once my daughter started crawling she refused to stay in such a confined space for more than a few minutes at a time. Now we broke it in two pieces to fence off certain areas but in a few more weeks when she is strong enough to climb on it, it will be completely useless.Do not get it if you can't climb over it. It doesn't actually swing. Do not get it if you plan on folding it up. It is SOOO difficult, feels like it will snap any second.

I was weary, after first opening the box, because I assumed that wear and tear from adjusting the fence would quickly make the flexibility useless. However, the fence has held up great. I am sure that his is a great product, but proved not too useful for our baby. His apparent separation anxiety made isolating him impossible. we more or less ended up using a few fence pieces as large gates to keep the baby from accessing certain parts of the house/rooms.

One section is a great \\"door gate\\" - depending on the area it may need something to support it on one side. We use a section to prevent access to the stereo/TV/DVD, etc. We can put it together and use it outside.It's relatively easy to connect the sections and folds up so it can be put away in a closet. It's been a Godsend for us to use with our rambunctious and curious one year old grandson.I'm getting one for my niece to use with her one year old daughter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works","review":"I have been more than happy with this play yard. It gives my nine month old plenty of room to roam. We also bought the extension so she can have more room when we have the space. We have used it in the closed (octagon) configuration and we have opened it up to cover the six foot opening between our living room and dining room.The product works the way it is supposed to, seems sturdy and I have yet to have an issue with the quality of the product. No complaints here."},{"rating":"2","title":"North States Superyard","review":"I bought two superyards as a pet barrier for a new puppy.

I bought it for my puppy, to keep him out of trouble, but he doesn't seem to like it much! My only complaint is the false promise I was given by amazon.com that it would arrive in 2 days if I signed up for the prime membership. My item was not shipped and received by the 31st of Dec.

I plan to use it to block off the electronic equipment in the family room since it worked so well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lightweight, easy set up","review":"I purchased this item for my small toy Yorkie (4 pounds)to play in when I go camping. It is easy to set up and light weight to handle and carry around. He didn't like it at first the small area provided so I got another and linked them together. The Yorkie has adapted to the larger space and is content to play. There is a caveat however, and one is warned of it in the instructions. There should not be any straight angles or angles less than 170 at the hinges because they warn this area of construction cannot handle the torque load of pressure at these points from wind or dogs jumping and leaning at this point. Easily solved by creating angles that are sharper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for our needs!","review":"These are GREAT for blocking/sectioning off large areas that are too awkward or tricky to really baby proof.

Definitely recommend!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Neither durable nor solid enough as a barrier.","review":"We received the item 3 weeks ago to keep our 1 year old in particular rooms / areas. It has proven to be light enough for her to manipulate past and has broken at one of the joints. The thing that prompted me to write this review was the fact that my 2 year old just stepped on a shard of the breakage that was very difficult to see on our carpet. I wish I could show a pic of this shard as it is very jagged and large enough to wedge quite deeply into a child's skin yet small enough to choke on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Panels arrived warped","review":"I ordered two sets and the panels arrived somewhat warped - I didn't think it was an issue until I tried connecting the panels, and the warping really caused the structure to be very unsturdy. Just one kick from my 6-month old baby made the panels wobble a lot. I'm not risking keeping it to see what she can do with it when she pulls herself up!The panels were also really difficult to disconnect and connect - I got really annoyed doing that, but stepping over with a baby isn't very easy either when you're 5ft 4in and the panels are 26in high!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"Great for my baby he loves being able to move around freely and I love him not going to my kitchen"},{"rating":"2","title":"Welcome to the Cage","review":"I purchased this so my nephew 2 years ago could start preparing for MMA fighting while he was still young.

It's big enough so that he has plenty of room to sleep, play, and even do his business in there. The play pen is easy to fold up if I ever need to put it away. The hinges are a little ridged, but maybe it still needs to be twisted and turned a bit more. It comes with these rubber stickers to put on the bottom so the play pen won't slide. Since I use it for my dog, he tends to get the panels dirty. So I have to wipe it down everyday. It can get difficult with all the little holes and crevices on each panel. But overall, the play pen is very sturdy. My dog can't move it or tip it over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great to have","review":"Love these so much I ended up buying a second set. My only complaint is they dont have a gate attachment for easier opening and closing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of problems","review":"I had lots of problems with this pen. Mine would not change positions. I had lots of trouble trying to get the panels to go in a different direction. I ended up breaking it in spots trying to get it to manuever.

I wish it would have been easier to adjust for me due to the fact that my dogs could not get out of it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Barricade","review":"We bought this to use a a barricade for our dogs to keep them from coming upstairs. This has worked well and because of the way it is assembled you can configure it it in many different ways.so far no problems with breakage that others have discussed.

But it works for what we want to use it for."},{"rating":"1","title":"North States Superyard Classix XT Gate Play Yard.","review":"I didn't like the Superyard Classix XT Gate Play Yard. It's much heavier that I expected. It was hard to open and close to an appropriate shape.

Would probably be ok for kids...again, if you don't mind bending over the tall sides and picking them up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what we needed","review":"This was just what we needed, we were able to spread it out against the wall to make more room for my son.

She was standing herself up by climbing up the side and then once standing she'd stick her little toes in the mesh and start scaling the side. The mesh siding of this model make this possible as opposed to the more expensive models with bars. Needless to say we had to return this and the extension costing us the expensive return shipping fees for both separately(but that's the chance you take when buying from Amazon). This gate may be great for most little ones but steer clear if you have a little acrobat like ours."},{"rating":"2","title":"Play yard of fun","review":"This is great.

It worked great. He could climb up on it and look at the tree and it never toppled over. It was reasonably priced for this. Only negative I have is that I wanted to take out one panel to make it a little smaller and the way it is set up, I would have had to take out two panels and then it was too small. I like that it comes with a nylon handle to help pack it aroound when it is folded up, only I don't remember exactly how it works, but that is my fault!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't do anything without it!","review":"I was having a hard time getting anything done once my son started to crawl.

I used this product for my other two grandkids and it provided me a a great sense of security. I use mine in a rectangle shape so it doesn't take up the entire living room. My new grandbaby is not too thrilled with it, but he will get used to it.The product is easy enough to fold when the kids leave and doesn't take up much space.All in all, I love it and I will reiterate, I love the sense of security it provides."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not nearly as big as it looks","review":"I was shocked at the small space this enclosure actually allowed. The image of two kids playing in the hexagon is totally misleading. My dogs, one 25 lbs and one 47 lbs, could barely lay down inside this space. I wish there was a realistic area information graphic to help understand the relative size of the space. Otherwise, the product breaks down easily. It could use a door though. Picking up my 47 lb dog and dropping her into the space was pretty comical."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bulky and awkward","review":"I'm a little surprised at the great reviews this item has gotten. It was much bigger (think thicker) than I anticipated. I live in a small condo and there was literally no place to store this thing. Secondly, it was difficult to open and collapse the pieces. I needed something I could set up quickly in the mornings, this didn't fit the bill for my needs. As always though, Amazon was awesome about returning it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't live without this!","review":"I used this for awhile like it's supposed to be set up but my son started crawling & cruising at 6 months and quickly learned that there was more places to go & he would scream anytime I got near the gate. So I ended up buying 2 of these and I have them stretched out across the openings to the living room, the fireplace and in front of our DVD's, so that he has the entire living room to explore. He is now 10 months old and he still doesn't mind being confined to the living room for play time. I babysit my friend's 8 month old who is just learning to crawl and he likes the free roam of the living room too. Having 2 babies on the go, I can't live without this gate!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Playyard/FP Gate","review":"My in-laws purchased the same set for around the fireplace.....It not only serves that purpose--but also great for blocking off rooms and taking outside. He can feel like he's playing in the grass without being confined in a playpen. thanks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for puppies.","review":"I purchased this for my 4 month old pomeranian puppy and for the first few weeks it was perfect. I only use this pen while I'm away and can't supervise my puppies play but I'll never use it again. She got her left front leg caught in one of the openings and broke her kneecap. She's in a cast and will be for the next 4-6 weeks and may still need surgery to repair what I thought was going to keep her safe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for infants who are climbers","review":"I bought this item when my daughter was 9 months old. It was only good for few days. When she learned to stand, she also learned to climb it! Her toes fits perfectly on the holes. I put on her shoes, but then she had a strong grip and uses her hands and pull herself up or hangs on it. Manufacturer should redesign this item, by making its poles into horizontal like most gates, and not the diamond shape holes. This product is only good for infants learning to crawl, but not when they learn to stand... and figure out that they can climb it too! I would say this product is only appropriate for 0-9 months old; those who are learning to crawl; and those infants who cannot stand yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well built and easy to use","review":"We actually bought two of these and have put them together to make a bigger version. This unit is REALLY meant to be used as shown, that shape is the most stable. If you do put two together the shape does not work out perfectly so we have used zip ties to attach the play yard to a railing to give it some extra stability. If you have wood or laminate floors you MUST use the pads or the play yard will slide all over the room.This has allowed us to give my son some room to play and it keeps him safe if I have to answer the door or go to the bathroom. He doesn't like to be in it all the time but there are times where he just plays for hours without even noticing I am sitting near by. It helps us contain the toys and it really helps contain him now that he is walking."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a good product but...","review":"Pros. It works for my now 12 months old daughter. She can play and move a long while cruising in the gate.Cons. It is hard to change shapes. It is also pretty flimsy. It's pretty small. Better get an extra extension"},{"rating":"2","title":"Safety Barrier","review":"We love this item. We use it to protect our electronics, cords and a bunch of other things we don't want our puppy to get to for safety and economic reasons. It is very versatile and can be configured around many different things. We bought 2 and separated one to block off 3 areas. Even though it's not high, we don't need height to keep our large breed puppy out of small spaces blocked off. It sure beats constantly yelling no. We will start taking them down gradually as he gets older."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clumsy and hard to adjust","review":"I bought this \\"play yard\\" for my Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier puppy. I use it whenever I can't watch him but don't want to confine him in a crate. The gate serves its purpose, but I'm not crazy about it.First, one of the pictures supplied by North States looks like you can open and close one panel like a door. That picture is really misleading. Removing one of those panels is no easy feat.Second, adjusting the play yard is not as \\"hassle free\\" as they claim. It takes a good bit of strength and patience - and it's loud.I wouldn't recommend this product, nor would I ever buy it again. Instead, I would splurge on a more expensive gate that's less clumsy and easier to use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good purchase, serves its purpose for now","review":"I chose this gate because I wanted a small play area for my 8 month old son. This is a good option, and good value for the money. It is relatively lightweight, which makes it easy to maneuver and fold up when I need to move it. That is good for portability, but I think it will also shorten the life of this product in my household, because I don't think it will be as effective once my son more mobile. I think he'll be able to push it around the room. But for now it is a very good choice. It keeps him safe and contained so I can prepare dinner or run to the bathroom without worrying he'll get into trouble. The mechanism for opening and closing the sections is relatively easy to use. I'll probably buy the extra two panels to make it a little bit larger."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great price","review":"This is a great product at a good price. It is light weight and easy to assemble and easy to store. I use it when training puppies. Used outside on grass as play pen and inside the house sitting on a tarp for inside play."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice and sturdy","review":"We borrowed another pen from a friend and my son was able to push it over.

Amazon made it easy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this Baby Yard!","review":"This is a great gate for new crawlers and toddlers alike. It's got enough height to keep little ones from climbing over, but short enough for caregivers to step over and enter. It's neutral; it doesn't really detract from the playroom or family room (besides, everyone knows it's a baby yard). We love it because it keeps our child in one spot and our pets out of her play area. There is room enough for movement and play without taking up too much space. Also, it can be used in a small space by removing gates, and for a more open area (say, the beach) you can add to the gates (just purchase the gate extension for $20. Totally worth it!). Make sure you check the dimensions; it's bigger than you think! Our little girl loves 'her' space and our older children appreciate and respect that. Well made, and well worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"North Super play yard","review":"very hard to change position of rails and to connect. Some pieces broke a bit trying to do.

I wouldn't recommend it except perhaps for a toy dog of some sort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too short and too stiff","review":"I thought I had purchased the same gate I had from somewhere else. This wasn't the same one. This one is shorter, which isn't a problem for us, having a small dog, but is way too stiff to maneuver. I wish I'd just bought another from the place I bought the first one, but this was cheaper and free shipping. Bad idea to get this to save a couple bucks. Fingers can be easily pinched trying to operating this playyard and I can see children getting pinched fingers (as well as adults trying to latch this thing). It needs a regular gate or something to make it easier to get in and out off.

He has plenty of room to scoot around and play with his toys, as well as use the sides of it to balance and work on standing! The yard is placed on some carpet and he isn't able to push it and move it yet, and hopefully won't able to. My parents however do have hardwood flooring and he is able to scoot the play yard around a bit on the hardwood floor. We solved this by putting down the foam ABC pads everyone was recommending, and now he isn't able to move it anywhere. This thing isn't fancy, but it definitely gets the job done. I'd definitely recommend it if your toddler needs more room to play in than a pack-n-play!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dog jumped the fence","review":"I didn't believe it until I saw it with my own eyes.

But I still like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very durable and sturdy","review":"This is very heavy so that it cannot be lifted by any young child. My 8 year old cannot lift it. But it can slide a little if your child puts their weight on it. It will not topple over as this is impossible. I use it to block my garage so that my 2 year old doesn't run out of the garage and into the street. Once your child is too big to fit in a playpen, you can get this so that they have more room to play, but still have them contained.It is very difficult during the first few times you open and close it. But it does loosen up and becomes easy enough to setup alone. It is actually better that the joints don't move so easily so that your child cannot change the shape of the play yard when they push against it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"This sturdy and versatile gate has been a lifesaver with our new puppy. We have easily changed the set-up configuration to accomodate our needs of the moment. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Excellent For The Money","review":"My husband and I purchased this product for our 8 month old after reading the reviews on it here at Amazon. It's not so much \\"attractive\\" as it is functional. It's sturdy and has held up well thus far. It's also easily portable; we've already taken it on one road trip and it travels well. The only drawback is that it isn't easy to move the joints into place while setting up. (my husband handles that part) However, this might be a plus in that it stands up well and isn't flimsy. All in all, it's been a worthwhile purchase and we would recommend it to others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very useful for my puppy","review":"This pen was great at first. It did a really good job of containing my puppy (14 weeks old) when I couldn't directly supervise her for the first four days. On the fifth day, she figured out how to climb out. She's not all that big, but she managed to hold on to the top with her front paws and climb up the plastic mesh with her back paws and jump out. Once she figured it out, she was climbing out constantly. I had to return the pen and switch to a crate any time she needed to be contained. I'd recommend this ONLY for very small dogs or dogs that are not strong enough to climb up and over the side."},{"rating":"1","title":"This gate should be recalled!! VERY UNSAFE!","review":"I purchased this gate when my twins were 4 months old and was disappointed from the beginning by how flimsy and cheaply made it was. It was also extremey difficult to change the shape and with no gate, it was hard to step in and out of it. At 9 months just as my twins started to learn to pull up, one of them climbed to the top of the gate and fell head first onto our wood floor. This gate has a terrible deisgn and is very easy to climb which is extremely dangerous. It is in no way safe for babies once they learn to stand. The panels should have up and down bars similar to cribs. The hexagon openings are the perfect size for little feet to climb. This product needs to be recalled."},{"rating":"1","title":"Safety Hazard!!!","review":"I bought this item about a month ago and really have loved i it. A nice spacious area for my 6 month old to play in safely....until I tried to fold it back down to travel for the holidays. The 8 panels are connected with joints. Unfortunately, in trying to fold the joints, the panels did not fold at the joints, instead the plastic seemed to just snap. This happened in 6 of the 8 panels. It produces sharp shards of plastic. Clearly not something that is safe for use around a child.I am disappointed because it was great having a large area for my daughter to play in. But, it certainly does not open up easily or fold down without issue.Back to looking for another safe play yard!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Arrived already with a crack!","review":"This item arrived and was already cracked.

We use it as a fence which separates the Christmas tree, TV, Bookshelf, and computer desk separate from the rest of the living room. Keeps the 14 month old away from all of it !!! Seriously, I am a fussy shopper and this product did EXACTLY what I wanted it to do. With the extension kit it makes it huge !!! We did not need the extension yet will get it for future uses as our lil one grows."},{"rating":"2","title":"Room Partition - sorta","review":"I got this to block off my 4 year old's toys from my 1 year old twins - they'll be sharing a room soon. I envisioned using the expansion kit so gate opening could go in the middle of all the panels (stretched out), and with a little work-a-round I think it will work. I had to turn the expansion kit upside down so it would accept the gate's handle locking mechanism. The handle's squeeze and pull-up technique is a little hard for my 4 year old now but I think he'll get it with a little more practice. I was also aware there is no way to attach this to the walls as I've seen offered on other play set ups, but I really wanted/needed the gate option for my son to easily utilize; We'll attach to the walls for a more permanent solution should this set up prove to work out. This product allows easy in & out access."},{"rating":"2","title":"2nd buy","review":"This is my second set.. I wanted my baby to have more room to run so I bought the second set.. Its a great way to keep her safe and have her own space.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sturdy for standing","review":"I used this play yard gate as a fence in my living room for a few weeks in order to allow a larger play area, but my 1 yr old quickly figured out how to move it and get out. So I rearranged it into a rectangle. The play yard allows a fair amount of space and she pulls herself up without tipping it over. It was pretty difficult for me to connect the last pieces together and I can't get them apart now. Amazon had a better price on this than any other store locally or online."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice !!!","review":"Iam happy i bought this play yard ( along with extension) when my 6 month old baby girl started crawling and exploring around.

In addition to its intended use by the manufacturer, I have installed it around my patio, and around a large circumference of my lawn, with additional support. It is attractive, and easily moved for lawn care. The last five sets were purchased from Amazon, and their price was the best by far from other dealers. Overall, it is a great product for small pets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Safe play area for a small dog","review":"I purchased a second play yard because I loved the first one so much. I put them together to make one giant play area. My small dog loves being outside with us, but we don't have a fenced-in yard. This lets him run free without a leash, while keeping him contained and safe. It is incredibly sturdy and easy to hose off if it gets dirty. It folds up easily for storing or traveling. It works well indoors and outdoors. The adjustable size and shape is also very handy. I've used the detachable sections to block off doorways when I wanted to contain my dog in one room. It is very versatile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sarah Palin has one","review":"I bought one of these for my boy. It is not bad for the money, but it would be better if it had a gate so I don't have to step over it all the time. We use half of it between the couches to block off the living room and the other half to put in front of the TV so he can't push all the colorfull buttons. Having baby gates all over your house is an eye sore, but once you have a kid your whole house revolves around your kid. On Sarah Palins Alaska show I noticed she had one in front of her stairs. I know it's stupid that I noticed that. I noticed it because Willows boyfriend stepped over it to go upstairs. I should really stop watching TV. Now a days politician and celebrity is the same thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't but it unless you want your child to make cry","review":"I bought thisone when my lil one was 6months.

Product wise it is good but it has practically no use for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Serves purpose but without class","review":"First of all, and the greatest problem, my son freaked out when I put him inside of this. He cried and hung on the side the whole time until I \\"freed\\" him. It does work and is a good size, but it is so cold, utilitarian, and almost ugly in it's bare functionality. It is an eye sore in the living room. It is really better suited for a pet than a baby or toddler. I haven't used it again after the first time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good for Shelties","review":"I bought this for my quadruped baby and within 25 minutes, she had climbed out of it. I suppose it works better for babies than puppies. Frankly, I was really disappointed. Apparently the \\"mesh\\" on the playpen makes it ideal for little doggy feet to get a toe-hold and just climb right on out.However, it is quite sturdy and strong and I was impressed with its quality. The downside is, it is NOT easy to set up and move around. The hinged-joints at each panel are hard, hard, HARD to adjust and move."},{"rating":"1","title":"I have yet to receive it!","review":"I ordered this item about two weeks ago with my Amazon Prime account and I have not received it!

And because it is so light he is also able to pick it up and escape."},{"rating":"2","title":"Play yard works great!","review":"We purchased this play yard for when our twin grandsons are at our home. It's big enough to give them plenty of play room (with the extension), without being too heavy to move. It's been great because it saves on the amount of baby proofing we need to do. It is easy to fold up to put away when they aren't here. Works great outside as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific!","review":"My husband and I babysit our 15 month old grandson while our daughter is going back to school full-time. Some areas of our house are difficult to child-proof, and my husband and I are getting older; it's not always easy to keep up with an active child this age. We bought two of the Superyards and put them together. This gives our grandson plenty of room to roam and play in safety, and gives us a \\"break\\" when we need it and peace of mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Baby Gate","review":"Gate was exactly as described. We're using the gate to keep our 10 month out of everything she can get her hands on. I know some people have mentioned that the gate is easy to break, but that's only if you bend the gate the wrong way! The gate does take a little getting use to, but overall great buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice","review":"It would be good to have a door. It is not quite easy going in and out for parents want to play with their kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very useful item","review":"We needed a gate for the base of our stairs to keep our one and a half year old from climbing them, but the way our stairway is set up makes it difficult to hang a regular gate. We set this up in a semicircle around the bottom of the stairs, and it works perfectly. It also spreads out so wide that we can block off sections of a room if necessary - I used it in this way when painting part of the living room; my son could watch, but couldn't get past the fence to \\"help.\\"Edit: We've had this for a couple of years and now have baby number 2 -- the gate has held up well, and we are still using it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good, just hard to set up","review":"This gate is great if you want to set it up and pretty much leave it in one spot.Opening it and folding it into space can be tough. The top and bottom hinges don't always work in synch and the fence bends and torques all crazy. The mechanism that locks the hinges in place is really tight and it can take some doing.Once you get it into position it works great. We have it to seperate the house into an area for the dog and an area for the baby. Neither one can get through or over it.It is also very stable, my one year old son grabs and shakes it and it has never come down.So, it's perfect if you want to set it up and leave it, but if you plan on moving it around a lot it may get on your nerves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this product for my twins!","review":"My twins are 9.5 months old and are just starting to move around. I love this product b/c I can leave the room and not have to worry about them getting into something. It is fairly easy to set up and it folds nicely for easy storage. I also recommend the extender if you have more than one child. It gives them a little more room to play."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to open!","review":"I purchased this gate based upon the great reviews. I unfortunately had the opposite experience. I found that the gate was very difficult to open, just as difficult to close, and the gate also has to be placed in a certain position so that it wont tip. My mom pointed out that one of the gates was cracked on top. Most likely from the force required to open and close. I am returning this gate immediately."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth the money","review":"I would have to say that this is not worth buying. The reason...if you want to keep your child from roaming around while you are out of the room, like cleaning the kitching, this will not do it, for all he/she has to do is move it to where he/she wants to go. also it will tip over if your child leans over to much on one side. We bought the play yard to make sure our child was safe while we cleaned up the house, well, he moved it. He also was able to bend it out of shape (which could have pinched his fingers) he moved the play yard all over the house and was able to get into things that he should not have.so if I could I would returned it, or if I read something like this review, I would not have bought it.on a scale from 1 to 10 I would have to give it a 3"},{"rating":"1","title":"Climbable","review":"I purchased this for my 7 month old grandson, but he climbs it and gets stuck at the top. From the outside he does the same thing and nearly topples the whole thing onto himself. This would be ideal for a baby who is not so active."},{"rating":"2","title":"North States Superyard XT","review":"This gate system is perfect for a semi-permanent play space-- we have combined two to fully surround our sandpit in the back yard and we love it! This provides added safety to keep our climber from getting into corners of our yard that we'd rather not have him. When combined with a second 6-panel set- this makes a HUGE (easily 13 ft round) perfect baby/toddler area that is completely mobile and takes five minutes to set up. Highly recommend for any family-- particularly those with older sibs that have small toys. We love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Item","review":"Just got this in the mail the other day and my son loves running and crawling around as usual but NOW i can turn around once and not worry about him hurting himself lol.

Thanks again!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for keeping grubby handed kids off by big TV","review":"My kid LOVES putting his hands on my cool stuff. This is not okay. The dog listens, but the boy doesn't. We don't use the yard to corral our kid in the traditional sense, but 3 sections as a baby gate for our wide hallway and 3 sections wrapped around my TV. No more tiny fingerprints."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth Every Penny!","review":"This play yard is a life saver. We have one year old twins and this is great to put them in with some toys. I can do laundry, dishes, etc. & know they are safe. I also bough the extension gate which makes a big difference. Its much bigger then a pack & play which makes them enjoy being in there. I also bring it outside on the lawn on nice days. The height is great as well. It comes to their eyes. I even sit in there with them some times...this is a must have item!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It works great for my Pug dog!","review":"I know a lot more people seem to review in regards to how this works for a baby but i dont have a baby and i recently got a pug. It works great for him. I love how convenient it is to change the shape around too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great gate","review":"I bought 2 of these baby play yards to make an enclosure to keep my new puppy contained. I already have one around the entertainment center to keep the kids' hands off of my electronics, and have been very happy with them all. They are interlocking and thus expandable as wide as you want, but can also be broken down into even just one wall segment so that they can block off as wide or narrow a space as is necessary. I have had the one around my tv for over three years and have had no issues with it being brittle or cracking as I saw in some other reviews, and my new ones are just as well made. They make a good deal of noise and are a bit stiff to open and close the segments, which in my opinion is a good thing - I don't want them to be easy to bend or else they would be easily modified by the kids or pets at their will - kind of defeating the purpose! All in all they are plastic and may be breakable eventually, but for their intended purpose they work great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Buy","review":"The Superyard was a fantastic buy for us consider that it has allowed us time to have dinner together in a marginal civilized fashion. Our 9 months old loves to play in it specially since she can see us through it. You can hook a bunch of toys to it to keep your child entertained."},{"rating":"2","title":"North States Superyard XT Play Yard","review":"We use it for our small dog daily--works great. Keeps him out of our things while we're gone but gives him space to play. Have to be careful to fold it correctly or it can break--had to return the first one. Folds like an accordion but each panel has a certain direction it needs to fold in. I didn't realize this at first. Would have been nice to have folding directions that told me this. Have no problems now with the new one. When folding I found it makes it easier to squeeze where the two panels connect which helps it to turn better. Since figuring this out I've had no problems. Stores easily and doesn't weigh much. I'd recommend this for small pets or children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for the price","review":"This is a great investment. Keeps kid's occupied and they can't run in the street. It is a bit lighter than it looks though so strong kids can move it around. I wouldn't consider using it as a 'babysitter'. Very light weight and short enough where a taller kid could climb out! The price is great and to keep your child contained at the beach it is great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice..until the panels start busting.","review":"We have gotten a lot of use out of this gate blocking a wide entry to the kitchen. The ends are sandwiched behind the sofa and entertainment center so we don't have to worry about it tipping over. It's great just stationary but I have broken two of the panels now when folding it/unfolding it. I'm not very strong so I don't think it's a good sign that I've already busted two in the six months we've been using it. I wish it were made out of better material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big box with a bit missing","review":"I got this to keep my child safe while she plays but this thing came missing parts to put together.

We have twins - one year old. We purchased this play yard with the two piece extension and it makes a very good size play area.The colored gates are great for stimulating the children and our children's developmental specialist loves it as well.The gate is very sturdy as the twins are learning to walk and use it to pull themselves up (19lbs and 16lbs), walk around, lean on and sit back down.We've been using the gate for about a month and have not had any problems with breaking when moving around. The sections are very sturdy and we have no worries about the babies moving them or being able to push them out/open at a joint.I would recommend these for anyone, and really recommend purchasing the extension with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product but some flaws","review":"This is a great product and very well made with one small flaw.

The extremely talented cast members are so expressive you can imagine every gesture, every expression, as if you were sitting in the theater audience watching the performance live.The downside of starting with this wonderful piece of work is you are truly spoiled for all else as it is few and far between to find another cast of this caliber, with such a masterful orchestra and conductor, and then top it all off with an exquisitely performed finale.

Forget all this. The (German) production is amateurish to an embarrassing degree. The blurry, meandering film is certainly not up to 2001 standards, and the audio is even worse: compressed to the point of being muddy and almost one-dimensional. The Israel Philharmonic musicians sound not much better than a provincial band, the piano is so indistinct that I had trouble appreciating the soloist's efforts. Paavo J?rvi puts on a brave face, but the chemistry is just not there and the performances don't ever get off the ground. The Tel Aviv audience give copious applause.

Then again, I am only about 1/3 of the way through this very long but entertaining read, maybe this is something the author saved for later...This book seems to tie in nicely to another book I am reading about the history of the Rothschilds and European banking and finance (The House of Rothschild: Volume 1: Money's Prophets: 1798-1848).Good so far..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book, lots of characters, long read","review":"Great book if you want to get an understanding of investment banking. It is, however, extremely long and has a lot of characters which are hard to keep track of."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Quite Dull, But","review":"Not as interesting as it should have been.Chernow could have made it more vivid by living more in the trees than amid the forest, region, or biosphere. I would've found it more engaging if there had been a more personal exposition of the players (i.e., more time spent on detailed exposition of individual events than on general descriptions and delineation of trends).I'm glad, though, that I read it. It was a very informative history.Maybe you will be, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book if Specifically Interested in JPM","review":"This book took me a long time to read. I started the book and found the first half of the book regarding Pierpont Morgan's life, his family and the bank he built quite interesting. The book drags on with details at points throughout the last half of the book and focuses much of its time on Morgan Stanley, but the author's strong research and writing ability stays constant. The last several chapters were more interesting to me and dealt with the changing face of investment and commercial banking through the late 1970s and throughout the 1980s in contrast to the gentlemen's code of banking that dominated the banking dynasties for more than a century. It's almost a shame that this book was completed in 1989 and missed the growth of JPMorgan Chase as it consumed giants such as Chemical Bank (and Manufacturers Hanover) and eventually became JPMorgan Chase Bank. In the end, this is an amazing piece of work, for any one person to achieve."},{"rating":"2","title":"Now for the rest of the story...","review":"Chernow's book is good for the sweeping overview that it is. It left me wondering, though, what is the story behind the story. The Morgan partners continually are painted in too favorable a light by Chernow. I'd like to know more about how Morgans not only used the \\"old boy\\" network to their advantage, but really created and controlled the core of that network for decades. Morgans had its fingers in *everything* at the previous turn of the century. But I have the feeling that it wasn't simply due to the Morgan partners simply being upright bankers!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brian Wayne Wells, Esquire, reviews \\"The House of Morgan\\"","review":"If a book, once read, does not remain on the shelf, but is referred back to on a frequent basis for additional information, it is a book that is well worth its purchase price. One such book is the Ron Chernow's \\"House of Morgan\\" (1990).As this reviewer reads other books on the economic history of the United States and relations between Britain and the United States in the 1890's, this book on the life and times of banker J.P. Morgan,his son and the banking firm they developed,is a book often used as a reference guide.The Morgan banking firm has had a tremendous impact on the history of the United States and Europe in the last part of the nineteenth century and the entire twentieth century. Reading this book, conveys that impact in a style that won the book the 1990 National Book Award"},{"rating":"2","title":"America's Gilded Age","review":"Ron Chernow is good at writing in great detail while making his books interesting. \\"House of Morgan\\" is well documented as are all of Chernow's books. This book is the interesting story of big banking in the United States and abroad during the period of 1850-1900. Chernow goes beyond the earlier years of the J. P. Morgan empire to the present; giving an introduction to Morgan/Chase as we know it today. The early founder, Pierpont, was ruthless, secretive and rich. The book is a long one, and took awhile to read, but it was worth the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Frankly I was disappointed with the book. It is good popular history but not really serious history. For example, the author talks about how bad the 1987 stock market crash was but fails to mention that stocks end the year higher than they had begun. He mentions thousands of boards the various characters served on but not once in the 700 pages are we inside a board room. On reviewer talks about how he lavishes some areas with detail and then ignores others. I agree. I found myself wanting to know more many times. The mini-biographies throughout the book seem like the author simply is looking at an old photograph and sheds little else on the subject. I did make it through the book but found myself wanting more information."},{"rating":"2","title":"Point to consider","review":"I have not read this book but would consider buying it if its on tape.

It had a real clean, a sophisticated, a solid technique. He was restrained but at the same time beautifully powerful. Well, this new CD is all that but he has kicked the 'shred' notch up to '11'.

NOT, I repeat NOT just for guitarists, this CD is listenable from beginning to end. Each composition is totally melodic and memorable. There is something for everyone's taste in music. A beautiful follow-up to a near perfect debut CD.

Magnificent!Most of differing taste will find some great listening here, whether into classical, country or folk, there is a mixture here of all tastefully and expertly performed."},{"rating":"2","title":"More Waltz than Appalachia","review":"As expected, the music was wonderful. This a quite a grouping of fine musicians and the disc is well worth purchasing. My only disappointment was that it wasn't a little more toward the \\"bluegrass\\" side of music and was more toward the classical. However, just because this wasn't quite what I wanted, the composition and playing were excellant. This makes excellant background music for serious gatherings and reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looking for more like this album?","review":"Melanie White and other reviewers have wondered what else out there might be similar to \\"Appalachia Waltz.\\" I highly recommend Oliver Schroer's double-disc \\"O2\\". Same fusion of folk fiddle idiom and classical violin. In places astoundingly brilliant. Lovers of Bach will see many influences here (yet I wouldn't call Schroer's work derivative.) In the liner notes, Schroer talks about making his work not just polyphonic but also fractal--funny thing is, the more you listen, the more \\"fractal\\" it sounds. Unbelievable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't let the title fool you","review":"If you think this is just another collection of roots music, remakes of folk standards, you would be wrong. This is innovative stuff. Meyer's bass playing is wonderful, stretching limits and crossing the boundaries between classical and folk. The three musicians create such textures and rhythms with their playing, you would swear there was a rhythm track behind them until you realize, it is just a bass, a cello, and a fiddle (for most songs). What's more, I personally have always felt that the traditional string quartet--2 violins, 1 viola, and 1 cello--is too heavy on the treble side of the scale. The combo on this album is much more my style--more bass and deep, resonant tones. Beautiful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!!!","review":"Appalachian Waltz shows the best of American music with premier performers.

I also highly recommend the second album from this trio, titled Appalachian Journey."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"I heard an interview on National Public Radio with Ma, O'Connor and Meyer when this great CD first came out. They were joking that O'Connor had to find a better fiddle and Ma needed a cello of lesser quality in order to play together! (All joking of course) I found that all three of these talented players were able to mix there own style and sound together to reach an incredible new sound. It is simply a wonderful CD and highly recomended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Yogurt Starter","review":"So far, this product has done exactly what it said it would do. We have produced 6 quarts of soy yogurt and had no problems. We have found that with soy milk you need to mix non-flavored gelatin and incubate the yogurt about 7 hours for a firm consistancy. The starter is easy to use, the directions are easy to follow. If the directions are followed and a little time is taken to experiment with different types of milk products, it makes a wonderful yogurt."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEAUTIFUL THOROUGH COMPILATION","review":"I love this and ordered it via telephone and have been listening to the volumes for the last week as I received it in the mail last Thursday December 17, 2009.

Hopefully, TIMELIFE/RHINO can create future volumes and send them to owner's of this boxset and like myself can just purchase them thru phone or online.To reiterate, this is a must have.

The plastic that it is made out of seems very durable but it is so thick and unmovable that my hands cannot adjust any of the controls on my camera. I just about fit the camera through the opening of the bag. There also is a lot of excess room in the bag (once you get it in) that the camera does not stay in place and you have to try to readjust it(which is almost impossible).I have not yet tried to actually use this case for photo taking but I think that it is still going to be useful just to keep my camera dry while taking it to the beach and on ship excursions. I would recommend this bag to someone who wants to keep their digital camera dry but not for picture taking in the water."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for carrying things, not much else","review":"I bought the AquaPac based largely on the glowing reviews I read from all over the Internet but I was very disappointed. I tried it first with a Canon G6 and it barely fit; when it was securely in place and the camera was turned on the bag almost prevented the lens from extending. I tried pictures indoors with a flash, which produced an image of a large, white blob, then without the flash, which produced out of focus images. My G6 never properly focused while in the bag, so I tried my Minolta Dimage X60, which fit very well but gave the same results. I tried the bag with the X60 in bright sunlight and out of about 6 pictures only one was acceptable, but even it had a bluish haze. The other photos had a more pronounced haze and not a single one was in focus -- and this was in bright sunlight! I'm not sure what I can do now beyond paying nearly $200 for a camera-specific waterproof case, but the AquaPac is definitely not the solution."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely not the best recording","review":"This recording, however not horrible, is not that great. It was the first year that Abbado was in Berlin and the orchestra was definitely not used to him, and the playing shows. Things aren't always together, especially the second movement. There's even a major mistake by the third horn. Listen carefully on the sound sample above and you'll hear it. On the repeat, the horn came in a bar early, however he did try to cover it up quite nicely and not many people would probably notice if they weren't listening carefully. Overall I wouldn't recommend this CD, there are much better. For example, Bernstein's second one with the Royal Concertgebowe, Tennstedt's with Chicago, his last one, and I feel Solti's with Chicago is also a nice one to have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Second Movement","review":"Concerning the tempo fluctuation at the beginning of the 2nd movement, I suggest checking the score, with a metronome in hand. You'll find that Abbado adopts 66 to the bar starting on bar 5, as written. All other versions I've heard (20+) use 60 from bar 1, including the presumably authoritative Bruno Walter interpretation, and Abbado's earlier Chicago version. It's no exagerration to say that Abbado's BPO version is the only one that's true to the score on this point.Note that Mahler's programatic description for this movement was \`Full Sail!'; one can imagine this clipper catching a steady wind on bar 5.Overall this is a very fine recording, and merits a place in a well stocked Mahler collection. Bernstein, Kubelik, and a few others also stand out, and this is certainly a crowded field."},{"rating":"2","title":"BPO inferior to the CSO?!! what a ridiculous statement !!!","review":"Excuse my ignorance but, who is David Hurvitz? seriously I don't know, but I guess he is someone who has something personal against the BPO and Karajan to make such a ridiculous statements. It's well known (except by Hurwiz)that the BPO as well as the VPO are the best orschestras in the world, period.Regarding this recording, it's one of the best 2 or 3 out there. Abbado conducts this work with great passion and feeling. I recommend it highly for the performance, the quality sound could be better.Please don't give credibility to Mr. Hurwizt's comments in other reviews."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good recording","review":"Personally, I don't think this recording is bad at all. In fact, it is extremely well. I have Bernstein's recording and this Abbado's version is as good as Bernstein's. The first movement is wonderfull. The second movement is far better than Bernstein's. The third is beautifull. The beginning of the fourth lacks of strength but the rest is very very well done. The only reason I would not put the 5 stars rate is because certainly I've heard recordings with better parts but this one has better parts than the same other versions I've heard."},{"rating":"2","title":"a must-have for harpsichord lovers","review":"I love the sound of this most unusual instrument, the harpsichord.

To be fair, I was hanging multiple items off each hook - it has 5 hooks on each one and I had 2 or 3 hangers on each hook.So, if you're looking to hang exactly 5 items on them, they may work -- but beware overloading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended! Only good for LIGHTWEIGHT garments!","review":"The problem with these hangers is that they can't support the weight of 5 garments. Unless you were planning on using these to hang up 5 camisoles or light blouses, these are not recommended. I bought several packs and used them to hang cardigans and blazers, but within 3 days they all fell down because the round part that hangs on the closet bar straightened out and fell right off the bar. The plastic is too pliable to support anything but the lightest weight garments.By the way, if your intended use is for very lightweight items, starcrest.com and taylorgifts.com have the same item at a better price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good if you are hanging blouses, not pants","review":"These hooks really helped me save closet space. Unfortunately, they don't seem to handle heavy items like pants too well. I dedicated one set of hangers to pants, and the plastic hook bent until it fell to the floor- it couldn't be fix and I had to toss it away.If you're hanging blouses or the occasional pair of pants, these would be fine.

This is the reprint authorized and updated by the Germans from Russia Heritage Society in Bismarck, ND. It is a timeless story of the clash of cultures during the settling of the Great Plains. It is not the clash of the Native American culture versus the White culture, but rather a clash of the Anglo-American culture versus the Germans from Russia immigrant culture. It is of two white cultures that have different views of life and how it is to be lived. It is well worth the read. The book arrived in good time and was as described."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good but boring...","review":"This is a good book for someone who wants to get an idea about philosophy in general - the only drawback is that its very boring, I had a hard time to get to page 400 (i know there's more), if you'r the kind of person that can read boring stuff and go on with it, then this one is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great light for the price","review":"It fit perfectly on to the the umbrella poll.

The best cuts on this album are \\"Conversation In A Car\\" and \\"Isn't It Sweet To Think So\\"; both retain the acoustics and harmony from their starting-out days. \\"You've Got A Way\\" is in this same vein, but is a bit more directly (and almost painfully) heart-on-the-sleeve, as ATS could sometimes be.Other cuts (\\"Dance\\", \\"Finding Somebody New\\") hint of their more theatric and over-orchestrated tendencies, and are almost too urban.

About a year ago I bought PaperMate Write Bros. to see what was so good about cheap, disposable pens. Well, they crapped out on me. All of them required alot of pressure to write with, and after using gel pens for more than 8 years straight, it gave my \\"atrophied\\" hand lots of cramps. So I threw them out and vowed never to use cheap, disposable pens sold in 12 packs.A week ago, I left my pen at home for maybe the 3rd time in my entire life. My friend let me use her pen for the day. It was a BIC Ultra Round Stic Grip, and I was amazed by the smoothness of it. It barely skipped or blotted.

Synecdoce has an interesting plot and a few fun moments, but it is not an \\"enjoyable\\" film. It's main character has many, many problems and spends years working on the same project. I felt that the same philosophical point was being made over & over, which was probably intended, but which started to bore me. However, if you can stick with it, the ending is satisfying in a melancholic sort of way."},{"rating":"1","title":"I guess you just can't \\"get it\\" if you don't have a PhD in Philosophy","review":"Fortunately (or unfortunately) I don't have one and therefore can't agree with all 5-star reviews of this movie. I guess I am just not sophisticated enough to \\"get\\" this \\"masterpiece\\" (which is strange because I happen to enjoy other Kaufman's movies).The movie starts promisingly. I quite enjoyed the first 1/3 when character of Caden Cotard and his family life are introduced. But the moment Caden receives the grant and starts working on his play, all sense goes out of the movie. It feels simply like an image of a mind of a crazy depressed person.Bottom line, I found this movie indulgent and trying too hard to be \\"special,\\" \\"original,\\" and \\"profound.\\"Two stars for cast and acting that was quite remarkable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only Likeable by the Most Pseudo of Pseudo-Intellectuals","review":"For all the post-modern ruminations this film mental-masterbates to, it ultimately lacks any real depth. Some people love to be flatter themselves by \\"figuring out\\" a movie like this, but the direct experience of watching it is tiresome and unsatisfying. Even the scenes that do work (e.g., it is funny for a character to be purchasing a house that is constantly on fire) are ruined by the director's \\"aren't I clever,\\" heavy-handed style.Really disappointing..."},{"rating":"1","title":"No, No, No...","review":"After only a short while, I reached the limits of my intellectural interest, sometimes referred to as the \\"BS Level.\\" I was insulted by the deliberate confusion of plot and \\"stage settings.\\" I found the entire production to be infuriatingly overdone. The more detail that was supplied, the more I found myself not caring.I thought perhaps I hadn't been in the proper mood to have watched the film, so I gave it a second chance. It didn't work. I couldn't get past the first 30 minutes.To have paced the film to inteligibly absorb all the information being pushed upon the viewers, the film would have needed a couple more hours to eliminate some of the constant overlapping, which would have given me the time to sort out everything, without my frustration meter going into the red zone."},{"rating":"1","title":"tedious and boring","review":"we get the point already. it's a recurring theme in this guy's work. all of us are the directors of the movie of our own lives and everything that has ever happened to us can be internally debated and reimagined. one review said the movie is like david lynch meets woody allen and that's about right except it's not nearly as good as either and it's very long and boring. the movie is hard to get through. i had to watch it in 3 different sittings to finish it. that's very telling and a very bad sign for any movie. i guess i'm just not a fan of kaufman's work. sorry charlie."},{"rating":"1","title":"I think someone is missing the point...","review":"...and it's not the viewers. While watching this movie I felt that Mr. Kaufman had watched INLAND EMPIRE, Brazil, and some Godard and decided it would be a great idea to make a movie with Lynch's verisimilitude, Gilliam's upbeat, cheerful tone, and Godard's tightly plotted barn-burner screenplays. In order to make the resulting mess his own, he added scatological humor and absurd pseudointellectual dialogue.It was incredible."},{"rating":"1","title":"sorry 1 star","review":"I know this film has plenty of fanboys who will probably flame me for giving this movie only 1 star but I must do what I must out of my own sense of integrity. If meandering films with little to no comical nuance(while claiming to be a comedy) are your thing then this is the film for you. If you truly enjoyed this film then it should not offend you in the least that I did not. I could spend 30 min or an hour writing out a scathing review but I feel this is enough. If you truly value your time, avoid this film imho."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soooooooo good","review":"I don't think I will ever understand how this movie was so widely overlooked.

The cast is stellar, but the story just sinks down the film's worth. I don't mind if a movie is depressing but this one is unbearable! I got sick of it half-way through but stuck with it 'cause I thought it would improve, only to be greatly disappointed. This is the only film I think I've ever viewed where, after it was over, I honestly wish I could've traveled back in time to watch something else or do something better with my time. Filmmaker Charlie Kaufman here is producing some pretentious avant garde cinema that simply doesn't make the wanted memorable achievement mark, except maybe a Razzie nomination.

This movie flits from one scene to another...little snipets of life. In the beginning, it seems he has a terminal illness, which gets lost along the way because he lives to be a very old man......I think. I had the feeling that I was supposed to think that the movie was deep, symbolic, fantasy, dream sequences?....The fact of the matter was halfway through, I didn't really care what things were supposed to mean.

It is brilliant, but it sucks the life out of you, and I found myself in a very sad mood after it was over. It got five stars anyway. It really makes you question what our lives are supposed to be about. Perhaps there is too much philosophy that will be needed to understand and comment on what the hell is going on here. I guess all I can say in the end is, \\"just what the hell is a life and how are we supposed to live one?\\" My toaster came with an instruction manual.

An ailing director, Caden Cotard (Philip Seymour Hoffman) builds a replica of New York in a huge cavernous warehouse and instructs his actors live out constructed lives. He hires an actor to play himself, and others to play the people he knows. The staging of the play takes on a life of its own as the sets just keep getting bigger and bigger and more elaborate, until the fabricated New York begins to look every bit as real as a real city. And when the actors begin to intermingle with Cotard's real life the line between the play and real life becomes even more blurred.This is a fascinating movie that will frustrate some and stimulate others. Just sit back and enjoy this labyrinth from the mind of Charlie Kaufman (\\"Adaptation\\", \\"Being John Malkovich\\")."},{"rating":"2","title":"Synecdoche New York","review":"This is one of the greatest movies of all time.

The actors are, undeniably, excellent. However,this absurdist screenplay never made me feel anything but dread -- fearing that this descent into a surrealistic whirlpool would never, ever end. Throughout, I kept wondering what kept me from turning off the TV. What could I possibly have seen in this madness that kept me watching? I wanted to find something positive that kept me there....but I think I was imagining that somehow the audience would be let in on some big secret.

It doesn't. If you enjoy wasting your life and being depressed, this is the movie for you!

Charlie Kaufman, the self-absorbed screenwriter who got way too much credit for movies like \\"Eternal Sunshine,\\" directed this and got way too ambitious. We simply don't care about the main character, Philip Seymour Hoffman playing a director, nor do we ever develop any sympathy for anyone else here. The movie tries to cover a long time period, I guess, which just ends up being another over-the-top element. In the end, I have no idea what this sprawl was about.

The entire movie seemed completely random. E.g. in one scene he's dying, the next scene he's fine. I watched it long enough to see if any of the randomness would be resolved such as waking up from a dream or delusion, but it didn't. Guess I'm artiste enough to understand it.

His handling of the topic is one of navel nit picking, and not informative though according to him, Beck, he is kinder to his subject than most other biographers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frisbee","review":"This CD is good for the causal listener - but after hearing Dinu Lipatti play Mozart's Piano Concert No 21, I can't listen to this. For No. 21, the music (orchestral and piano) is too slow - technically the playing is spot on, but the timing feels off and there is extra flourishes in some of orchestral parts that seemed disconnected or seemed to not belong. I listened to No 21 first and gave it three full ear shots and did not bother listening to No. 20 as I threw the CD's out the car window. I am not sure if it is the conductor, the player, the orchestra or a combination of it all. It's probably me..... but I am not recommending this CD.Maybe my opinion would be different I had listened to this first with no other variations.....no....b/c I just recently came across Dinu Lipatti...

Certainly the old chestnut ranks right up there with me! Serkin does a masterful job presenting it. His tempos are right on, and he does a particularly expert rendering of the 2nd movement, Andante. His playing of both concertos tugs at the heartstrings and brings out all the nuances that Mozart composed into his music. I believe this to be, if not the best, certainly one of the best among the many offerings of this music available.I suggest that you get it now while it is still available. You certainly will not regret it.

There are quite a few minor errors which can be attributed to a bad editor. Here are two that are worth mentioning: a) the chapter on indulgences has to be ignored. The author confuses indulgence with forgiveness. b) In page 96 where it says \\"Jesus' place in the Godhead\\" is ambiguously phrased and seems to indicate that the Son is like a portion that fits in a \\"place\\" of the Most Holy Trinity.Save for these minor flaws the book is very useful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great nsync book","review":"This is a great book to get for any *NSYNC fan.

Those subjects may be standard Cave fare, but the amazing string arrangements featured on almost every tune add an epic sweep to the album, imbuing it with a grandeur found in the work of Jacques Brel and his protoge, Scott Walker. While Cave sings of pain and tears, the music moves you there with him--and you're better off for having gone along for the ride."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reminiscent of the Sten series","review":"Excellent work, best of Mr. Bunch's work since the Sten series with Alan Cole. Much more gritty and realistic approach to his heroes, written by someone who seems to know what really goes on in covert operations. I found the ranking a little too cute, since the structure seemed the same as today, with just an alien sounding name. I think it would have been as effective and easier to keep up with if the ranks had been in english. Excellent work, could not put the book down. His humor had me laughing out loud at times!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A new Military SF book.","review":"Good book, quite engaging. Not a derivitive of the Sten books, but essentially built with the same technical know how. The characters are not saints, but are people. People whose story and actions quickly grab you and draw you into the story. Character development that doesn't bore you, but actually helps to let you get to know the characters. Bunch proves that he has the know how to write good, believable action. He also proves that the good guys do not always win (at least on the first try). He is a master of incorporating everyday politics (ie, backstabbing and stupidity) of human beings into his characters. All in all a good effort, I really enjoyed reading this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"After genuinely enjoying the Anteros series from Bunch and Cole, I was pretty eager to get started on this \\"Find\\" from a used book store.It never happened.

Rappers like Talib Kweli, Common, Mos Def, Jurrassic 5, Dilated Peoples should get more recognition but they don't talk about guns and robbing people and other ignorant topics.

The Album had a few good tracks such as \\"We Don't Give A Fu*k\\" with 50 Cent, Olivia & Lloyd Banks, and \\"Pimpin\\", to me these were very catchy tracks that would have otherwise made decent videos. \\"Live By The Gun\\" was also a good track which was a raw track which is becoming a rare thing for G-Unit. Aside from these three tracks Tony's Yayo's album - Thought's of A Predicate Felon was a flop.

This clown seriously makes himself look retarded. I am going to be so upset if this piece of trash does well and takes away from sales of Kanye's Late Registration.

There are some good songs on this CD like Drama Setter, Pimpin (Kind of stupid but it's okay), Curious, and I know you don't love me. Then there's those songs that make you go wdf? Like, Eastside Westside, Tattle Teller, and Dear Suzie. For those of you who haven't gotten this CD Just go get it bootlegged. It's actually good enough for you to download. But delete it off your computer A.S.A.P. after you burned it on a disc cause the Gunit people may tap into your computer and put all this G-UNIT garbage and when someone sends you a IM its going to go GGGGGUUNNNIITTT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ME SO ON FIRE!!

I'm shocked...I can't believe that his gimmick of shaking his hand 3 inches from his face, back & forth for 10 seconds, didn't catch on with the youth.

Unfortunately however, I, like many of you, tuned into tracks such as \\"Tattle Teller,\\" \\"Curious,\\" and \\"Project Princess.\\" For an ex-convict, that is not the type of message you want to project to an audience that is expecting something more... hardcore; something better. On tracks such as \\"Live By The Gun\\" and \\"Homicide,\\" Yayo delivers my aforementioned desire for \\"harder\\" lyrics, but tracks such as these are few and far between.

Ja Rule never put out bullsh*t like this and all G-unit talked about was how he went pop. New Edition is harder than G-unit.

Yes, Yayo basically sings on several tracks on this album. And you'd have to hear it for yourself to really believe how bad it is. I'm actually kind of mad at 50 because now that he's producing all the g-unit albums and running the g-unit \\"label\\" the music has really been disappointing and a real diservice to any fan of g-unit. Slowly but surely people will get tired of paying for crappy music and g-unit albums will be completely ignored. 50 needs to give musical control back to Dre and Em. 50 cannot produce or run a label; he's doing an awful job."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Predicate Felon\\" Review","review":"The final of the original G-Unit to put out his solo album, the long-incarcerated Tony Yayo looks to follow suit in the success of his fellow G-Unit brothers, Young Buck and Lloyd Banks as well as the commander-in-chief, 50 Cent. What better way to do so than by following the same formula to a tee, right? This may perhaps be the biggest problem with \\"Predicate Felon\\". Aside from a few tracks written while behind bars, the content on Yayo's solo LP seems almost exactly identical to prior G-Unit releases. It's the usual format. You've got your party track (\\"So Seductive\\"), your songs for the ladies (\\"Curious\\", \\"Project Princess\\"), your song about smoking weed (\\"I'm So High\\"), and your pimp song (\\"Pimpin\\"). Mix in it with a few \\"street tracks\\" and some G-Unit collabo tracks and you've got the formula. While \\"Predicate Felon\\" has a few worthwhile tracks, Yayo, for the most part, doesn't seem like he can hold down a solo album on his own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgrace","review":"Man i bet yayo's mama is mad at him for making this kind of album i mean nothing on this album is worth your hard earned money all these pop songs suck and i been reading that people like these beats well they suck too.

Basically its the same ol things g unit loves talking about and kanye West's album IS NOT garbage. In my personal opinion the man is a musical genious. Personally i did not buy Yayo's album due to lack of lyrical content, meaning, theres nothing really to the album. I heard it and probably had expectations of an album like pac (being he was locked up and came out and dropped a class) not the case for yayo. He is just trying to follow 50's formula of pop/hip hop songs with no meaning whatsoever. Dissapointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"WOW","review":"First off lets get it clear i love hip hop and im not a hater but these g-unit niggas is garbage there exactly what hip hop is NOT all that flashy s***, what ever happen to that real lyrically s***, from the sound of this album it sounds like begining of the end for them first 50 drops a wac album and know the highly anticipated yayo album is by far the worst album ever released in hip hop, they should have never let this dude out jail, not one track is worth listening to, im predicting that the g unit is going to be know more really soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Give Up","review":"What has happened to G-Unit?

A little while ago, wasn't 50 and the Unit dissin' Ja Rule for coming out with \\"LOVE SONGS?\\" I could have sworn that Yayo just made a love CD! Jesus Christ!

Or \\"Reasonable Doubt\\". Now that is good rap. Trust me, just cop Illmatic, listen to it 3 times, and you'll throw this Yayo cd in the garbage bin.Damn, I don't get it, if you have good beats, why don't you put good rappers on'em.

Many of the songs are not produced by Dr. Dre (one of the few things that G-Unit has going for them) resulting in \\"greasy\\" and bad beats. Tony Yayo cant seem to trun his mouth away from drug trafficing, being locked up in prison, hoes, ect. He lyrics aren't all that great either, making him have the worst voice in G-unit as well. He sounds almost as if he is my grandfather- maybe as a result of getting locked up. The few pluses on the album are \\"Drama Setter\\" feat. Eminem and Obie Trice followed by Eminem's constant adreniline rushing sound and beats (even though he only is apart of the chorus-a big mistake) as well as \\"G-S**t\\". My advice, download these two songs- this CD isn't worth $14.00!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This album should be Tony's 3rd felony....","review":"This album did not make any sense to me. It's just some more commercial garbage pumped out to make money. Remember the days of Biz Markie, De La Soul, and Digital Underground. These guys all had their own style, and used humor to bring a lighter side to life in the ghetto. These days nobody is willing to stray away from the gangsta sh*t in fear they won't make money. This album is a perfect example of that. Have you seen the music video for seductive? What does the video have to with lyrics? Well that seems to be a constant theme with this album.

But I was unimpressed with Yayo's cd. It almost seemed rushed. Lyrically, yayo is as basic as it gets. While he has an occasional tight punchline, he cant compare to 50, Banks, Buck, or the Game (when he was g-unit). His hooks are weak, and alot of the beats sound the same. I expected alot more from his debut, but now im wondering why g-unit was so eager for him to get out of jail?

He should have stayed in jail. But no, he is set free and he cuts a song called \\"So Seductive\\", a song consisting of pop beats, weak flow, idiotic lyrics, and mindless yelling. Just take a listen to this one song and you'll get an idea on how terrible Yayo is.Also, the album flopped and was considered one of the worst of 2005. No explanation needed here.

One of them would be Drama setter with Eminem and Obie Trice. This is another weak product to earn some easy money as all G-unit albus are! Massacre is great example. G-unit is going down hard. 50 overestimated himself and his crew. His flow was good in the beginning but whats up with singing? Its like this disease is spreding and all of the G-unit members are starting to sing. This kind of albums are bringing rap to its end.

I'm not one of those G-Unit haters either, I like most of the stuff they come out with. This time around it's a different story. Yayo has delivered one of the wackest G-Unit albums ever. First off, he's not a great lyricist. Second, his flow is average at best. Third, the beats on the album are generic. Some of the beats on the album even sound the same! There are only maybe 4 good songs on the whole album (Homicide, So Seductive, Drama Setter, Pimpin'). Some people will go and buy this album just because it's G-Unit, but I wouldn't advise it. If 50 expects real hip-hop fans to buy into this garbage, I don't think G-Unit will be around much longer.

But if I did, I still wouldn't recommend this book. Not only are the arguments put forth in this book extremely weak, but Denton is in over his head when he adresses scientific subjects outside of his specialty of genetics. He demonstrates a poor understanding of chemistry, and his section on how the periodic table of the elements is fine tuned for human life is especially poor.For those who are interested in intelligent design creationism, Darwin's Black Box is a much better book - better argued, and Behe knows what he's talking about when he discusses biochemistry.If you don't believe me, take a look at the creation/evolution literature, and you'll see that Nature's Destiny is never cited, while works by Behe, Dembski and Johnson frequently are."},{"rating":"1","title":"Life is a rarity.","review":"If the universe is made for us why is life so rare? If there is an architect, why did he make so few habital planets? It's a pretty big universe to make just to stick a silly two-legged species on this one planet. Why didn't life evolve on more planets? Because the chemistry of life does have some stringent requirements that most planets do not meet. Rarely does a planet have the right makeup and of those that do most probably do NOT have life? Does this really sound like a grand design? The designer could not have been too wild about his creation. He (being all-powerful) could have replicated the creation many more times and he didn't. ANd what if there IS other life out there?

Happily, having hunted down a copy, I found the other movements were equally well-crafted. One of the other reviewers was spot on in describing Harvey's work to Vaughan Williams and Copland, other modern composers whose work, although very definitely twentieth century in chord structure and sensibility, contain melodic lines the equal to any in the classical tradition. While the third movement remains the gem for me (a lyrical catharsis of sorts), the entire work is exceptional, evocative, and a testament to both Harvey and the gifted John Williams. The concerto is self-contained, so I found the Gray piece placed right after a bit jarring and superfluous. It would have been better on another disc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Cute Book Interactive- good for a new baby","review":"My 5 yr old likes to say the \\"Koala Lou, I do love you\\" part... so i would say this book is interactive.

This book re-visions evangelism in a way that will reach out to people who haven't grown up in a church setting. Through his study of celtic Christianity, George Hunter saw an evangelism that does not expect people to live by the \\"rules\\" of Christianity before they are even accepted into the doors of a church. Looking at a group of Christians who reached out to the world around them and asked them to be \\"christian\\" and not \\"civilized\\" is true inspiration for us today when our churches seem to want people to know how to act before we are willing to even let them in the doors. This book is well worth the read for anyone interested in bringing Christ to their world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"Terrific and quick read. Hunter gives a very interesting account of Celtic Christianity and how Celtic principles can positively shape modern day \\"church.\\"I highly recommend this book.

The Celts were able to rapidly convert barbarians to Christianity using their unique style of mission, and to do so where the Roman church had failed. This excellent book describes the methods used by Patrick, Colomba and others back in the 5th and 6th centuries in Ireland, Scotland, Wales and, after the fall of the Roman Empire, throughout Europe. At least one US group is trying to use this approach today with our 'Neo-barbarians' and is having some success.

The advice given is rock solid, practical, and inspiring. It is applicable to all: young, old, men, women, atheists, priests. While firmly rooted in Catholicism, the practicality of the Golden Rule doesn't discriminate based on creed.One of the reviewers took the book to task for lacking scriptural quotes. I don't think he read the book carefully. Each chapter includes a scriptural notation in the header, and the text itself is peppered throughout with scriptural notations.

What he presents comes from the sacred texts, the documments of the Church, and from his personal experiences.I believe that you will find in these pages a source of purpose and a sense of resolve for priests to lead lives of genuine commitment to the promises and vows made at their ordination, no matter how many years ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terribly disappointed","review":"Terrible experience.

The author takes significant liberty in coming to conclusions concerning why certain events happened as they did. Many conclusions are his thoughts, no fact. I felt early on in the book that the author was out to take Jefferson down a couple of notches in historical significance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Study of Jefferson","review":"I like how Ellis approaches his subject--he centers his work on particular events, rather than sheer chronological biography. His research is nearly flawless. However, I find his approach to Jefferson (well, this is true of all modern Jeffersonian biographers) to be biased; he seems almost sarcastic at times, as though he is determined to topple the myth of Jefferson, the man of the people. We are dealing with a complex historical figure, who knew that he would be the topic of much spilled ink--think of what Jefferson did not include among his surviving correspondence. I believe Ellis makes every effort to withhold judgment--another strength of the book, as many biographers don't even try. (I'm thinking of Malone who seemed to worship Jefferson, even though his research and detail is nothing short of amazing.)Perhaps Ellis cannot avoid his impatience with the near deification of Jefferson, but there were times he needed to hold back on his dismissive tone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Informative, but needs a more astute author","review":"How does an ordinary person explain an extraordinary person? I am afraid the two stars are for research and interesting trivia, but not for Ellis' interpretation of the mind of a great man. The complexity of Jefferson's mind seemed to daunt the author at every turn and even a bad interpretation of Jefferson's motivations would have been preferable to Ellis' continually clearing his throat at the crucial moment and moving on to something less (to him) awkward."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth reading despite author's credibility issues","review":"I am not a fan of TJ, but I found this book to be very balanced--a \\"warts and all\\" type of biography. This book is not a biography in the strict sense, in that it does not attempt to cover every aspect of TJ's life. Instead Ellis uses several episodes in TJ's career to illustrate the many inconsistencies and hypocriscies that characterize this founder's life. Since the book was written pre-DNA, the treatment of Sally Hemmings is somewhat dated now, but I still found this to be an excellent read and an interpretive bonanza."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ellis Dislikes Jefferson","review":"Ellis try's to intellectualize why we (Americans) irrationally like Jefferson.Let me take a leap like Ellis does with his many \\"Leaps of Faith\\" about Jefferson and say that Adam's would think this book is an unfair attack on his friend and soul-mate.Imagine what Adams would eloquently say in this Amazon comment space to Ellis. Read this knowing he does not like Jefferson."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Character - What a Character! - of Joe Ellis","review":"I'll bet that 90% of earlier reviewers who gave this book high marks would retract their ratings in light of the author's exposure as an habitual fabricator of \\"history.\\" This book should be recategorized as \\"historical fiction.\\" What a hack! Ellis deserves to be sued by the publisher, the purchasers of the book, and the American people for fraud. At least we have the satisfaction of knowing that this man's false witness has finally caught up with him. Due to the uncanny timing of Ellis' groundbreaking 1998 report, \\"Jefferson Fathered Slave's Last Child\\" -- just a few weeks before the House vote on Clinton's impeachment -- I recommend that all extant copies of Ellis' books be donated to the Clinton Lie-brary."},{"rating":"1","title":"An american stinx","review":"I have read quite a few slow books but this really tops it off. It is a slow and boring book. Ellis portrays Jefferson, an American hero, as bland as Fiber One."},{"rating":"1","title":"Author has questionable ethics","review":"The Boston Globe has exposed Mr. Ellis as a liar for his fabrications about his non-service in Vietnam, his bogus stories of civil rights protests in the South, bogus accounts of playing high school football and fabrications of helping David Halberstand with his book.Ellis never served in Vietnam and he smeared Thomas Jefferson with bogus claims. He tarnishes the good name of men who actually fought and died in Vietnam. Disgraceful. Avoid anything written by this man."},{"rating":"1","title":"American Sphinx","review":"I am a well educated person with a particular interest in Jefferson. I was amazed at the assertion by Ellis that Jefferson formed the republican party. The republican party was not established until 1854. The party the Jefferson formed evolved into the democratic party. Are we living in the soviet union now? if you don't like real history you just change it. How do I get my money back on his piece of crap book? I knew this guy has a history of stretching the truth but I didn't know it went this far!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Misrepresentation","review":"I have read most of the major books on Jefferson, and have now finally finished this one. What an awfully misguided, opinionated, and prejudiced piece of work. This book misrepresents Thomas Jefferson. It gravely misses the mark. Shame, that those who select books for awards can obviously be so misled. There's no wonder its called \\"American Sphinx\\". I don't recommend it to anyone who does not wish to be wrongly disillusioned about America, especially during this time when terrorists and much of the world challenge American virtue. I recommend the Remick book here in Amazon.com's listings on Thomas Jefferson (called \\"West Point:...Thomas Jefferson\\") for a clear understanding of Jefferson, because it is drawn from what Jefferson himself read and wrote throughout his lifetime, not on opinions written about him."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Dry, Slow Presentation","review":"I hate to take exception to the glowing reviews of this bookposted by others, but I would summarize it thus: \\" Took offin water, cruised in molasses, and landed in tar\\". The more I read,the more it dragged. I found that it left more questions unansweredthan answered, and provided an incomplete view of some of themore interesting aspects of Jefferson's social and political life.I was looking for a good all-round, comprehensive book on Jeffersonwhen I heard of and read this book. I still am"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thomas Jefferson Survives","review":"If you've read about the Founding Fathers, you can't help but notice that Thomas Jefferson has an eerie elusive quality that the others just don't seem to possess. You can figure out Ben Franklin, George Washington, James Madison, etc.. Jefferson, however, seems to be someone who you can't quite pin down or so easily lay claim to by today's standards. As was once said of William James, \\"He's just like a blob of mercury, you cannot put a mental finger upon him.\\" It probably has something to do with, as Ellis states in the book, the fact that he was far more inclined to rhetoric and theory than he was to the tedious gears of hand-on politics.I was expecting this book to cross the line in relation to dragging Jefferson into the present and beating him up a bit, but it kept within reasonable boundaries without either unrealistic hero worship or a foolish attempt at character assasination. Very readable and informative."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Book on a Fascinating Founding Father","review":"Ellis is becoming my favorite biographer. This book is an excellent book on Jefferson because, as the title suggests, it neither lionizes nor condemns Jefferson but rather approaches him as a notoriously complex and very real human being. Ellis has a keen sense of what we want to know and answers the questions that we all have about Jefferson: What was going through his mind when he wrote the Declaration of Independence? What's the latest on the Sally Hemings controversy? What kind of country did Jefferson want America to be and how much of his vision was realized? What kind of personality did he have? How could a slave-holder say that all men are created equal? All these questions and more are answered in this relatively small book.John Adams was right. Thomas Jefferson not only survives but is alive and well and more mischivously paradoxical than ever!"},{"rating":"2","title":"american sphinx","review":"this book, along with everything else I have read of Joe Ellis are must reads. Very indepth presentation of the 3rd president and very, very well written. Highly recommend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good.","review":"I enjoyed this biography thoroughly. A lot of valuable insights into Jefferson's thought and personality were given, especially in the sections pertaining to his Philadelphia and Paris years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entry point for Jefferson","review":"This book is a good entry point for a look into the man who was Thomas Jefferson. He is one of the most influential founding fathers of the USA and any serious historian cannot get through American history without studying Jefferson.Jefferson was a man who wanted to free slaves, but still owned slaves. He wanted personal freedom to trump government intervention, but used the government for the Louisiana purchase. He thought a revolution was good every once in a while but did not like the turns that the French revolution took. Contradictions, brilliance all were a part of this man.This book is well written. Ellis is a master-historian and I enjoy his books. I can't say I formed a stronger opinion of Jefferson after reading this book, but I can relate to him more after studying his life. We all have contradictions in what we believe, we all are not perfect, same as Jefferson.Good book - JVD"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sphinx Stinks","review":"I did not enjoy this book. I was looking for a comprehensive review of Jefferson's life and theories. To his credit, the author makes an attempt at a balanced analysis of Jefferson's thoughts and influences. That is more than most other authors provide. The large and significant omissions of key events in Jefferson's life, however, are the biggest disappointment in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shoddy character assassination","review":"Prof. Ellis, who was finally caught last year in his long time lie of having served in Vietnam, presents as an indisputable fait accompli Jefferson's alleged fathering of a child with Sally Hemings. In fact, all that was revealed by the DNA evidence was that Hemings's youngest son, Eston, was likely fathered by one of the more than two dozen Jefferson males in the area at the time. Most likely is Jefferson's much younger brother Randolph, rather than Jefferson who was in his mid-60s when Eston was born. Recently a distinguished panel of over a dozen Jeffersonian scholars provided a detailed analysis on this issue and their conclusions ranged from strong skepticism to the belief that the charges were almost certainly false. Nevertheless, Ellis continues to propagate his jealous libel. His extreme personal bias taints this book and makes a reader wonder what other facts he has misreprensented."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should head own advice","review":"The author starts the book by warning that it is a tired subject which will make it hard to present anything new. At least with this book he was correct. He seems to be intimidated by his subject and has a very immature and insidious way of being derogatory towards TJ without any proof. Without the massive cut and paste sections this book would be very short and the author would (and does anyway) come across as extraordinarily insecure.In the end the author fails absolutely to figure out that TJ was a master politician though often times the reluctant and multi-faceted politician. He goes on and on towards tediousness trying to understand certain behaviors that to even a casual observer screams \\"politician\\"! If you want to learn alot about the insecurities of the author this a great book, but for insights or interesting perspectives on TJ I would look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Biography Bogged Down from the Beginning","review":"After visiting Monticello and watching the Ken Burn's Special on Thomas Jefferson I was eager to read this biography but was sorely disappointed in this one, as it starts off slow and is an uphill read from there. Sorry but I have to give this one two thumbs down!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A brief comment","review":"Having read Ellis's work on Washington, His Excellency, I thought I'd try this one too. I found I enjoyed this book as well. Ellis's books manage to dispense a great deal of quality information in only about 270 pages. I understand that one needs to read the more voluminous works by other scholars to get a truly rigorous background on these subjects, but for busy people who don't have the time to plough through such voluminous academic works, Ellis's well written and engaging books are a good compromise. For such a comparatively brief work, it dispenses a lot of quality information in under 300 pages. And if you wish, they can serve as a springboard to the weightier volumes such as those by McCullough, Issacson, and others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitive Analysis of Jefferson's Mind","review":"Arugably the most enigmatic of the founding fathers--extremely brilliant, yet highly contradictory. Ellis does a masterful job of narrating Jefferson's career from his early years to after his presidency. In this study the reader walks away angry at Jefferson for not being the light in the darkness of things such as the issue of slavery. However the reader walks away with great affection for the man as was an extraordianry figure."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I wanted to read a textbook...","review":"Sadly disappointed in this book. It read like a textbook without a thread to string the sections together. There was a great deal of insight into TJ's life, but compared to a book like Fischer's Washington's Crossing that brings a founding father to life Ellis cannot compete."},{"rating":"1","title":"Author tries but fails to reveal or discover anything new.","review":"Last month we discussed this book in my History Book discussion group. Those unfamiliar with other workers on Jefferson or who are not historians will find it interesting and enlightening but historians and those who have read or studied other works will find much of the material a repeat of much that is found in other works over the years. Van D. Caldwell, esq."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clash of Titans between Theory and Practice","review":"Unlike David McCullough in his superb \\"John Adams\\", Joseph J. Ellis has a hard to get into style that does turn Thomas Jefferson into a sphinx. The audience can have a difficult time to understand the similarities and differences existing between Jefferson and John Adams. Jefferson was a study in contradictions. He was often not practicing what he was preaching. For that reason, many people can reasonably claim to be the spiritual heirs of Jefferson."},{"rating":"2","title":"I M Pei : Mandarin of Modernism","review":"This is an academic book on IM Pei.

Daniel R. Gustin the manager of Tanglewood has written the first essay entitled \\"in my end is my beginning\\" and Tim Page has written \\"Bernstein: The Final Concert\\". Bernstein is no Von Karajan but still a very accomplished conductor in his own right. Being a Deutsche Grammophon recording the sound is impeccable. Recommended. 4/5."},{"rating":"1","title":"Historical but not memorable","review":"Although this CD has historical significance, and those in attendance will probably treasure the experience forever, let's face it, the performance of the Beethoven 7th is average at best.

Britten's 4 Sea Interludes are also performed at a leisurely pace, but the performance hangs together better, and emotionally, is more captivating."},{"rating":"1","title":"sentimental yet awful","review":"This recording has historical and sentimental value, but it is one of the worst performances of the Beethoven 7th that I have ever heard. It just drags on to the point that I thought it was never going to end. Indeed, it was taken so slowly that the orchestra members themselves seemed to be struggling to stay awake. There is no emotion in this performance. It just keeps going and going and going......Get this CD for the sentimental value, but don't bother listening to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"No more stars to give","review":"I have only just discovered this recording and am stunned by the quality of the playing.OK the recording is slightly marred by the shuffling and coughing of a live performance but what magnificent playing.Having read the earlier reviews I was expecting the Beethoven to be a dirge and bought the CD as a 'homage' to Lenny, but I think it is probably one of the most intense recordings of Beethoven's 7th I have heard - full of tension and vitality.Don't be fooled, despite his physical frailty this Beethoven is inspired both in terms of conducting and instrumental playing. The orchestra knew this was Lenny's final appearance at Tanglewood and absolutely played their socks off - and Lenny knew exactly what he was doing with the slower tempos. There are so many phrases that leap out a bring new light and shade.The Britten is wonderful to - but the Beethoven recording should be heard by everyone (at least once)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sha Na Na always delivers!","review":"If you love rock'n'roll music from the '50s, this one's for you!

Domingo is a very good Cavaradossi, but a little vague dramatically. Freni and Ramey are where the show lies on this set. Ramey is a Scarpia like no other -- dignified and noble, commanding respect through his presence instead of by barking at people. Freni sings beautifully and powerfully, with dramatic conviction and some gorgeously spun pianissimi. Sinopoli's conducting is disctinctive (as usual) without being distracting.

Now on this particular watch, it would change the day of the week at 2am (English title) and then change again at 4am (Spanish title).

What I did was read them on the Citizen web page while waiting for my order to arrive. Make sure you charge the watch outside in the sun is best or under a lamp (not too close!) for a few hours with the crown fully out. Once that's done setting the time is a matter of following the product instructions (the thick booklet!).

The characters in this one were developed a little better, and I thought the interaction with the Musth made for a more exciting story than did the conflict with the Raum. But the book still had problems with the culture and slang that seemed made up and forced, but maybe that is just a personal preference. This one at least made me want to read the next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"typical Bunch","review":"It is enjoyable easy reading.

Bought it for the look and good reviews at that time.The machine worked OK, not great, for the first 2 years. Very limited amount of crema. Tried with and without the attached \\"disc\\" but didn't see any difference. The espresso itself tasted OK, not as good as my other machine.The steam function worked fine. It shoots out cold/warm water for about 5 to 10 seconds and the temperature drops therefore you need to wait for the machine to heat up again before you can really froth the milk.After 2 years, the brew function didn't work any more though steam function still worked fine. I guess it is pump. I guess it is not worth the money (two way shipping and the repair charge) to fix it. Now, I only use it for frothing the milk. Not a good use for >300 bucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Longer Brews","review":"After maybe about 20 uses over the past couple years, it no longer brews.

BAD Machine","review":"It is clear that the November reviewers are all the same person... loser!Anyway, this machine is not easy to use, leaks, very wet foam... bla bla yuck!I opted for a Breville... the die cast 800ESXL and immediately noticed the ease and consistency. Of course my best recommendation is a Rancilio Silvia for home (friend has one) but it is labour intensive, have to wait for the boiler to heat up after pulling your shot... etc... if you want consistency in taste, ease of use, and good steam on command... do not buy this machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Delonghi Disappointment","review":"While the machine has an impressive look, it does not boast the kind of pump power needed to get a good extraction. The machine was light weight compared to better quality machines. My last machine was a Starbucks Barista and the Delonghi does not compare favorably in any way. I returned this machine and purchased a Breville in which I am very pleased. I would not recommend this machine to buyers."},{"rating":"1","title":"STAY AWAY!!!!","review":"After about 8 months of weekend use (about 12 shots per weekend), the pump died. All the other negatives stack up very quickly after using my new Breville 840XL! After treating myself to the new Breville this weekend, I realized just how messy this machine is to operate. Soupy grounds, leaky head after making coffee, very small water reservoir capacity, shallow drip tray (when combined with the leaky head is just plain messy!), the filter basket that seemed to always disconnect from the handle and stick to the head, etc. etc. etc. I paid $400 for this machine (bought it for looks as it was my first machine), and it is a total ripoff! Stay away from the Espressione. I still have it in my basement and dont have the heart to throw it away even though the pump is shot."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a let down!","review":"well I anxiously awaited the arrival of my new Espressione Retro today and was utterly dissapointed when I tried to steam 2 cups of milk for a latte. Although as promised the machine does not take long to heat up to 100C for espresso and 150C for frother, it has a tiny boiler. It gives good initial steam but it is very short lived. It requires waiting again and again to heat up a small amount of liquid. It took me 4 rounds of lever lifting and waiting to heat and froth the 2 cups of milk. (Simply unacceptable)could have saved a lot of time heating on stove top and finishing with Aerolatte handheld frother.The espresso was pretty good but filter holder is cheap and assembly-oriented."},{"rating":"1","title":"after 18 months, i tossed this in the dumpster","review":"Sure, it looks great. I bought this machine 18 months ago. What a pain! And an expensive one to boot! It was always a guess to determine the proper temperature, ground of bean, how much bean to put in the thing-a-ma-bob, how long to hover as it kept brewing brewing brewing or steaming steaming steaming. Dripped all over creation. Sputtered coffee grinds all over creation, sometimes in an explosive fashion that got all over everything with a resounding pop. Ran out of water with every latte. And, to add insult to injury, it started to rust out. Ugh. It is the very last thing you need in the morning as you are getting ready to face the day. So glad to toss it in the dumpster and replace it with something more reliable.

It is beauty to look at, and at it first it worked well. However, within a year I began having problems, same as other reviewers. I had to replace the filter holder because it fell apart after 15 months ($30, not a huge deal). I had the same problem with frequent refills, a lot of mess, and the older it got, the more things began to drip and fall apart.It no longer brews espresso. The pump is probably broken, not worth repairing, and not a Do It YourSelf. If I had unlimited counter space, I might leave it out to use as a steamer, but it is messy, and takes almost 3 minutes to get up to 150 degrees F. I have replaced it with a new machine (Breville Venezia), about the same price, looks beautiful, more features, and we'll see how well it works after the 1-year warranty is over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a winner","review":"First off, this machine LOOKS great. But unfortunately, that's where the attraction ends. You see, I too used a little Krups $45 espresso machine for years. But it was a heck of a lot easier to use, and made consistently better espresso/cappucinno than this dog. Here's a brief synopsis.The reservoir holds enough water for just a couple of days. I'm constantly refilling it. After making an espresso, the thing leaks out coffee drippings for minutes on end, making a mess of the whole machine. The steamer seems to spurt out as much water as it does steam. The lever that dispenses the steam does not move in a fluid fashion. And positioning the coffee holder pod thingy is downright cumbersome.Did I mention the thing leaks? Now you might forgive the little bugger if it made amazing capuccino............... it doesn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"work good - for 1 year","review":"This machine was lovely, until the 1 year warranty expired. Coffee doesn't come out anymore. We followed instructions to repair it, but it suggested to return for repairs, which is in New Jersey. They can't tell us how much it will cost to repair until they have the machine in their shop and since is just shy over the 1 year warranty, we will have to pay for the shipping and the repair cost whatever that may be. So, we are wondering if it may be better to get some other brand new machine instead of repairing this one. This is not a good experience after paying over $300 for a machine like this. Your expectations should be that at least it will work for a little longer than that."},{"rating":"1","title":"a weakling espressione","review":"After reading all the other rave reviews, I thought I had found the dream machine!...but...alas my old Krups, though slightly on the down side of it's brewing and steaming life, does a much...I mean, MUCH better job of giving me a strong tasty latte every morning.

Soooo, my recommendation is to not buy this machine if you like a really rich espresso, and a really foamy, hot latte."},{"rating":"1","title":"really bad machine","review":"Terrible. I have used home espresso machines for over 10 years, never had an experience like this - the machine abruptly stopped brewing less than 3 months after I bought it.

Maybe if you like Blair Witch & District 13, you'll like it but it just felt like a bunch of scattered, not that funny moments to me coarse I was playing a game while watching it.

The heroine tells the story of her journey from northern England to London and then to Jerusalem with the entourage of Richard I. The action is fast-paced, and the heroine is constantly reacting to a continuous barrage of events. Unfortunately, the author never gives her heroine the opportunity to ponder events, emotions, attitudes, anything. The story is all action-reaction, and although the history and setting are interesting, the novel disappoints because there is nothing soul-nourishing about it. There is no beautiful writing here to savor, and no truly charismatic character to cherish."},{"rating":"2","title":"All I can say is wow!","review":"This book has become rather laddered pagged and the pages have become rather dingy from my reading it so often.

The problem with the Definitive Collection is that it collects songs from the Mediocre CDs as well as the good CDs.Most of the songs on this CD bombed at radio; there is a good reason why. People wouldn't listen to songs like \\"Sea of Cowboy Hats\\" for free. Don't make the mistake of paying for them.Instead of this CD, I recommend purchasing \\"Single White Female\\" by Chely.

I can't say I'm an Eddie Griffin fan (mainly because I don't think he's very funny) and I'm definitely not a fan of conformist movies and this fell right in there.

This movie fails at every attempt to be funny. I did not laugh once. I am a fan of dumb movies. I loved Zoolander, Kung-Pow was one of my favorite movies, and American Pie wasn't terrible. This movie is terrible. Coincidentally, the only funny part of this stinking piece of [junk] is when the young Dizzy is dancing and falls on his crotch while doing the splits, exclaiming \\"I hurt myself\\" in a James Brown-esque tone. This is how I feel about the movie. Even though I fell asleep for most of it, this movie actually made me depressed it was so not funny and left an empty void of unfunnines in me for a day or two. Really. I don't know why Lyle Lovett and Henry Rollins agreed to be in this movie. I have lost most of my respect for both of them, even though Black Flag was a great band. ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Directors Cut","review":"This movie is FUNNY! If you are looking for a raunchy,rude, and wild movie, The New Guy:Directors Cut is for you. This version is not all that different from the original version. There are a few new scenes, including Gil (DJ Qualls) making out with Eliza Dushku in the sprinklers and some akward talks with Gil, his father, and the councilor . All in all, this is the version to buy, because it has more adult subject matter. And, who doesn't enjoy that?"},{"rating":"2","title":"BETTER THAN AVERAGE TEEN COMEDY!","review":"'The New Guy' offers nothing new, but gets a big boost from its cast. We've seen it all before a million times in those 80'steen comedies. Loser becomes school's top dog and pines for the most popular girl and gets her, then they find out about his \\"loser\\" past and everything unravels. Yeah......we've seen this all before....What could have been a huge dud turns out to be surprisingly funny and charming because of a good cast, an energetic soundtrack and a few differences in the clich��d story line. The quirky DJ Qualls in the title role gives an enthusiastic performance and cutie pie Zooey Deschanel is always a treat. If you like these types of films, this one is much better than I expected it to be. It's not original, but it is a charming entry in the genre.Look for cameos from Gene Simmons, Lyle Lovett, Henry Rollins and Tommy Lee."},{"rating":"2","title":"A geek turns cool? wow!","review":"In this movie DJ Qualls, a typical geek is unpopular in his school.

All the recipes supplied are very high in fat which we try to avoid. We have a flap-jack mix that works very well in the machine. Still looking for a basic recipe that is low in fat that works well. The teflon coating works very well. We have never had one stick and we have never put anything on to make sure they do not stick. A word of caution.

As to the first 4, I brushed the surface with vegetable oil, and on the other 4, I sprayed Crisco vegetable oil on the surface, in each case as per the instructions. The results: 4 split open, on 2 I had to delicately remove the waffles with precision of a surgeon, which was time-consuming, irritating and dangerous, and the other 2 came out perfect.Since my old waffle maker had this problem at the end of its life, it might be inferred that all waffle makers are deficient in this area.

Just slide the skewer under the waffle via the groove in the bottom half of the machine, and lift the waffle out....We love this machine!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Make the beeping stop","review":"My dog is traumatized by all of these beeping appliances.Here is how to make it stop (and void your warranty).Under the data plate on the bottom of the waffler there is a circuit board. Remove it carefully and locate the large round black piezoelectric speaker (it is about the diameter of a dime) See the small hole in it? Locate a small screw from one of your kids broken toys or some such place and screw it in carefully till you hear a click. Now test it; no more beeping.

I AM VERY pleased with this item. The other waffle makers I've had in the past fail to compare this this one. This is a more solid, well built ( if you can say that about a waffle maker) The lid isn't flimsy as in most others I have seen and workmanship is an A+ The waffles come out great. Nice and thick. I would recommened this item . Also, here is a plus.. Amazon.com had the lower price of other sites including local retail."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Waffle Maker","review":"I bought this waffle maker after reading the reviews on Amazon as well as following the recommendation from 'Good Eats' on the Food Network.

Some reviewers are stating that this Villaware Belgian waffler is the waffle iron recommended on the show. It isn't. The iron used on the show is the Villaware V2004 Uno Series Classic Round Waffle Maker Waffler (not the Belgian version). I'm sure they're both good, but they're also different.Just thought some of you guys might want to know. The classic version seems like it is harder to find, but there are still some out there. If Amazon is out, try eBay or even Williams-Sonoma."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Bargain, Terrific Performance!","review":"This is a great waffler for the money! A little cooking spray ensures no-stick performance, but even without it, sticking isn't a problem. It wipes clean with a damp paper towel!

I am very satisfied with this purchase and highly recommend the product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great waffle iron, annoying alarm","review":"This waffle iron makes nice, fluffy waffles using the recipes in the book that accompanies it. You can adjust the doneness, a feature not found on all waffle irons. However, the alert signal to let you know when the iron is ready and when your waffle is ready, is truly annoying. It sounds like a sci-fi \\"red alert\\" signal. Other than that, a great product. We saw it on Alton Brown's \\"Good Eats\\" show on Food Network."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great waffles, annoying beep","review":"There is a lot to like about this waffler, but the most important is simply \\"Does it make good waffles?\\". The answer to that is \\"yes\\", and I am pleased with the crispy exterior and tender interior (I have only used the Golden mix so far, that is available on Amazon too, and really like it).The variable heat setting seems useless to me, because even on the highest setting (7) I still have to leave the waffle in a bit longer to crisp it up to the level I prefer. Anything lower than 7 just seems like it isn't even cooked enough.The worst part to me is the alarm \\"beep\\" which is loud and incessant. I get to hear it when the iron heats up, and every time it reaches temperature. I'm not a morning person to begin with, and listening to that noise is a bit much.Bottom line though, if I want a delicious waffle, this machine comes through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only Cooks Waffle on One Side!","review":"I'm fairly stunned this waffle iron has such a high rating. I could only get it to cook waffles on one side; the second (top) side was undercooked and looked terrible. I was replacing the Cuisinart which flips over and cooks both sides perfectly.Unfortunately, after using this thing once, I ordered another Cuisinart. I'm not sure what sort of waffles people are making, but I always use the yeast-based ones that you make the night before. If that's the type of waffles you make, you'll be very disappointed with this."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was the best waffle maker I have ever used","review":"This was the best waffle maker I have ever used, until it broke.

Only saving grace was the Amazon price was $30 less than Williams Sonama, so throwng it out hurt a little less."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Wafflemaker","review":"I have had this wafflemaker for 2 years.

I do _not_ find the chime the least bit annoying and have _not_ had to set it on the highest level to get my waffles to brown (as some reviewers have stated). As for the crispness of the waffles, any waffle will crisp up when allowed to rest in a slow oven for a few minutes. The waffles I've made had also been delicious toasted the next day. I think the appliance is handsome to look at and works like a charm -- what's not to like! And Amazon prices and service are second to none!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Waffle Maker","review":"My wife and I love this waffle maker.

The round shape provides even heat and even cooking (no under done corners like a square waffle iron). It beeps at you when it is ready to go so you can be doing other things in the kitchen while making waffles and not forget about them. All in all, very nice waffle maker, highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jodypints","review":"This product is great nice small size for storing,easy clean, makes a great waffle. probably will never have to buy another one but if I do It will be the same waffle maker....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Belgian waffles if we go out to brunch...","review":"I certainly have not been disappointed. The instructions on how to use it were clear and the included recipes (that I've tried thus far) are excellent. It makes a perfect waffle in only 3 minutes and they come out so cleanly that the only thing the non-stick surface needs is a quick wipe with a paper towel and perhaps a light sweep with a soft-bristled brush for any remaining crumbs. The cord wraps snugly into place and storage is a breeze since it easily stands up vertically. I would definitely recommend this unit for anyone looking to make such a purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry I bought it","review":"All of the reviews I read said this waffle maker was a great product. I was so disappointed in that it only browns on one side. I've tried flipping it over, leaving it on longer, everything!!

The whole alumnium cover looked dull and looked as though it wasn't polished at all. It sill had black polish compound on certain spots. It also had dents and nicks. The hinge between the top and the bottom was loose and the top had a lateral wiggle room about 1/8\\". To be honest, I was so disappointed with the cosmetics of the waffle maker that I returned the item without even making the waffle so I don't know how the waffles would've came out. I've posted pictures that shows what I'm talking about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy This","review":"Save yourself time and money and do not buy this. I took it out of its box and the first thing I noticed is the 'funny' smell of plastic,etc that seems to be in everything made in China that's rubber,plastic, etc. The metal lid is scratched and roughly made. I'm not going to use it. I've already processed this for return through Amazon and am going to purchase the US made waffle maker though it's about $100 more. That's my '2 cents'.

How were the vines that produced it grown? Who made it and where? How was it harvested and prepared? How was it stored and shipped? How was it kept? Who drank it and what different qualities were available? What were Roman taverns like? Were Roman parties sometimes as wild as we think they were? What did the Romans think about wine? All of these questions, and more, are answered in a very readable text embellished with numerous colorful drawings, charts, photographs and maps. In fact, many of the areas of Europe where great wines are produced today also produced wines under the Romans, and even now not only are some of the grape varieties the same, but some of the growing methods are as well.

It is perhaps one of the most perfect recordings of the piece, combining the fire of Argerich, the musical insight of Richter, and the absolute command of sound and color comparable only to Horowitz.

If you are a serious musician and collector of fine music, I highly recommend getting this recording."},{"rating":"2","title":"simply very good","review":"That's really one of the best Liszt Sonatas I own on CD. It's probably the best, but that's very hard to tell, if you know Horowitz (let's go...), Argerich (see what my Steinway can bear), PLETNEV (maybe the most virtuosic interpretation), Gilels (\\"broad\\"), Curzon (incredibly risky), Cziffra (3 hands), Pogorelich (surprise), etc...What I really like about this CD is the beautiful sound quality of the piano. Also listen to the other tracks, it's so abysmal Liszt-I love it- and you will love it too...."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best so far?","review":"Apparently, Zimerman took 10 years to record a Liszt Sonata that met his approval. So it must be good. And it is. As one would expect from this great pianist, everthing is under control, his fingers move as fast as anyone and all is musical. Argerich brings more fire to the piece, Demidenko a bit more grit and bite, Pletnev forgets to use the pedal, Pollini is good but not as good, but in my opinion, Zimerman gives the best overall account of the sonata. Stephen Hough has just released his recording of the Sonata, and having listened to his other Liszt recording, it may well replace Zimerman's version as the King of all Liszt Sonatas.

Now listening to it trying to figure out what I want to put on my I-pod and I really can't find anything other than the 1st 2 tracks, which are great. The Filter/Crystal Method track is a classic. But beyond that I just find the songs somewhere between mildly interesting and boring. I am a fan of many of the rock & electronic artists here, but this experiment just didn't pan out in my opinion.

Also, Korn team up with the Dust Brothers for my favorite track on this cd, Kick The P.A. Incubus do a song with D.J. Greyboy (I have no clue who he is....) and the song comes up great!

First off, I am not a Manson fan or anything, but I like that type of music, and Long Hard Road Outta Hell really fit this movie (bad as it was), and is a great song. Trip Like I Do has got to be one of the best on there, but since I am the biggest silverchair fan, I think Spawn is the best song outta all of 'em.

The Korn and Dust Brothers song \\"Kick the PA\\" is alright, Tom Morello and Kirk Hammet each kick out the guitar jams in an awesome fashion alongside Prodogy and Orbital, respectively. All in all, this is an interesting CD and is worth a listen. I highly recommend the Judgement Night soundtrack as an even better soundtrack along similar lines.If anything, whether or not this CD was a big hit, Happy Walters deserves some recognition for bringing together musical genres before it was cool to do so. This CD is worth the $10 it costs to buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Of The Best Soundtracks I've Ever Heard","review":"The Spawn soundtrack is great.

It starts out with a mutated version of \\"Trip Like I Do\\", and gets steadily darker and more experimental after that. Kudos to the Spawn team for coming up with the brilliant concept. I love these crossover-style soundtracks - the \\"metal vs. rap\\" soundtrack to \\"Judgment Night\\" is another good one. But \\"Spawn\\" is simply a classic. I also appreciate the fact that they didn't use exclusively mega-selling bands. A desert island disc for any industrial or experimental electronica lover.

The one exception is \\"Skin Up Pin Up\\" by Mansun & 808 State. I've never heard of either group, but there contribution is one excellent rock song.

However, a choral conductor he is not, and the chorus' work in this recording lacks a great deal. Both the Kyrie and Jesu Christe are ponderous where they should be intense, and the ...Sancto is disjointed rather than dancing through the runs. The Qui Tollis has wretched balance between the double choirs, and the chorus in the Gloria is overridden by an intrusive bass drum.As an alternative, I recommend John Eliot Gardiner's recording with the Monteverdi Choir. The solos could perhaps be improved, but the choral movements are unmatched by any other recording."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Highly Recommended Performance","review":"This is a wonderful recording of one of Mozart's most powerful and moving choral works. The soloists, the Bavarian Radio Symphony, and the chorus are all superb. It reminds me of how Bernstein, even in his old age, was able to execute a vibrant, energetic, and wonderful performance.

It came in a cute little box and is beautiful. Fits perfectly, the sizing is accurate. I accidentally bent the band a bit because I punched our table (I don't have anger management issues, I was just messing around XD), but I was able to fix it, and it doesn't seem to have weakened the metal at all, so it is made of good tough stuff.

It fits well and looks terrific. A fabulous deal!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I bought this because not only do I love silver jewelry, I have a tattoo just like it on my right inner wrist.

Service was excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Celtic Knot Band","review":"I purchased another ring from this seller and was very pleased with it and was looking for something else in the Celtic design.

I wear it everyday and couldn't be more please with my purchase. This is an excellent deal for your money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Filigree Celtic Knot Sterling Silver Ring","review":"Quality of the ring is very good. The craftsmanship of the design is superb.

It takes a standpoint of symbolism, not mysticism. Idk if im using the right words, but oh well. I hope you get what I mean. Like, it doesnt say that tarot is fortune telling, but rather, just a way to get advice. And it explains a lot of stuff, especially the symbolism parts. But I agree with the book that every reader should make up their own meanings. That's the beauty of symbolism. If you see the DEATH card as DEATH, then DEATH it is. But if you see it as REBIRTH, the that is what it is. Meanings change. Take the swastika for example. It can mean something completely different from [extreme] national socialism as seen in the Western world, to a meaning related to Buddhism in the Eastern world."},{"rating":"1","title":"bubble gum tarot","review":"I agree with the statements made by \\"pete\\". The book starts out fairly informative, then the description of the cards is simply a hodgepodge of phrases. This could be ok, if it was also accompanied by a full description of the true symbolism of the card. I am completely new to this art, and found most of the book \\"unreadable\\". It is only useful, IMHO, as a reference during a reading. If that's the way you would like to learn, this is the book for you, I prefer a book you can dig into. Overall it did not strike a chord with me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top notch Tarot resource","review":"I found Tony Louis's book Tarot Plain and Simple to be a most excellent source for Tarot information.

This book gives simple words for each card to remember that will get you reading in no time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Written from a different perspective","review":"Anthony Louis approaches the tarot from a different perspective, from that of someone who is a psychologist first and tarot reader second. This gives a fresh approach to the information he provides. While he doesn't stray from the traditional symbology, he does discuss it in a new way. His writing is very easy to understand for new users, and provides interesting perspectives for seasoned readers.One thing I especially liked was his explanation of reversed meanings--for the first time, I was able to see the reversed explanations as extremes of the upright meanings.When I got this book, I felt comfortable getting rid of several of my other tarot books. I think you'll really find this one a good addition to your library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book that is easy to understand....","review":"If you have any interest in learning how to master the art of tarot, I highly recommend this book. It gives you step by step instructions for different spreads, but the best part has to be that it takes every single card and goes over its complete meaning. The title definitely knows what it's talking about. Tarot has never been more plain and simple."},{"rating":"2","title":"At last!","review":"I have always looked through tarot books in shops and never bought them, as they seem either over simplified and short or too complicated. This one is fabulous. It has an unusual layout in that the numbers of the suits are grouped together, but it makes sense as the essence of each number is explained beforehand.When paired with your own intuition, this book can help take your readings and understanding of tarot to a new level.I am very glad that I bought this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Beginning Tarot Students Turned Me On to this Book","review":"My beginning students were showing up to class with this book and I found that their instincts about it were right - it is clear and comprehensive. The author has some wonderfully keen insights, easy to understand card meanings, including reversals, and thought provoking exercises. He used the Robin Wood deck for illustrations, a deck that could be termed a Waite-based deck, and this is refreshing as it is a personal favorite of mine and is one of the most popular decks available -- even after all these years."},{"rating":"2","title":"A delight to read ... clear and illuminating","review":"I have read many books on the Tarot, but this one stands out for its clarity and erudition. Anyone starting on the road to Tarot would benefit from this fine guide. I recommend it highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Thorough and Easy to Understand Card Interpretations","review":"I agree with an earlier post that the wide variety of meanings given for each card can be a little overwhelming for the beginner. However, I also think that this same feature helps beginners to stay open to the possibility of different interpretations and encourages beginners (as the author does explicitly) to find through experience their own meanings for the cards.I started learning the Tarot several years ago relying heavily on this book as one of my primary resources. It's a great reference book to have on hand for its thorough card interpretations. My only two complaints are (1) There are a few typos in the section explaining the Celtic Cross spread, which could lead to confusion; and (2)There isn't enough explanation for how beginners can learn to integrate all the meanings in a spread to give a unified and coherent reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book to Keep On-Hand","review":"I own many, many tarot books, but this is the one I keep next to my deck when I need to check something or get confused on a meaning. It's well laid out and the card descriptions are sorted by number rather than suit. There's also a bit of information on astrology and numerology as it relates to tarot. I'm not a fan of the Robin Wood deck used for illustration (although this deck is extremely popular) but since it's a Rider clone, it will give you a good idea. Overall, a well written book good for both the beginner and the more experienced tarot reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best in my Tarot Collection","review":"Of the 20-odd Tarot references I own, this one is by far the most accurate and is the one I consult most often.

If the Pledge of Allegiance (to The Flag, Of The United States of America) wanted to reference the flag as only the \\"american flag\\", it would have done so.

Although nothing will compare to the original line-up, this longest running line-up of Box, Kerslake, Bolder, Shaw, and Lanzon have come together to bring a truly enjoyable set of 'unplugged' classics. You don't have to be a Heep fan to enjoy this disc. The songs are great, old and new, but mostly old, and the fans clearly show their appreciation. Heep has dusted off some classics that haven't been played in over twenty years: Lonely Road, Wonderlworld, Shadows and the Wind, Circle of Hands, and many more. A truly enjoyable set from one of rock's finest bands."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Deal!","review":"The movie came packaged well. The 1975 dvd was great.

My dermatologist says she recommends this to all her patients with oily skin. You will not be disappointed if you try this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cold Performance","review":"While the Emerson certainly dots its I's and crosses it T's, musically speaking, and has to be commended for accomplishing every nuance appearing on the page, it's what's NOT on the page that's missing. The performance here leaves me cold. They don't seem to bring a depth of personal feeling to the music.Annoyingly, the hyper engineering of the recording volume renders the pianos inaudible and the fortes overpowering, leaving one to constantly turn up the volume and then have to run to turn it down. This is a string quintet, for pete's sake, not a hundred piece orchestra!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Should be on everyone's Desert Island Disc list","review":"I would not have thought that this would be my preferred recording of the Schubert Quintet. When this was released, I was acquainted with the Emerson Quartet through their recordings of the Bartok quartets and also their recordings of the Ives & Barber quartets. That resume did not give me any assurance as to their competence as Schubert interpreters. Also, Rostropovich has never particularly been a favorite cellist of mine. I came to this recording with only moderate expectations.I was pleasantly suprised. The Emerson Quartet has proven to be more than equal to the task and has crafted a sublime performance. This is one of the best Schubert recordings I have ever heard, and deserves to be on everyone's Desert Island Disc list. It certainly is on mine."},{"rating":"1","title":"The shotgun approach to deep musical structure","review":"A pompous and confused application of category theory to music.The math is advanced, and so is the obscurity of the encyclopedic and voluminous prose. This is a pity, since Mazzola makes a number of fascinating and deep observations. Fighting through the dense, barely edited, text to find these gems, however, is an activity best left to the most masochistic of PhD candidates in music theory, especially given the heft and price of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent account","review":"Most recordings of the Turangalila symphony is actually more than worthwhile, but this is definitely one of the front runners. It is less white-hot and emotionally energetic than some of the competitors - on the other hand more detailed and texturally transparent; it is also somewhat quicker, being fitted onto one disc, but insofar as it never sounds rushed, this is no objection. The soloists are also less prominent than on alternative recordings, being more integrated parts of the orchestra than competing against it, something I find advantageous. If I have any objection to the interpretation, it must be that the account can be just a little to soft and gentle sometimes; not analytically cool, but a little tentative (the finale in particular). But the ''Jardin du sommeil d'amour'' is the most beautiful I've heard.. Sound quality is a little distant, but perfectly acceptable. All in all, this is an excellent account and easily recommendable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chung wins big","review":"To my knowledge, Messiaen never met a recording he wouldn't endorse, but this really is a superb recording of what is Messiaen's best known and perhaps best loved work. Chung approaches the score with the attention to fine detail that a complex 20th century score deserves while attaining the sweep and grandeur necessary to make this truly romantic work sing like only it can.Francis Bacon said that in every beauty there is some proportion of strangeness. This beauty fell to earth from the stars, an alien--weird, startling, but wholly organic and fetching in its own chillingly unique way. Who can listen to Jardin du sommeil d'amour and fail to be touched? Chung brings a delicacy and spirituality to the whole that will leave you mesmerized and the contributions of Yvonne and Jeanne Loriod could not be more expert or authentic--no soloists know this score as they do, surely. This is one of the most successful of Chung's DG Messiaen recordings, and that's saying something."},{"rating":"2","title":"superb work and performance","review":"Messiaen himself writes of this performance: \\"This new version, superb from every point of view, can be considered henceforth the definitive account\\". Nothing more needs to be said."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book Explains Middle East","review":"This is a great book if you want to know why the Middle East is the way it is. Jeffrey Goldberg is a great writer. He's funny, but he also explains everything about both Arabs and Jews in a serious way. He knows so much about Israel, the Palestinians and the Bible, and he talks about all of that in this book. I also thought it was a great adventure story! Amazing how much he has seen and been through. A definite must-read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shameless garbage","review":"This is what happens when shameless self-promotion, propaganda and bigotry are passed off a insight. You get something like this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Don't get....","review":"why prior books that are far better researched have the lifespan of milk, while Goldberg who's story is surely contrived, gets five star reviews. Seems like working at The New Yorker and Washington Post trumps...Danny Rubenstein's \\"The People of Nowhere\\"Amira Hass' \\"Drinking the Sea at Gaza\\"and Wendy Orange' \\"Coming Home to Jerusalem\\"...and many others who were deeply engaged journalists drop off the book list. Surely these now out of print books covered the same turf but none are connected to Goldberg's. WHY? Is it all about connections and pr? I think yes. What do you think?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gut-wrenching eye-opener, beautifully written","review":"Goldberg's humor, prose, honesty and pure reportorial genius make Prisoners one of the best works of contemporary non-fiction I have read in many years. His personal account of one of the most intractable global divides of the day is both dramatic and hilarious, without losing the sense of seriousness that pervades all of Goldberg's writing. While readers may not agree with all of his conclusions, they will have to wrestle with the nuance of his assertions, many of which challenge the conventional wisdom about the permanence of the Middle East conflict. A dazzling accomplishment."},{"rating":"2","title":"A word to the wise","review":"If J. K. Rowling's Hogwarts were real, this book would be in the Restricted Section of the library. Professor Snape, Lucius Malfoy and \\"You-know-who\\" would have read it cover-to-cover.While Crowley was an authentic magician, having learned as much as anyone of his generation, his path can be EXTREMELY DANGEROUS to anyone without a solid grasp of the concept of good and evil.I've been studying magic for 20 plus years. Even my most 'out there, hippy-dippy' teacher warned me to give \\"Ol' Uncle Aleister\\" a wide berth.If you're a pure scholar who is only interested in the history of the magical arts, or a \\"White Light Knight\\" who is only studying the Dark Arts to learn how the opposition thinks and works, then by all means study Crowley. Everybody else- you have been warned.Alternately, if you're a Dark Wizard wanna-be, Crowley's works are practically required reading.A point in this book's defense is that it is too dry and technical for the dilletante."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cynics, take heed...","review":"In this day and age of politicians afraid to tell it like it is, it was wonderful to read a book by a man who did. For all the media hyped personal travails, Robert Kennedy was still a political figure unlike any we have today. He not only got people involved with politics but got them excited as well. In this age of \\"dumbing down\\", he knew that the words of Dante, and Camus, and Aeschylus would not necessarily be recognized but would certainly be understood by the masses. Maxwell Taylor Kennedy is to be commended for bringing to light this side of his father, one that has been largely overlooked in the press. Truly an inspirational book for anyone who wants to believe in our government and our politicians again."},{"rating":"2","title":"An inspiring collection","review":"RFK's son has put together a collection of thoughts, quotes, and inspirational material on various topics from life to race relations. I think this book would make a great graduation gift! Also it is a positive book, full of hope and improvement. A great sources for quotes for papers and speeches. I enjoyed learning more about Bobby Kennedy through the words that inspired him to make a difference."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scratching the Surface","review":"A biography this is not, but it does give us insight into the mind of Robert Kennedy. His face is etched in our national conscience, making America wonder what could have been. Through this book, we see the principles he believed.This collection of quotes is taken from RFK's speechs and the private journal in which he collected quotes and ideas. A wide spectrum of ideas is covered from political life to social ideas. Robert Kennedy's social conscience has gone unmatched in the political arena since his life ended.One of the things I most enjoyed about this book is the candid photographs scattered throughout the book. These images show the softer, more personable side of the man. It is the side of the man that Americans were never allowed to see come into fruition.A great quote to end this review is located on p 89. Although it refers to education, I think it is very applicable.\\"All things are at odds when God sets a thinker loose on the planet.\\" Edith Hamilton"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Insight Into His Thoughts","review":"I liked this book. I give this book 5 stars. This book gave me the chance to read some of his thoughts that he had recorded in his personal journal(daybook). One quote that I really liked is \\" I know there is a God and that he hates injustice. I see the storm coming and I see His hand in it. If He has a place and part for me, I am ready\\". For me, it has renewed my sense that I as well as my country need to get up from the sleep or the spell we our under that has led us down the wrong path, and get active again in trying to get this country on the right path."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspirational-Politicians can and do have values.","review":"This was a very nice collection of thoughts and inspirations of the late Sen. Robert Kennedy. It renewed a hope that politicians can truly be out for the little guys. Sen. Robert Kennedy's words made you want to get out and make a difference in the world. Sen. Kennedy taught us of kindness and a need to help our fellow man yet also for each of us to take responsibilty for ourselves. As someone who was only little when the senator was assasinated I found it interesting how the words and messages of over 30 years ago could apply so well to our situation today.

It applies extinction-based theory to children - stating that if you stop going to them when they cry they will stop crying. It even advises you to ignore vomiting, or head-banging, and use a crib tent or door lock if necessary. There is something deeply disturbing about such a theory. While this may result in a child who allows the parents to sleep undisturbed I question the emotional and psychological results of such a method. There are several much newer books on the topic which appear to be based on current research and theory and present more humane approaches to an age-old problem - getting children to sleep: The No-Cry Sleep Solution and Sweet Dreams."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book made me cry!!","review":"Please before you buy this book, know that the method is to let your child cry themselves to sleep. Babies need their parents. All a baby knows is that they need someone to be with them. When a child cries him/her self to sleep night after night all they learn is that mommy or daddy does not care if I scream. They learn to shut down and not even ask for help. Crying is a babies way of saying they need something.There are ways to get your children to sleep. Try Nighttime Parenting By William Sears. I had a child who woke a lot and I know where you are coming from but all this book does is teach you to turn off your feelings when your child screams. it is horrible listening to them scream. Their cries are supposed to bring us to them."},{"rating":"1","title":"They Are Called Needs For A Reason","review":"A baby has needs that this book completely ignores in a way that can be harmful to the infant's physical and emotional development.Most pediatricians would not recommend letting a newborn go more than 3 to 4 hours without eating. Many older babies wake up hungry at night as well. To ignore a baby's need to be fed is equivalent to neglect.A baby also needs to have his cries answered to learn that he can depend on and trust his parents. To ignore this need is to teach your baby that you cannot be trusted,and that the world is a frightening place. Ignoring an infant's need for emotional comfort and security is neglectful at best, abusive at worst.Parents who care about their children's needs will be better off using the methods in Elizabeth Pantley's \\"The No-Cry Sleep Solution\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alone in the dark, my cries unanswered...NOT a solution!","review":"The only thing that crying yourself to sleep does for your baby is make him tense, nervous, anxious and insecure. Not only does this method NOT work, but you have to repeat it every time your child goes through any kind of developmental change. Try \\"The No Cry Sleep Solution\\" by Elizabeth Pantley. I got my unsleeping child to sleep using her methods with no tears and no problems.

I was ready to give up breastfeeding because I thought his sleep (or lack of) problems were related to gas and not enough calorie consumption. Ferber's graphs of a normal sleep pattern were right on with my son's night wakings. Do you and your child a favor and figure it out with this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"It really does work!","review":"I have 9 months twins and My wife and I were just frustrated. On average, we used to spend around 1.5 hours just to put our kids to sleep not including the time before putting kids to sleep like bathing our kids, change diapters, feeding them etc and then also they would get up atleast couple of times during night.After reading just couple of chapters and putting the techniques at work, we are suprised and satisified with the results. Our kids now know how to put themselves to sleep on their own and do not get up even once during entire night. That also gives a full-night sound sleep.Thank you Dr.ferber.

They fought going to bed at night, we thought it was time to move to big beds. That only made matters worse. For 4 months we struggled with them constantly gettting out of bed at bedtime and waking in the night. Finally I bought this book. What a life saver! Dr. Ferber's techniques are wonderful and teaches the child that they have a part in what happens. We were unprepared for toddler bedtime troubles, but this book explained everything.

Ferber tries to reassure us that its okay to make our kids cry for increments at a time and make them feel as if no one really cares. This is an outdated book for a time when we need a more gentle approach to putting our kids to bed. They are really only children, and when we make them think that their parents aren't there for them anymore, who will they be able to trust? People follow Dr. Ferber's method when they are tired of nurturing their kids to sleep.

He was getting up and eating, getting up and inconsolable, not able to nap, it got very bad. He has had to cry for long periods of time, though---50 minutes, then 40 minutes, then 35----so don't assume that it will only take 15 minutes or so. We went into another room, turned on the music and went into his room when our timer went off. Definitely helps not to hear him cry at all.

We have had a very tough time the past two months with no sleep and this was our last resort. I could relate to what he was saying in the book. I was using too many sleeping aids to get my daughter to sleep. (Rocking, TV, a bottle). She cried - sure, but not hysterically. When she was crying I read his book again to reassure myself.

That is responding to a baby's crying. When a baby cries - something is wrong. That might mean simply that a baby needs to be held and loved longer. Ferber's method tells baby that nightime is scary, dark, and that love and affection is gone until morning. Ferber goes against common sense. His method may work but it is cruel and insensitive.

Babies yearn to be near to their parents, especially at night. To put a child alone in a cage, in the dark, and then to call this child's anxiety and tears \\"sleep problems\\" is inhumane in the extreme. Most societies on this earth keep babies near their parents at night, in their bed. All other mammals sleep in the same manner, too, cuddled up to their young. This is normal and what every infant craves and expects to feel safe.Read Ferber if you want to know what NOT to do with a sensitive, defenseless baby!

I must say that it does not support my parenting styles though. I believe that a baby should be sharing a room with his parents. It allows for the simplicity of anything from breastfeeding to having reasonable sleeping patterns. I also don't agree with his views of a child needing to \\"accept separation from you\\". I would like to ask \\"for what reason?\\" Is it so your children can learn to accept early on that no one will be there for him. I'm sure that Richard Ferber, M.D. is a wonderful person and probably a loving parent, but i do not accept his views.

It's about teaching the child that she can rely on herself to get back to sleep.It does help if both parents are equally committed to the program, or else you'll be having some very tense discussions at 3:00 AM -- a friend says \\"The most important technique, and it's not in the book, is the gentle tackle.\\" Other than that, this was perhaps the most useful baby book we've had."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book should be called \\"Torture your baby and Yourself\\"","review":"This book made me so angry I actually cried.

My pediatrician recommended the method as well, but didn't push it, saying that we should wait until we were really ready. It only took two nights for him to learn to settle down to sleep easily, and now he sometimes dives into the crib when he's sleepy, rather than fighting to stay out of it. I really think that it was the best choice for him. He definitely doesn't seem to show any signs of lack of attachment or clinginess.

Our relationship over the next few weeks suffered tremendously, and his behavior became intolerable. I read this book on my doctor's advice, and feel very strongly that it should not be recomended. I now sit or lie down with my son to send him off to sleep, often reading or online, and my presence comforts him. After reading much of the Dr. Sears parenting series, I practice many of the attachment parenting strategies for sleep and discipline, and I have found that our relationship has just kept improving.

However, I question what this does to the parent/child bond and to the baby's view of the world. Furthermore, many of my support group friends who Ferberized took several weeks of torment until their baby was sleeping better, and many of the mothers cried through the process. And then they seem to regress quite often and have to do the crying-it-out process again and again.

At first I was comfortable with the idea, but after a while my gut said try something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Old, outdated information","review":"This book is 18 years old and the scientific data upon which it was based is now outdated. The recommendation to let your baby lay in his crib and cry to sleep because it's the only way to get him to sleep no longer applies. There are many other options to better sleep for babies and parents. Our generation has learned so much in the past 18 years and it's wise to take advantage of new research and information, and it's much easier on both parents and baby too. I liked a new book (2002) called The No-Cry Sleep Solution, Gentle Ways To Help Your Baby Sleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"there are better ways of getting a good nights sleep","review":"Please, before you read this book, consider Merideth Small's new book \\"Our Babies, Ourselves.\\" Children are biologically designed to sleep with adults. It may not be in our culture, but for our babies sakes, we can change our culture. Trust me. I became a 3rd time mother at 43, via c-section. If anybody ever craved a good nights sleep, it was me. The baby sleeps in our bed and everybody is happy. She wakes up, nurses and goes back to sleep. I used Ferber with my 2nd child and I'm still apoloogizing 11 years later. This is not, repeat, not in any way the proper method for getting babies to sleep.Sure, Ferber's a doctor, but so was Mengele."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book","review":"I borrowed this book from a friend and used the \\"techniques\\" in the book and was so pleased that I bought several copies for friends. Everyone that used it was amazed how quickly their children started sleeping on their own. The trick (and downside, if there is one) is that you have to do what the book says. If you fudge even a little bit you have undermined what you are trying to do. The good thing is that it really does only take 3 nights to get results. Most of my friends read the book and said, \\"There is no way this will work with MY child\\" but they were so desperate that they tried it and were thrilled that they did. They really couldn't believe that it was so simple."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tried it, now have a 7 year old that won't sleep","review":"When my daughter was a year old I decided to \\"Ferberize\\" her. She would sleep fine with us, but I thought it was time for her to \\"move out.\\" I followed the guidelines and she did go to sleep after about 3 hours of crying. I continued until a month later when I couldn't take it anymore. By then though she wouldn't sleep with us anymore, so my husband had to sleep in a different room altogether with her. To get her to sleep required laying down with her for 1-2 hours. She finally began going to sleep independently at 5, but she still resists sleep and lays for hours in the dark and gets up at the crack of dawn. She's severely sleep deprived, but won't sleep. I wish I had never doubted my instincts and just let her grow out of our bed on her own time. I listened to my instincts with my next 2 and they have no sleep problems whatsoever. They hit the bed and they're out like a light (in their own bed)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware this seller","review":"First, the lamp looks nothing like the picture.

The flow of ideas is so natural that there are times when you can even read the book like a novel. The exposition is clean, and the proofs are elegant.However, keep in mind that this book IS a GTM. Hence, it requires pre-requisites by way of approximately a year of abstract algebra. As the author says in the preface, it's possible to read a the first 11 chapters without it. However, to appreciate the beauty of the theory, I would sincerely recommend algebra as pre-req.The first 12 chapters can be considered 'elementary' (not easy, just fundamental). The others are specialized algebraic topics. For instance, the chapter on elliptic curves is useful to get a flavor of the subject.

He was not published on merit, but rather by his daddy. I've met Dilly and he is in no way deep or sincere, preferring to brag about the girls he supposedly slept with or the modeling competitions he's in. (model?! please) His poems are lacking in any type of talent or insight, more resembling the monosyllabic ryhme schemes and simple meter of a 5 year-old. His empty poetry is a reflection of his empty life and personality. A BOY who has never faced hardship of any kind should not have the audacity to publish a book and pretend he's Maya Angelou.

I find his writing to be shallow. I acknowladge that at the age of 16 a person may still have a lot of room to grow, however I feel that Geoff has not permitted himself to do anything besides feel and express these narrow feelings. There is much more to life than love, loss, angst, and depression. Geoff has certainly put forth his greatest effort in producing this book and I certainly respect him for that. However, one may argue that the same effort may be put into a diary and kept away from the public. Regardless, Geoff needs to mature and look beyond his narrow scope of life before he writes another book. I applaud his efforts, but I pray that this will not in the future become an example of American literature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insightful..Thoughtful...An Enjoyable Adventure","review":"Geoffrey Dilenschneider is a bright young man who has a poetic and masterful way of writing.

Each performance before an audience at the Esterhazy Castle is preceded by a talk with demonstrations about the work in question which, in turn, is preceded by a bit of film about Haydn and the Esterhazys. The good news is that all performances are first rate and stand up well to some rather stiff competition on CDs. The sound is quite good and the camera angles for the performance OK and, in general, watching Schiff in action added to my enjoyment; although I would have prefered a few less shots of Schiff's hands as seen from below the keyboard. The concert was done in 2005. The only bad news is that I have yet to find a way to just play the concert without the film or talks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good characters, bad science","review":"Like the other reviewers, I read this book as a kid in 1959. Unlike them, I cannot recommend it. Although the characters are likeable, the story is crippled by the fact that the author is almost entirely clueless about computers. Of course in the Fifties, unlike now, this was true of most people, so the author's ignorance is understandable--but the many conceptual errors in the plot really hurt the storyline, and are likely to make young modern-day readers cringe with embarrassment--or simply discard the book, unfinished."},{"rating":"1","title":"Country Serenity is a RIP OFF!!","review":"I am (WAS) a big Phil Coulter fan and I'm shocked that he would resort to this type of deception!

There are only about 3 songs I would consider country, maybe not even that many.

I had hoped after having her little brother (now 1 1/2) that he would be interested in it but he does not care for it either.

Where was Bert Kling and his new love? Formerly a new 87th precinct novel would keep me spellbound, but now I found myself wondering when this boring story would end.Why did Mcbain write such a boring novel? Does he want out after almost fifty 87th precinct novels? Perhaps the answer is \\"yes\\". However,I really hope that Mr Mcbain will delight us with many more of his fine novels.

The writing prosaic. The story line well crafted. The style refreshing. Then I jumped down to this book. What a difference. Mr. McBain seems to have fallen into the morass of ho hum writing that caters only to the shock element that unfortunately has become prevalent with so many mystery writers. Or is it the malady of losing interest in telling a good story well? Perhaps he got lazy. His overuse of vulgar language is almost comical. It's much like immature boys trying to out cuss one another. The jerky story lines are difficult to keep straight. And the stupid nun jokes by the idiotic fool detective... Why go on? I'll return to the earlier books in sequence and when it becomes apparent that Mr. McBain is no longer interested in good writing and telling a good story, I'll stop."},{"rating":"2","title":"keeps you guessing","review":"I love Ed McBain & the 87th are the best.

There are also tons of tidbits you never needed to know: A compendium of every \\"Holy...!\\" utterance that ever escaped Burt Ward's breathless lips, for instance, and an inventory of the bat-gadgets used in each episode.What's best about the Batbook, though, is the behind-the-scenes insights gleaned from original interviews with Alan Napier (the show's trusty Alfred), several writers, and bit actors who played henchmen to the featured baddies.

Somehow, Wired Magazine articles are better than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love Easy but,","review":"I love Easy but this used tape had a couple of gaps in it. I took this on a trip to Dallas from KC. On the third stories the tape was a little garbled. their was also some blank spots. Otherwise it played fine.

I would purchase additional stories but i would prefer it if they were on CD.Walter Mosley's Easy Rawlins Mysteries"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great combination of writer & reader","review":"Walter Mosley's Easy Rawlins books are my favorites, although I read all his books & short stories. The characters, the setting - LA over several decades past - the events & issues, & especially the reflections on the events, all come together in Mosley's talented words to create many-faceted, deeply felt stories of life in all its complexities & contradictions. A wonderful author presented through a talented actor/reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"lucia without high notes?","review":"Domingo is fine in this et, but Studer is dreadful..her off pitch singing is a labor to listen to, and her weird mad scene without e flats is not very rewarding. She has that hollow tone at the center of her voice, and she employs old tricks to ghet to the top of the register, and worse ones to get to the bottom.Her characterization is average. When you hear Callas with Von Karajan you will know how sub- standard this really is..or Sutherland's. How does Studer on this set and on others get away with this pitchless singing???"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless, empty-headed compilation","review":"A gob of songs taken out of context and plopped carelessly on one CD, like the mashed potatoes in your school lunch plopped on your tray by a hairy-legged cafeteria lady.

Keep this monstrosity out of your house."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doing Floyd an injustice - their own fault probably","review":"These works cannot be taken out of context. It is that simple. Certainly, they are pleasant to listen to, but their true impact can only be experienced within the context of the respective albums. 2 stars because the music is great, of course. And, of course, a slap on the wrist to Pink Floyd, who allowed this money-grabbing scheme to be loosed on the public.

How about 'Comfortably Numb'? 'In the Flesh'? 'Hey You'? 'Run Like Hell'? 'Have a Cigar'? Granted, 'WYWH' is a great exception, but they didn't include the best stuff! Better to buy the complete original CDs. Or was that their original intent?!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much point","review":"I never really have understood why this album was released. I used to have it on vinyl; God knows where it is now. Anyway, I know it has the re-recorded version of \\"Money,\\" and the single version of \\"Another Brick...\\" and a cool cover, but for the life of me I can't figure out why I should care. The truth is there's very little here to get all worked up about, even if you're a Floyd fanatic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disposable CD","review":"I've got it, but don't know what to do with it. As noted by others: great songs taken WAY out of context. I bought this as my first Floyd CD, transitioning from tape. A mistake. (I'm now up to 3 real Floyd CDs.) There's an annoying psychic jolt between the unrelated tracks, as if they had been selected by an amateur DJ. And, you can't really call this a hits CD, with so few tracks out of a large body of work.I could give the album to an appreciative, uninitiated music fan. I could save it for when I get a CD player for my car. I could donate it to charity. The whole purpose, here, would be to save me from feeling I had wasted my money. Yet, the album would still be inflicted upon someone.I fear I may have to destroy it, and make the world a better place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Now that 'Echoes' is out, this CD is obsolete","review":"I'll keep it short (this CD sure is). Most of the songs here are from 4 mid-70s Pink Floyd records (Wish You Were Here/Animals/DSOTM/The Wall), making it useless as a rounded look at a constantly changing band. Now that the 'Echoes' best-of is available, all of the songs on this CD can be found there, with an hour-and-a-half of more music. This CD is now obsolete, and should probably be deleted from the Pink Floyd catalog."},{"rating":"1","title":"good songs, bad album","review":"i never took the title to this cd seriously, i really thought it was a joke. if it was meant to be an album to dance to, then they failed miserably. \\"one of these days\\" is a great PF song, but then it goes into \\"money\\", these 2 songs do not sound good together. \\"Sheep\\" is another good song and then the always good \\"Shine on you crazy Diamond.\\" but again they screwed up \\"another brick in the wall\\" just doesn't fit there. the songs are good, but the album sucks, so i recommend you buy the original albums and listen to these songs in the form that they were truly meant to be heard."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Money\\"- For all it's worth.","review":"An interesting compilation of tracks here. Bought this on vinyl when it was first released on LP. I probably sold more Hi-Fi from the remixed \\"Money\\" on \\"Dance Songs\\"(track 2), than ANY other demo I had. It is a COMPLETELY different song from the original release of '73. This cut alone makes this disc worth it's weight in gold. Phenomenal !"},{"rating":"1","title":"A joke!","review":"Let me give some advice to anyone who bought this(and liked it); don't reveal this to a real PF fan. How can you take specific songs from albums that are conceptual in nature, uniquely diverse and generally considered musical masterpieces, rework and mash them together only to pawn it off as a \\"best of\\" to classic rock \\"radiophiles.\\" Do yourself a favor and stick to the original discs; it almost doesn't matter which one. It'll prevent ridicule from others and embarrassment for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dance Songs?","review":"I love the music from Pink Floyd. I own just about every album they ever made from vinyl, import only, ( yes there are a few ) to the latest CD's. But, the one thing Pink Floyd doesn't do is DANCE MUSIC. This CD should be renamed \\" RIAA's attempt to take great P.F. tracks, put a few together and make some more money. \\" If your a Pink fan you don't need to buy this CD! As far as trying to dance to the tracks RIAA chose just goes to show how little they know about music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Cookbook","review":"If you do decide to try this book out PLEASE buy the $2.00 used copy!!! One of the 2 positive reviewers just \\"happens\\" to live in the author's hometown-Mom, Sister, Friend? I think so. Basically everything that has been said it true, I cannot mailorder groceries every week. Also, the lack of descriptions, suggestions, and just plain color don't stimulate creativity. I LOVE cookbooks and cooking but I just cannot get motivated to try anything in this book. I even sampled some of the recipes at a seminar/book signing (which by the way is the ONLY reason I ever purchased this book-i didn't pay retail though! ha) and they weren't anything to write home about. Most definitely NOT for NEW vegans. You have been warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Awful","review":"Save yourself the bother. Buy a regular meaty cookbook and insert the word Vegan in front of anything you might not be able to eat; so that's recipes using vegan chicken, vegan ham, vegan prawns, vegan grouse, it really is that simple. You'll also need a kitchen full of rare and obscure ingredients most of which you won't have heard of or be able to obtain.Truly a waste of the money I paid for it at a charity shop; I would offer it to them again but for the risk of someone else being as equally disappointed (1 star because I can't give it zero)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best thing since sliced bread!","review":"We have used this gate for our kids and now our family dog as well.

In ten slim chapters, you don't get much back-story or character development, but the usual cast (Roarke, Peabody, et al) are all on deck to catch a murder discovered on Christmas morn, with the hope of a solution prior to the dawn of the new year. The plot gets going in a hurry as pinned to the dead body of Judge Wainger is a list of principals, including Dr. Mira and Lt. Dallas, responsible for sending murderer David Palmer to prison in an earlier story. Eve soon discovers Palmer's escaped prison and sets out to warn and protect others on the list of six intended victims, Eve herself the \\"coup de grace\\".\\" The hunt and chase are sustained until the very last page, giving us a typical hard-to-put-down outing by J.D. Robb - short, but sweet !"},{"rating":"2","title":"short but complete","review":"It's the 8th in the In Death series, and Nora compensates for the shorter length by leaving out some of the secondary characters, and by having Eve know from the beginning whodunit.The killer is a psychopath Eve helped put away some years ago, a spiritual heir of Mengele who tortures his victims to death to study their bodies' pain and fear responses. His mission since his escape from prison is both to further his \\"research\\" and to get revenge on those responsible for locking him up.Despite its short length, Midnight in Death is a complete story, and we get some good character insights into the recurring characters.

It's a little noisy but it's quieter than others I've owned so it isn't bad...doesn't even scare the cat. The head is flat enough to easily fit under furniture. It was very easy to put together. We've had it for a few months and really, really love it. It's a great buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the best bagless Canister around","review":"This Vacuum has a lot of power and a really long cord to make it easier to clean several different places without changes outlets. The only problem I have is I have to empty the container that hold the dirt frequently. I guess my house is really dirty, plus I have two cats and a dog and the pet hair builds up fast in the dirt holder."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck!","review":"I will never get another bagless vacuum. I have to vacuum daily because of a dog that sheds 24/7. This was not a good vacuum for such a thing. It has good power & is easy to use, but to have to empty the very small dust bin, and clean the filter was a nasty job. Dog hair got all wrapped around the filter, and dust and dirt got trapped inside it. I had to bring it outdoors to bang it off, yuck. I do not reccomend this vacuum to anyone who has to vac more than once a week."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Vacuum, but plastic like everything else today","review":"I have had this vacuum for just over a year.

Easy to use because it helps pull itself along. Only complaint is that I have to empty the cannister very often.

That said, it's been a nightmare. I think the electronic control on the handle that is attached to the hose is the culprit--the replacement part sells for $160. After it was replaced once by the Hoover company because the revolving brush stopped revolving, it again died within a year. The second time the brush kept revolving but the suction stopped and the control buttons stopped working so the only way to turn it off was to pull the plug. The Hoover company said it warrants replacement parts for 90 days and declined to offer any relief other than selling me the failed part. OK, the cleaner is out of warranty, but before you spend money on this vacuum spend some time looking at alternatives. I'll never purchase another Hoover product."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for.","review":"This product worked well for 8 months. Now the Beater-Bar shorts out while cleaning. It cuts in and out every 20 seconds or so. It's very annoying and makes cleaning difficult. Plus the customer service at Hoover is not very good. They don't want to hear from you even though the product is still under warranty. I have emailed Hoover and all I get back is incorrect information, stalls and no responses.

I replaced an Electolux that I paid $350 USED. This beats the Electrolux all to heck. It's also fun to use. My 17 year old teenager actually volunteers to vacuum! It's the best value for the money I have seen in a vacuum cleaner. I give it five stars, HOWEVER nothing is perfect. The HEPA technology makes the house smell fresh after vacuuming but the dust bin needs to be emptied and the filter brushed and cleaned very often. Second, some of the attachments don't ride along on the unit and so they get misplaced (in my household) all the time. Those are the only things I think Hoover should change."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment","review":"After reading about all Hoover vacuums, I decided that this one was the one I needed. One thing that was missing from the descriptions was the fact that the nozzel/brush does not swivel and I only realized that when I tried to use it. I thought that I must have put it together wrong (these days everything that you buy has to be assembled), so I called the company and found that it was not made to swivel. It had great suction, but would not turn corners or go in and around furniture. I had to pick it up in order to turn it and it is very heavy and the nozzel/buush is much too wide to go under most furniture. Sorry, but I had to return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Motor Blew After 1year and 1 month","review":"I felt I had researched cannister vacuum cleaners well and settled for this Hoover.

I can vacuum my hardwood floors and go directly to the carpeted areas with just the press of a button.

And then the motor died. Yes, the power brush burned out on the very first cleaning, without me abusing the product, \\"testing\\" it to see how hard I could push on the wand, or even using it on any plush berber carpets. Since Hoover closed it stores and authorized repair centers in my state (MI), there's a 2-week wait for replacement part -- so, back to Amazon it goes.On the plus side, it was able to get almost a full cup of dust and dirt, so it works quite well when it does work. Unfortunately, poor construction and lack of support mean I am not recommending this vacuum."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad ergonomics, heavy and bulky. I regret I have purchased it.","review":"Stay away from this badly engineered appliance. It's bulky, not maneuverable at all and it doesn't slide easily on the floor. Old generation wheels are finished with rubber and not silicone. It lacks a light-weight attachment for wood flooring or bare floors (you would be forced to use the carpet motorized brush-roll in off position which weighs a ton). Also every time I use it I have the sensation that the wand's handle is going to give up since it's evident that it's not designed to carry all that weight, plus the suction. It also lacks a general power switch: you will have to use the sliding cursor/power knob to disconnect the motor. If you're in doubt about the purchase of a canister vacuum and can afford to pay a bit extra, I strongly recommend to go for Electrolux Ultra One... It's a more expensive appliance but it's worth every penny: the difference in performance is immense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this vacuum","review":"Cuts off on its own all the time. The roller brush turns on and off continuously (have replugged in many times as to see if it's a short).It's a piece of crap. Buy anything else and you'll be happier than I am.

It comes with all the expected accessories (crevice tool, furniture brush) and then some (carpet beater bar, small beater bar tool) and since I have hardwood floors, a great hard floor tool that is much wider than normal ones. I didn't read about that in the description but it is fantastic and really makes a difference. It is small and easy to transport up and down stairs with the handle on top of the unit.

However.....it takes up a lot of closet space and the wheels busted off the brush head a few months ago. It still has so much suction that it will now stick to the hard floors. Also, the electronic buttons have begun to stick every now and then. I loved this vacuum but am now in the process of researching its replacement. I truly felt I got my moneys worth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shuts off at will! No clogs & dust cup empty!","review":"Had high hopes after reading many hundreds of reviews. The unit was very easy to set up.The problem: it shut off intermittently at will - no hose clog, no metal wand clog - check the dust cup -- not enough dirt to warrant emptying - however, emptied the dust cup anyway, checked all the electrical connections including the wall socket to make sure everything was properly plugged in -- it took more than 10 minutes before the vacuum would respond to pressing the suction control (this is the on button).Received Wednesday returned the following Monday - used twice within a 6 day period and the \\"shut off intermittently at will\\" problem was even more pronounced on the second use.Called Hoover customer care: they said this was not normal and to return it to where it was purchased.

The vacuum cleaner is much heavier than the european with canister and less maneuverable . The motor of the carpet tool failed after three years of use and now the joint between tube and carpet tool is broken and the vacuum cleaner doesn't run any more.

Cumbersome, not particularly powerful and unreliable. The power head was intermittently cutting out until it recently stopped working altogether, and oftentimes it would cause the vacuum to shut off completely. There are better choices and I recommend you take a pass on this horribly designed unit.What's most disturbing is a previous review I left (which I was going to amend to state the power head failed) was deleted. I don't know why or by whom, but its disturbing to think a consumer's unbiased opinion could be erased. It makes me very suspicious of the review/rating process - especially with all the five start reviews left by people who have reviewed no other product but this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Small yet Very Powerful!","review":"After much reserch I decided to settle on the Hoover WindTunnel and I am so glad I did! It is very powerful, quiet and compact - all the qualities I was looking for in a vacum. The suction is incredibly strong, picks up dust and dirt I could have naver guessed I had in the house. Extremely easy to use as well - I take it up and down the stairs with no effort at all. I also love the fact that it is bagless! SO easy to clean out and you naver have to buy another replacement bag again! *** I do only have hardwood and marble floors, but I am sure it would fare just as well on a carpeted surface."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazon/Hoover Experience","review":"I purchased the Hoover WindTunnel Canister Vac in Jan, 2011. I purchased it because I had the same vacuum previously & it held up pretty well.

I took the machine to an authorized Hoover repair shop and have since found out that the actual \\"new\\" machine was built in 2007 - hence I have a machine that is essentially 4 years old in technology and the repairs might not be covered under warranty (which takes 4-6 WEEKS for approval from Hoover)due to the \\"age\\" of the vac.

The belt came off within the first few hours of light use. I put it back on. It came off again. Rinse and repeat. I sent it back. They sent a replacement. The belt came off. Of course it did: It's designed wrong. There's nothing to hold it there, so it comes off. I would, too.If you're planning on buying this anyway, try this first instead: Line up about 170 one-dollar bills on a 10 x 17 square. Tape the edges together.

The repairman stated that this is an extremely common occurence on Amazon Sales. The faulty part is the Electric Hose which is a $137.

Toss a few sesame seeds on the floor and try to vacuum them up. Pass after pass will leave them untouched. On carpets, it may be better. It does grab into the carpet, but I don't have a good feel for its cleaning ability. My girlfriend has a Dyson and thinks highly of it. I wish I had spent the extra money and got a Dyson instead.

It truly sucks hard enough and you can visually see the carpet being pulled away from the edges. There is no need to go around the room cleaning the edges with the smaller attachment.

The suction is great and I didnt mind emptying the canister. I used it about once a week for 2 months until the rotating brush started getting bogged down on rugs first, then on the regular carpet. Now the only way to get it to work is to hold the handle up so that the brushes are barely touching the carpet, otherwise the brush stops, like the motor is dying. I am in the process of trying to go thru the warranty for replacements. I do not have high hopes considering that every poor review I've read says that nothing was done.The suction still works great, but if the power carpet roller doesnt work, its worthless.

Sometimes lifting it would restart it.A couple more months later it started switching itself off.And now it switches the carpet attachment motor in overdrive and shuts off the main suction motor. The only way to recover is to unplug it.Note: We have no pets, the brushes are not dirty, nothing is blocking the movement and it does it with the canister empty. I followed all the directions in the manual to make sure it is clean and being used properly.Second note: This is the second one we got. The first one broke within a week and was replaced by Amazon.

It spits out everyhting you vacuum a half a second after it picks it up. I have dogs and if it gets one strand of pet hair in it, it clogs up. It is a terrible product. I read the positive reviews so I expected so much better. What a shame to have wasted 220 on an item that is a worthless piece of junk!"},{"rating":"1","title":"JUNK","review":"I owned this vacuume cleaner for about 2 months and hated it every time I used it I finally sent it back to buy a Dyson. It had great suction on hard floors but as soon as it hit carperting and you turned the brushes on they would quit spinning. I would have to hold the vacuume up a little so the brushes could spin and actually pick up dirt and pet hair but it took a toll on my back and a vacuume cleaner should not be that difficult to operate. If the filters were not cleaned every time the canister was emptied it would lose a noticeable amount of suction. I read many reviews about this product before I spent $250.00 on it and all the reviews were great until I bought it and now I am so glad I sent it back. It was a total waste of money and my time even using the vacuume."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate this vacuum cleaner!","review":"This is a cute little product, and I loved it for the first 2 or 3 uses. Every single time since then, however, I have had to take it apart to fix the fan belt, which falls off constantly. Seven screws out, seven screws back in. Sometimes this happens 2 or 3 times in a single session. The carpet suction on area rugs causes this to happen, which means that they are cleaned with the less effective floor suction option. Just leaving the vacuum on with the wand upright for a few seconds causes the fan belt to fall off. Worst part? We overlooked Amazon's plicy of returns within 30 days. An expensive mistake."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Hoover is no Dyson.","review":"So I bought this vacuum and overall wasnt happy. It didnt pick up anything. I mean I dont know what people are talking about here. It makes me think I got a defective one or something because mine really was weak where suction was concerned. I took it back and after doing ALOT of online research I went with a Dyson, DC17 Animal-ABsolute. Let me tell you what, this thing is amazing! Picks up stuff from the neighbors carpets its so strong! I would highly reccomned not getting this Hoover but instead if youre looking for a slightly more expensive vacuum you go all the way and get the Dyson. ANY Dyson for that matter. It just doesnt get any better than Dyson and with the 5 year vacuum, you are protected against any problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"My First Hoover","review":"I read all the reviews I could find and finally settled on the WindTunnel Bagless, I was a little cautious about the bagless concept and about the comments about the handle being weak. Well the vacuum is great, love the bagless, but I do agree with the other reviewers the handle is weak and doesn't stand up on its own very well. Overall I am very pleased though."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would not recommend this vacuum cleaner at all!","review":"We had this vacuum cleaner purchased to use in cleaning our church. I had high hopes but was soon disappointed with how it did not hold together. The BIGGEST problem was the wheels on the rug head. They fell off constantly forcing us to use duct tape and other measures just to keep it functioning. The hose connection is also weak and it would either overheat and quit or lose the connection, we are not sure which. We finally had to buy another vacuum cleaner after just two years, but for the money, this should last for years. Move on with your search, in the long run this vacuum cleaner has too many faults and I want to save you that frustration."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easily broken","review":"The tool cover broke with first usage.

Works well on carpeted and hard wood surfaces. Has good attachments too. I am disappointed, however, that I have not owned it for two years yet (more like 20 months) and already it needs to be repaired. The wiring that controls the hard floor vs. carpet control has gone bad. As a result, it no longer works on carpeted surfaces. I will be calling the service center tomorrow to get an estimate on the cost of repairs, but needless to say I am not impressed with the durability of this product.

It's nice to have a cannister vacuum again after having an upright for years. This new Hoover easily glides under the bed, so now I can easily clean there each time I vacuum. It really picks up the dirt and gets the carpet and the floors really clean. The rotating hand attachment is really nice and pulls the dust and cat hair from the furniture really well. There are several attachments and I've used them all. The cannister is easy to maneuver and is quiet for a vacuum. I have to empty the dirt cup after every cleaning but I don't mind--it's a reminder of how much dirt and dust the vacuum is pulling up. The dirt cup empties easily with very little dust escaping into the air. I just empty it into the trash. I'd highly recommend this vacuum to anybody that's looking for a quality cannister vac."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little vacuum","review":"The vacuum works great. It picks up everything.. The two things I don't like is the filter and dust holder are too small. I can only vacuum one room and have to empty it. It is very messy to empty, the dust goes everywhere. The other function I don't like is the floor dusting brush falls off the pole when I use it. It doesn't stay on very well. I would recommend this vacuum for carpets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Pleased","review":"So far this vacuum has been great. I purchased for my basement which is finished. I just got tired of the lugging the upright up and down the stairs. I recently purchased an african grey parrot, she has a big cage but still makes a mess with feathers and food. I must say this vacuum picks up everything and the nice attachments or you can use no attachments like I do a lot when I want to pick up millet from the bird around the furniture legs or off the end table, lots of suction which is adjustable by pushing button on handle, It also comes with a stair attachment, works very nice. Everything seems very high quality on this unit, retractable cord is great. You will be happy with this vacuum."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Investment","review":"I am very happy over all with this vacuum. It does a fantastic job. The dirt cup could be larger, other than that I was very surprised at how much dirt and cat hair I picked up the first time I used it. It is easy to push and the suction is excellent.

So I'm having the same problem as in the other negative reviews. So disappointing because I really liked this machine. Buyer beware! Here is my original review: \\"This is definitely the best vacuum cleaner I've ever owned, and at an excellent price. It has tremendous suction power, and I also appreciate the suction control feature. Plus, it's relatively easy to carry up and down stairs. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is that all of the attachments don't fit on the tank.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST VACUUM EVER!!!!","review":"We've had this hunk of junk for 4 years and have totally regretted ever buying this piece of crap!

I received two replacement versions of this model while under warranty from Hoover and now the vacuum is out of warranty and I continue to have the same issues with my 3rd vacuum. After a while the power carpet attached is high unreliable. It will keep cutting out and losing power for no reason. As other users have stated sometimes the vacuum will power off completely for no apparent reason, but only when using the power carpet head. I suppose if you had only hardwood in your entire house this would be ok, otherwise I would advise against getting this model.

Broke in a year.[INITIAL REVIEW] We've had this vacuum for 10 months (empty nesters, no pets, 1500 sf home, cleaning service uses this vacuum). It worked really well at the start, then after 9 months started to fade. The problems are that 1) The belt needed to be changed on the powerhead and 2) The filter really needed to be replaced, washing, 'tho possible was not practical. The local repair joint suggested changing both every three months (they wish!) Once the belt and filter were changed the machine was back performing like a champ. We'll replace them every six months...[UPDATE] 3 months after replacing the belt the vacuum broke. Repair cost was equivalent of purchasing a new vacuum. So we purchased theMiele Neptune Canister Vacuum Cleaner, S4212 Neptune S4 - Turquoise Blueas a replacement. While it cost 2x the Hoover it has run flawlessly for two years without undue care so it's already more cost-effective. It also weighs less."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disposable? vacuum","review":"I would have written a completely different review right after first using the Hoover Windtunnel. Fabulous! Amazing! etc. But after the 10th use or so, the carpet attachment STOPPED WORKING.

They replaced the belt and charged me for it - something about the belt not being under warranty. The belt has been slipping ever since and after repositioning it for the zillionth time, I've had it.

It is totally broken. Spoke to Hoover and they told me to bring it to the service center since it was in warranty. Did that, they told me they could not fix it. Hoover will not stand by their product and Amazon can't help me after the 6 month point. So I am stuck with a vacuum that doesn't even turn on. Save yourself the aggrivation and don't buy a Hoover .What a nightmare. And amazingly, Hoover couldn't care less and actually told me that I should buy a new vacuum. One rep on their help desk asked me 'what do you expect for $180?'. Outrageous. Don't buy this product. I threw mine away and bought a Dyson. What a shame. A waste of money and I am sure there are others all over the place buying this horrible product and just throwing it away in under a year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't do it!!!!!!!!!","review":"Wow,I was so excited to treat myself to a new vacuum.

I decided on a Miele because it's fairly depressing thinking about dumping another 30 pounds of Hoover plastic into a landfill three years from now.

I assume this is a one-off experience as I don't recall seeing this issue in any other ratings.Update: 04Jul09 to 4 stars: The fix was simple and cheap - a < $4.00 belt in the agitator. I was told that when the manufactured vacuum sits in the warehouse the belt becomes dry so when it is used it begins to slip. A new belt did the trick and it works beautifully.

After assembling the parts, I noticed that the handle and tube section that lead to the roto brush were not connecting tightly. After numerous attempts to adjust this issue, I turned on the vacuum to see how it affected things. It did, the roto brush where the vacuum actually cleans the floor would not operate. I had to manually pull and hold tight the handle and tubing that contains the electronic connection just to get power to the roto brush. So basically it was delivered defective. When I went to return it to Hoover, they said to send it to a Hoover repair shop. Not the answer you want to hear when you had not even officially operated the unit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great vacuum","review":"Based on other reviews that were posted on Amazon and that the price was right, I purchased the Hoover Wind Tunnel Electronic.

Does great job on carpet, but I used it on hardwood floor as well. The suction power is great, and adjustable. This is really good engineering @ work. The whirl inside of it looks like a tornado, which picks up the dust and pushes it down, it's even fun to watch. BTW, I'm in NY and digitalfotoclub charged me tax and shipping.

The first time we used the vac we emptied the cup 3 times! Bags tend to be expensive and I like the thought that all that dirt, dust, and hair are now OUT OF THE HOUSE!

It does a great job at picking up the hair, but the dirt container is so small that I have to empty it two or three times for a single cleaning. Doesn't sound like much but I have a very small house.

People who say it's light never had a nice vacuum - this thing is quite heavy, but not as heavy as uprights (those i simply hate as a kind). People who say its quiet, never had a quiet vacuum, however it is not as loud as most uprights are. It does pick up most of stuff, but you have to empty it so often it is annoying. And I find the process messy - I live in an apartment and cant empty it in my backyard.

Not as good as a Dyson (nothing is) but good for this price range. The problem is that the rolling brush only works intermittently because of a loose connection (this only started recently). The electrical connections run the length of the hose, so it is important that a) you are careful in handling the hose and b) lucky that the connection does not wear over time.

Then it developed electronic problems, turning itself off at odd moments. I more or less put up with that even though it gradually grew worse, but then the \\"cup,\\" the plastic receptacle that catches the dirt in the bagless unit would no longer fit smoothly within the cleaner, thereby interrupting the airflow and making it useless. According to the Hoover CR that is a common problem, as is the apparently failed circuit board.Normally I discount reviewers reports of product failures on the assumption that they are the ones to write in. But in this case the failure of two systems -- one electrical and the other mechanical -- suggests that there is a real quality control or design problem.I would advise against purchasing this unit, but if you do consider an extended warranty."},{"rating":"1","title":"this thing is posessed","review":"Order the exorcist attachment along with the vacuum.

This vacuum is so big & cumbersome that I dread using it (I'll even sweep or swiffer to avoid having to lug it out of the garage). It's heavy, the cord is kind of short, so I can only vacuum 2 rooms until I have to change outlets. It also tends to not pick up cat litter and small pieces of dirt/paper that are on the ground, so I usually have to swiffer afterwards anyway. I don't have an attachment that allows me to do stairs or upholstery, and the regular head is also heavy & cumbersome to lift & move around.

Initally, I absolutely loved it! As time went on I discovered I actually hated it! 1)does not get close enough to walls, etc., for 'edge cleaning'. 2) the filter is an absolute nightmare! It requires constant cleaning if it is to have the suction required to vacumn. The only way to get the damn thing really truly clean is to take it outside and bang it gently for 15 20 minutes on a hard surface and then high pressure hose the filter out which then means 4 to 5 days of drying time! What a pain in the neck! 3) within the first year there seemed to be an issue with a short of some kind in the handle where you activate the amount of suction (on/off) and turn the power head on/off. Perhaps that is an easy fix for the repair guy, I dunno, I'm replacing it with a dyson animal d17. With 5000 sq feet of house to clean I can't be bothered with taking my vacumn to a repair service.

I recommend this model nased on: ease of use (all switches are on the handle), lightweight, POWER!!!, and ease of maintenance. the only drawback as far as I am concerned is that 2 of the additional tools that are sent with the vac aren't stored on-board, you might be making trips to your cleaning closet. This is a great product."},{"rating":"2","title":"This thing really sucks!","review":"Unreal suction power. Great on pet (labrador!) hair. Hose attachment tools are cheap quality and the crevice tool is way too short. Cord could be longer.Absolutely beats our former vac...$400 Sears canister. Consumer Reports and most reviews I read were right...a great vacuum and a good value."},{"rating":"1","title":"Died after 2 years","review":"Not much more to say...worked well, but then died after 2 years.

After only 3 years of use, the on/off buttons on the handle are working only intermittently, and portions of the plastic housing are breaking off. There is no adjustment for rug pile depth, so the beater bar does not turn on some of our rugs."},{"rating":"1","title":"I expected it to last much longer!","review":"I have had this vacuum for exactly three years. For about six months now the buttons on the handle have only worked once in a while. Just recently the button for the power head stopped working completely. I took the vacuum to a reputable repairman and he said it would cost me $170 (mostly in replacement parts) to fix it. He also told me that Hoover's are now made in China and that I should never buy a vacuum with a computer in it or one that is bagless because I'll pay more in replacing filters than in vacuum bags. I'll admit I did like my vacuum until it started having problems, but I feel that I paid too much to have to replace it three years later."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great on pet hair","review":"I love this vacuum. I have 2 large german shepherds that shed a LOT!This vacuum does a great job getting all of the hair. The attachments help a lot.I used the small beater bar attachment and it got all of the hair out of the sofa.It does great on hardwood floors, the carpet and stairs.I would have given it 5 stars but I have 2 minor complaints.....1) the cord should be longer2) the main beater bar head takes major force to stay clicked onto the telescoping wand.I have to really shove it in hard or it pops off.Other than those 2 things.....this is an awesome vacuum."},{"rating":"2","title":"light and easy","review":"This vac works great,good cleaning on rugs and floors.

I am still finding her hair in the canister...Sad... but amazing to see the difference between these 2 similar priced units."},{"rating":"2","title":"UNBELIEVABLE VACUUM!!!","review":"Bought this for use at a summer home ~ lots of sand and pet hair ~ and boy, does it do the trick and then some!! I think it was sucking up stuff that had been in the braided rug for years! I love the fact that there are no bags to replace, and emptying the container is very easy. So is washing out the filter.The floor brush has 3 suction settings ~ ideal for hard wood, tile ~ strongest setting is truly VERY strong and wonderful on carpeted areas.I would highly recommend this vacuum!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hoover S3765-040 WindTunnel Electronic Bagless Canister Vacuum","review":"I think this vacuum works very well.

As the owner of a first generation Eureka bagless upright, which was relegated to the closet in favor of an OLD Hoover cannister with the power head, I have to say Hoover has done it again...The variable suction is an excellent feature, the ease of emptying the cannister, and the location and ease of cleaning the hepa filter are major pluses as well... Then there's the revolving brush small head - (it is powered by the air flow, it does not plug in like the floor head.) great on pet hair on \\"their\\" favorite couch...As good as I thought the OLD Hoover was, I was genuinely amazed at how much more \\"stuff\\" this one picked up in the same amount of time... It even ripped through a spilled bowl of popcorn, without batting an eye.If this one turns up in the Friday Sale again, or elsewhere at a reduced price, treat yourself...;0))PK"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hoover S3765-040 Wind Tunnel Bagless Vacuum","review":"This is the best canister vacuum I've owned.

I cleaned everything and reassembled to no avail. I should have gotten it fixed then when it was under warranty, because at 13 months, it stopped working entirely. And Hoover wouldn't help fix it because I was one month over warranty. I might have gotten a lemon, but I now need to buy a new vacuum. It turned out to be a very expensive vacuum when you average it out over the time it worked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware","review":"Buyer beware. I bought this vacuum nine months ago. It does a good job vacuuming but it is already falling apart. The screws came out of the body separating the top and bottom, the hose is leaking, the electronics have a mind of their own and the winder cord only works at random. It is very heavy to use, children find it very difficult and awkward to use. I contacted Hoover as soon as it started to fall apart. They were worthless and happy to have more of my money by offering that I take it to a repair shop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Vacuum!","review":"When we first got this vacuum I was so excited to use it. It's very cute! Parts of it do look cheap, but it's very modern and sleek looking for the most part. At first it cleaned great, but withing a few months we were replacing the roller. After that it all went downhill. We have had it 9 months it was not cleaning half as good as my moms 10 year old kenmore, and we are assumming some of the electrical wiring when out in the the hose. It's shot. We are trying to see what the company will do. I am not interested in this again. I would like to just give the extra money once and for all and buy a nice vacumm!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No service from Hoover. World's Worst Vacuum Cleaner","review":"This vacuum cleaner is the worst vac I have ever had and service from Hoover is seemingly nonexistent as the phone lines are not staffed by real people and no one responds to email when I click on Contact. I ordered a new filter almost a month ago hoping that would help but the filter never arrived nor do I know if they even shipped it. All I got was a charge on my credit card which is also all I got from the vac purchase.The vacuum is extraordinarily cumbersome and the flasher indicating dirty filter has been been flashing since near new and no amount of following cleaning directions ever works to stop the flashing and get full suction; nor is there obstruction in the tubing.It it is a cute little thing but clearly all FLASH (pun intented) and no substance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hoover Windtunnel is Junk","review":"I just returned from the vacuum repair shop where I had taken my broken 3 year old Hoover WindTunnel. The quote to fix it was more than I paid for it. The repairman said they broke like crazy, and showed me two other broken ones that had just come in. Meanwhile, another customer walks into the shop with another broken Hoover WindTunnel. Hers had a broken beater attachment. Mine had a broken control unit. I gave her mine to cannibalize for parts. Walking her to her car, she said hers had already broken once before.This vacuum was great out of the box, but realize you're buying something that's going to break on you very soon. My old Hoover lasted me 20 years. The lady I gave my broken WindTunnel to said her prior Hoover lasted her a long time too.No more Hoovers for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget about Customer Service","review":"I purchased the Hoover S3765-040 about a month ago from Amazon.Immediately the electronic control on the handle started going out.Forget about calling Hoover - they recently sold out- so no one will answer their 800 Number. After a afternoon of calls I finally found a dealer here in Dallas who says they can fix it.Too bad if you're use to having a company pick up the damaged and deliver a new.It may be a good product, when it finally works, but my suggestion is to spend a little more for a company who has a concept of Customer Service."},{"rating":"1","title":"does not meet the test of time","review":"I have had the vaccum for about two years and have had to fix it twice because of power head electrical cord or electrical connection design flaws."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Vacuum","review":"This is one fine vacuum! It is compact, easy to manuver,versital, powerful, and; easy to store."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I hoped for.","review":"Exactly what I wanted. I read many other product reviews and this one, for the hardwood floor cleaning job I needed, worked perfectly. Plus best of all, it's reasonably priced. The only negative comment I have is, the suction control is on the handle and sometimes I increase or lower the power level inadvertantly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flawed design, failed after 3 months","review":"I'd give this product 4 stars since when its working it's great and pretty powerful, however this vacuum should not be on the market as it is a flawed design. There was a recall on the previous model, which I found out too late & discovered Hoover has not corrected the issues with this vacuum. The connections between the hose and handle begin to fail and the motor started cutting out. I could go on but see many other reviews with similar problems. Fortunately I'm close to a very good vacuum shop (Banks in Troy, MI) who were very nice and helpful in servicing and repairing the vacuum however I'm concerned how long it will keep working until it quits again and if there will be warranty left by then."},{"rating":"1","title":"Electrical Connection keeps shutting off","review":"This vacuum worked great for a few months. Then just last month the electrical system sounds like it is going. It will turn on at times then off. I'm very disappointed in the quality for the price I paid. I was under the assumption that there is a one year warranty on this product, therefore I believe it should be replaced as I purchased in May 2012 and haven't even had it a year. Would like to be reimbursed or receive a new vacuum."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was ok.

But I suppose if you like dragging the rest of the vacuum behind you all the time you may enjoy this one"},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY this vacuum","review":"After seeing a glowing review from Consumer Reports, and many reviews at Amazon I decided to buy this one. Some of the reviews dating several years back complained of reliability issues, especially with a power switch going bad. I thought this is a simple fix for the company, and the issue should have already been resolved after so many incidents. Well, it's only been a little over 2 years of light use (once every other week), and the vacuum died. Yes, it's the power switch. What's more, Hoover would not stand behind the product when I contacted customer service. I would strongly advise steering away from all Hoover products, especially this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK, but needs some work!","review":"The suction on this vacuum is unbeatable. I also like the cord length and the handle attached to the top of the cannister. The things I find remiss are: 1) the weight...I find myself preparing to lift it with a mighty heave each time I have to move it; 2) the size of the dust collector...it's very small and seems to need emptying several times during my cleaning; 3) the upholstery attachment...doesn't seem to do the best job; 4) the filter cleaning... a real annoyance because you have to use the provided brush on every fold of the filter; and 5) the wand...it's unwieldy and difficult to move especially whenit's on the highest suction level. Given a second opportunity, I don't think I would purchase this vacuum again."},{"rating":"1","title":"fan belt isue","review":"I read all the reviews for this vacuum hoping for something great. However, within 20 minutes, the fan belt came off twice. Also, it is very difficult to remove the plastic lid to replace the belt. Buy another vacuum, guys."},{"rating":"1","title":"This unit works very well","review":"I decided to buy this vacuum after reading the positive reviews.I have had this vacuum for over a year and have had three (3) breakdowns so far.Two of the repairs were sent under warranty but the last one we haven't fixed yet since the cost just doesn't seem worth it. We definitely got a lemon but I don't want to chance buying another one of these.When it did work it worked well. However I'm going for a bagged canister such as a Miele or even an Electrolux (Sebo would be the ultimate). The bagless feature is nothing but a mess when trying to empty.So based on my experience stay away from this machine and invest in something with a better reputation and a better warranty.Edit (12/26/07) I found out that the two problems I had with this vacuum were a broken belt and a crushed hose. This unit works very well and I would recommend anyone to buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"No stamina","review":"Vacuum is great at first but does not last a year without something breaking.

Nice price tho - I paid a lot more at Costco but can return it forever ;}"},{"rating":"1","title":"It stinks","review":"This vacuum has great suction, but cleaning the filter and the cup are a big pain. I have a dog and every time I vacuum I have to open the windows and air out the house because it stinks. I can't find a replacement filter, so I wash it with vinegar, rinse with water and set it in the sun to dry. My husband hates it and wants to buy a different vacuum, but I don't want to give up the suction. If you have pets, I'd avoid it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Effective and easy to use","review":"I bought this after struggling for years with a bargain upright that finally did me the courtesy of dying, and after a couple of weeks of use, I have to say I should have bought something like this model sooner. It's very effective, especially on cat hair (I live with three of the little boogers, and a dog as well). The \\"turbo\\" attachment is fabulous on upholstery, and the dirt receptacle is easy to remove and empty.

NO PHONE SUPPORT AT ALL. DO NOT BUY THIS OR ANY HOOVER PRODUCT."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Like many other customers I purchased this vacuum because it received a good rating from Consumer Reports. I have had the machine only a few months, and although it does a good job of picking up dirt, I have encountered similar problems to those of other reviewers. The machine will not always turn off when you press the power button. In order to turn it off, I have to unplug it from the outlet. The plastic pieces that connect the top of the wand to the hose cracked and have since fallen off. The power head no longer stays connected to the wand. In order to be able to vacuum rugs, I must now duct tape the two pieces together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Vacuum for the Price!","review":"We scoured the internet for information about the vacuum cleaners out there and decided on this Hoover after reading many reviews. We have not been disappointed. It is very light and easy to maneuver and has plenty of power. It's very user-friendly and easy to operate. My grandmother liked it so much that she had me order her one and has told me how nice it is compared to the big, heavy vacuum she has had for years. I like the ease of emptying the canister once it is full and the idea that I don't have to buy bags for it. We have been very happy with our purchase! I'm sure that there are better vacuum cleaners out there if you want to pay more money, but for the price, I give this one five stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Too Great","review":"Great suction. But it is poorly put together. I use this vacuum everyday. After a week, the electrical connection on the pole started slipping upward, making it stop working after going back-and-forth about 10 times. The only way to rectify the problem was to duct tape it so it couldn't wiggle loose. I feel this should not have happened so quickly after purchasing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but somewhat heavy and noisy","review":"It is, overall, a good machine with a convenient way of disposing the dirt. The downside is that it is somewhat bulky, the head is relatively big and difficult to maneuver especially on stairs. It is also somewhat noisy."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst vacuum I ever owned and the worst cusomer service","review":"I wouldn't recommend anyone buy this vac. I used it 4 times and it broke. I have a studio apartment so it did not get heavy use. I called the company, they do not have a toll free telephone number so you have to pay high toll calls and wait on line forever. There is no company repair store in my area. I would have had to ship it elsewhere for service. Hoover is not the company they used to be 30 years ago and their service is non-existent. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"My family love this item","review":"May be I don't have enough language to explain how this vacuum does its job but it does it wonderfully. I couldn't expect that 209$ vacuum will clean better than that my parents have for 450$, but this little machine cleans much better and has more tools that very helpful. I tried to find appropriate vacuum for the budget I could afford and I was ready to pay 400$ to have good vacuum because my 6 month baby started to crawl. However all vacuums I liked were much more expensive than 400. I'm so glad that I didn't bought 450 Miele I saved money to buy my little one something nice. Don't spend your time for more search buy this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great, while it worked.","review":"Purchased this from Amazon. It worked great, cleaned carpets and hard floors. Was easy to handle. Powerful. Nice air filter. We really liked it. For 2 years.Then it completely broke down. Power nozzle quit working. Cord shorted out.

But 2 years until it is totally shot is ridiculous."},{"rating":"2","title":"I named it OBI!!","review":"I really love my little Canister. It follows me around making little noises like a Robot! Everything is easier to do, changing the height of wand, taking in the cord, changing from hard floor to carpet, adjusts to depth of rugs and carpets, controls are in the handle, has a light for under furniture and beds. The only thing I am sorry about is the duster. .and lack of a good brush. But I can manage that otherwise.To control the suction so easily at the handle is wonderful!!

The suction is unbelievable. The only problem I have with it is that it gets stuck up a lot. If something a little unusual gets lodged in the pipe it continues to suck until the pipe hole is clogged and you really can't tell it is plugged until the last minute when you finally discover there's a problem.Otherwise it is light and simple.

What's best is that Hoovers website is down so I can't contact them to find out what's wrong.EDIT:The unit was covered under warranty and was fixed.

It is easily stored in a small area."},{"rating":"1","title":"New vacuum overheated :(","review":"I bought this vacuum new and it overheated within 10 minutes of using it for the first time. It would cool off, start working, and stop within 5-10 minutes again. I read a lot of good things about it so was extremely disappointed. In all honesty, it might not have been a great choice for our family anyway because I vacuum about every 2 days, and I have 5 kids, so the very small canister would have needed emptying constantly. The size of this vacuum would probably make it a better choice for someone with a small apartment who vacuums once a week. One more thing is that the small brush attachment has very stiff bristles so dusting wide baseboards with it was quite difficult. I would keep looking. I purchased a kenmore canister from Sears instead, along with a 2 yr service warranty, and it has been great in every way. I don't have stairs so even though it is heavy, this isn't an issue with me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Bang for the Buck","review":"I am a researchaholic and on the cheap side, so far this vacuum has fit the bill. When I had narrowed my choices down I was torn between this Hoover and the Electrolux Harmony. The deciding factor was the washable filters that the Hoover is equipped with. As a pet owner frequent vacuuming is a way of life so I didn't feel like being a slave to the cost of the disposable bags and hepa filters of the Electrolux. I can recommend the Hoover Wind Tunnel canister vac with confidence however I can't attest to it's longetivy as I haven't had it very long. I will say that Amazon.com is by far the best way to shop online. Two thumbs way up for Amazon! :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"requires too much maintenance","review":"Cleans good but the tiny dirt compartment needs dumping after 10 minutes of vacuuming and the filter needs cleaning every 3-4 times you use the machine.

Also I've tried to buy one, not offered anywhere that I can find. Works really well, I'm over 65 so I wouldn't recommend it to an older person due to it's weight.

I have used my new Wind Tunnel just once so far and I think I am going to love it! I have a 100 lb. lab, which sheds her hair continuously, and the tunnel reservoir was full of hair. It seemed to suck up every bit of hair. And that was just the entry way and one very small bedroom. The vacuum is very easy to put together and use. My 76 year old mother with arthritis, was able to push and pull it around with ease. The cost at amazon is better than I could find at other stores. I hope it lasts me half as long as my sunbeam has.

This bagless model is wonderful...it really, REALLY cleans..the wide attachment for wood floors covers a large area so quickly and gets under all the furniture. The attachment for carpets works very well. I wish the dirt cup were a little larger, but other than that, I have no complaints.

It cleaned great and was easy to use until the powered floor nozzle quit working after 3 months. The Hoover company would not answer my emails, when I called I got a customer service person in another contry that I could not understand and didn't understand me or what my problem was.I called two more times and was given the names of service centers that were all over 100 miles from my home and told I had to take it to one of them. I have never had as bad an experience or been so dissatisfied with any company as I have with Hoover. I will never buy one of their products again no matter how good it might be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great on carpets, good on wood floors","review":"Great on carpets good on wood floors.

The belt that rotates the carpet brush kept popping off everytime I used it. This is a piece of junk. I will not be buying a Hoover again and am surprised this happened after all the good reviews."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hoover Vacuum","review":"I was quite pleased with my purchase. It really picks up the dirt and much easier to vacuum the stairs. I also like the attachments, especially the upholstery one. Like others, the only thing that would be better is a longer extension cord, but I guess the price you pay for automatic windup, however, be careful with the pedal to zip it back in. It can hurt your ankle.Overall, a good purchase for the price. Packs up conveniently, lightweight, works great, less of a \\"workout\\" to vacuum, and easy on the back!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Suction - Breaks Easily!","review":"This would be a great vacumn if the controls didn't quit working. The only source to turn on/off the power is in the handle. The wiring has to travel through the hose to reach the canister and it shorts out often. Bummer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Consumer winner","review":"The Hoover WindTunnel was rated third by consumer reports - behind two Kenmore Progressive models (one that we own). The fact that this vac is bagless and has the power to pull a four year old vacuum-er across the room (little ones should be supervised around this machine!) speaks volumes - Not to mention that it is HALF the price of a Kenmore Progressive.Another amazon review I read mentioned a feature was missing - whatever that feature is - we don't miss it. The only criticism I have is that the attachments are smaller than I'd like - and I accidently bump the suction control button when vacuuming, lowering power all of a sudden. But the quality of the machine overall outweighs all concerns - this is a good one!Plus - it reminds my kids of R2D2."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good quality for the buck!","review":"It is a good vacuum cleaner. I am so happy to be back to using a canister one: it is so much more convinient in the staircase, easy to manoeuver (especially under furniture) and as efficient as an upright. It is also great for use in the car.My only complaint about this model is what a lot of other people noticed too. The dust canister is small and if you have a lot of carpet it will need to be emptied every couple of rooms. That part can get messy (although easy to do). The filter is better off cleaned outside and it can take a while to do so.Over all, I am happy with this purchase which comes at an unbeatable price and was praised by Consummer Report."},{"rating":"1","title":"Powerful but flimsy","review":"It's true it's powerful and pulls up the fine dust. But everyone who describes the flimsy handle is right. One week after receiving this, after using it only a few times, the handle will now not stay in the upright resting position when inserted in the main, large vacuum head attachment. Which means it has to be laid down horizontally on the floor everytime I let go of it. And the control button panel on the handle is so flimsy and cheap it's like something on a childs toy. I agree with the person who said this vacuum will last her about a year, but not longer than that. If you, like me, would prefer to have a better built vacuum that lasts longer after paying $200 including shipping, then get something else. The industrial designer who designed this at Hoover earns an \\"F\\". They really need to test these things with real people in real homes, before putting them on the market."},{"rating":"1","title":"It works fine while it works","review":"I have the vacuum just over a year. It starts to falling apart. The power switch does not work any more so it is useless now."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO height adjustment","review":"This was not a good choice. The beater on the rug attachment would not turn unless on a extremely low pile carpet such as a door mat would have. Consequently, it did not work on our oriental rug at all. The belt kept getting stretched in just a few uses. This may be because there is no height adjustment on the rug wand!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Love it/hate it:(","review":"I bought one of these because I loved the reviews and it was important to me to buy an American Made product. Hoover is one of few affordable USA companies. I love the little thing...when it runs. Great suction, easy to use, but the beater bar shuts off randomly (seems to be a short in a wire, perhaps). Also, when it does run, the belt keeps running itself off the bar. So frustrating. Back to the drawing board..."},{"rating":"1","title":"CR Reports this as a best buy NOT","review":"Constantly clogs filter and difficult to clean. Poor suction after first month. Poorly designed parts that fit too loosely that allow loss of suction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful canister vacuum","review":"Had two wonderful reports of this vacuum which sold me on this item and I quickly purchased it from Amazon.com (no shipping and a great price). I thought my rugs were clean until I vacuumed with the WindTunnel Canister, and I highly recommend this vacuum to anyone who wants really clean floors. (Could even get under a bed that my previous vacuum could not go under.) I am so proud of the way my home looks after using this product. Best one I have ever owned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Vac","review":"Not a bad vac.Pros - Quieter, Small, Lite, Good suction, Controls on the handle make it easy to use, Easy to disconnect power head with no hands.Cons - Small dirt canister, Tube connecting wand to vac doesn't swivel at the connection points - you have to rotate the whole wand to untwist the tube, No swivel where wand connects to the power head - you can't twist your hand and have the power head twist on the floor to get vac around corners etc.Good for the price - I'm glad I bought it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful Vacuum, but heavy","review":"This is a great vacuum if you are looking for power. I previously had a canister vacuum and had tried and returned several uprights before buying this one. The suction power is excellent, and the Hepa filter is easy to clean. If you are looking for a small vacuum, this one is not for you as the width is pretty wide and will not fit under some furniture unless you switch to the attachments. The parts are quite durable and well-made, which however also results in them being quite heavy. All in all I am very happy with it except for the bulkiness and awkwardness of moving around. Be careful when moving around the canister so as not to dent your furniture. Love the retractable cord!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great little vac","review":"This is a fabulous little vacuum. Three suction strenghts excellent for different surfaces. I can't believe how much dust it gets out of the rugs that seem clean. Bagless great,I empty the canister every time I use it. It is very easy to use in all aspects. It leaves no odors in your broom closet when being stored. I would recommend this product very highly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good, while it lasted (which was not too long)","review":"This vacuum worked well initially, but then the hose got clogged with junk. We cleaned it out, and it started working well again. Unfortunately now it has died out completely...the one year warranty expired about two months ago!!! Next time, I will buy the extended warranty. This is the third Hoover I've had problems with. They all have lasted just past the one year!!! We have no pets or such, so I guess it's just bad luck. No more Hoovers for our family."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it!","review":"The Hoover S3765-040 Wind Tunnel is a great vacuum cleaner. It does an incredible job of picking up dirt from deep in my carpet. When I first switched to the Hoover, I was amazed at the amount of dirt that my old vacuum had not picked up. My first pass with the Hoover filled the canister. Attachments are easy to use. There is no need to bend over to change attachments. Everything can be done from the standing position. It is small, compact, and easy to store away. I higher recommend this vacuum."},{"rating":"1","title":"SUCKS, and not in a good way","review":"I bought this vac based on all the 5 star amazon reviews. Big mistake. I've had it about 2 months and it has already gone through 3 belts, the tool cover broke off and it's been in the shop more than I have used it. Read the bad reviews as well as the good one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor design; multiple failures in first 12 months.","review":"In the first month, the yellow collar holding the filter broke. The unit works without it, however. The contraptions holding the powerbar to the wand allows hair and debris to become trapped, causing the powerbar to slip off until you wrench the spring back and clean out the debris. Objects become lodged in the bend of the handle and cannot be reached with standard household implements (I used a 14\\" surgical tool). The slide switch failed twice and now the vacuum appears dead altogether. I give up. I won't even mention how much I disliked cleaning the dirt trap and drying filter, only to have it mildew in the Florida humidity, because that was a given, I suppose. No more Hoovers for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hoover Windtunnel Electric Bagless Canister Vacuum","review":"A fundamentally defective machine. I am an independent housekeeper who was drawn to this vacuum for its features: portable, bagless HEPA filter, with great range of attachments including a vibrating carpet attachment. However, after experiencing the same problem with the connections on THREE Windtunnels (the buttons stopped working, the connection at the handle and at the base of the hose all stopped working--within two months of purchase with one model)I have decided never to buy another."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time or Money","review":"I was pleased with this vacuum until it showed it's true colors after 10 months of light use. The electronics failed, and it would be stuck in \\"on\\" position (had to pull the plug to turn it off) or it wouldn't turn on at all. When I contacted Hoover, they wanted me to take it to a service center far from where I live. Wasn't worth the time or gas. They refused to work with me and allow me to ship it back for replacement. This vacuum is cute, and it worked well for a short time, but ultimately, it is cheap, and not worth the money. I'll never buy another Hoover product after this experience. They do not stand behind their products."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I checked with consumer reports and they gave this vaccuum excellent reviews. I also look at other peoples's ratings. I like everything about this product and advised my daughter to buy it. It is easy to carry up my stairs, has a wide brush that gets the edge of the floors and its suction is very powerful. I saw where some people said the dust cup was too small. I did not find this a problem at all. I just carry a small plastic bag when I go to another room and empty it. Because of the great job it does, I don't consider it a problem at all. I also enjoy the retractable cord. It makes it easier for storing. I highly reccommend this vaccuum."},{"rating":"2","title":"good vacuum","review":"The directions didn't say anything about the wand adjusting height. My first time using this vacuum I thought it was too short and was going to cause a backache until I accidentally adjusted and now the height is perfect. I love the location of the floor/rug switch and the multiple levels of suction power. This a great vacuum that works quite well on both my rugs and hardwood. The fill cup is too small and a little awkard to empty would be about my only complaint."},{"rating":"2","title":"HOOVER WINDTUNNEL","review":"Great vac! Powerful yet lightweight. Bagless container isn't so simple to clean though. Very satisfied overall. Great price!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No Height Adjustment","review":"I've had this vacuum for over one year and the roller brush has never worked correctly. The brush would only turn when I pushed the head forward. From reading many reviews today I see that I'm not the only one having this problem. I have berber carpet and the roller will only turn when on tile. After spending quite some time trying to fix the problem, finally the roller brush spins continuously like it should have from day one. With no height adjustment available, the WHEELS WERE TAKEN OFF the head attachment. Now it works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hoover Windtunnel Bagless Canister Vacuum","review":"I have not had a canister vacuum for 25 years, so I was reluctant to try this one. Plus, the last bagless vacuum I tried got everything dirty. That being said, however, it is clear that canister vacuums are much better engineered today than uprights, which is what I have been using for years. The Hoover has very easy to use attachments, and the canister rolls like a dream. No yanking on the nozzle required! The only flaw I have found so far is that the belt slips off the brush roller occasionally while in use. But that's it. I have a large house with old, uneven wood floors and wall-to-wall carpeting in the bedrooms, a longhaired cat, mud tracked in from the garden, and a staircase and screened porch. The Hoover handles it all. The floor tool is especially good, and the roller brush for carpeting is very easy to use. I like how the suction can be controlled with a touch of the finger on the handle as well as how quietly it runs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed in this vacuum","review":"After reading the great reviews, I thought I'd give this vacuum a try. I am disappointed in this vacuum. The control buttons on the vacuum work only about 50% of the time. I have to unplug the vacuum to turn it off. I do like that it has great suction and I love the cord rewind. It has an awkward feel, and it feels like a chore to pull it out and use it. I will probably get rid of this vacuum and purchase another Eureka \\"The Boss\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"vacuum","review":"This is a really nice and efficient vacuum cleaner. It picks up the dirt very well. The only complaint I have is that is fairly heavy for the design. It has a simple handle which lays down when not in use, but it doesn't drag very well, so it is logical to carry it and was obviously designed to be carried. I haven't used any of the attachments yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best one yet!","review":"It would seem that I've developed a hate/love relationship with most vacuums. I bit the bullet and got a Dyson and returned it a week later. What an awkward machine. Then I got the WindTunnel Bagless Canister. I'm really an impressed. Less than half the price of the Dyson and does just as good of a job and a lot easier to use.There are tree humans living in my house and 5 pets. Two with long fur and three with short. The windtunnel gets deep down cleaning done.

The second one we had worked for a longer time but we just sent it back after 6 months. Tried to get some response from Hoover - it took multiple emails and when they finally responded they gave us a list of places to go for repair. We tried 2 places - both of which said they don't perform warranty repair on items not purchased from their stores. These are the places Hoover recommended! Never buying Hoover again.

At the beginning of my practice it does stick quite well but after only about 5 to 10 minutes my hands and feet have begun sweating and it doesn't stick at all. It was not an exaggeration in the other review that it's like practicing on ice. I have done 6 practices on it and cleaned it twice with no improvement. So, if you're the kind of person that doesn't sweat then this mat will probably be great but if, like me, you sweat quite a bit then you will be better off with a $20 mat you can find at Target."},{"rating":"2","title":"Manduka 85 pro","review":"I had doubts about getting the standard or longer length mat, glad that I got the longer mat...excellent quality & durability."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the money!","review":"This mat is definately worth the extra money. I practiced yoga five days a week for 4 months, blowing out one cheaper mat and causing significant signs of wear on the second one. Once this mat is broken in, I found it to not only be quite sticky, but also to provide excellent cushioning for me knees. It is also larger than most other mats, so there is less need to read just your position on the mat as frequently to avoid contact with others in a crowded yoga class.This mat is also excellent for those wanting to practice yoga at home on carpet. My other mats always slid around on my carpetted floor, but this one is heavy enough to stay put. If you are committed to a yoga practice, invest in this mat and you won't regret it. The only negative is that it is so heavy I would not necessarily recommend it to yogis that walk or bike to class.Namaste!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great for tall folk","review":"love love this mat, finally a mat long enough for tall people.

In a series of short essays, several leading lights of the anti-sanctions movement highlight the tremendous toll on civilian society in Iraq that a decade of US-led sanctions has taken. What emerges is a horrific tale of US machinations and a ruthless policy making that has resulted in the deaths of over a million Iraqi civilians and has done very little to displace the current regime.This book is laden with facts, eyewitness accounts, and reports of fact-finding missions from people from a whole range of ideological, professional, and political backgrounds. It must be read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Atrocious","review":"When you hear leftist MIT professor Noam Chomsky talking about \\"the deadly effect of US-imposed sanctions on Iraq,\\" you squirm a little, wondering. Then you read many credible sources citing the death of over one million innocent people (including some 5oo,ooo children) as a result of these sanctions. This makes you cringe a little more, but you still wonder about the reality of it all. Although this book does not furnish any photos of children with one mutant eye bulging out their head from exposure to depleted uranium radiation, it does nonetheless paint an accurate picture of the current situation. (Btw, I was exposed to footage of \\"dumpster babies\\" and mutant children in Japan, so you can take my word when I say that you wouldn't want to see such photos anyway.) Moreover, the book will provide you with the most up-to-date information about the sanctions available in print.

It seems as though Jaramillo has a knack for witty, crisp dialogue but his plot formation leaves much to be desired. The plot is a meandering mess from the outset and never truly resolves itself. In fact, all of Steve's books have suffered from this problem. Unfortunately, many young writers in this tired age of Tarantino wanna-be's think that a few zingers now again can hold together a novel. Sadly, this is not the case. THE SCOUNDREL reads like a high school nerd's rebellious fantasy. Perhaps the most pathetic aspect to this novel is that the author doesn't even write well about sex and seems much more comfortable describing food. The passages describing the kitchen and Carl's life as a chef are by far the most compelling. Authors should always stick to what they know--in this case food.

The jazz masters who collaborated with her deserve as much praise; they are wonderful (especially in the interlude)and add tremendously to classical pieces such as \\"Del cabello mas sutil\\" and \\"Azulao\\".

There are also macaques, capuchins, and baboons (among others) shown as well.The photos capture candid, sometimes poignant moments, in the lives of our evolutionary cousins. The caption paragraphs often offer a humorous or anecdotal story about the featured primate.My only complaint is that other apes (orangutans, gorillas, gibbons) weren't featured at all, but Frans de Waal didn't do extensive studies of those species, and so it makes sense he didn't have the opportunities to photograph them.The book is what it is, not a scientific work, but more of an art project.

Prokofiev did not successfully translate his quirky, tangy idiom to the string quartet, and these two works are generally considered glib failures of imaginaiton as well. Prokfiev's idiom depended on several things that are absent here: soaring, sweet string lines, motor rhythms backed up by strong percussion, tunefulness, and often a folkloric foundation.These quartets contain a bit of his idiom, but there's no message. They are too timid and faceless.

I hope the film maker's other films are better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rambling, unfocused, boring. ....\\"Enough!\\" he cried","review":"I managed to sit through 1 hour of this non-story story. Who are the people who find this stuff so terrific? I watched this free online and am happy I spent zero dollars on it...A very few humorous moments early on with the suicide guy, but after that there was nothing whatsoever pleasant or uplifting, and compounded by the s-l-o-o-o-w-e-s-t moving \\"plot\\" imaginable. Call me a grump but I was hoping for a real story here. You know, with a beginning, middle and an end. Just couldn't take wasting my time on the \\"end\\" part. If there was one, let me know how it turned out. These characters were simply excruciatingly BORING in my opinion. Stilted dialogue, plotless plot, and except for maybe the cop, all were unsympathetic small-town sterotypes. I simply lost patience that this movie ever would develop a clear direction or have a point to make. Is this Canadian 'comedy', or 'art', or 'drama'? It sure was a mystery to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Romantic Flick","review":"A surprisingly wonderful movie of a small town all residents know each other and interact routinely on different merits climaxes in a near-happy further-development-promising ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"You don't have to live on an island to be insular, but it helps","review":"This quiet film perfectly captured for me the essence of living in a small community where people still care about who your parents were and what you did in high school long after the glory of prom night has passed, and where political corruption can be truly small and petty and yet still ruin people's lives. It's a surprisingly sweet film considering the dark nature of the central plot. An excellent ensemble cast practicing some fine, tightly controlled acting, makes it enjoyable to watch as events in the small town pass through a possible crisis. I'm just happy I don't have to live somewhere like that (ever again.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY NICE, FAST, RELIABLE","review":"Bought this off eBay, 4GB but half of flash price.

Most of the bibs we could find either weren't absorbent enough or weren't waterproof enough to keep their clothes dry. These are PERFECT. We still have days were we have to change their bibs a few times, but their necks stay dry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great bibs for a major drooling baby","review":"Although these bibs are plain and are not cute as the ones with funny quotes, it really does the job. The reason why I gave it four stars is because although the bib have plastic in between the terry cloths; when there's excessive drool, it'll soak the entire front and eventually seep around to the trimming by the neck and wet the back as well.I still love these bibs because it work a lot better than the expensive ones like Carter's which holds up drool well but is too hard. These are soft and when you wear them on the baby and it can face either way.I just bought another set so I wouldn't have to wash them so frequently. 10 will last me a week. They can be thrown in the dryer with the rest of babies clothes. I will recommend these to others and will be buying for friends' baby showers."},{"rating":"1","title":"buyer be aware!!! Velcro will cut baby's neck!","review":"I purchased these bibs fairly recently since my 4 month old baby drools a lot.

Unlike other bibs that we have, this product's Velcro is located directly in the back of the neck and not off to the side. There is a large Velcro patch in the back that scratched my baby's neck on 3-4 occasions before we figured out what was happening. The final straw was when taking off the bib it scratched him so bad that he cried and had a viable wound for days. Save your money and buy a higher quality bib."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work!","review":"I was very disappointed after using the first one for 30 minutes. My 10-month old son is teething and his drool soaked right through to the back after only 30 minutes, making his clothes all wet. I don't understand how they can sell these as waterproof. Also the color ran from the bib onto my son's white onsies. Total waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as the reviews","review":"I bought this product based on the rave reviews and they were terrible!

They are really thin, so on extra drooly or spit-up days they don't hold up well. They will soak straight through to my son's clothes. The pack comes with 10 bibs, so I always have a fresh one to change him into. But I wish they would work better so I don't have to change them out multiple times a day.The price is reasonable, but you get what you pay for. I wouldn't buy these bibs again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheap, plentiful, and cute","review":"These are exactly what I wanted them to be. They fit my enormous 6 month old son (he's 22 lbs). They're big enough for meal time, but small enough that he can wear them while playing to mop up the teething drool. They have the waterproof layer in the middle, but it's not super loud and crunchy like some bibs are. The only reason I gave them 4 stars instead of 5 is that they use velcro and that seems to eat everything in the wash if I forget to close them first (and I always seem to forget). I would much prefer snaps, but I can't seem to find them anywhere. And the instructions say to lie flat to dry. Haha. That's funny. Like a new mom has time for that nonsense. So far they hold up in the dryer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!!! Not Waterproof at all!!!!","review":"I bought these bibs for the 'waterproof' nature. My son was still SOAKED!!!

They are soft and work great for drool and spit-up. I am mostly leaving this review to help you with sizing. These are small and fit my 2 month old son perfectly right now. He is about 13 pounds but is long and lean. I feel like they might not fit in a in a few months. I don't feel like they will fit chubby babies when then need them the most.Update: My son is almost 6 months old and these still fit wonderfully. I'm ordering more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"not for spitting, but good for drooling","review":"These bibs are waterproof for sure. If your baby spits, everything will just slide down to his outfit. For spits I highly recommend Aden and Anais. But these are the BEST for drooling. The only downside is the velcro, I hate it, it will stick to anything, and it will make a terrible noise and wake the baby up."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE LOVE LOVE","review":"My baby has severe reflux. We go through tons of bibs each day. We've given away all the cutesy ones since they are not at all absorbant. We had terry cloth bibs from babies r us, but they were not waterproof, so we'd end up changing the babe's clothes anyway once they were too wet. We also had waterproof ones, but they were no at all absorbant. These are PERFECT! They don't crinkle nor do the sides curl up!! I wish we had these from the beginning! I dry these on low & haven't had any problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for the price","review":"Very good quality for the price. I generally prefer snaps in the back over Velcro, but they didn't scratch my baby's neck at all, so no complaints."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not waterproof!!!!

My daughter's shirt was socked right away from her drool and on top of that the color leaked onto her shirt and skin! That is extremely dangerous for her delicate skin and irritating that her shirt got all dirty and stained. I would not recommend these bibs!"},{"rating":"2","title":"These are our favorite bibs","review":"Our nearly 4-month old son drools a lot and even likes to suck his thumb and bib at once and these have really worked well. He also love to pull on them side to side (we joke that it's his cape) and the Velcro holds every time. We have other bibs that soak through, don't absorb well and don't have good Velcro. I like these so much I am ordering another set of five (for different colors) and plan to order a set for a friend who is having a baby.I read a review that said they wash them in garment bags and hang them dry. I thought that was a marvelous idea and use a garment bag for anything that has velcro (to include his swaddle).We have been using these bibs since he was about three or four weeks old and they have been wonderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like them, ordered second pack","review":"Despite some reviews, I do not have problems with the bibs. They do not get wet beyond middle layer, baby remains dry. You have to change them several times a day, but it is just a normal thing. I bought two packs,and I am happy with them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good bibs","review":"These are great because they are waterproof, don't stain easily, and are easy to get on and off. I love the colors and I love that they are plain bibs. They are fairly absorbent. The only thing that is bad is that my dryer tends to melt the inside layer and then they are misshapen and I have to throw them away. Not dryer safe on high heat!I have two sets and they are my favorites."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT Waterproof!","review":"I bought these because I was tired of changing the baby every 10 minutes. Spit up and drool is a normal thing. These are marketed completely wrong.1) They are NOT waterproof at all2) They are NOT absorbent at allWithin 5 minutes of wearing these after feeding baby, the clothes are completely wet and the entire bib is drenched. It seems that one area that is wet seems to spread out throughout the entire bib.The terry cloth also keeps the wetness feeling icy cold against baby skin and even if I touch it.Also be careful, the velcro is verrrry scratchy (more so than usual) and is only stitched down with fabric covering the edge of the velcro on 2 of the 3 sides. I've sliced my finger on more than 1 occasion from that stupid velcro (it's like a paper cut), so imagine what it can do to the baby if you're not careful.Not worth it...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great after pre-washing","review":"As other reviewers have mentioned, I did find the darker colors of these bibs to bleed. However, having read others' warnings, I just rinsed them in the sink with hot water before throwing them in the regular wash and they did fine. They absorb a lot and fit around my 16-pound son's neck well. The Velcro is strong; if he falls asleep while eating, he'll often wake when we pull the Velcro apart to remove the bib. I expect the strength will be very useful once he gets older and wants to try to pull the bib off himself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best and ONLY Bibs you should buy","review":"We have roughly ~4 types of bibs and these always get used first. Strong velcro, absorbent, no \\"crinkle\\" sound from a lining. All around great at what they do.

However, red color bled.","review":"I'm beyond sad. I love these bibs. They are the only ones I've found that don't leak drool onto my LO's clothes, but I just discovered the red one bled all over one of my LO's best white outfits. (I did prewash the bibs and he wore it one other time over a black shirt so it's been washed at least twice before bleeding) I'm hoping it will wash out, but I'm not holding my breath. I haven't noticed a problem with the other colors and I have the boy and girl color set. (I haven't used the pink girl ones though.) I'll still continue to use these bibs, but I might look harder for another waterproof absorbent bib if I were to buy more. (Though, I'm not sure if there is anything else out there.)My other complaint about these is that the velcro closes in the middle. I much prefer bibs that move the velcro over to the side so it is not right behind the baby's head and it's easier to get on and off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Generally a good product","review":"These are great bibs, but a little big still for my 3 month old. He spits up all day long, so we use these to try to preserve his clothes. Since the neck opening is still a little big for him some of his clothes still get pretty soaked. The only real negative thing about these bibs is they really stink after being wet (with spit up) for a while. His other non-waterproof bibs don't stink nearly as bad after the same amount of time... it must be the waterproof layer. I kinda wish they were a little bit heavier and wouldn't move around as easily. Regardless, these are decent bibs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scratches baby's neck.","review":"I like the bib but the Velcro is very had/tough and leaves scratches all over the back of 4 month old baby's neck.

Buying the 10 pack was right up our alley so we didn't have to do the wash all the time and had spares for the diaper bag and in the kitchen. The colors are vivid and although they are no real cool designs or funny slogans, they look fine but most of all , they are extremely functional. They fit our son who is in the 75% for height and weight of a year just fine and they have a great length and width to not get his clothes dirty. They wash well and have a perfect thickness to ensure they are not papery. For $2 a bib and the number of times you can use these over and over again-I would start here before I would get those cutesy bibs that will cost you a lot more and then maybe get lost...at least for the cost-wise!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Durable Bibs","review":"I have had a great experience with these bibs.

With the amount of laundry I do, I can't be line drying bibs."},{"rating":"2","title":"My baby's shirt is dry","review":"My baby is a big time drooler and all the bibs i had would soak through to his shirt.

I'm really happy with them and the price for 10 pieces is great too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too thin!","review":"My 5 month old twins are drool factories! I was having a difficult time finding waterproof bibs, so I ordered these. They fit well, and also had some room for growth. However, the bib still needed changing after an hour. The reverse side of the bib would become wet, so the reversible option is not very useful. The only feature I did find useful was the terry cloth fabric, which dried quickly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely colors, good quality, not for fat necked babies.","review":"My baby isn't all that chubby, but we have to be very careful with the velcro or it bugs the heck out of him, and it barely fits him at 5 months old."},{"rating":"1","title":"not for a toddler who drool constantly","review":"When the product states that it's waterproof, I expected my son's shirt to stay dry at least 1-2 hrs. but it was very disappointing to find out within 30 min. his shirt got wet. even though it has plastic layer in the middle, didn't feel like it. it wasn't absorbent at all.according to the packaging, it's for 3 to 12mo olds. amazon's product description doesn't say anything about suggested age range. my son is 16months old who drools constantly. maybe this product should only be used for kids under 12mo. and doesn't really work for heavy drooling toddlers. very disappointed in the product and amazon lacking product description."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice bib BUT the sizing is incorrect","review":"I bought these bibs for my grandson because the price seemed fair & I liked the idea of the plastic \\"sandwiched\\" in between the 2 cloth's.

It drives me crazy, and makes me want to put the guitar back in the case, untill someone can tune it for me.I don't want to invest in a tuner, untill I know I want to keep learing how to play, and I don't want to play while I'm so out of tune!

He makes himself very clear that he is writing for a general audience. He wants that audience to understand what happened in Flanders Fields. That understanding can help general readers fathom many of the actions and attitudes of the English during what Foch called \\"the twenty year truce\\" (he missed it by a year) and the Second World War. Groom is writing for an American audience that he hopes he will inform while spinning his tale. In this endevour I believe he succeeds"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Book","review":"With the lack of quality and readable titles on the great war, this one should be a must read. Groom covers all the fighting by the BEF in Ypres during the war. The book moves very quickly, while lacking great depth tells a superb story. Groom, shows the horror of the fighting that caused a great amount of sorrow yet, never lead to victory."},{"rating":"1","title":"Entertainment, how sad.","review":"Grooms writes a very entertaining book about World War I. He describes the hardships soldiers faced in the trenches during the Great War. Yet, I cannot take his work serious. The book lacks evidence! He writes over 240 pages of historical data and never cites one source to back his thesis. I am astounding by this major effort. I am appalled that this book was published without any citations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Guns of November","review":"This is not a well written book. It has flashes of brilliance but never delves into the real meat of the matter. For example, we never really meet General Haig or Prime Minister Lloyd George and so never understand the conflict between them. I enjoyed Groom's book about the civil war, but this one is a throw-away. I was astounded to learn of the great losses suffered by the British--fighting for the French and Belgians! The best WWI book is still \\"Guns of August\\" Pick it up first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"While certainly not an attempt at an in-depth chronicle of the first world war, Groom presents a highly readable and fascinating account of the horrific fighting in Flanders. Most effective are Groom's descriptions of what the soldiers in the trenches experienced. Strategies are described in plenty of detail without bogging things down with overwhelming detail. Finally, the maps are excellent--demonstrating clearly what is described in the text (why does this seem to be so difficult for most writers of military history). I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Battle for Ypres.","review":"I liked Groom's Civil War book, so I decided to read his book on Ypres. Groom writes well and the flow of his book is very good. This book progressed well and the four Ypres battles were covered in summary. This is more of a summary history of the battles in this region. However, this is not the authoritative book on the battle. As even Groom will admit, this book is for Americans, and not the British who fought this battle. It is a very readable, detailed book though.Groom writes well and gives the low down on this huge battles for a tiny piece of Belgium. The flow of this book is as well as anything that Ambrose did. This is a nice read on something most Americans know little about."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Storm in Flanders","review":"This is a solid attempt for a novelist and non historian, and Groom is certainly a good novelist.

It starts with an interesting premise and then sort of fizzles. Do NOT waste your time on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"November","review":"We, my husband and I, didn't like it at all.

Whie the murder was taking place, she was sitting in the car, in the first flashback she was in the store, in another, the murdrer was preparing to kill her inside the store. It becme so confusing I didn't realize it had ended. All of a sudden the credits started to roll.

The movie is basically a poor man's \\"Memento\\", of sorts - one of those films that messes with you in that you can't tell what's reality and what's not. No wonder the video store only had one slot on the shelf for this waste of time. And I wonder what exactly they're smoking at Cannes?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Moving and Memorable","review":"I don't usually like fractured story lines or stories that loop us back through re-plays of an event. However, this movie brings something different to what is too often just arty technique. This movie kept me engaged, trying to guess what would be the meaning and solution to its recursions. It poignantly captures the melancholy of the second-to-the-last month, the month that can swing us like a pendulum - from chill anticipations of winter, back to the warmth of sunnier days.There are two commentaries on the disc. The first one is done by the Director and Writer, and is more general. The second commentary, with Director and Cinematographer, is much more technical, covering such topics as screens, gels, backdrop, camera focus, etc. This second commentary would serve as a good preliminary course in cinematography for any aspiring filmmaker.So there's more than one reason to check out this movie and to let it linger and re-play in your memory."},{"rating":"1","title":"wants to be artsy, but is just bad","review":"This movie was boring, confusing and seemed pointless. After her boyfriend is shot and killed in a convenience store, Courtney Cox goes through a difficult adjustment which includes a blur of reality and fantasy. We see her remembering the incident several different ways. Now, reading this description it would sound like the movie is intriguing and would be interesting but it isn't. With a premise that has potential the writer and director manage to create a dark, confusing and (worst of all) completely uninteresting movie. I was amazed that it was under 80 minutes because it seemed soooo much longer. I felt no connection with any of the characters, and found Courtney Cox's character the least engaging of all. The characters seemed two dimensional and the plot (if you can call it that) was pointless. By the end I just didn't care what really happened. Skip this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suspenseful, engaging movie","review":"If you like to sit and think about a movie for awhile after watching it, then I think this is a great movie to watch. I can understand how a person might get frustrated with the odd sequence of events, the seemingly changing plotline and the visual effects. However, if you are willing to give this movie a try, then you will hopefully understand the point in the unconventional elements of this movie.Everything pulls together in the end of the movie, and if you do not pick up on what the movie is really conveying (because it really does make sense-honestly), then listen to the film's commentary. Once you get the ending, you can really enjoy the point of view and the tone of the movie. I found it to be truly unique."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOVEMBER 'a boring month","review":"this mystery/puzzler will definitely cure your insomnia..well least i only had to sit thru this crap for 78 mins"},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible","review":"cannot believe courteney cox agreed to do a movie this horrible after being a friends star. i like psychological thrillers, but this is just plain bizarre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tiresome","review":"Evidently, people getting shot is one of the only topics for American movies. No wonder the Euros see us as uncivilized. In this one, Courtney Cox's boyfriend buys the farm in a convenience store. We see it over and over and over. It's part of some muddled plot about how she grieves. Was she really there? It's a psychological thing. At least, this only runs 68 minutes. Barely worth the time investment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Consistent in its confusion","review":"At one point in the movie the investigating detective commented that the photos were too artsy to be much help....what he wanted was clear images. This sentiment sums up my impression of the movie. It is one thing to allow the viewer to fill in the spaces and come to their own understanding ~ it is quite another to create spaces large enough to swallow the experience. Nothing about it compelled me to even care about the truth by the time it crawled to its disappointing conclusion."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOTHING IN NOVEMBER","review":"Director Greg Harrison has made what must be a personal film for him, because it sure isn't audience friendly. Courteney Cox plays a young woman whose boyfriend is apparently killed during the robbery of a convenience store. Or is he? Next thing we know it might be a dream she's having because she feels guilty about cheating on her boyfriend. Next, it's Courteney herself in the convenience store and no boyfriend around; and finally, well not one to spoil movies I can't say what happens the last time around.NOVEMBER suffers from artsy filmmaking that sometimes seems to be so lauded at film festivals. But when a movie's ambiguity is so forcefully fed to us, how can one know what they've just watched. Cox is tediously boring in her role, and Anne Archer as her mother is wasted. James LeGros as the boyfriend is almost petrified in his performance as well.I didn't like this movie at all; its pretentious, self-serving and just dull."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This movie recycles one of the WORST movie cliches of all time.

The story was common for that kind of thriller, but it was well-written, and it went in a way no one could expect, so it had lots of surprises(good ones).

Incredibly contrived (yet strangely convoluted) and a script that is riddled with holes. The use of the flashbacks and non-linear storytelling were truly offensive to those directors who actually know how to effectively use such techniques. I think the guy who did the soundtrack (and editing) was shooting weddings prior to this gig.

It's a shame this movie wasn't a bigger hit in the box office. Suicide Kings is really well written and, more importantly, extremely entertaining.

I contribute a lot of that to a bad screenplay and bad directing.I think that the plot and the idea that the movie was swaying towards at the beginning was good but the movie was full of bad dialogue and terrible directing.

It's easy to forget how good he can be. Suicide Kings is an old movie but didn't get a lot of distribution when it launched. There are some familiar faces, Dennis Leary, Jeremy Sisto of Law & Order/6 ft. under; ET's Henry Thomas, Jay Mohr, Brad Garett.The basic plot is that several friends try to save their friend's sister who's been kidnapped by capturing Walken, a criminal with money. The friends get Walken to contact his people to put up the ransom money. Simple enough, but Walken plays a man who knows the young men are over their heads and probes them to find their weaknesses. There are a few twists along the way. It is an enjoyable watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is Christopher Walken","review":"Suicide Kings is a movie based on a dark and twisted tail of revenge and betrayal.Amateur rich kids succeed in kidnapping a former mob boss (Christopher Walken) forcing him to help them find a kidnapped sister of one of the group. the mob king is able to get key information from the kids and manages to talk them into freeing him where he ends cleaning all the associates of the plot.Great entertaining Movie, Christopher Walken Style. The DVD is good in sound and picture. Enjoy"},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the best straight to video movies i've ever seen..","review":"Christopher Walken is an awesome actor. This movie is good because all of the actors kept pace with the moods and the ability of the other actors. In other words, one actor wasn't overshadowed by another actor's performance. All the actor's performances were equal and very powerful. The plot was twisting and kept my mind going. The wit was a vital part of the movie as well to relive some of the anxiety and then to bring it back on the viewer. Denis Leary did a great job as Walken's #1 guy. The movie, overall, was great. If you get a chance, get the DVD. It has 2 alternate endings and a lot of other stuff that will help in the enjoyment of this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly overrated","review":"The film Suicide Kings takes a promising premise--a bunch of rich brats kidnapping a mob boss--and destroys it with unlikable, poorly developed characters, tediously repetitive humor (Denis Leary's stingray boots), and a ridiculous ending couched as a clever plot twist. The only bright spots were the understated performance by Walken as the mob boss and the fittingly dark setting. Otherwise, the acting, dialogue, and story were highly overrated."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Movie!!","review":"Christopher Walken is one of the greatest sinister actors that I have had the pleasure to watch.

Its strength lies not in its plot, but in the casting. Dennis Leary in particular is great, even if he's merely playing himself.

You put him in a film and it seem every other character on screen is humbled by him. And here is no exception, I mean even though he spends most of the film tied to a chair, there isn't one moment when he doesnt seem dangerous.Denis Leary also excels, though he's hardly playing against type, as the Angry, Ranting, Irish American. The young cast are also pretty solid, Jay Mohr and Johnny Galecki in particular...The DVD is great, for such a small movie they've done a really good Job... there's nice little video introductions by O'Fallon to most of the Special Features (The Alternate endings are particularly interesting) a decent Commentary, and a couple of other little novelty extras.You then Take into account that it's less than $10 and you got yourself a solid DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"closed captioning a mess","review":"I would have liked to know that this movie is only available with spanish closed captioning.

Watch Christopher Walken mess with some hapless fratboys! That's suspense?Denis Leary interludes are interspersed, reasonably implying an understanding of the tedium that is the bulk of this thing. So we get to hear Denis Leary do his \\"this is what is wrong with this country\\" spiel a couple times and beat a couple people up. Yawn.

Someone kidnaps Avery's kid sister Alice and he and his friends come up with a stupid, stupid, can we say STU-PID? scheme to get her back unharmed. Then they find out she has lost her finger. These dumb honeys kidnap Chris Walken of all people and tie him to a chair. Are they suicidal or just plain stupid? Hence the title. These delectable young psycos are so dumb that Walken spends the movie twisting stuff around until he has them all dizzy and mixed up and fooled! Great eye candy, great story, and Dennis Leary rocks.

But I'm an Anglophile where alternative music is concerned and I admit to a slight bias in that regard. I subtracted one star because The Cd doesn't include \\"Jericho\\", \\"Sense Of Loss\\", \\"No Sacred Sound\\" and the other songs from the \\"Big Jugular\\" EP which would have made the Disc even greater.Also the sound should have been re-mastered better.

These kids call themselves the \\"wolverines\\" and one part of the movie which really made me laugh was when the kids attacked the Russians and some of the troops cried out \\"help help its the wolverines\\" I cant understand anyone who can honestly say they really enjoyed this movie.

Strong performances by Jennifer Grey and Powers Booth make it somewhat enjoyable. The story involves the invasion of the United States by the Soviets and their allies. Even though an invasion wasn't likely to ever happen, the movie did cause me to think about what I would do if something like that did occur. Of course, if another country tried to invade us, at least we have plenty of guns to defend ourselves. The same cannot be said of other counrties. Funniest scene to watch for: towards the end, when Patrick Swayze is holding a dying Charlie Sheen, watch for snot to come flying out of Patrick's nose. A little childish, but worthy of a rewind none the less."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"freedom isn't free\\"","review":"This is one of my alltime favorite movies. It deals with a Soviet orchestrated invasion of the United States and how a small group of teenagers are transformed into freedom fighters to fight the Soviets. Relavant for the 80s, but still relavant today. This film sends the message that \\"freedom isn't free\\" and that duty is a burden worth undertaking. The Soviets in this movie could just as easily be the Chinese or our own government. Every young person should see this movie and learn how to shoot a rifle and become a Rifleman."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Cinema, not film, a movie","review":"Here's the deal peopleYes the movie is stupid, yes the movie is unrealistic, and yes it has plot holes so big you could fly a division of russian paratroopers on comercial airliners through it but it is unrealistic and stupid in the right porportions. So if your main pleasure in the cinema experience is trying to catch the continuity editors mis-steps this probably isnt for you. It is a melodramatic, unrealist, star spangled, fantasy but, and this is an important but, entertaining because of those reasons (even to left leaning tree huggers like me). So if that sounds like your deal wrap you and your girl in a flag and enjoy the evening.It maybe worth saving the 12 bucks and just reading the reviews they are pretty entertaining, but I dont really have room to criticizes since I decided to partake."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic everyone should see.","review":"A great movie with a bunch of great actors in their youth.

Actually, it is a film against war.

It makes you think about what you would do if you were in their shoes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ignore the Editorial Comments and enjoy this film","review":"Unfortunately, the official editorial, and some subsequent reviews are in error. The invasion depicted in this movie is both the result of a nuclear strike, and is somewhat more plausable than indicated in the reviews. The possiblity of a so-called decapitation strike (nuclear bombing of centers of federal government and federal military command centers) is real. In fact, the US used conventional weapons to do exactly the same thing to Iraq with similar effect as depicted in this film. The reviewers of the film were clearly not paying attention when this theme was stated in the early part of the film.When one appreciates how possible this scenario is, the film becomes much more entertaining as a thriller / horror story. The work of the actors and crew can be much more fully appreciated. If you like to be scared, this film will do it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christmas gift","review":"This was a Christmas gift for my 19-yr old nephew, who just recently discovered this original version after seeing the remake, which I didn't think was as well done.

The orginal, made at the height of the Big One was about the heroic Russian partisans battling the Nasty Nazis in defense of their beloved Motherland.Ironic, no?Considered merely as an action film, it isn't bad. Plenty of things blowing up and gunfights. Seasoned with a spoonful of charachter development to help it all go down.But it's ultimate fate will be similar to that of the parent film--a relic of propaganda serving to mark a particular moment in time and space.

It's funny what we liked as teenagers in the 80s. It could've been a better movie with a slower, more developed beginning. The movie gets points for fairly successful drama, but lack of character development at the start and throughout the movie seriously dulls it. It also gets points for varied locales, from deserts to pine forests to snowscapes. Ultimately, it's hard to care for the characters or even the cause. I'm realizing that I liked it as a kid because it was voilent and every American boy's fantasy. Neither lure holds up for me today like it used to, much like the movie as a whole."},{"rating":"1","title":"Implausible at Best -","review":"Russian/Cuban forces in the 1980s parachute into a small Colorado town and begin eliminating the inhabitants. (Really - Russia would need/want Cuba's help, they'd start in a small town in Colorado and bother exterminating its populace?) Patric Swazye and friends grab a pickup truck, stock up on supplies, and head for the hills. Meanwhile, the town's remaining men are held at the local drive-in. Then the teens emerge as a vengeance-seeking commando unit known as 'Wolverines' and rescue the town from Communist occupation - after Washington, D.C. Kansas City, Omaha, etc. were already obliterated. Sometime later, the U.S. drives the invaders out, per the film's epilogue.

WTF? did the Russians forget they have freaking armored vehicles?The idea that these kids could hold their own is paltry to begin with and pathetic by the end.Then there's Charlie Sheen slipping into some lines that he looks all to comfortable saying, maybe a foreshadowing of things to come, like when he turns to one of the chicks while holding a dirty dish and says, \\"here, make yourself useful and wash this\\" HA!I understand this is a cult classic, but thankfully that cult must have all drank the kool-aid and is no longer around to try to push the idea that this is a good movie.

Perhaps the plot of this film is not likely, but it was far more possible than I think many Americans realize. The film is thought provoking, and entertaining if you like adventure films. It also reaffirms the moral bankruptcy of communism and other totalitarian regimes. Many critics do not like this film because it leaves the impression that our individual ownership of weapons is a very important right under our Constitution. Our founding fathers knew that. This film just makes the modern case for the necessity of our Constitution, our Bill of Rights, and the danger of totalitarian governments."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great 80's action/drama","review":"No doubt written by Reagan speechwriters, this anti-communist action film sometimes borders on the ridiculous, (Cuban soldiers spearheading an invasion of the U.S. followed by Russian paratroopers) but it is both enjoyable and, at times, clever (for example,there is a scene where a bumper sticker elicits the slogan \\"You can have my gun when you pry it from my cold, dead hand\\" followed by the camera panning over to a man's corpse holding a gun and a Russian soldier taking the gun out of his hand after having shot him.) At times, as far-fetched as the plot may seem, (especially in retrospect) this movie does stir good old-fashioned feelings of angry patriotism. This movie stands out as one of my favorite movies of the eighties.

I'm not saying it's perfect but it has lots of great details and moments."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oy Vey!","review":"I thought about giving this film an intellectual review, but that would have been a complete waste of time. Watching this film could be compared to listening to a C.W. McCall album with a bad case of nausea or perhaps something scatological. Simply pathetic. The only redeeming role was performed by William Smith, who was the ONLY actor who seemed to exhibit talent, putting Sheen and Swayze to shame as acting professionals. This film would only have value for students who are seriously studying Russian and at that would be applicable to Chapter 22 with Smith's \\"I Am A Hunter\\" speech. This film is a good example of how you can't win a game when only one person on the team shows up."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Russians are coming! Really, they are! Wait, they never invaded!","review":"This film is such a joke, a completely dated piece of right wing, jingoistic propaganda. The 80's was filled with \\"the Russians are coming! The Russians are coming!\\" propaganda. The MSM, Washington, DC, and Hollywood all made it sound like that dreaded Soviet invasion was going to happen anyday. Well, as far as I know, the Russians never invaded. They never dropped the bomb. We're not all speakin' Russian. This film was written and directed by John Milius, a filmmaker with a pro militaristic viewpoint. The film is unintentionally hilarious today, because of its totally unrealistic scenarios. This film is no different than any propaganda film you would see during wartime.

He is a very outspoken left wing liberal(like his father martin sheen), who fights to take 'american's' rights away such as but not limited to the passing of laws against the right to keep and bear arms. This movie has happened to us in a sense. This is a classic 80's movie. It is very pro-american even though you may find it to be a little gung-ho.These days though it's not at all unrealistic to be this way for real unfortunately due to this countries current tragic events.

But a story about USA under communist occupation is something you do not see every day - and it is not so badly made. The fighting scenes are more credible than not, decors are well chosen (Rocky Mountains) and the story is really not so silly at all. The fight with the MI-24 helicopters in itself is worth the price of the DVD location. In fact, this movie can surprise you, so if you feel like a little cinematographic curiosity with your popcorn - go get it.

I would not let my children watch it even if they were 16 or 17.Red Dawn was an impetuous display of WW3. Although actors Patrick Swayze, Charlie Sheen, and Jennifer Gray play key roles in the movie, I found it to be overall inane. Although I slept through most of the movie, the parts i did see/hear were voluble, the Russian especially. I was embarrassed for some of the acting in this movie with some of the not so big stars. Again, Patrick, Charlie, and Jennifer did a very good job.Overall, this movie was a complete waste of Hollywood's money. I got bored almost immediately after the students were mutilated and I would give this movie no more than 2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"True?","review":"This movie is about a battle that took place, from what I can gather, sometime between Vietnam and the Persian Gulf War I. It is about Cuban insurgents that infiltrate a strategic town somewhere in the Rocky mountains. The Soviet Union joins the Cubans to fortify the town which is seemingly unreachable by the American military due to it's logistics. A few fresh faced kids battle the insurgency but ultimately fail in the end. This movie seemed to glorify the actual event which gets little if any mention in historical texts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thanks","review":"This disc was out of it's case when received but came in perfect condition.

Good movie to watch with your teenagers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Red Dawn","review":"Loved this movie!This is a movie i can watch over and over again, I miss Patrick Swayzie, he was an amazing actor."},{"rating":"2","title":"...","review":"The plot and characters in Red Dawn are far more complex and subtle ... The fall of the U.S. federal government is not the result of a simple invasion, but a combination of political and military actions over many years. Yes, guns are used (on both sides) but the resulting carnage is also explored and questioned by characters on both sides. The ambiguous feelings of the Cuban (Nicaraguan?) officer towards his teenage enemies in the hills are a masterful twist in the plot. Yes, there is violence, but it is never glorified.The movie poses a rather simple question: how important is freedom to American citizens? For some, the answer is to give in and accept the occupation. The invaders even set up reeducation camps to help them in their transformation. But the main characters decide to fight for their liberty, and the final scenes are as dramatic as any you'll see on film.The technical quality of the DVD could be better, but it's at least equal to my old VHS version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"High quality DVD, loved it so much I have loaned it out and now do not know who has it.

Lord of the Rings meets World War III. One of the only redeeming values are the performances by Powers Boothe as the pilot and of course Lea Thompson and Jennifer Grey, who are two of my favorite actresses. They do not make up for the oppressive undertones and depressing storyline."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as I remembered ...","review":"Got it to watch with my boys prior to seeing the new version just released.

It had been working well until today. Now I have lost all suction.

I have taken off all parts that could get me to a clog--no success. Anyone have any advice??

My opinion has now changed, after owning it for a few months I have had nothing but problems. The first thing to break was the self propel. Then the on and off switch quit working, it just stays on, to turn it off you have to unplug it. Now, it keeps throwing the circuit breaker to my house when you plug it in(brand new house). It is still under warranty, but Hoover says that I have to take it in, and they will only pay the bill if it is their fault. I don't want to take the chance in what they preceive is their fault. This vacuum cleaner should be recalled, I can not imagine it is very safe if it will not even turn off. I just threw away alot of money, and now have to go buy a new vacuum cleaner."},{"rating":"1","title":"awful","review":"Changing the canister (which you have to do once for every large room) is a messy undertaking.

It is way over-rated - Extremely heavy - NOISY - Cumbersom going from carpet to floor mode. No way to use it on steps safely. Belt broke in 2 months. Hepa filter- HAH! Emptying the dust bin is not beneficial to anyone, much less those with allergies. Dust flies all over. I HATE this thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looking for a new vacuum...forget this one!","review":"I bought this vacuum cleaner less than a year ago and it has been in the repair shop more than it has been at my house. The belt has broken at least 4 or 5 times and the self-propel system keeps breaking down. When I took it in just last week to be repaired again, the repair shop owner pointed to the back room and said over half of the vacuums they repaired were this model.Actually, when the vacuum works, it does a decent job...although I don't think I would buy a bagless type again. Emptying the container creates a mess unto itself! So my recommendation is stay away from this Hoover model."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not run well, and messy too","review":"I have used this vacuum for over a year now. I consistently have trouble with the belts staying on. I cannot count the number of times I've had to unscrew the plate underneath and reattach the belts. If it even rolls over something uneven on the floor, the belt comes off and the beater brush stops moving.Also, although \\"bagless\\" sounded great, this vacuum is very, very messy to clean out. I have to take it outdoors and the dust goes everywhere.It also does not have a lot of sucking power through the attachments.I write this review today because the beater bar stopped turning and all belts are attached. I have taken this vacuum apart for the last time..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well, but it's huge","review":"I bought this vacuum because the reviews were good and I wanted a vacuum that would work well and last a long time. I was surprised how big it was when it arrived--very awkward to carry the box up to my 4th floor apartment. The first thing I did with it was to vacuum the area rug in my living room. The amount of cat hair and dust that it picked up was amazing--I was serioiusly &quot;grossed out&quot; by the amount of stuff in the container. The problem with this vacuum is that it is just so big and heavy. I live in a city apartment with hardwood floors and I have alot of furniture and &quot;stuff&quot; everywhere because I don't have any storage. This vacuum doesn't fit under the bed, under furntiture, around stuff. I've decided to return it and get a canister instead (probably a Hoover windtunnel)."},{"rating":"1","title":"If only it vacuumed","review":"This has to be one of the poorest performing vacuum cleaners I've ever used. I finally ponied up the money and bought a Dyson. What led to that was a small spill of shreds from my paper shredder onto a shag carpet in my home office. The Hoover picked up about half of it. The rest of the paper shreds it spread around, bury some shreds further into the shag. It doesn't help that the hose has barely any suction at all. That was the breaking point. Yes, I've tried every setting, went to the web for advice. It's just a bad product. I sold it off for $2 at my garage sale - I just couldn't pawn it off on someone as if it actually worked. The buyer said they thought they could make some modifications."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing works right","review":"The on-off switch did not work properly because its internal workings are plastic and do not fit perfectly. If the handle is not tightly connected to the body, the switch does not work. I took this to a dealer repair shop where it would work there but as soon as I brought it home it stopped after a few times. The propeller switch broke. Finally the the beater brush switch stopped working. The reliability and workmanship is terrible. I have had it for about a year and got it as a gift."},{"rating":"1","title":"***Horrible DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!","review":"I am so irritated with this vacuum. It only worked well the first time I used it. After that it was one problem after another. Every part on this vacuum has broken, and now it wont work at all and its only a year old.

Buy something else!","review":"I bought this vacuum new and used it three times. For those three times, it worked like a dream. Never had the carpet been so clean. It even looked like a professional carpet cleaner had just visited.On the fourth use, the brush abruptly stopped rolling and the motor started smoking. It cost me over $100 to repair. Beware buying this vacuum; repair shop owners will laugh at you when you bring it in because they see so many of them with broken belts and motors. Ignore what consumer reports says on this one and most definitley do not throw your money away on this piece of junk. It would be cheaper and easier to have your carpets professionally cleaned."},{"rating":"2","title":"incredible","review":"Purchased this vacuum and used it after I had already vacuumed with my current machine.

When I first bought this vacuum I wrote a raving review. But now I feel compelled to change my review. I spent a lot of money on this vacuum and it only lasted me 2 years!!! While vacuuming the other day and the motor just stopped working. I took it to be fixed and was told that the dive motor burned up and is unfixable! I was made aware this is a common problem with this \\"self propelled\\" machine and with pet owners. Although I do own a dog but she does not shed hair!!!

Sometimes I can use it for a few minutes, but most of the time, I can't even engage the brushes before it comes off. Sometimes it will rip the belt in the process. I'm on my third belt, and I don't use it very often.We went with this vacuum over a Dyson, because although we needed something really good, we didn't want to pay $600 for it. Big mistake. It doesn't even pick up hair as well as my old $100 vacuum cleaner.Stay away from this model. Just to be safe, stay away from Hoover altogether. The fact that this item made it through their quality assurance tests really says something about the company."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to expectations","review":"I bought this product in December 2004. After two months of use (about once a week) the on/off switch broke. Eventually after using it for a year (and trying to get Hoover to correct the problem), just before Christmas 2005 I got quite a fright when I started smelling smoke whilst using it. I discontinued the use of the product, and asked Hoover once again to please look at it. Their reply was that I should take it to one of their authorised shops, where they'll repair it, charge me. Then Hoover will see if it was in fact a factory error and only then refund me when they feel they're not in the wrong.Please. Don't waste your money on this product. It is defnitely not worth it. It is noisy, vacuums carpets well when used to work, but is unable to vacuum floors at all. (One of the options on it).Sorry, Hoover. But you have lost a loyal customer. (My whole family for 3 generations back has always bought Hoover, including myself...)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed in the Wind Tunnel","review":"This vacuum is SO heavy. Also, you have to attach the wand each time you want to use it (can't just grab and use). It has a strong suction, which makes it hard to move forward or backward. Have to keep changing settings to find one that will work for various rugs. Finally, it chewed up one of my rugs today. So I definately would recommend looking elsewhere!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't last","review":"I bought this vacuum from Target several years ago. It works great as long as the filter is clean and the canister is empty, but the HEPA filter clogs easily and it is a chore cleaning out the canister (actually must shower after emptying canister). Also, now that it is several years old, the self propel does not work very well, and the plastic pieces have chipped or broken. For the money, I thought this would last longer. I'm now looking at the Dyson."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for","review":"This net rotted out in less than 6 months.

There is no other concerto that I am aware of that achieves the same level of vibration or transmission between composer, performer and listener. Mozart, Mendelssohn, Brahms, Tchaikovsky, Bruch, Sibelius; all wonderful concertos in their own rights, but nothing like it compared to the Beethoven one. Here, the violin is not just making music or follwing a melody; it speaks, it talks, it resonates: It lives! Only here the instrument has a true language, a communication, a feeling of its own, and sometimes I think, especially in the adagio, it tells us a story, a story like the blues sometimes does, yes, I would almost say ths concerto has the blues! With Zukermann, Barenboim and the CSO as formidable interpreters, this concerto paints a picture of romantic music like nothing else before or since."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too spacious, off tempos, not pure enough for this concerto","review":"I LOVE Beethoven's violin concerto, and seeing this CD with a great conductor, a great violinist, and a great orchestra, I thought it would be a good performance. Wrong! Zukerman's tempos are so terrible. Just listen to lazy solos at the beginning of the third movement. Barenboim's conducting doesn't help either, sounds too large and bombastic, even violent. One music critic said the violin sounds like it has \\"fat\\" on it. Well, I wouldn't go that far, but it doesn't sound refined and pure enough for Beethoven's concerto. I would recommend Itzhak Perlman's recording with Giulini on EMI, it has better-judged tempos, better conducting and orchestral accompaniment, more beauty, and more refined technique. In fact, it's the best version I have ever heard, so much more beautiful than the Zukerman recording. As for Zukerman, his performances of the Romances aren't bad, but I can't stand his solos in the violin concerto."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is not the very good.","review":"Don't buy this book! This book contains a fair number of typographical errors that tend to give it a 'sloppy' feel. Also, one analogy given in this book was apparently taken from GPS A Guide to the Next Utility by Jeff Hurn and published by Trimble Navigation in 1989, to whom the authors make no reference. It should also be noted that approximately half of this book is just made up of reprinted advertisments for different kinds of GPS equipment. To a few this may be useful, but it will quickly become obsolete. There are many other books that are much better.

Also, one must realize the Tupac Amaro and the Sendero Luminoso were terrorist groups responsible for the murder of thousands of Peruvians. Having lived in Peru during the Fujimori regime, he was considered a hero by most Peruvians who hated the violence and murder committed by the terrorist groups portrayed in this movie.
