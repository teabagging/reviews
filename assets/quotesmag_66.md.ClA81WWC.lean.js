These are not items that have changed over the years; my dairy-allergic son has never been able to eat Wendy's buns,and he's nearly 13 years old.The recipes are fairly good, though I get irked by reading \\"milk substitute\\" in them - I'd rather see the brand name of the product she used (soy milk tastes very different from rice milk, for instance).With this book, as with every packaged food product, you must read carefully and be certain the food she mentions is safe.

She relies on milk-substitutes (rice and soybeverages) more than one might like (see Kidder's _Milk FreeKitchen for a cookbook which doesn't), but her recipes areimaginative and fairly good.

I didn't need a recipe book to tell me that. I know I have those options.

Often, music has to grow on me, so I tried playing the CD a number of times, but it didn't get any better. The songs on this CD just don't seem to have the same kind of inspiration many of his earlier songs have.

For him, it launched itself through the air for about 10 feet, flipped and dug a hole in the lawn.

Any time it was tilling, it was bucking and jerking my arms out of their sockets while I am cussing it like a sailor! After the ground was thorougly tilled, it was fine for keeping weeds down if you used it more often than once a month. Perhaps all tillers are like this but the lesson I have learned over the years concerning small engines (a lesson I ignored -- to my own regret) is this: Pay the extra money and buy Honda. Honda seems to invest their time and money into engineering so their products do what they are desinged to do for a long time rather than investing in advertising to make their stuff last long enough to sell."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another masterpiece","review":"Lara Fabian has done it again with Nue.

A powerful song, stating that Lara still believes in a better world. Then it goes ahead. It talks about love, suicide, loss, gain, friendship. All the things that define one's live.

And in a better world, people will always listen to Lara!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely breathtaking.......","review":"I've always been a Lara Fabian fan. I was not disappointed in this CD.

I've been studying french again, trying to remember what I've forgotten over the past 10 years, and I decided to buy this cd. I was expecting to maybe be a little dissappointed, since I loved \\"pure\\" so much. But this album is definitely as good, and even maybe a little better. The songs are beautiful, her voice is amazing, the melodies and the music are just perfect. And the last track is a piano version of all 15 previous tracks. It is a beautiful cd, even though I only understand every other word!"},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing Lara !","review":"Nue is an exceptional release from Lara !

Would not recommend them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Returned the seats as they are no better than the old fashioned ones - non gel - stadium seats we have been using for years. Perhaps expectations were unrealistic.If you need cushions, these may be as good as any and they are lightweight and somewhat weather proof otherwise, stick with what you have and save some money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I expected","review":"I received this product quickly as always from Amazon. The cushion was much smaller than I expected and did not have sufficient padding to make it useful. The combination of gel and foam should be twice as thick and the cushion itself needs to be longer and wider. This might work well for a child or a petite person, but for a larger frame person, it did nothing. I returned this product shortly after trying it out. I found a thicker, larger dense foam cushion at a local sports store instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"I tried to return this item and the return feature wouldn't work.

Sturdy, easy to clean, convenient handle, fit easily into my back pack. It was even rather benign in that nobody really noticed me pulling it out along with books and notebooks and plopping it onto my chair at university, all of these are great, if you don't actually need a cushion between your buttocks and a hard surface which this does not provide. It also lifts you just enough to allow the front edge of the seat to cut into the backs of your thighs. Not only was it no help, it made things a bit worse. I do not recommend it for anyone except for those who can be fooled by the placebo effect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and unimpressive","review":"This anime is boring and unimpressive.

This anime was boring. I almost fell asleep watching the first four episodes.The plot didn't attract me. The animation isn't all that great, and it has a hardly better picture then the VHS. There is literally about 30 seconds of action, and the action that is shown is dull.I don't know, maybe I don't like it because I don't get Matsumoto's works(this is the first one I've seen). I recommend this as a rental instead of a buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Reviews?!!!","review":"I am absolutely astonished that there is not one single review on this album. Seriously. This man was one of the greats. A blues musician that nearly became one of the lost legends if it weren't for this recording. Robert Lockwood Jr. claimed that Harney was well acquainted with Robert Johnson and was a major influence on him, being the only musician that could compete with him. The guitar work in this album is stunning. And! it was recorded when he was in his sixties, hadn't picked up a guitar in years and had had a stroke!!! An absolute must for any true blues fan. Essential."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD kind of scared me...but in a good way.","review":"Yeah, well, it did kind of scare me. But, like I said, it wasn't a negative experience...really, it was rather alluring. I'm not sure what I would classify the music as...I wouldn't say it was punk or metal or whatever else, but I can make one general assessment about it: it was damn erotic. I've never heard anything that DARKLY sensuous in all my aural escapades (with, perhaps, the exception of much of Die Form's work.) Gen really gets you to think and to question...not only the way you express yourself sexually, but also intellectually. She proved to me to be an acutely intelligent and thoughtful woman. That's a sexy thing. After all, what's more attractive than a woman with a fierce libido AND a fierce mind?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great debut album!","review":"I have both Sin City and this album. I loved Sin City, so I bought this album.It's a great heavy metal album, it's just not exactly very melodic in my mind.

Being as ecelectic and ADHD as I am, I'll need something different. The songs aren't in themselves very unique from other stuff or themselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"A masterpiece","review":"120 Days is a melting pot of metal & industrial.

However, having this set only contain the playoff games is an EPIC FAIL! The Giants had to win the last two games of the season. This run began with the 99 yard catch and run by Victor Cruz against the Jets. Then a do or die sunday night match up against the cowboys for the NFC East title. How both of those games are not included in this set is ridiculous.

I did and I didn't feel so attached to it as I did to the first novel. I do think it was a great novel but the basic idea of the story was how different Ethan and Leah were and all the obstacles between them that stopped them from being together. Until the last five chapters did the novel's title start making sense. Excluding the slow parts, I think the novel was very good. The ending, though, makes you want to know what will happen between Leah and Ethan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet book.","review":"A really sweet book, very well written.

It helps me better understand whatothers are going through in the world. This book gave me a good idea of how powerful God's work is on earth. You feel like your life is blessed after reading this novel, whether ill or not, because you can believe that God is there for you always and that an angel is there to meet you at the end of the road. I learned alot about the Amish communities. I liked how the book was put together.It has romance, drama, miracles, and history all packed into one!

The cards are oversized being roughly twice the size of a normal deck. The visual layout is clean and easily read from the other side of our rather large gaming table. The art on the face cards is colorful and well executed with a slightly pulp/comic feel. The use of different genres for the face card characters is inspired and really helps distinguish the different suits even more. Due to the oversized nature of the cards, shuffling can be slightly more difficult than a standard deck but I think the good looking art and the ease of reading the cards from a distance make up for this. I wouldn't use them to play poker, but for their use in Savage Worlds as initiative counters these cards are ideal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Essential, But Nice If You Can Own One","review":"Savage Worlds uses cards to determine initiative.Deadlands:Reloaded uses cards in a number of other roles, not least during duels at High Noon.You don't need special cards. Any deck with the jokers left in will do, though Savage Worlds GMs often go to great lengths to secure idiosyncratic decks in order to give their games a unique \\"look\\".This deck is printed on oversize stock, so that each card is about half as big again as a standard poker card, and the face cards feature artwork from the various Savage Worlds publications.The size can make shuffling a little difficult for those with small hands, but the increase in visibility has been a positive boon for me when teaching the Savage Worlds system to new players at convention games and I have hands like steamshovels anyway.Recommended for those looking to upgrade from Bicycle Rider backs.[EDIT]Check out the new (regular sized)Savage Worlds RPG: Action & Adventure Decks[/EDIT]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty, but not necessary.","review":"I purchased this deck and theSavage Worlds Explorers Edition (S2P10010)at the same time, in preparation to play in a friend's campaign. Being unfamiliar with the SW system, I was under the impression that this specific deck was required for game play, possibly having text and rules for game use. I was wrong, through no fault of the cards or SW, which is a great system. They are pretty to look at, with interesting character illustrations ,but their large size makes them a bit hard to shuffle and deal. As much as I enjoy supporting the game industry with my dollar, in hindsight, I could have just bought a deck of dollar-store playing cards and been fine.

Some stories are heartwarming, such as those contained in a chapter on good samaritans who came to the aid of fellow citizens in need. Others are horrifying, making the reader involuntarily shake his or her head at the inhumanity and senseless loss that occurs every day in this crime-ridden city.

My friends and I would listen to it half-seriously, but really enjoyed it. I just found the CD at my parents' house while examining my dad's new stereo and immediately went home and imported it to my iTunes. This shit is ACTUALLY really good! Their lyrics are playful yet meaningful and they twist shit! For instance, the song The Oceanfront tells the story of a typical LA beach party, but as the song progresses, it becomes more of a song about growing up and growing apart from their core group of friends and appreciating the time they're able to spend together as obstacles get in the way. Who doesn't relate to that? They're not struggling to sound \\"hard\\".It's not a gimmick. They are merely telling stories of their experiences as white kids growing up in a predominantly ethnic environment. The production is tight and the beats are downright funky at times.

The critics here who point out the poor acting need to read Teddy Roosevelt's quote on criticism. There are films with bad acting where it is obvious that the people are acting and not playing a role naturally - but this one showed no signs of that. One of my favorite actresses GiGi Erneta only had a small role in this. Ali Faulkner is a rising star. The adult leads were good.

Listening to 'The Sign' and 'The Bridge' again proved to be a great experience, not only because of the nostalgia but because they were still pretty good albums in my mind, even after not hearing them in about a decade. Cruel Summer, on the other hand, is horrid.The overall theme of this album is very disco, and sometimes even has a doo wop feel (a very caucasian-sounding doo wop, mind you). The album has spots that are more dance-y and poppy and are not too terrible, but they are still pretty drab. This album was very disappointing to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD SUMMER....","review":"C'MON ACE OF BASE's FANS...THIS ALBUM IS REALLY A WASTED OF TIME AND YOU KNOW IT.

With a third, of course.This cd is so incredible, every song fills with different emotions and reactions. Cecilia is awesome and really enjoy the bonus Cruel Summer track. At first, I was disappointed because how can a group redo this Bananrama song; but, they did it quite nicely and I actually am liking it more than the original. I also love Toyko Girl and Travlin to Romantis...this is the rockin' cd of the season."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"This CD was very very disappointing. I loved their first two CD's, but when I bought this one without listening to it first, I immediately thought of a hundred things I should have done with my $13. The songs just weren't very good. I noticed that they didn't write some of the songs on this CD. They shouldn't try to sing other people's music. It just didn't work. They should definitely stay away from ballads. There were only about two or three decent songs, and I honestly tried to listen to this CD a few times, hoping that it would catch on, but it didn't.What happened to the blond chick? I noticed she was fuzzed out in all the pictures. Just wondering."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great one from Ace of Base","review":"The new cd is as expected, quite good and full of well crafted pop songs. From the uplifting \\"Whenever Your Near Me\\" and 50's pop sound of \\"Donnie\\" to the mellow \\"Everytime it Rains\\" their is no shortage of 'single' potential. Their renditon of \\"Cruel Summer\\" however is a bit of a disappoint. Well done but it adds little to the superior Banananrama original. I can't bring myself to give it 5 stars, as good as it is, it doesn't have the large collection of wonderfull songs as their previous, \\"The Bridge\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is Their Best CD!","review":"This CD Is really not what you would expect from Ace of Base. Living in Europe and now owning bother versions of the album, I can see how they have adapted it for the US Market. Everytime it Rains is a beautiful 5 minutes of music, very deep song with a lot of meaning. I also like Whenever You're Near Me, which has re-written words form the hit in Europe, Life is A Flower. Also a few songs on this album are different to the versions on the European release, but I urge all Ace of Base fans to get hold of this album.

However, the album, \\"Blue Sky Mining\\" is by far one of the best!! EVERY song is excellent and evokes a passionate response from the listener. The arranging of the music is perfect, which is sometimes hard to imagine with the amount of lyrics Peter Garret tries to \\"fit\\" into a melody. From the working mans songs :Blue Sky Mine, and King of the Mountain to the smoky, Mountains of Burma,and rythmic Antarctica, you are transported through every range of emotion and can find common threads no matter where you are from; I'm a Canadian. And once you've heard \\"Stars of Warburton\\".. the \\"Oils\\" will have YOU \\"shouting to the skies again\\"....enjoy!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Midnight Oil Blue Sky Mining","review":"This band rocks. They give you reality through their music, you feel like you are rebelling with them and the hard working blue collar man. The lyrics are well written. I especially love \\"Antartica\\" and with the Global warming and environmental changes happening, you wonder how much longer it will survive. These songs will never get old with me, I could listen to them over and over and never get tired of them. This is one CD you must add to your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite a good CD","review":"This CD is one of Midnight Oil's best and I'd put it as a tie with \\"10,9,8,7..\\" for their Second best album, with Diesel and Dust being the first. It's softer than either of those two, but the lyrics, which poke fun at the insecurities of Capitalism, job related and otherwise, and give hope for the future. One Country is a very simple song, but is nonethless one of the best. The first 4 are all addictive. There is poignant social commentary in this album, as well as commentary about the problems facing the environment. It's not as hard-hitting as \\"10,9,8. . \\" and Diesel and Dust but it is still worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"MacBook Pro Battery Exchange Program","review":"I have had this machine since March. It always ran hot so much that you had to cover your legs when using it. The battery began to give me real trouble at the same time Apple announced its battery exchange program. Once I figured out how to read the battery serial number(I had to remove it and blow it up via the copier by 200%!) and even then it took me a while to figure out the final four characters, I called Apple, was told to use the web site, entered the info at about 3:00P.M. and received the replacement battery the next day by 1:00P.M. Called DHL at 1:30P.M. to pick up the old one and they were there by 3:30P.M. to return it to Apple. Excellent response and I wonder if Bill and his buddies would even consider matching that. Oh, by the way, the machine ain't bad either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully odd tales from the same city","review":"The best way to read this book is to know nothing about it beforehand. Maupin has crafted a creepily odd and seductive psychological mystery that needs to tap into your sense of innocence and surprise; it is what you must bring to the read. At more than one point I was caught up with the \\"Wow!\\" of the plot. Maupin manages to mix the inventive and the autobiographical in a way that lends resonance to both elements, and if his emotional nakedness does not unsettle you, the strangeness of the story will pull you in."},{"rating":"2","title":"An engrossing read","review":"I do not know the author to judge if this is partially a biography. But the story itself is suspenseful, engrossing and at times heart breaking. However I am giving 4 stars and not 5 stars because I never like vague ending which to me is the flaw of the whole story. Maybe it would have been a better ending if the author has just left out the afterward. Overall the book is brilliantly written. The emotions just flow and I found myself feeling for Gabriel, a lonely, insecure and unhappy man past his prime seeking for acceptance from his father and love. Did he finally find love and solace through talking with Peter/Peter's mother? The story seems to suggest so. Jess, Gabriel's 10 year lover who left him, is a fascinating character too. Jess may have Aids but he wants to live and that in itself is beauty and strength. A must read despite the ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"big let down","review":"The book had a fast paced momentum throughout that concluded with...nothing but a big let down!

It portrays emotions which are very real; very perceptive; I can relate to lot of feelings expressed. Very touching; at times painful; at the same time very funny.I would recommend reading the biography of Armistead Maupin written by Patrick Gale.

I never fail to finish a book, but I could not finish this one. I kept waiting for the book to have some redeeming quality that might make the juvenile depression expressed by the author worth the time I had already invested, but the empty drone of the wail lasted longer than I could.The side story about the abused child was also not worth the time and only kept my interest because it diverted the author from the continuous detailing of his lost love.Paul Katz Boulder, Colorado"},{"rating":"1","title":"I feel dirty now","review":"This book is about a writer who splits up with his long-term boyfriend, becomes depressed, and then becomes friends with a young boy (I think 10? 12? I don't remember) over the phone who was abused and used in a kiddy porn ring by his parents before escaping only to learn he had AIDs and writing a book on it. Except as the book goes on, it becomes questionable whether the kid actually exists.All well and good, but what really makes the book stand out isn't the storyline. Noooo. It's the slashy overtones where there REALLY REALLY SQUICKILY SHOULDN'T BE ANY! I should NOT get the idea that this abused kid is this middle-aged author's fantasy. No, no, NO.I felt dirty after reading this. I felt even more dirty after finding out via wikipedia that the author based it on a real life experience of it.This is a scary scary man, and makes me want a long long bath."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling","review":"A story filled with many twists and turns.

Oddly, I felt throughout the entire thing, that Maupin must have been stalking me, before writing Gabriel's character. It's almost a long-lost twin, albeit 20 years older. At one point near the end, I found myself in the uncomfortable position if sitting on a plane while reading it, tears running down my face. Call me emotional, I guess...Bottom line, this is not to be missed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Insightful, Haunting Tale","review":"This is truly a many-faceted gem. In the 1980s I spent seven years working with a phone crisis line, and I became aware of callers who gave different names but had voices similar enough for us to question how many people we were talking to. As in this book, opinions differed. Mr. Maupin is right in showing that it is what WE bring to these situations as well as the truly factual aspects which are SO important and revealing. This story will haunt you, especially about what you are expected or expect yourself to take \\"on faith\\". I agree with the reviewer who lamented the fact that he's not more prolific with his novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"love it!!!!!!!!!","review":"this is such a great book! i was moved and bewildered by the story. in fact, i had to reread it to get some further understanding, i will most likely read it over and over again. its that good! i had to go out and get a few of maupins other books, which are wonderful as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perhaps his other works are better...","review":"I can't deny that The Night Listener is engaging and easy to relate to. What I liked most is the way Gabriel describes the pain of losing a lover and falling into a depression. It's not easy to stick to him, but Maupin's depiction of the loss is very accurate. However, the whole story about Pete and his relationship with Gabriel is unrealistic and creepy. We virtually cannot see the emotional scars that Pete carries due to his years of suffering. Perhaps the writer has tried to give us a clue, after all, we never know if Pete is really himself. But the fact that after a few phone calls, Gabriel and Pete are calling themselves father and son, made me feel very uneasy. Also, the subplot involving Gabriel and his father is cliched and boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not believable, except in parts","review":"I found this book to be a fun read, but it's not a \\"masterpiece\\" or a \\"triumph.\\" Even by Maupin's \\"Tale of the City\\" standards, this is a strangely unsatisfying novel. I thought the storyline itself was confusing and did not really lead much of anywhere. I was fascinated with this book more as a document of Maupin's self-indulgence than as an act of fictional creativity.I would have liked to see a novel that spent more time with Noone's breakup with his long-time lover, Jess. The dynamics of Noone's heartbreak in the context of seeing a lover move from almost certain death to a completely different plane are handled wonderfully, but it would have been preferable to see this story moved to the forefront and the hokey 13-year-old-as-counselor gimmick moved to the background. The novel that Maupin really should have written, unfortunately, is not what we get."},{"rating":"1","title":"a weak story, poorly told","review":"Maupin, with his \\"Tales of the City\\" series and \\"Maybe the Moon,\\" established himself as a storyteller of high order. That makes this current book an even greater disappointment. A book that cannot decide what it wants to be, it is full of one-dimensional or incomprehensible characters that move around within the rambling plot without reason or cause or much to like about them. The plot \\"twists\\" are mostly unnecessary or inane, and one is left feeling that Maupin owes us a refund or a real book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yikes","review":"This is one of the worst books by a real writer I have ever read. Of course, there are books by people who really can not write and their books are simply unreadable. And there are books by accomplished authors who just dialed it in to meet a deadline.

I am a theatre director interested in Grand Guignol Dramas and, even though I did not LOVE the play, it is most certainly a great excercise for actors, as well as for directors, since the play presents a very intriguing character. It is a ruthless character, yet the audience must love her dearly. It's a very fine line to work there, therefore a great challenge. It's strange, the poems and specially the play affected me in a peculiar way: I was not cray about the text, but it was intriguing and challenging.

It is strange, for example, that the author refers to the pharmaceutical industry as \\"slow cycle\\" industry, while everybody knows that there are few industry where time is so critical to success and where radical changes (just look at biotech and the revolutionary changes ahead) occur so quickly and drammatically.The book cites far too many industries to provide any actionable information and it is legitimate to say that it is highly superficial.My clear vote is \\"Not recommended\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Gift!","review":"I bought this for my fiance who loves penguins because we both love tea.

Spetner illustrates that not only does Dawkins make radical, unsubstantiated assumptions about the probability of natural selection as an explanation for human life, but that Dawkins lacks a basic understanding of the astronomical odds involved in his rather nonsensical theories. Given that Spetner holds a PhD in physics from MIT, and has a far superior grasp of probability theory, one wonders why Dawkins continues to have any commercial success at all.

Like the best of SJ Gould, the book has real flavor because its author has a strong point of view; but just Dawkins' writing style - clear, bold, beautiful - should make it a classic of the popularization genre.However, the strong view also points to bias, in Dawkins' case a combination of strict genetic determinism and an obsession with computer analogies. Frankly, computer simulations and pseudo-discovery stories, which over-rated magazines like WIRED promote and hype ad infinitum, are boring: so many of these books on \\"complexity\\" etc. just repeat the same stuff.

In fact this book is really nothing more than a Bible for atheists. However it advocates a faith without any kind of salvation, just meaningless living.

Creationists argue that the eye has too many interdependent parts for each of the parts to have evolved seperately and still have the eye \\"work\\" to any degree.

Dawkins' analysis is sharp and his writing both clear and amusing. I'm not saying it's a perfect book; he spends too much time on his biomorphs, for instance. But overall, it's a remarkably consistent work and filled with fascinating examples, from bats to fish to insects. And it's gratifying to see that in the last chapter, Dawkins doesn't pull his punches when explaining why Lamarckism and creationism aren't adequate explanations of life as we know it.I know \\"The Selfish Gene\\" made Dawkins' reputation, and he himself says \\"The Extended Phenotype\\" is his best book, but if you've never read any of Dawkins' books, this is the place to start.Best line: \\"...living organisms exist for the benefit of DNA, not the other way around.\\" From the \\"Power and the Archives\\" chapter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Do you *really* understand evolution by natural selection?","review":"It's amazing how few people, including staunch advocates of evolution, really understand the mechanisms of Darwin's theory of evolution. Dawkins recognizes this, and devotes this book to explaining the theory in a way that helps the reader relate to the vast timescales and processes involved, and attempts to reduce terse scientific jargon to understandable concepts. He does this remarkably well, and even those who thought they had evolution and natural selection down pat may come away with a more personal understanding. One of the most interesting aspects of the book is the accompaning software, which allows the user to experiment with 'biomorphs' that breed, mutate, and evolve based on the 'artificial selection' of the user. In this way, the reader can test some of the theories for themselves, bringing the conceps to life in a way that few books on the subject have done"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice try, but philosophy isn't the same thing as science.","review":"Richard Dawkins has written a brilliantly written, highly informative, and woefully mistaken defense of non-teleological Darwinism.

Dawkins does a great job of explication, *assuming* that his ideas of evolutionary continuity and the efficacy of mindless processes to produce organized complexity are correct. However, that is a pretty big assumption. Michael Behe has given some of Dawkins' more egregious examples a badly needed skewering in his new book, _Darwin's Black Box_ (Interestingly enough, many people seem to think that Dawkins has pre-refuted Behe.

I am looking forward to reading it again, with new surprse and definetely, enjoyment."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Introduction To and Defense of Evolution","review":"This book is another fine effort by Richard Dawkins to explain how the complexity of life can be explained by evolution including natural selection. He uses his usual detailed, but laymen type of explanation to explore how various attributes of animals (and man) have come about.The books closing chapters deal with some of the other theories that exist to try to explain the diversity of life. He does not take a highbrow approach. He explains the core beliefs and concepts of the theories and then using their own words, shows how they can not explain it as well as the theory of evolution can.I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in a good discussion of evolution.

However, as a scientist I have learned that absolute certainty is only for mountebanks. I must say however, that I learned a lot, despite the fact that I have read most of Darwin's works, and many related texts. Unfortunately it is easy to get riled up by his everyone else is an idiot tone, and miss many of the startling insights of the work.

True, empircal evolution (i.e. adaptation, speciation, selection, and genetic drift) is all well and good - and irrefutable - but it has zip to do with origins, and will remain a delusional fantasy for those who reject the Biblical record of sudden creation and the subsequent global water catastrophe.

In a philosophical sense it says nothing important. Only how things MAY have happened.I take it that if it IS science it is only so by being vulnerable to overthrow. Impregnability is DOGMA and is the worst of scientism. In other words ONE counter instance can overthrow a physical, constant or theory, there are far too many that stand against evolution it must just have the status of 'scientific' opinion.

Why do we have reason? Because of God. He gave us reason. He gave us everything.Look at the world around you and tell me that theres no God. Look at how wonderful this world is. Dawkins shoud be thanking God, not dissing him and saying he doesnt exist. We need FAITH. Not just science. Science says alot of true stuff........but not everything. How can you scientificaly look at beauty??? as Einstein said beauty is truth after all...we need to love God. We need to have faith and love each other...without faith theres no reason to be moral or to care about anything...science cant tell you about morals or beauty, we need to have faith.

Like good sci-fi, interesting but fictitious in its premises and conclusions. Even if natural selection mechanism is not statistically equivalent to chanciness, to endorse the notion that a pimple on some primitive creature migrated or gravitated or transmogrified to today's sophisticated eye (in matching colored pairs, mind you) takes more faith than accepting Genesis as eyewitness account of Someone Who was there In the Beginning.This book is not just about The Blind Watchmaker. It is about Blind Faith in Brute Forces of Dumb Selectivity unintelligently creating intelligence. Life as we know it emerged from pre-life as we don't know it? Pre-life emerged from ... chance? Or is it pre-chance?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dying Theory","review":"This book still clings to the dying theory of Darwin's Natural Selection hypothesis!!

He needs to go to Amazon.com and pick out a good adventure tale to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Something from nothing?","review":"After reading this book, I unfortunately have to conclude that the famous Richard Dawkins believes the following statements:-You CAN get something out of nothing!-Out of arational, unconscious, determined (reacts and cannot act) matter, you can get rational, conscious, free human beings entirely by random mutations.Believing that would take far more faith than I possess.For a logically and philosophically sound argument, read The Kalam Cosmological Argument by William Lane Craig."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must read","review":"Dawkins' book is the single most important book I have read in nearly 60 well-educated years. It answers dozens of questions that have puzzled me throughout a lifetime -- questions that have never been satisfactorily addressed by the multiple creation myths of the world's various religions. I've read it several times, recommended it to my children and everyone else willing to listen, and I recommend it as a must read for anyone who is the least bit curious as to who they are and from whence they came."},{"rating":"2","title":"The works","review":"I bought and read this book because Douglas Adams prized it.

Fascinating."},{"rating":"2","title":"An explanation of why evolution makes sense.","review":"Dawkins has a way of explaining things that makes sense to the rest of us. The book is close to twenty years old now, but is still an excellent introduction to the subject of evolution. Dawkins takes on the creationists' arguments one by one and destroys them all, but he is also interesting, not merely pedantic. For those who have heard all the noise and can't make sense of the arguments and counter-arguments, this book will help make it clear."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read!","review":"Not as quick and clean as Abusing Science (Philip Kitcher, ISBN 026261037X) but still necessary intellectual self defense against those zealots who prey on ignorance and rely on misinformation.

His more recent books are excellent: very well written, entertaining, and cogent.Watchmaker is my least favorite Dawkins book [so far]. In a few places, it is sloppy and unconvincing, although the thesis is right on the mark and almost speaks for itself to anyone with an appropriate technical background.I haven't read Climbing Mount Improbable but I would guess that it is much better. Why else would he have re-written the same book ten years later?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Caught up in the discussions of the day","review":"While the point Dawkins makes is obviously right and a good point, he frequently looses himself in endless repetition of the same argument, and many of the chapters serve to refute discussions of the day or more frequently discussions of the early days of Darwinism.I read the 2006 edition cover to cover and had hoped that he would update this with some of the more interesting questions - how genes get expressed, more modern knowledge of embryology, but found that the latest edition does not share the insights gained in the last 30 years. Also, some of his arguments refuting other theories are so thin, that a highschool student could prick them in a hour (look for his arguments on mutationism, there full of obvious nonsense).That is unfortunate, since the core premise, that Darwin was right about natural selection is so important that is deserves a passionate plea. But it also deserves a plea that is better made and more up to date with today's knowledge."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book to explain the mechanics af evolutionary theory","review":"Entertaining popular science book on the foundations of modern scientific evolutionary theory. There are newer books out there and much more evidence is at hand today. However, for a easy to understand walk-thru of the basic elements of the thinking behind and evidence behind evolutionary scientific theory (and counter arguments to creationalist religious belief) this book is highly recommended. The examples are easy to follow and all important angles and hard questions are dealt with in a logical way. I am - as others - surprised by the many reviews here that so directly misrepresent what this book says and the arguments that Dawkins put forward. If only for this reason I can only even more strongly urge people to read this for themselves if they have reservations on the ability of evolution to explain the world in which we live today - and the fact that I can write this on a computer and communicate it the the internet to the world! Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dawkins and Evolution","review":"I have read this book and plan to read it again and again.

The author ignores a plethora of scientific material, almost as if it doesn't exist. He makes assertions that are either poorly substantiated or provides no definitive support whatsoever! I would definitely not recommend this book for anyone wanting a balanced discussion on the subject of Intelligent Design and evolution."},{"rating":"1","title":"Willful suspension of intelligence.","review":"Disclaimer: I didn't read past page one because to do so would have been tantamount to willfully hurling myself down the rabbit hole.Starting off with a bang by throwing credibility to the wind, on page one Dawkins redefines biology and physics, and then, merrily tripping down the lunacy trail, he proceeds to defend his absurd classifications (computers and cars are, for the sake of his argument, biological objects) by actually admitting that he uses words in different senses when it is convenient.Now there's reliable science for you.Good thing he's not a chemist, he'd blow himself up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the evidence?","review":"In this book you can't tell where the science ends and where religion begins. Dawkins has done a good job of blending them into one another as an attempt to justify his materialistic worldview. While reading this book I kept wondering, where is this Evidence of Evolution that Reveals a Universe Without Design? I kept looking for the evidence but never found it. Dawkins uses misdirection and fancy wording but fails to offer any proof for his blind watchmaker theory.Read this book carefully and look at the evidence for yourself. Then judge whether or not the evidence supports the authors conclusion. Dawkins, very sneaky, doesn't examine what complexity is or how it could have arisen by random mutatons. Moreover, he doesn't even examine the statistical probability of his theory. But yet wants to convince the reader that life could evolve without outside help. The message is convincing, but lacks any evidence to support it."},{"rating":"1","title":"academically worthless","review":"Dawkins offers logically fallacious arguments at best. His darwinian religionist bias colors his interpretation of observed phenomena. He approaches his subject with the philosophical, apriori assumption of naturalism which he fails to establish. His naturalistic, materialistic, physicalist worldview is contradicted by his desire to utilize non-natural, non-physical, non-material entities like laws of logic, and induction. The title to Dawkins' book is apropos, for in the end he clings to his darwinian religion the way all evolutionists do - by blind faith."},{"rating":"1","title":"Duhhh","review":"So let's see: Richard Dawkins's computer can generate interesting 'biomorphs' IF IT'S PROPERLY PROGRAMMED, and a roomful of monkeys can type out 'Methinks it is a weasel' by repeated typing IF AN INTELLIGENT HUMAN BEING MONITORS THE PROCESS AND RETAINS THE CORRECT LETTERS.

The real argument is not overthe presence of design but over the source of the design.

It's amazing how many presumably bright people buy into his hogwash.For the record, I've been an atheist since I was 6 years old and have no interest in the creationist agenda, nor in the young earth agenda. But the evolutionary facts nevertheless suggest design. They most certainly do not suggest accident. And while it is abundantly clear that creatures evolve, it is just as clear that Darwinism is not the driving force behind evolution. The fact is that we do not have any idea what drives evolution but there does appear to be a design to it. What is so unfortunate about Dawkin's drivel is that real evolutionary science is at a standstill and will be until his generation dies.It's hard to determine whether Dawkins is not very bright or simply dishonest, The way in which he ignores valid arguments against his positions and engages in ad hominem attacks suggests the latter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Creation and Modeling","review":"For the skeptics of the Biomorph experiments:When you try to model a system, you always have to intervene to define the parameters of the model! With nature, the parameters are defined by the physical world (melting point of water etc...) In a computer model, these parameters have to somehow be defined by human intervention. This is the \\"creation\\" that is taking place and it doesn't detract from the validity of the rest of the experiment. (Of course the rest of the experiment MAY be flawed, but then this would be a different issue.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice try, but philosophy isn't the same thing as science.","review":"Richard Dawkins has written a brilliantly written and woefully mistaken defense of non-teleological Darwinism.

Dawkins does a great job of explication, *assuming* that his ideas of evolutionary continuity and the efficacy of mindless processes to produce organized complexity are correct. However, that is a pretty big assumption.Michael Behe has given some of Dawkins' more egregious examples a badly needed skewering in his new book, _Darwin's Black Box_ (Interestingly enough, many people seem to think that Dawkins has pre-refuted Behe.

Nuclear Assault's Something Wicked TOTALLY reminds me of a new release by a new band called Another Animal,which also has very fresh sound as well and follows on the same path as Something Wicked in its metal/rock roots. On top of that both album covers have that circus/zoo/entertainment feel as odd as that sounds have cool album covers.

It doesn't even cover all the engines it claims to.Once youve purchased it & removed the shrink wrap, you'll be able to see the list of engines it really does cover, several (like mine) are conspicuously absent.The engines that are covered are poorly covered. It lacks diagrams or breakdowns of many key areas of the engines, and the info that it does contain is so basic that it would apply to ANY engine.Do not waste your time & money on Seloc manuals."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dean ultra plug","review":"I was in to RC racing about 10 years ago and used these same plugs.I wasn't surprised to see them still available.They work well on 7.2, 8.4 and 9.6v battery packs.I also use them on my Nitro T-Maxx 3.3 for the 4.8v pack, as well as an AssociatedRC10GT and electric Tamiya Blackfoot.Very heat resistant. I've never melted one, even from soldering.There isn't a lot of area to solder to so if you tin the wire firstso it has already taken solder it's quite easy to solder it to the post.Need only remove an 1/8th inch of insulation from the wires and the included heatshrink fits good and no need for tape.Looks professional when you get the hang of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keyed Power","review":"A really nice standardization plug set.

And I disagree with them. This novel was horribly amateurish and simply written. It read like it was written by a high schooler. Although the idea behind the story wasn't bad, it was not executed well. It was like watching a bad movie, but after investing the time, I felt like I had to see it to the end.

The problem is that the movie has nothing to say. The dialogue is laughably arch, the narrative the same familiar story, and the attempts at arty cinematography generally pointless. And there's absolutely no rhyme or reason to what music is played when, let alone how these mischosen excerpts sound once they're spliced together. There's just nothing going on in this film.If, on the other hand, you're attracted to anodyne paeons to l'art pour l'art, or fancy costumes, or garishly performed and mindlessly repeated excerpts of a few dramaturgically suspect musical snippets, this might just be up your alley."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!

It isn't boring and not too technical. It is just an explaination of how freshwater behaves on earth. It explains groudwater, rivers, lakes, water cycle, and the functioning of aquifers. The focus of the book was on North America and in particular Canada and the North of the United States, that's okay but she spends several pages about bogs and fens and one small paragraph about the forested wetlands and mangrove wetlands. I think the lady is Canadian, so she writes aboput what is around her. That is fine, it liked that book and would recommend it to somebody who has an interest in the science of things around us.

Unfortunately, I bought two of these for my two phones, and they both worked the same, so it seems to be a design flaw. The mic boom is too short and/or the mic amplification is way too low.Even with the intermittent connection, the cheap headsets that came with my phone are infinitely better than the M130.

Hard to get the receptacle out and box doesn't quite fit in the tent.

The book probably discourages the right type of people from coming to West Point and encourages the type that West Point does not and should not want.

There are others that you can read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Elite?","review":"I don't see what's so great about West Point. I expected that standards would be higher.

The book talks about the Honor Code with a \\"see no evil\\" mentality. Yet every 10-15 years, regular as clockwork, there is a cheating scandal related to that code.While we are at it, there is very little written about the teachers. It is a shame Lipsky chose not to spend any time with them.I also had major problems with the format of the book, it jumps around way too much. Just when you are starting to get a feel for a cadet, you are jerked away from that person.I have spent a lot of time at the Point and have great affection for the institution and its people.

The stories the book told, following individual cadets, were always interesting and often surprising. I felt I got a really credible look at how the cadets lived there lives and what they thought and felt.I found the cadets to be an idealistic group, much more so than your average college students. I was fascinated to see how some of them bonded with the institution and there fellow cadets while others did not. I really enjoyed the feeling of this campus on the Hudson River, just a short distance from New York City, being both a world apart and yet one of the most enduring achievements of our country, right at the heart of our country.It's a timely book now that our military appears to be becoming a vital force in the nation's life once again."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISAPPOINTING","review":"THIS BOOK WAS EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTING.

I have bought all of her other albums as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 stars, hands down!","review":"Miranda Lambert has come up with another winner. This album shows off the amazing talent she posseses at such a young age. If you liked her first album and think that was everything she had, think again...there's definitely no sophomore jinx here. In a way, some of her songs remind me of the tracks in Alanis' JAgged Little Pill...her frustrations in Crazy Ex-Girlfriend resonates through her voice as easy as the emotions flow through ballads such as Love Letters. My personal favorite is Dry Town, which happens to be the most country of all the songs here. Get it, you'll love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Crazy Ex-Girlfriend Continues Where Kerosene Left Off","review":"I don't recall an album that so closely mirrors its predecessor and continues to highlight the outstanding talent of its musician. I liked every single track, from the already popular ones: Gunpowder & Lead, Dry Town, Famous in a Small Town, and Crazy Ex-Girlfriend, to the not-yet as well-known ones. My personal favorite is: \\"More Like Her\\". I don't know why; I just really like this track. Miranda Lambert really is \\"beautiful in her simple little way.\\" Please, Miranda, don't make us wait so long until your next album! But then, maybe it was the wait that made this second album so great!!! Nah, it's the great music and lyrics coming from your heart and soul.Dave M."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sophomore album!","review":"This was an album that I had on my wish list, but was holding off on buying. I finally broke down and let me tell you - I am so impressed with this sophomore album. Miranda takes country back to what country used to be. Although I am a fan of the more modern form of country, I love this album! The songs are catchy and really well written. The words jump out at you and not only do you enjoy it, you can laugh at how crazy it all seems, yet realistic because these things happen. The first three tracks are the perfect introduction to a fabulous album. If you like country and if you liked her first album, you will really enjoy this cd!"},{"rating":"1","title":"USB port broke after 3 weeks","review":"This is a very sleek unit that offers a wonderful functional experience -- while it's working.

I wasn't sure I'd get a full cardio and toning combo in just 30 minutes, but I really felt I did. Plus, it was fun. A little cardio kick boxing, a little dance...but just repetitive enough that makes it easy to follow without being boring.I'm not sure what the previous negative review is talking about.

Way better than the card game. Comes with a really easy start-up guide. Can't say enough about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of little pieces!","review":"It takes awhile to set up the game itself, much like all the other Catan games, but this one is pretty neat looking, visually. We've only played it twice so far. I have a 5 month old, so all the little pieces were very noticible to me. It helps to pick up the boosters and lasers straight up, instead of at an angle like a puzzle piece. It seems to be fun! We'll keep playing to really get the rules down. I was thinking this was the other space game from Catan, but it works because this one is only for two players. (They apparently aren't manufacturing the other game currently.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good game","review":"Game is very well designed. The first time out it was a little long but it has a quick start game so that you can learn the rules as you play the first game. That made for a better night than just reading the rule book for 30 minutes. Setup for each game takes some time, but it is worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Got To Love Those Randall Men!","review":"Is it possible to fall in love with a character I think it is.

I was excited that Judy Christenberry decided to reissuse the Randall Brothers series because I have been looking for the books for some time now. I have read \\"Cowboy Come Home\\" the story of Randall cousin Griffin first not realizing until it was to late that there were other books in the series.

And let me tell you, the studio releases sound anemic and tinny next to this. But live the band absolutely roars to life: the production is full and throaty, and the performances manage to be both raw and tight. With maybe the exception of \\"Earth Sun and Moon,\\" I don't think any of their studio albums have approached the sheer sonic power of this one.A handful of bands out there are best heard on their live albums, and MO is one of them. This is not a \\"fans only\\" live album. Quite the opposite. If you're new to MO, I urge you to pick this as your FIRST album. You'll be converted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great set","review":"However, I would have liked \\"Best of Both Worlds\\" to be included on the disc, as well as more songs from BLUE SKY MINING.

Haydn's music played by the Vermeer String Quartet was heartbreakingly beautiful! I had not known of the music, so that contributed to my enjoyment. I used most of the short meditations (some were not helpful) as a guide for my own meditation times. The disappointment was the CD in the back of the book, which I could not understand why it was there. It has some weird sounds on it. I wrote to the publishers to inquire but no one responded. So, ignore that CD but play the front one--the music will enrich your life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow...bad","review":"Or at least not what I was looking for...but based on all the other reviews here, I thought it was. This book has a very limited audience in mind, namely those who are giving \\"speeches\\", not just regular, everyday presentations and meetings. The name of the book is deceiving, and so are the reviews. The first chapter is the only one that is moderately worthwhile if you're actually looking for tips on becoming more confident. Otherwise, it is simply a laundry list of ways to give big speeches; not helpful at all to the average joe who works in corporate america and just wants to feel more confident. I realize this is difficult to teach in a book, but the other reviewers gave the impression that I might garner some tidbits on this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful new voices","review":"Wonderful music, the type one can listen to over and over again.

I was sickened by the police footage that the so-called filmmakers used showing the mutilated bodies of three eight year olds. I was horrified with the titling with crosses in the Os like this is some cheap horror movie. I was digusted with how the filmmakers, apprently gleefully, show child murderers cavorting and primping for the camera. If that's not enough the two filmmaker losers chose to use the favorite music of the convicted killers for the music of their \\"film.\\" The propagandist filmmakers not happy enough with their obvious disgust with the parents of the victims and their Christian religion tried to help create evidence to skew the trial in favor of the murderers! This whole film is just plain grotesque. There is no excuse for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"GUILTY,GUILTY,GUILTY!","review":"PARADISE LOST: The Child Murders at Robin Hood Hills.An intense trial drastically cut short for reasons of judical propaganda.a 4th person involved in the murdering of the three eight year old boys.....I have only 3 words GUILTY,GUILTY,GUILTY!But could there be an unknown 4th killer?

But I don't agree with those viewers and reviewers who express conviction that there was a gross miscarriage of justice; that the three boys found guilty of the murders are in fact innocent. To be sure, they may well be; \\"Paradise Lost\\" certainly offers one ample cause to have reasonable doubt. It's important to note, however, that the juries didn't render their verdicts based on the documentary, but on the evidence presented at the trials. While I'm inclined to believe that the boys aren't guilty, that inclination is based on the documentary. It's impossible to know with certainty what verdict I would have rendered had I been a juror at one of the trials. And the same is true of everyone who's expressed a definite judgment(usually in favor of innocence) after viewing the indisputably excellent \\"Paradise Lost\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Paradise Lost , Justice isn't found","review":"This 2 disc collection is the bizarre and disturbing tale of the Murders at Robin Hood Hills. Back in the early 90's three children were found brutally murdered aand this docuementary shows the trail of the accused killers. The true victims in this case may the rest in peace i feel still have not found justice. Disc one documents the trial of the West Memphis Three , the three teenagers accused of the murders. Disc two raises more questions odf their innocence.

After watching this first video on the case I was still not 100% certain that Jessie, Damien, and Jason did not commit these murders, but after seeing Part II and reading the book about the case \\"Devil's Knot\\", I know for certain they did not do this. The info that was suprssed during the trial was sinful.Read the book to get a full outlook!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well done unbiased documentary","review":"I saw this documentary on HBO's America Undercover when it first aired. It is a fascinating look at how easy it is for people to hate without gathering enough information to develop an informed opinion. The filmmakers do not choose a side, and I was able to form an opinion without feeling manipulated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haunting","review":"This documentary is brilliantly made - no commentary, just footage of the incidents, interviews with the people involved in them, all of which speak for themselves. But it's a haunting message they tell - a haunting, horrific murder and some haunting questions about the justice system's response. The film does not pretend to give answers - it doesn't preach, it just asks questions. Those questions continue to reel inside me, long after viewing - the guilt or innocence of the young men charged with the crimes, the guilt or innocence of others and, perhaps for me the most disturbing question of all: will we ever know for sure just what happened? Like pretty well everything that HBO is involved in, I found this to be really top-shelf documentary production."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXTREME MISCARRIAGE OF JUSTICE","review":"This film shows the worst part of our justice system. It shows how someone (any one of us) could be accused of a crime and convicted of it without any evidence at all. It also shows how small towns can make their own version of the law by their ignorance. Watch the movie and decide who you think did it! The evidence is there. But, not for the boys in jail for it. A judge who has never heard of bite mark evidence shouldn't be allowed to continue hearing a death penalty case. Why isn't the stepfather under a microscope? This is the worst case of injustice I have ever seen.After viewing this, decide for yourself if we shouldn't let the Federal Goverment get involved in states issues. Someone needs to stop the Arkansas ignorance that is keeping these boys in jail. One of these boys will die if we don't get involved."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST SEE","review":"THIS IS INJUSTICE AT ITS FINEST. PLENTY OF REDNECK AND TRAILER TRASH CULTURE.

I just read a news article today that Natalie Maines - singer of the Dixie Chicks - just won the law suit taken against her by Terry Hobbs. He was the stepfather of one of the boys murdered and was suing her for defamation. Anyway, reading the article brought it all back to me. This story will haunt you for years to come and I am not referring to the gruesome details of the crime. Not only do you feel helpless and lost and heartbroken for the little boys that lost their lives, but you feel helpless and ANGRY watching the travesty that resulted in 3 young men falsely (I believe) convicted of these brutal crimes. Watch the films. Formulate your own opinion. Powerful story."},{"rating":"2","title":"They did it.","review":"The video was a pretty good documentary. They failed to mention several things, such as the necklace of Damien that had blood stains from 2 of the murdered boys on it. Also, the two walking sticks that the boys were seen with previously were left at the crime scene. I know that it makes a better story to paint these kids as innocents who were convicted for liking Metallica, but that is not the case. The video neglects a good bit of the more incriminating evidence.

I was absolutely appalled and disgusted. I don't know how they received permission to use these pictures/footage. Even with permission - they should have had empathy and common sense and at the very least blurred out the images. But, apparently, they were only interested in shock value in order to bolster this so-called documentary. How do you think the victims' families felt seeing these disturbing, graphic images of their tortured/mutilated/humiliated/murdered children?

It comes with a plastic cover that slides over the jewel case and a booklet with couple of pages of notes on the film and also includes some artwork from the theatrical posters.The last 2 tracks are bonus tracks of lesser quality, the first is 11 minutes of various rehersals with the orchestra which includes musian chatter, laughter, discussion on how to play, etc. The second bonus track is an unmixed finale track.A great price for a nice, hard to find score and a must for Steiner fans!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"best soccer cleats i have ever had :)","review":"i got these cleats about 5 years ago! they have lasted me about 5 seasons of spring, fall, and summer. they are just now starting to rip, i love these cleats they are so amazing that i have been looking for days for these cleats just to get the same pair!"},{"rating":"1","title":"THERE IS NO WAY TO CONTACT THE SELLER","review":"I am completly dissatisfied with this pourchase.

It is not as another review states, tracks preceded by a bit of introductory dialogue. All the delicious underscoring leading into the wondrous musical numbers that I heard faintly in the movie I now can also here FAINTLY in this Cd. As with other 'lifted' soundtracks on the market the sound suffers from being so removed from the original source elements. The result is crackly, muffles music that dare not be played too loud. This was disappointing as Membran is usually top notch with their soundtrack offerings. I don't like to leave negative reviews, but sometimes more complete product info is helpful, as I would certainly not have bought this if I had known. My advice is to get the movie instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Doing the impossible - on a shoestring budget and no facilites = Ingenuity at it's best","review":"A small team of men with a minuscule budget takes on a task that large aircraft companies would have to spend hundreds of thousands of Dollars - maybe millions of Dollars to do properly.

This book focuses on the end of WWII and the disappointments which followed when French intellectuals and politicians failed to unite; when France's power diminished and when Communism's inability to solve the problems of mankind became obvious. Reading Simone provides insight into how the McCarthy era evolved and how the Cold War came about. Alhough its cast includes the philosophical and literary stars of the mid-20th century, this book is more than a gossipy treat: it is a road map to the understanding of how Europe and America dealt with mending the wounds of war and how the remainder of the century was shaped."},{"rating":"2","title":"DoubleBass also make melodies!","review":"This CD is the perfect example that the DoubleBass could be an extraordanary instrument for \\"soloing\\" with the orchestra.

The suspense carried out until the very end and as usual the author does a good job surprising the reader. Even though you may have your suspicions, you aren't quite sure until the reveal. Some of the characters really came off as bitter people and never did redeem themselves. That was a little unsettling, but other than that it was enjoyable.Mind what you read by some of the other reviewers. This is not a romantic suspense like some say. It is also not as much of a thriller as it is made out to be. It is a straight out suspenseful mystery.

I do, however, try to read a variety of works from various genres to stay well rounded. This book was a real disappointment to me personally. I found the whole thing fanciful and unbelievable. From the dog that should have been cast for a Lassie remake (What Lassie? Uncle Frank has fallen down an old mineshaft and we need approximately fifteen feet of rope to free him. Is that what you are trying to tell us, boy?) to the little girl who sounds way too much like an adult trying to imitate a small child and failing miserably, I found the book difficult to believe.I would only recommend this book (I have not read anything else by Carlene Thompson) if you have the ability to put aside serious unrealistic elements and can enjoy a book only for the sum of its parts, not the parts themselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"DEFINITELY ONE OF THE BEST NOVELS OF 2000!","review":"I have read all of Carlene Thompson's novels and loved every one of them.

Mrs. Bennett was neither cold nor bullying of her brood of British daughters? The characters in Pride and Prejudice are likable unlike this horror. I was delighted to pick this up, but it turned out to be so disappointing.The sisters and their mother, \\"Doc\\". are so thinly drawn. The author labels each one and we never see beyond that. The mother was so exaggerated she could never garner any sympathy. The men from the father to the assorted husband/boyfriend/fiance types were also like paper dolls, nothing was there. I never cared about these people.If you want a book about marriage and sister, reread Jane Austen!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful read!!","review":"I read the excellent review of \\"This Side of Married\\" in the Boston Globe and bought the book immediately.

Anyone who likes americana music in the vein of Lucinda Williams, Roseanne Cash, Allison Krause, Shelby Lynne, or Shawn Colvin should seek this album and performer out - yet she is not exactly like any one of these more well known artists. Less gritty than Lucinda, but the album does feature some tastefully dirty electric guitar. Not as folk-pop as Colvin. Sally's songs convey their Appalachian roots, but she isn't as bluegrass as Allison Krause. More Asheville than Nashville. In short, she's a singular creative voice playing with consistent quality and authenticity. Check her out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Post-Thunder Chord, but really getting close to what will be Tear of the Moon","review":"If you've read any of my other CO reviews then you know I hold that is isThunder Chordwhere CO really found their sound.

The book is more of a dictionary of alchemists or those that prolonged the study of alchemy in the face of modern science. Grimoire was not even included as an entry. Waite's extensive textually critical analysis of extant books debunching the more ficticious publications of his time did not even get a footnote in this dictionary. The famous Alchemist's Gate that spurred generations of 'research' missed the publication deadline. The elements were tapered to those earlier than Plato BC period and excluded Plato's aether (not that Plato was the ultimate encourager of free thinking, he sabatoged the advancement of mathematics for generations with the geometry only edict). A full page is devoted to Jung with his psychobabble that totally ignored the fact that contrary to Jungian presuppositions and extant evidence alchemists of the past did perform and document their non-metephysical experiments."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dense and opaque, but with some interesting parts.","review":"I gather from reading this book that the author has developed and previously published some theoretical or psychological model for analyzing religions. In this volume, he applies his analytical approach to the question of whether Freemasonry is a religion, which seems appropriate enough given Freemasonry's ritual and esoteric content. His explanation of his model and its jargon is even more impenetrable than the jargon itself. His discussion of his results suffers accordingly. The book becomes a bit more worthwhile in discussing why men join the fraternity (at least in England where his research was done), why they stay, who they are, what they get out of it, and what they do behind those closed doors. His unsurprising conclusion, as near as I can tell, is the same answer you would get by asking any random Freemason whether the fraternity was a religion.(This book was originally published in hardcover under the title \\"Who's Afraid of Freemasons?\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE!!!!!","review":"Without doubt this is the worst book I have ever read on any subject. It actually hurt to read the entire thing. I've been a Freemason for 17 years and I've never read anything so confusing and nonsensical in my Masonic life. The author's title makes the reader believe that perhaps the author will be attempting to answer the title question, but in fact, that question is never even addressed. So much time is spent trying to explain the author's theory on religion and make the author look good, that no space is left for the him to address his title question, and thus the work suffers greatly. The editor of this books should lose his job it is so poorly done, and Mr. Piatigorsky should be reevaluated in his professorship. I was sorely disappointed with this book and wouldn't recommend it to anyone. In fact, I would recommend people avoid it as though it had the Plague."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are better books on the subject","review":"Judging by the title I thought this was going to be a book trying to debunk the conspiratorial viewpoint many have about Freemasonry. Its actually a mix of mainstream Masonic history and blue lodge level Masonic \\"secret\\" rituals, symbology and oaths with the authors spin and opinions on them. Overall most of this book is boring but you get some decent history and some of their so called \\"secrets\\" but there is nothing in this that hasn't been presented better in other books."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent philosophical enquiry into a religious phenomenon","review":"This book deals with Freemasonry as a phenomenon, which is to say it concerns itself with freemasonry's role as an object of conciousness, as the starting point for an enquiry into not whether it is a religion or not, but into how popular/public (including freemasons')conceptions of freemasonry and by extension 'religion' may be formed. The author's findings suggest that any thinking on religion acquires, or rather is analogous to, religiousness itself, in so far as 'religiousness' as an idea, as an object of conciousness, that is as a 'concept', has, by its very conceivability, acquired an ontological status already equivalent to the initial 'epistemological' premise."},{"rating":"2","title":"great varied workout for the out-of-shape to intermediate exercisers","review":"I just did this workout for the first time and had to write how pleased i am with it.

This dvd really has it all... the toning is excellent, I use 8 lb weights for the upper body segments, and I can really feel the burn.

Her autobiographical account - she was only in her early twenties and married to a member of Chiang Kaishek's coterie - combines the personal with excellent explanations of chinese history, although it does help to have an atlas to hand as you read it.First published in 1968, the book begs the question how far she felt able to express her true feelings, at the time of the Cultural Revolution, but politically, the novel leans to sympathy with Mao's Red Army during the civil war.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product","review":"I purchased this product after reading that red marine algae can help to \\"cure\\" coldsores.

I have just discovered the Dragonlance books and will definitely read the others. It's different, the things that struck me the most were the bits of humor tossed in there that seemed out of place and didn't quite fit the fantasy theme; another thing was how commonplace Weis made the gods seem, they weren't very 'godlike' at all.

The character development was very interesting, I found it to be well done, especially the interaction between Mina and Chemosh. The story was very engaging as well, it's darker than the rest of the Dragonlance books that I've read lately, and although once again evil gods are trying to take over Krynn, at least this time the enemy seems far more creepy than the usual. I mean come on, living breathing corpses who still believe that they are alive, and who go around seducing new victims on a nightly basis, this could lead to some very interesting scenarios. The only part that I found to be a little less than satisfactory was the way the book ended, there was kind of a twist, but it was not an extremely strong way to end the first book of a new series. I very much look forward to reading the next one as soon as it comes out though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Dragonlance gem","review":"Margret Weis tackle a character that last appeared in the War of Souls trilogy, that character being Mina.

This has been one of the best books I have read in a long time. What makes it even better is that the words are coming from a man who is not afraid to talk about his feelings. I mean it had its suspense that made you want to know what is going to happen next, but what was most important to me was the way he allowed you into his soul. He wanted you to feel what he was feeling so that you could understand why it was such a struggle for him and the impact it made on his life. He didn't make himself out to be a hero because he hated what he had to do to his family and friends and the price he paid to do it. This is a book that speaks volumes on integrity. Great book and everyone should read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Reading","review":"I truly enjoyed this book.

Jet Li gives a brilliant performance. The photography is beautiful. However, do not watch the dubbed version. Watch the original and read the English subtitles. The dubbing has to be some of the worst. It sounds exactly like a 1970's low class English dubbing of a cheap Hong Kong kung fu movie. Same cheap, unexpressive English accents definitely not synchronized to the actors. Since this movie has been getting great reviews, you have to wonder what whoever authorized the dubbing was thinking.I heard also that the distributor cut out 1/2 hour.

For a Covers set: George's crazed autobiographical re-working of \`Bye bye Love'. \`Maya Love' and a quite abbreviated version of \`It is He...' could go onto a bonus set. \`Dark Horse', the song, is very good, but it's the non-hoarse version from George's 1991 Japan tour that makes it a Beatlesworthy pick."},{"rating":"1","title":"C'mon, get real - this is a bad album.","review":"If this album wasn't by an ex-Beatle it would have quickly been relegated to the dust bin. There are exactly three songs on this that are tolerable - Hari's On Tour(no vocal!-good) - Simply Shady, and Dark Horse. The cover of Bye Bye Love is one of the most pathetic covers I have ever heard. Maya Love is boring, and Ding Dong is just about as dumb as the song title implies. A real misfire for Geroge on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bringing Down The Horse","review":"Dark Horse was a quickly put together release to coincide with George Harrison's 1974 world tour. The album has a the feeling rushed and couple it with the fact that Mr. Harrison's voice was more or less shot. He smartly opens up with a solid instrumental \\"Hari's On Tour (Express)\\" which is a sprightly number but songs like an awful version of \\"Bye, Bye Love\\", \\"Maya Love\\", \\"So Sad\\" and \\"Is It He\\" are just not that great. Despite the overall weakness of the album a couple of songs stand out including the sublime title track and \\"Ding Dong, Ding Dong\\" which is a great holiday song. The album was yet another top ten effort, but it failed to spawn any top ten singles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark Hoarse","review":"this actually has pretty good songs marred only that George recorded some with a sore throat. i wish he'd have waited 6 months after his throat healed & his 1974 tour. then this would be one of his classics.at the time, George said its only a rock & roll lp, so he used his injured voice but many years later and for all generations, we are stuck with a flawed recording.such were the times & short sightedness of all involved then."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Dark Hoarse\\"","review":"George Harrison's 1974 rush-release suffers from his obvious laryngitis - surely he could have waited until a full recovery. Not surprisingly, the best track on \\"Dark Horse\\" is the opening instrumental, \\"Hari's on Tour.\\" Despite the impeccable musicianship, George's shredded voice ruins everything from the title song to an unnecessary remake of \\"Bye Bye Love.\\" The world's finest digital remastering cannot salvage Harrison's weakest album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great one from George.","review":"This is a fabulous album, even though it was critically panned when it first came out. Sure, it's not \\"All Things Must Pass\\" or \\"Taxman\\", but then, if you were expecting that from George, you missed the message in this album's title track! Great songs on here, especially \\"Simply Shady\\", \\"So Sad\\", and his post-Pattie venting in his cover of \\"Bye Bye Love\\". It took me awhile at first to appreciate it, simply because I was more accustomed to earlier George works, but I'm so glad that I purchased this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Last good effort before falling into a prolonged slump.","review":"This is a good, not great, effort by George. True his voice was a bit strained for these sessions following an extensive North American tour. Still, with the exception of It Is He and Far East Man it is a collection of strong songs with able musicianship and production.

I am sad that he is no longer with us. However Dark Horse is still not a very good record and no matter how much I love some of Harrison's other records, Dark Horse still is not a very good album. The songs Dark Horse and Hari's On Tour are very good. The totally over looked Ding Dong, Ding Dong which cracked the top 40 as a single is a catchy song. The remainder of Dark Horse unfortunately is very forgettable. Harrison's voice is in bad shape throughout the album and the production here also is not very strong. Most of the songs here are also not very well written. If you are looking for good Harrison records to buy, start with All Things Must Pass, Cloud Nine, and Living In the Material World. All of the above mentioned are wonderful to listen to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Harrison finally hits middle of the road","review":"This is a sore dissappointing follow up to the previous \\"Living In the Material World\\", which showcased some stunning moments.Sadly, that charm is lacking here. Harrison recorded this shortly after his widespread tour in 1974. It's not like he had to issue any product at all, since \\"Dark Horse\\" was originally released on his own Apple label.The album has a few moments, most notably with \\"So Sad\\" and an unusual version of the Everly Brothers \\"Bye Bye Love\\".To make matters worse, the two singles that were culled from the album were not the best tracks on it, so, I guess that says something about the remaining material.Knowing \\"Dark Horse\\" was not that popular upon its initial release, it's easy to see why the CD issue has been very difficult up until this time to obtain.At best, it's STILL George Harrison, and it's STILL good.

I am an ethnic Tajik, and a professional translator, and this book was very poorly done. As another Tajik reader said, this book is full of misspellings, and words that are just completely wrong. Also, many of the words that are given do not reflect the Tajik dialect of Persian. Even the introduction (in English) is factually incorrect, because Tajik is not a separate language, it is a dialect of Persian/Farsi, that, during Soviet times, was written in Cyrillic. A Tajik who speaks English should have assisted in this project, in order to have a more satisfactory outcome."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the few resources available for the Tajik language","review":"This is a very useful little book, which includes a short introduction to Tajik grammar and pronunciation, a short dictionary, words and phrases categorized by subject, and even a few proverbs. The entire book uses a romanized alphabet for Tajik and does not include even a table showing the Cyrillic alphabet for Tajik, which is unfortunately, since many Tajik texts are currently available only in Cyrillic, but this book should be useful for people visiting Tajikistan or who would like to communicate with Tajiks."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible","review":"Absolutely useless.

The nutrition in this grain combo is phenomenal and the taste is fabulous. I buy the 4 jar package and it comes out cheaper than if I could actually talk my grocer into carrying it. The flavors complement a gumbo, spanish rice, a bacon/ham and pecan casserole, or anything with a stronger flavor even oriental and indian dishes. For milder dishes like Indian Butter Chicken, you might like your regular white, basmati, or jasmine rices, although I generally use these whole grains for almost everything. Jars were package very well, packed for shipping very well, and shipped promptly. Rice lovers will love this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"You'll never go back to white rice","review":"A huge difference in flavor and texture versus the plain supermarket brands.

Those are all good songs and 70's Brit-punk is my favorite music, so I picked this up.Anyway, I'm glad I got this. The music's great, especially the first disc (minus the 1988 songs at the end).My only question is, what do they mean by calling this \\"the complete collection\\"? The third and last CD is all live tracks, many of which I don't recall hearing on the first two CD's. A few are covers, I do realize, but most of the 3rd disc songs say they were written BY Sham 69. So, I'm thinking they were published as studio versions before they were recorded from live shows. So, where ARE those studio recordings? Is this really a \\"complete collection\\".

Also, since it is IR and not \\"wireless\\" (like the controllers\\") you do not have to sync it to your Xbox.

Just as irritating was having to activate the game controller to use it... And the lack of a volume control... And explaining to guests how to use it... Ugh.The xbox remote solves all of those issues and viewing movies on the system is sooooooo much better now.

I thought it would be more like the controllers and it didn't matter where you pointed them or where your xbox is located. This has to be pointed directly at the xbox and i mean it has to be aimed right at the xbox sensor and you cant be too far away. If your xbox is behind your tv like mine was then you will have to move it for this to be useful. Plus the remote only works for your tv and is very limited in what it does for that. Everything it does for the xbox is good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Handy 360 remote","review":"This remote has made using our XBox 360 as a DVD player as well as a gaming console much easier. Using the controller while watching a movie would cause problems if it was bumped while still on (fast forwarding or rewinding a chapter), or if it had shut off when we needed to pause. This remote is as easy to use as any other DVD remote.The only downside I had with it was getting it to operate the tv as well. Microsoft's instructions left a lot to be desired, and when I went to their website to get the code to use with our tv, I stumbled on the page accidently. There was no direct link to the codes, and even when I used the search engine it didn't take me there directly.As is usual with anything from Microsoft, the directions aren't very helpful, but once you figure out how to use it, this remote is very useful if you are going to use your 360 as a DVD player on a regular basis."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it but it has some flaws","review":"This remote is a must buy if you use your 360 for video viewing whether it be dvd or File shared. For me the greatest part is the input button (My tv makes it difficult for me to change from cable to AV input) The only flaws this has is that its not an Universal remote. It cant control your Cable box or VCR and no indicator of any kind to tell you whether or not its set to control your TV or 360, which has been standard with Remotes that control more than one device for years."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best low-cost remote for the 360.","review":"If you use the media center extender on your 360 this remote is a must have for only $20. Yes all the functions this remote provide can be accessed via the 360 controllers but this remote makes it so much easier and doesn't go to sleep like the controllers do. I especially like being able to launch media center directly after the profile is signed in, no waiting then navigating through the 360 blade menus to find MCE.The only con is that this isn't a universal and is \\"just one more remote\\" to add to your collection. Very pleased with my purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware: IR--not RF--remote","review":"Unlike all of the Xbox remotes, this does not use RF (radio) to connect to the console.

Unfortunately this changes my plans for how to lay out the room."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Universal remote","review":"This remote works fine to control an XBox;however, it will not control a new Vizio TV. I tried both specific codes provided by Vizio as well as the \\"try everything\\" option on the remote.

It has buttons that can control your Xbox dashboard and while I haven't yet linked my console with my PC, there is a button to access your Windows Media Center right on the remote. This remote is hardly universal however, it will only control your Xbox 360 and your TV. If you have any other components such as a VCR or a seperate DVD player, it will not control these. Also, as another reviewer mentioned, there seems to be no input button to switch from watching TV to gaming. I even called Xbox technical support to see if I was missing something, and apparently there just isn't a button for that. This means that I would still have to keep several other remotes around just to have all the functions I need. Overall, a nice looking remote, but falls short.

Plus if you look at the back under the light you'll see some minor marks/scratches.Maybe a 90 day warranty really is no big deal. Maybe some marks don't matter either.It would be honest however, to properly sell this as refurbished so you can decide if $10 plus $3 shipping for these used units is a good deal next to the brand new $19.99 models.I figured the price was too good to be true and it was - I'll probably keep it but the seller is simply dishonest by not mentioning this on Amazon.Be aware of this before you buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works fine with my HDTV; not so good with XBox","review":"This remote works fine with my HDTV but doesn't seem to work well with the XBox.

I rinsed the button membrane and cleaned the board with alcohol, put back together, and the remote functions like new. However, the years of use has rubbed the ink off the buttons... so... it's sometimesd very difficult to know(remember) what buttons are what!

First, you have to have extremely long bra straps.

I tried again on a stretchy strap bra and same thing. They just don't work. I was really hoping that this would stop my bra straps from sliding off my shoulders & give me the ability to wear more of the T back tshirts but this product definitely won't help me with that. (Had I really thought about it before I bought it, my bra straps would have had to be at least the distance from strap to the middle of my back in extra length for these things to work.

Then I realized I was putting it on wrong, so I tried it exactly as shown and described on the packaging and I never could figure out how to make it work, as it kept falling off.

The band opted to put in a slightly slower version of beautiful night which takes away some of the power the CD offers to fans IMO (esp for me a big toadies fan).For Toadies fans this CD will definately be worth the 10 bucks.

And it is a beautiful thing. 10 out of the 11 tracks I love. The odd one out is growing on me.\\"You're so God damn beautiful\\" makes you want to sing aloud every time. \\"Shadow\\" is a beautiful new song. \\"Do for me\\" is still my favorite.I have one problem with the album: It should be one or two tracks longer (Did I hear \\"Dirty Sanchez!\\"). This is a band to watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Lord, this is bad.","review":"I certainly realize that different people have different tastes, but this CD is really, really bad.

Changing the pace from a dance song to a pop song was a bad idea, because as a pop song this isn't even credible. In the past, they have had other artists provide outstanding remixes for the tracks, but Alice Deejay's remix is simply the instrumental of \\"Back In My Life\\" with a few notes changed.I guess they are lowering the age of their target market, because this is far from the days of \\"Better World\\", and \\"Overwhelm Yourself\\".

There's almost no beat to it, it's terribly slow and seeing the lead singer Kim singing something like this now almost makes me cry.

Sometimes you just know, the instant you see someone for the first time.The second story, about Misty and Morgan, was touching. I felt for Misty, with her problems in the past and not really knowing how to deal with them.

Grade: A+"},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst","review":"This is definitly the worst in the entire Bond series. This is only a remake of Thunderball and they did a [bad] job of it. It didn't even have that circle at the very beginning when 007 turns around and shoots and then blood comes down (you have to know what I mean if you've seen another 007 flick other than this one). Plus they didn't have a scene before the theme song. Thunderball is much better. The acting I suppose is OK, and some of the action was enjoyable. Those are the only reasons I gave it an extra star. But this doesen't even belong in the 007 series. Don't buy this.

But by the time this movie was made, the formula which made him such was lost, and only recently has Pierce even come close. The movie follows the same basic formula as some of Moore's cheesiest bond titles (aka View to a Kill), using high tech gadgets and special effects to make up for a lack of panache and storyline. As has been said before, aim for Thunderball... the story is similar, but the classic bond flair and style are there. In truth there is no comparision"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I am normally a fan of James Bond movies but \\"Never Say Never Again\\" is terrible. While it is apparently supposed to be a remake of Thunderball, it ends up being something less than a cheap copy.

My recommendation is to keep this movie out of your bond DVD library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Bond Film ever","review":"While watching this film I was disgusted, not only was it a blatent rip-off of Thunderball, but they tried to be funny in this movie, which in my opinion they completely failed, if you are thinking about buying this movie, I would rent it first. This movie may appeal to some, but thank God I saw it on TV, because if I would have bought this movie I would have been even sicker than I was after watching this travesty. You have me correct this movie made me sick, now all may not feel the same as I, but if you are thinking about buying this movie, and you haven't seen it yet. I would suggest renting, though if you really like the movie, or you are a completest, Bond fan, well then go for it.

In my opinion, it is the worst James Bond movie ever made. It is a remake of an earlier Sean Connery movie, Thunderball, which is a far, far superior 007 movie. This movie has an overall bland feeling to it because no one really seemed to care when making it. Connery was great as James Bond in the 1960s, but in this movie, he is much too old for the part. And since the movie was not made by MGM/UA, you don't get the usual actors portraying Q or M. I really don't think I'll watch this movie again.

The master copy must be somewhat lousy, or the technician was an amateur. I swear I could have done a better job myself at creating the conversion.

The film is silly at best and sacreligious at worst (their version of Desmond Llewelyn's immortal Q makes me want to cry or vomit, or both).

The scene in between is missing. That scene is where Bond surprises Domino. She had previously seen him at the health spa where he gave her a rub down, she thinking he was a member of the staff.

It is by far the worst of all of the 007 movies made. The story is of course not original, it is a remake of the fantastic \\"Thunderball\\" movie, so there is nothing unique or intriguing about it. The quality of the movie is awful, in large part because there was no budget. Sean's $1 Million dollar (1st of it's time) contract used up alot of the movie budget. The special effects were hoakie, there was no chemistry between Kim Bassinger and Sean (She called him old in a Playboy interview, not a good start), the music was not memorable, and Sean's toupe was hiddeous.

The acting (including Connery) is sub-par, and the action leaves something to be desired. However, the main problem is that this is a cheap knock-off James Bond movie. A remake of \\"Thunderball,\\" the fourth film installment, \\"Never Say Never Again\\" is not released through United Artists, and was not produced by Albert Broccoli or his company, EON Productions. A true Bond fan knows this, and any interested party will notice the absence of 007 trademarks such as the gun-barrel opening and the truly artistic title sequence. In fact, \\"Never Say Never Again\\" was released as competition for \\"Octopussy,\\" the 13th 007 flick, in 1983. So, plain and simple, if you want a good version of the story, buy the orgional \\"Thunderball.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"DOWN WITH REMAKES!","review":"I've never been a big fan of remakes. It seems to be particularly annoying with this one, since the main actor was also the one who starred in the original. This would seem to make re-hashing this movie a pointless endeavour.

I find it hard to believe that so many other reviewers have said this is a good movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN","review":"Bond, not at his best. There are a few scenes worth watching, but overall it is a bit boring. It was nice to see Connery in the role that he made famous however the villan was dull,the musical score was awful, and the gadgets lame. Also the DVD version is missing about 15 minutes of the movie (when Bond enters the casino and subdues the doorman it skips right to the video game scene and deletes the entire first meeting between Bond and Largo). Stick with the Broccoli/Saltzman Bond for first rate action and adventure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Connery is Bond","review":"Sean Connery is the king of Bonds. It is a shame that we Connery and James Bond fans can not have this video for our collection. This is one of my favorite Bond films.

I have every James Bond movie on video except this one and can't believe Never Say Never Again is no longer availabe. Let's hope it is available again soon.

Here's a list what's different from Thunderball...THUNDERBALL Locations: 75% Nassau, 2% Bahamas, 3% France, & 20% of the South of England.NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN Locations: 10% Nassau, 2% Bahamas, 3% MI6 Training Area, 15% Africa.THUNDERBALL Villian: Age - 50 (Eyepatch)NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN: Age - 35 (Both Eyes)THUNDERBALL: ***1/2NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN: BOMB (thank god this wasn't an official bond)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Um...","review":"I have no idea why they even spent the money to shoot this film. Sean Connery is a great actor, but he was too old for this role. It's a forgettable remake of Thunderball (which was a good movie) that had me falling asleep. James Bond doesn't have grey hair. The older Sean Connery movies were the best, but you should pass this one up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should not have been made","review":"I got depressed while watching this picture because I missed the quality of the previous Bonds which were made by producer Cubby Broccoli and EON productions. Missing are a teaser in the beginning and afterwards a catchy tune sung by a big name singer while the credits role. There are no clever quips said by Bond. The scenery is boring. The only good thing I can say about this picture is the first rate cast - Sean Connery, Max Von Sydow, Klaus Maria Brandauer, and for the girls, Kim Basinger and Barbara Carrera - who played an excellent villainess and deserved better. It would have been interesting to see all those actors in an EON production."},{"rating":"2","title":"007 Movie Review","review":"I purchased this movie to add to my collection of James Bond Movies. I know this is not one of the offical James Bond Movies, from the UA franchise but it does star Sean Connrey so I wanted to add it to my collection. A bit more cheesy considering his past 007 movies, but I enjoyed it just the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as bad as You Only Live Twice, but thats not saying much","review":"This movie (a Warner bros picture and not officially a part of the James Bond series) is a turkey! My god, can Connery get much older looking? The simple fact that this is a remake of Thunderball is enough reason to stay away. It's better than You Only Live Twice, but thats not saying much. The video game sequence for world domination is incredibly stupid. Connery should have stayed retired, stayed out of the Arcades and out of Octopussy's wake(a hit Bond film released the same year). STAY AWAY FROM THIS ONE... you've been warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally Unsatisfactory","review":"Never Say Never AgainThis product was shipped from Belgium.

The Blu-ray version is better as you would expect, but as much as you want to shine this turd -it's still a turd.If you haven't seen Dr. No, Goldfinger, Thunderball, and the BEST Bond - From Russia with love- (even if you have) see them or see them again.

The production values are poor, the lighting looks like a TV soap opera, Sean Connery phones in a flat performance, Barbara Carrera is laughable, the story jumps around, barely hanging together. I give Kim Basinger credit for delivering a fairly dignified performance in the midst of disaster; Edward Fox, who is capable of a good dramatic performance, and whom I typically like, plays M as a clown.I'm content to own a copy, because it was the only Bond I didn't already have, but I don't know whether I'll ever bother to watch it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"bland!","review":"To begin, I'd like to state I love Connery's 007 in the 60's.But the 80's weren't good to him. He really looks out of shape in this film. I'll take Moore 'Octopussy' anyday over this. The DVD I watched INCLUDES the deleted scene everyone's been stinkin' about in these reviews. On the positive side, I quite enjoyed seeing the CENTIPIDE arcade machine in its original form. Yes, I'm an 80's geek!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Superspy Supertoupe","review":"Bond meets old age, Sean Connery deserves an award for the Worst hairpiece in cinema history, really, I think he has a dead chiwawa on his head. This film was released to try and rival the then sitting Bond Roger Moore and it lost dismally. Never a serious rival to Moore, Connery sends himself up in rather unnecessary style, rather reminiscant of Roger Moore in the Cannonball Run. This by the way is a remake of THUNDERBALL, the only Bond script Kevin McCleary owns the rights to. And wait for it there are plans to remake this. Again with Sean Connery, assumedly now in a nursing home, Bond fans everywhere unite...DONT DO IT KEVIN!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry James","review":"Say Never Again Sean Connery on making a Bond movie without the right directors. It was most crappy Bond movie I ever seen. And I love Sean Connery as James Bond . 'Never Say Never Again ', is 2 thumbs down . Sorry Sir James."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Remake","review":"Sean Connery still has its charm, but he seems more like the aging high school football hero who has to live in the memory of his past glory. This film is a remake of the 1965 Bond film Thunderball. The original movie was much better in every way. The music in this film is very poor, the acting is mediocre and quite honestly the movie is way too long and dull. The changes made in the script don't help it, but rather hurt it. It is worth a passing glance if only to make you appreciate his other Bond films."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry to say this about a Bond Movie","review":"I never thought i would say this but i am sorry to have seen this particular movie made. Whilst Sean Connery turns in a good performance the rest of the cast and indeed the plot leaves something to be desired in their performance and indeed their standard and it is well apparant that the usual Bond Team was not involved in the production of this movie. If your a Bond fan then maybe give it a look - otherwise give it a miss."},{"rating":"1","title":"should have stopped while ahead","review":"sean connery is indeed a great james bond, but he should have stopped while he was seen that way. I am a the biggest james bond fan, and i even had to stop watching it mid movie. It was making 007 look stupid. he made the movie stupid.

I RECOMMEND NOT GETTING THE MOVIE."},{"rating":"2","title":"No extras, but Sean makes up for it...","review":"This DVD release is unusual in that it has no \\"extras\\" other than a Theatrical Trailer, but that's OK, because Sean Connery is back as Bond. Though not an \\"Official\\" Bond movie, and doesn't have the familar James Bond \\"Music\\", this movie is just fun entertainment. Connery looks better than Roger Moore did at this stage, and can still deliver the lines...Fatima Blush: \\"How clumsy of me, I've made you all wet.\\"Bond: \\"Yes, but my Martini is still dry...\\"The print is good, and the sound quality is good for it's age.

This is the only James Bond movie that i do not own and would love to see it rereleased to give the people that dont own it a chance to bye it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Sloppily Produced Disc","review":"Never Say Never Again is not one of the worst Bond films, but its simply mediocre and of the standard of all the Bond movies produced after their glory days of the 60 and 70's. However the worst aspect of the DVD version is not the film itself but the lack of quality control that went into making this DVD edition. Unexcusable is the fact that the makers of this DVD couldn't even bother to include the entire film on this disc! There is at least one large missing scene (i.e., just before the 'domination game' section of the film in the casino) and there may be others. Given this and the lack of any extras (save a trailer) makes this a disc to avoid. My advice to fans is to pass up on this edition and wait for a more definitive version in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Doesn't take itself too seriously.","review":"...which is much more than I can say about the vast majority of the Brosnan Bonds -- which is unfortunate as Pierce had such a great sense of humor in Remington Steele. Never Say Never again does not have any of the trappings of the Ken Adam/John Barry masterpieces, but if you just accept it for what it is, and follow Connery's lead, it's pretty fun!And there are some fabulous things in the film. Klaus Maria Brandauer gives one of the best performances ever as a Bond villain, and his torture-laden video game is brilliant. Some of the location work is excellent, as is the final set. Barabara Carrerra and Bond have a fabulous last scene together. Wrap it all up in a mega-camp theme song and Connery winking at the camera... you just gotta roll with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Neither a comedy nor an action","review":"The film was far below expectations. Connery was too old and compare to his natural Bond movies he was a pale old Bond who wasn't in style at all. Largo's character was also a wrong choice- the actor was too mild and comic for Largo, especially ugly was a scene where Bond and Largo played a computer-game: instead of showing \\"serious\\" Bond making high bets on casino , the scene seemed to be made for kids who enjoy computers. I even don't understand if the film was a plage, comedy or did the producers really want to produce a cheap action where just a name Bond sells high profits. Rowan \\"Bean\\" Atkinson didn't also fit to his part. Finally, the good thing is that the movie I call Connery's worst is not officially listed as a Bond movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gospel #1's","review":"They dvd is all the words that could be said.

To be able to put rap and R&B together as they did, as if they were two from the same genre, is incredible. I do believe it could be a little less vulger or sexual. However, the artwork is definitely high quality, and the production is appropriate for what they were trying to do...But Jigga is flowing on that thing. Taking his lyrics to another level. I dig it..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed...","review":"...First of all the beats are just booty. Yep you got it right, they [stink]. Big Time. This is unusual because Jay-Z usually doesn't rock over just a straight unlistenable beat; but sad to say that they have maybe two decent beats on the whole album. This is bad.Second of all they have basically one producer team ; Trackmasters...yep the same ones who brought you the excellent Fiesta RMX. But they produce garbage tracks on this album and to make it even worse each track sounds alike...The rapping on the other hand is vintage Jay-Z. Nice rhymes here & there but can get boring at times. R. Kelly's singing is pretty tight throughout as well even though he uses about the same flow on the whole cd. Devin The Dude breathes some life into the album on [P***Y], the only gem on the album....I wouldn't recommend this to even the die hard fans of Jay-Z and R. Kelly.

Kelly's sex scandal prompted Def Jam and Jive (both labels for this album) to cease promotion for this album and take the artists' photos off of the album cover. Second, this album wasn't very good anyway. Neither artist was in the studio with each other while recording, Jay-Z spread himself thin over these tracks, R. Kelly didn't inspire with his half-singing, half-rapping style, and production by the Trackmasters made everything sound like the remix to \\"Fiesta\\". The only good songs on here were \\"P***y\\" (with Devin the Dude's verse added at the last minute) and \\"Honey\\" but R. Kelly's part on these tracks ruined everything.

I recommend this item."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Product At A Great Price","review":"First off, I want to talk about the misleading picture. If you basically remove everything inside the outer frame, that's what the newer version looks like. Having said that, I wouldn't be put off as it's still very strong and can more than cope with today's LCD TVs weighing around 50-60 pounds. Mounting is very easy and comes with a vast assortment of bolts and fixings to meet almost every design out there (providing they stick to Vesa guidelines). Overall, a great product, which does the same job similar mounts offer for at least twice the price, but I do want to dock one star though for the misleading picture and the fact it looked as though the box had already been opened.

Rudimentary installation is fairly easy. Fairly inexpensive.The bad:Poor instructions. Unable to tighten mounting brackets due to their proximity to the wall. Advertised for 50\\" displays, but the wall mounted sheet metal is so thin it 'barely' holds my 46\\" plasma. Wall screws need to be higher quality steel so the the recessed Phillips receptacle doesn't strip so easily (they are hex screws, so you can use a hex driver when you strip the Phillips).Overall:Once you get it into place, it stays put.

The most important part of the wall mount is locating and marking the 2 studs to be used. The instructions were adequate but I did need to ask their support person which bolts should be used for my TV since they have quite a few nuts & bolts to accomodate various TVs but they do not tell you which ones to use for your specific TV. I also took advantage of the tilt feature and it took two people to mount the Plasma on the mount.

They were either too big or too small. I called the company support desk, but the person with whom I spoke did not really sound as though he knew what he was talking about.

After that, the installation was flawless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not heavy-duty but it worked","review":"I wanted a Tilt Mount because I wanted to hang the 50\\" plasma up high and out of reach of little children.

It's not as heavy-duty as I wanted - the far edges bent away from the wall (not much but noticable) from the weight of the TV.

The product is packed in a compact box; Amazon adds a very large shipping carton that came in rather beaten up. The product was fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"No reason to spend more","review":"There is no reason to spend $200 plus for a wall mount that I can find! I mounted a 46\\" LCD and can tilt it down for optimal viewing with no problem. Good instructions and well packaged hardware.I ran into one potential problem that this mount helped solve. I mounted my LCD above a fireplace and it had to be centered with the mantle. Problem. The stud was exactly in the middle and the mounting plate will not span three studs. I mounted the plate about 4\\" off center to the left and was able to slide the TV to the right to center exactly. Something to think about if your positioning is critical like mine. I would absolutly buy again. The black is nice too for low visibality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great wall mount!!!","review":"This wall mount is well worth its value!

Excellent product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice wall mount, easy to use.","review":"I used the Peerless wall mount to mount my 40 inch Samsung LCD TV in my room. The instructions are clear and easy to read and they include a load of screws to fit pretty much any TV. Once I got it on the wall it felt very sturdy and took the weight of the TV with no problem. I mounted it high on the wall and gave it some tilt for a little bit of a theatre effect. The price was great since Future Shop in Canada was trying to sell me a similar mount for $312.00 .

I read countless reviews and chose this model. I really didn't see where the price was justified on the $250 models. It is a pretty simple setup, afterall. Mounting this was pretty easy. Usually I can't even hang pictures up straight, but I got this perfectly level without having to drill any extra holes. Once the bracket was secured to the wall and the t.v. was ready to hang, I got really nervous trying to put my investment up there. It actually went in pretty easily. You will probably need a long handled #1 phillips screwdriver to reach the bottom securing screws. The tilt feature is nice, but I only use it if I'm swapping out cables.This was an amazing deal!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"After installed, my panasonic plasma is dead","review":"1) The product came with missing part.

I have looked at other brands and didn't find them to be of the same construction and when you hang 1000 dollars or more on the wall you want to be sure it stays there. Really simple installation and plenty of hardware no running to home depot for screws or anchors. I now have used it at home for another tv and it is great.

The reason it is getting a low review by me is it should last for more than a year. Maybe I just got a bad battery, I will buy another one at some point though."},{"rating":"2","title":"does exactly what it says","review":"This is a great buy. I bought this because one of my controllers kept running out of battery. It charges the xbox 360 wireless controller while you are playing which is great because then you dont have to wait for it to charge. you can just play"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Alternative to Batteries","review":"I looked at a few different charging systems for the xbox360 controller. I was using up a pack of batteries every few weeks and it was getting expensive. I really like this charge and play system. It does the job of keeping my batteries charged. Although my system is set up far away from my couch, far enough away from my Xbox that I have to sit fairly close to actually charge. I need to have the box powered up to charge the controller so if you are trying to charge the controller wile you're not playing with the system, it can be sort of a pain. But overall I would recommend this product. It works great and doesn't cost as much as some of the alternatives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the convenience","review":"I have heard a lot of people complain about the necessity of this product, blah, blah, blah. I really like knowing that I don't have to stop my game to go find batteries or recharge a battery pack for 3 hours if my controller is dying, even if it means I have to be connected by a wire momentarily. Plus it came with a battery pack, making the price of the actual play and charge cord somewhere in the neighborhood of $3. Not too shabby, I think.I would put this as a 9 on a scale of 10 in the area of must have for long session gamers. My husband and I can easily spend several hours at a time playing a game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Use Your Computer","review":"While it's true that you have to have your Xbox turned on to charge the controller, you can also plug the kit into any computer with a USB port, and charge them that way"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great for about 5 months...","review":"I've had 3 of these official batteries and it seems like they don't last more than 4-5 months before they crap out... I don't even abuse them in any way, I'm a light gamer. The last battery I had lasted about 6 charges and I went the last month or so without going on my Xbox much. When I went to plug my play and charge kit back in the light would only stay red for a few seconds and then it would turn green like it was finished charging. When unplugged the controller will not start. Basically I have a wired controller now. I love when the thing actually worked but it seems to die way too quickly. Save your money and just get rechargeable AA batteries."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best way to charge and keep shooting!","review":"If you are an avid XBOX gamer you NEED this kit. The fact that I can drain a battery, plug this in, and continue to use the SAME battery is a huge plus for me. The only issue you might run into is if your cable doesn't happen to be close by when your battery dies in the middle of a COD multiplayer game. Things get a little intense at that point!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Uhh.... It's not supposed to be like this....","review":"I got my charge kit a couple days ago. Not only does it not charge if it's not plugged into the while it's on, but once I unplug it, it isn't charged.

I've burned through a million of them. This play and charge kit basically turns your controller into a wired controller within a couple months because the batteries don't last at all. Then the cable eventually breaks and you either have to take it apart and rewire it (the single one I did this to is the only one that I can reliably use), or dig around and find the AA battery pack you threw in a drawer somewhere.My suggestion would be to simply get the wired controller. You don't have to worry about power, the weight is better, and you'll never be distracted by the blinking lights when your controller has 49.99999% battery left."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have","review":"Lets see what is it and if you need it or not.....Basically what they give you is a 'batery pack' and a cable, what you do is use the batteries in your control and when u need to recharge just plug the cable in, the control will still the wireless and the cable will only charge the batery pack, since the charge is made from an USB connector, you can even plug the cable into a standard USB port in your computer and play in your xbox it will work :)But what happen if you already have plenty of these rechargable bateries ?Well use them, ok it is easier to just plug a cable, but it is wiser to don't spend money in something you don't really need if you have an alternative."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak battery, use USBCell instead","review":"My XBox rechargeable packs always seemed to run out of charge in a few hours when playing. Also, within 6 months to a year they would hold no charge at all, making them useless. The charging cord was a pain, too.I found USBCell rechargeable AA batteries that fit in the XBox controller AA battery pack. 2 USB AA batteries are cheaper than the Play and charge kit; you can play for days rather than hours before they run out of charge, and they don't wear out in 6 months. They charge in a few hours in any USB port. I would recommend the USBCells instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"MUST READ NOTE TO AVOID THE 360 FROM OVERHEATING!!!","review":"BUT MAKE SURE YOU KNOW WHEN IT IS PLUGGED IN! EVEN WHEN YOU TURN THE CONSOLE OFF, THE 360 CHARGES THE BATTERY PACK. IT WILL CONTINUE TO UNTIL YOU TURN ON AND OFF YOUR CONOLE WITH THE CHARGE KIT OUT. IF YOU DON'T, YOUR 360 WILL OVERHEAT FROM BEING ON SO LONG AND HAVING TO POWER YOUR BATTERY PACK.Now to the acutal review:The charge kit is great because there is no need to constantly replace batteries. The cord can be plugged into the xbox 360's USB port, and it has the length so that you can play it at the same time. No need for expendable batteries anymore! The battery in the controller can recharge totally off the Xbox 360."},{"rating":"1","title":"Faulty device","review":"There are day when i plug it in and it charges the battery and then there are days it just wont charge the batter"},{"rating":"1","title":"Play and Charge Kit CATCHES FIRE!!!","review":"after playing with the cord plugged in for less than 2 hours the battery began to overheat and then CATCH FIRE!!!

Needless to say, the internal electrical circuit overheated and started a fire which melted the plastic housing. Luckily it did not catch anything else on fire, but BUYER BEWARE... this could happen to you as well. I'm not so upset about the money I'm out (approx $20), but this is a serious safety hazard, as so many kids use this product for the same reasons we bought it... to save on batteries. I did report the incident to Microsoft as well as the consumer product safety commission. If there is some default in the production of these items, then maybe a recall is in order.

In about 3 or 4 months the problems came and the battery held no charge and no matter how long I left it plugged in it didn't matter.

I end up having to keep them plugged in almost constantly - only two controllers can be charged simultaneously, so if you're playing 4-player halo, chances are someody's battery pack is gonna go dead and be unable to charge at some point.You can buy a lot of AA's for ~$18, they're more reliable, and last tons longer.If you don't want to buy batteries, buy a wired controller; if you want wireless, buy a big pack of AA's at costco."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT idea","review":"This was one of the things that sold me on the 360. No more dealing with AA batteries. Another great thing is they last forever, I play daily and I rarely need to charge them. The best part is even if they die while you are playing you simply just connect the cable to the controller and 360 and you have a wired controller that is charging for future wireless use. Another great feature of this set up is if the controller is not finished charging when you are done playing the 360 can be shut down but it will continue to use a minimal amount of power to charge your controller. All you need is one of these kits and you can buy extra rechargable batteries for your remaining controllers separately. A great idea, and if Nintendo and Sony don't implement a system like this I think it will just be a big hassle. Another great idea from Microsoft."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overpriced and a Waste of Money","review":"Like all Xbox 360 accessories, the Play & Charge Kit is over priced.

Rather than buying this, buy the Quick Charge Kit which is only 10 dollars more and very reliable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only the Cord","review":"I ordered this expecting it to come with everything I need to play endless games without having to worry about changing the batteries.

I have since gone back to using my old router which works wonderfully.This technology is still way too new and Linksys needs to work out the bugs in it before releasing it to the public."},{"rating":"2","title":"Huge speed and range boost","review":"The Wireless-G router is the one I use at home. At the time I picked it up, it seemed like the perfect combination of a wired router and a wireless router for connecting to cable or DSL. Set up (including pulling out my old hub, router, and wireless) took less than 10 minutes and best of all everything worked for me the first time. Now I have 1 device to replace the clutter I had in the corner under my desk for years and years. This model here has SRX400 speed and range expansion. The other, similar looking model, is considerably cheaper, but if the speed and range boost are worth the extra cost. I use my laptop outside on the picnic table in the backyard with the router on the other side of the house. No problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Linksys WRT54GX4 Wireless-G","review":"Linksys products over the years have proven to be less than reliable and the WRT54GX4 may be the culmination of this dubious achievement status.Like all Linksys products the main issues are functionality, consistency and ease of implementation. I have only thirty years experience in the IT world which perhaps under qualifies me to properly setup these units.Avoid using these overpriced, under performing products whenever possible and you'll be much happier or disregard this review and find out why millions of people are on a first named basis with Rashis (from Bombay) one of the dozens of friendly customer support individuals sub-contracted by the company to man their very busy customer support lines 24/7.

It starts dropping connections probably 2 times a week, usually power off and power on will fix it, but some times that doesn't even work for an hour or so. I've tried upgrading to the latest firmware 1.00.17 and hard reseting, but it's still has problems. You can do a search on the web for similar issues.

I was hoping to get more range with the new router... which I do. I doesn't do much good however since the router is so unstable. It locks up or reboots itself about every 10-20 minutes... unless I disasble the wireless, then it ran for 6 hours without a problem. I upgraded to the 1.00.10 firmware and then reset to the factory defaults and that cured the slow response to the routers web interface, but not the lockups and reboots. I have tried various MTU and channel settings as suggested by linksys.

Written in 1894 by Paul Sabatier, the book became a bestseller throughout Europe and made the Vatican's infamous \\"index\\" of forbidden books. Sabatier, a French Protestant wrote a very objective biography that portrays Francis favorably, but tells how his order of spiritual brothers was challenged by ecclesiastical authorities. I was surprised to learn that meek and gentle Francis could also be bold, stern, and assertive in many situations. He did not go gently when he reprimanded his brothers and there were several occassions when he did so.It's a good translation and finely edited by John Sweeney, who has added sidebar annotations that contribute to understanding the people and places in Francis's time."},{"rating":"2","title":"The first attempt at a modern biography of St. Francis","review":"Now in a new edition edited and with an introduction and annotation Jon Sweeny, The Road To Assisi: The Essential Biography of St. Francis was first published in French in 1894, as the first attempt at a modern biography of St. Francis, one of the most beloved figures of Christian history. Author Paul Sabatier struggled to answer the question: who was Francis the man? Groundbreaking research reveals the a fully human portrayal of a man who was nonetheless gentle, passionate, joyful, and who desired to live as Jesus once taught his disciples. An extraordinary work that covers Francis' weaknesses as surely as his strengths, enhanced by the annotation and sidebars that place events of Francis' life in historical context. Highly recommended for individual reading as well as biography shelves, and a must-have for library collections."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book does have many Native American words","review":"I disagree with the previous reviewer.

This documentary is a must for anyone with a general interest in early to mid 20th century black history.The big problem with this dvd is it takes full use of an irritating DRM technology called UOP prohibition that will stop you from fast forwarding certain parts of the dvd. Commercials, logos, etc. all unskippable, you can't even use the stop button. The only way to stop the player is to shut it all the way off with the power button.

Jones shows a physical prowess that does not come through in any other film I have seen him in and carries the role with a natural grace.

It was said that Mohamed Ali saw the play and later modeled his boxing 'personality' after the famed Jack Johnson.I've read many biographies of the late Jack Johnson, and I think that the movie does not follow true to the actually events in Johnson's life.

Until last night, when she was gleefully smiling and spinning, the hand wheel popped off, and she banged her head on the floor. My baby's not much of a crier, but boy did she cry after that!

You can spin it as long as no one is sitting on it, so it is a pointless waste of money and space. My son gave up on it and won't even try to play with it anymore. If you decide to try to find an old used one, avoid the ones people claim are vintage made in 1973. Only the base of it says 1973; the musical top part is from the late 90's and is too flimsy to be functional.

PLEASE TRY THIS IN THE STORE BEFORE YOU BUY! Don't be fooled, as we were, into thinking the 'music' was not too loud. We tried the music in the store (TRUs) before buying, but discovered, when in use at home, that a toy store environment must be very loud. In addition to the VERY loud, obnoxious music (even our 3-yr. old daughter still covers her ears, and that's with clear packing tape over the speaker), it is very, very easy for children to fall when they step on this toy (and that's the 1st way they usually try to get on it). As a consequence, VERY CLOSE SUPERVISION is needed for playdates and children under the age of 5. Children also tend to lean backward while trying to use arms to spin, and this often results in the SNSpin toppling over.

And yah the fact that there is NO off button is horrible!! It's about to make a disappearing act!! If I knew how to contact the company I would ask for a refund!! What junk!!

She is now 18 months old and she still doesn't sit on it and spin. She tries to stand on it, and ends up losing her balance and tumbling off. Her favorite thing is to press the top to play music or to put a stuffed animal on it and spin the animal around. I hope she will \\"rediscover\\" this toy when she gets a little older because she seems bored and uninterested with it at her current age. I also find it a little unsettling/dangerous when she tries to stand on the spinning part."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes me dizzy just watching, but what a great toy!","review":"I remember having one of these when I was little and I loved it. So, when an aunt wanted to get something for my daughter for Christmas I didn't hesitate to ask her for this toy. What a great decision of mine! She has loved it!

While I agree with the statement \\"why improve on spinning around & getting dizzy?\\" my daughter really loves playing the music, so great. Also, I love the fact that she's playing on a toy that I enjoyed until the age of 11, I think.However, I would definitely have paid $5-10 more in exchange for a sturdier toy, perhaps with a heavier base, the way the older models were made. The plastic is pretty flimsy, and it's too easy for my daughter to simply pull on the handle really hard while seated (thus completing the spinning motion) and tip the whole thing over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where did the fun go?","review":"Today's Sit-N-Spins are nearly half the size they were when I was a kid--and it's not just because I got bigger that it looks smaller. My son got one for his second birthday, and he is too big for it! He is not overweight, he is within normal height range for his age group. The base is not wide enough--there is not enough room between the handle base and the edge of the seat for him to sit without rubbing against the handle, or falling off the edge of the seat. His feet dangle off the opposite end--when he crosses his feet to sit, it works for a few turns; still, he comes in contact with the handle base and it stops while he is still trying to spin.I'm very disappointed with this, I thought it was a great toy, but they've ruined it by making it impossibly small. Now all he does is push the button for the music, or give his stuffed animals a ride on it. His birthday was only two weeks ago!"},{"rating":"1","title":"My 2 don't like this one.","review":"Neither of my toddlers like this toy other than to stand on top of it and jump off.

Perhaps child safety issues have made the company slow down the rotation, but it's just not as fun.

As a kid, I remember how great this toy was. Trust me, this isn't the same toy. The toy is smaller than it used to be and it is incredibly flimsy. This new model has you put a couple of screws in place to attach the post to the base (the original was a single piece). My daughter only uses it for music now. Buy something else that will be of more use to your kid."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are better products","review":"This sit-and-spin is very light, and therefore unstable. My son is less than 30 lbs, and it tips easily with him on it, and he doesn't play with it for that reason. The products without the music pad are heavier, safer, and cheaper. My son LOVES those.

She didn't grasp the idea of turning herself around by using the top wheel, and she wasn't too thrilled at being dizzy when her grandma gently spun her around on it, but she loves the music and light show! The unit was easy to put together, quite sturdy (has survived a tot and two overactive boxer dogs quite well!), and the music level is low enough not to assault the ears. She also loves giving her dolls and stuffed animals rides."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even at 18 months, my daughter enjoyed this classic!","review":"I had such fond memories of my sit n' spin, that I knew I had to get one for my daughter! We thought she would also enjoy it since one of her favorite activities is being spun around by mommy or daddy! She got it for Christmas (at 18 months), struggled a little, but within a week, had the hang of it! Now, at 22 months, she can go pretty fast and yells \\"dizzy!\\" and \\"weeeeee!\\" over and over! I think the lights and music are a fun addition to this classic. The music is really not too loud, so I was able to tune it out easily. haha. Well worth the money for us! Oh, and another reviewer stated that the top part kept coming off, but you really need to snap it in tight for it to stay - then no problems!"},{"rating":"2","title":"musical sit & spin","review":"I bought this toy for our daughter's first Christmas, and she figured out how to use it within seconds. She loves all the different songs that play on it while spinning around. She is now three years old, and I don't think there's a day that goes by that she doesn't ride on this toy. It was a good muscle, and coordination builder for her. Her four year old brother loves to use it also, and they sometimes fight over it. I recommend this toy for rainy days. It keeps them busy for hours. It's also very sturdy, so it can be used for many more years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Loud","review":"The speakers are right near the ears, there is no volume control and the music is loud enough to deamage hearing.

I am not a big fan but was turned onto the band by seeing Radiohead cover one of their songs (the Thief) a few years ago. I like this album a little better than Tago Mago, mainly because the form of the songs are a little more in line with the pop form. Don't get me wrong this band has little pop sensibility.

It's largely a continuation of the ideas pioneered in \\"Tago Mago,\\" where the band was layering manifold drum rhythms intercut with sparse guitar buzzes, eerie keyboard effects, and ultra-minimalist bass throbs. All is topped off by the incomprehensible but compelling vocals of Damo Suzuki. And like \\"Tago Mago,\\" this is still a good 20 years ahead of its time, and has been stolen from by myriad artists who have taken credit for innovations that were not theirs. Can deserve to be far more well known than they are. Find out where your fave alternative artists REALLY stole their licks from, and get your brain massaged in the bargain.

It's a classic album that covers all sounds that Can could make. Tago Mago gets more focus, mainly because its actually more inventive and pushes the envelope much farther.

Any heterosexual red blooded male who likes anime will love this series. The innuendo and suggestive scenes are woven into the story in a perfectly hilarious fashion.The artwork is very true to the manga form, and the emotional expressions of the characters are a joy to watch.The only downside to this series is that there are only 6 of them. However, on the positive side, since there are only 6 episodes it's easy to watch them all in one or two sittings. The cool thing is the last episode ties in to all of the previous ones, and brings the story to a full circle but still leaving it open ended for our main character to continue on into new adventures."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for a collection, bad if it is the only anime you own.","review":"... This show has little in the view of a story and that fact that it is episodical makes it difficult for me to empathize with the main character whom I do not know because of a lack of background.This show sticks to a strict formula. The main guy gets a new Job, meets a ...chick, enchants her until she gets hot for him, leaves job and never scores (probably a good thing).I think horney guys are funny. I love Urusei Yatsura, but this show didn't do it for me and frankly the nipples in the first episode disturbed me. This is not one for the kiddies and not smart enough for the grownups.I give this 5 stars for dippy teenage fun.For me this Anime is right on level with Ruroni Kenshin, Kite, Cowboy Bebop, Dominion Tank Police and Green legend Ran.

I personally haven't seen a huge difference. The biggest positive to these cables, to me, is the ability to take any old external PC monitor I have, which only has a VGA input, and turn it into a gaming screen. By taking the audio cables and putting them through one of the suggested Aux-L/R component converter and the female-female Aux cable (a combined value of like 5-6 dollars) I can use my PC or a set of speakers for the audio.For my needs, that of taking a semi-useless external and giving it life as a gaming machine, it is perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"This cable has AMAZING video quality even better than a HDMI cable definitely worth the money the sound quality through it is also spectacular and I would definitely recommend buying itI also didn't notice any problems with ghosting or the colors being washed out but if you do have that problem you can change the color settings IN THE MONITERS SETTINGS not on the xbox.

I believe the model I bought was used, but it sits behind the TV and is never in view, so who cares? I purchased because I was experiencing lag between my xbox and new vizio TV.

I wanted to bring my XBOX 360 but didn't want to bring an additional TV that would have taken up a lot of space, and still would have been too small to enjoy the superb graphics that many of the games have to offer.I noticed that the VGA cord was for sale, so I bought it to be able to use my computer monitor as a screen. All I have to say is WOW. Best thirty something dollars I have ever spent! Full HD support, great color, and extremely convenient too.If you don't own an HDTV, get one of these cords and attach it to any computer monitor. The difference in quality will amaze you.Note: Some earlier review have stated that the colors can be washed out or not as good as component. That was fixed by an update, so it shouldn't be an issue now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great!","review":"I wanted these because they not only out-put through VGA which can match my Vizio's 37\\" native rez of 1366X768, but becuase they also have TOSLINK optical audio out. That way I get true Dolby Digital 5.1 for all my games with my home theater system.Ever since the Spring '07 Xbox 360 dashboard update, VGA cables are no longer plagued by the \\"Washed out\\" issue everyone complains about.The update added the ability to change the \\"reference levels\\" to three different settings, which really means changing the black levels the 360 is outputting. (the expanded setting being recommended for LCD's) And I got to tell you the 360 looks great, I prefer these over Component cables and HDMI cables.The biggest other difference you will notice is that when using component cables or HDMI cables is a good portion of the image is cropped off of the edges. The VGA cables dont do this."},{"rating":"1","title":"??? I dont get it ???","review":"I bought this cable because i only have one component input and the 360 has no HDMI out. I wanted to use the component input for my Wii, but after seeing the crappy picture quality with this I'll live with composite for the Wii. The cable is probably only good for DVD upconversion. Component has a far superior picture that's not as washed out. The VGA cable made my 360 dashboard look bad too. Even after i changed the display settings to my TV's resolution it looked completely washed out and colorless. So unless you have a 1080p TV and want DVD upconversion through an analog cable don't buy this.

This thing is a godsend. I have a perfectly good 19 inch wide-screen monitor on my desk not being used, so it was just common sense to get this. The cord works perfect. No ghosting. No problems with video or audio. I do have a little beef with it though. The audio has no extension like the vga does with its adapter. So if you do have 2 vga's connected to each other, the audio is still as short as it was, so you have to hide a bunch of extra cord. It almost counters any reason to use 2 vga's together, but not quite.

Im not much of an audio/videophile type but even I can see the difference clearly.I guess I should have done more research as I have found out my set does not send the proper color output from the vga connection, which is designated PC Vga.

I now believe in God and God believes in (I tend to get tangential every now and again and go on and on and on and on)me. Why do I like this movie? Well, I... What time is it? Six o'clock! Hey - What's for dinner? My favorite is poke chops, jist like Lil'Abner, and I wouldn't mind stupping Daisy Mae neither, come to think of it. Stupefyin Jones however, is an entirely other kettle of fish; as is Moonbeam McSwine, Mammy, all them Scraggs,Pappy, and yes, even Abner himself.(My wife made me say that. In fact, she's tapping a big wooden spoon in her palm as we sp,,,)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Li'l Abner","review":"I rate the DVD you sent me as poor.

How can I get my money back or a new copy of Li'l Abner?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very enjoyable film","review":"Highly entertaining production, featuring the various Al Capp characters, portrayed very effectively.

This classic film provides the definition of a hillbilly before the Beverly Hillbillies. An idealized view of backwoods mountain life vs. government intrusion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Li'l ABNER","review":"This film is a nestolgic musical that brings me back to my youth, the film offers a bit of fun to everyday life. The story line is a bit corney, where a town - Dogpatch USA, is scheduled to be a test site for atomic weapons unless there can be found a usefullness for the town. The introduction of a tonic, that makes men handsome and strong, while at the same time decreasing their virility, was thought to be cause to save the town - Dogpatch USA. I do not want to reaveal the end but this musical while predictive and the songs may not meet up to todays standards is fun, jubalient and enjoyable and yes fit for children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Li'l Abner review","review":"MOISHE DAYAN & LIL ABNERI was born 3 years after this movie was produced. I remember first seeing it in b&w;, (not rich enough for a color tv) as a child and was enthralled.Later (in my early twenties) I saw the last half of this movie (in color!) and was enthralled all over again.The characterizations and musical numbers are spot on, and one can sense the eagerness of the actors to get it right. Try searching YouTube for Lil Abner and see if this movie's right for you too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute for the time and a great musical for high school kids.","review":"I've seen this musical about 3 times. Once when I was about 8 and then 2 more times as an adult. When I was a Junior in High School, my chorus did this musical. I played the part of Pappy Yokem. We all fell in love with the musical because our cast fit the parts perfectly. I think this musical is a classic because Lil' Abner was a very popular comic strip while I was growing up and the movie version captured each character as close to the comic strip as possible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must See for Li'l Abner Fans","review":"This is great because it is so unpretentious-- a crowd pleasing musical farce based on Al Capp's popular comic strip. The gorgeous 50's pin-up style women are especially true to their source (and Julie Newmar really earns the name \\"Stupefyin' Jones\\"). Leslie Parish makes a luminous Daisy May, and Peter Palmer is the biggest, brawniest baritone Abner you could imagine. Mammy and Pappy are also great, but the weirdest impersonation has got to be Eagle-Eye Fleagle-- that guy moves like a cartoon! The plot is as kooky as one of Capp's Sunday half-page strips. Kind of corny but lively, with very athletic dancing by various hillbilly-clad young Broadway performers. The only flaw is its stagey-ness and flat lighting with multiple shadows on the studio floor. Still, with Gen. Bullmoose, Marryin' Sam (Stubby Kaye), Mooshine McSine, the Scraggs and a lot of plot convolutions, it is a very satisfying fable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lil Abner - Amazon instant video","review":"As described - instant download - I was led to believe that I could download the film onto a DVD or such, then watch it on my television. However, that was not the case, and the file is kept on an AMAZON server, where I can watch it whenever I like. That being said, I would also question the quality of the video resolution as compared to a pre-recorded DVD, which I took out of the library, the library copy being much better. Next time I purchase a film, I'll be sure to check if it is actually being downloaded to me, or just to my AMAZON account."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't get it.

Ball's Five Women Wearing the Same Dress at a local community theatre, and was high impressed. Ball has a very distinct writing style, that underneath all the laughs, there is some kind of twisted mass of drama that is not always viewable throughout the script. On top of that drama, neatly and strategically placed is a laugh-fest of comedy. Five Women... encompasses all aspects of this.

Actually, I would warn some that this is a collection of 20th century writers, and only up to 1975. Some were born earlier, but their main out put was in the 20th century. So they are indeed, modern, but not recent.This said, it is an excellent collection of well chosen and well translated short stories. I had read novels by some of these authors, some I didn't know at all. It was all interesting, and I found several particularly good.To me, modern Japanese writers are just as worthy of interest as the ancient past of Japan."},{"rating":"2","title":"A bit of a confusing read....","review":"In reading this book I expected more traditional tales with a moral at the end but these seem to me to wander about and leave one wondering what they just read.

I just wanted a no brainer action flick with some good looking women in it. (WARNING - spoilers ahead) The story which was the strongest part of the film dissapointed me in the end when you find out the main heroine used to be a man who was deeply in love with main villain (also a man). Once this was revealed I began to lose interest in the female lead actress. The action was slow, boring and when the end of the movie finally came I breathed a sigh of relief and gave the dvd away and I have certainly not missed it.I have to say this though, if you want to see something different and are not just in it for the girls and violence this might be and intersting movie for you.

Its a scripted docudrama, starring Todd and Jack Hoffman, former slumlord motel owners from Sandy, OR. They round up a band of their hillbilly friends, and, bankrolled by Discovery, head north to gold mine and end up losing their shirts. If you like bad acting, obvious scripted melodrama, and more silly nonsense than a 3 Stooges movie, you'll love these clueless hillbilly buffoons as they try and convince us they're sincere about finding gold. Its one crisis after another, with Todd dragging his 400 pound frame around the mine site, like an Alaskan bear rooting for its next meal in the camps garbage cans.

I was very excited that they'd come out with a new CD. This CD is nothing like any of their previous music. Gone are the kettle drums, church bells, and Gregorian chant-like vocals. This new CD sounds extremely similar to Dead Can Dance. Although I am a Dead Can Dance fan and own all of their recordings as well, I've grown rather bored with their sound and was disappointed to see Arcana emulating a style that's been around for over two decades and is on it's way out, in my humble opinion.Still, if you've never heard Dead Can Dance before and aren't burned out on the whole middle-eastern, belly dance, street bazaar, ambient thing, then this may be just the CD for you. In typical Arcana style, it is well produced and is filled with great musical imagery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Performer","review":"I was spoiled by my last mixer, which lasted for 25 years, had 7 speeds and beaters that stayed in the housing. This mixer does not have enough variable speeds and is too powerful even on low speeds. So powerful that the batter flies all over the kitchen, and the beaters come out of the housing. I usually like Cuisinart products but will never buy another hand mixer made by them. I use my Kitchen Aid stand mixer instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good while it works","review":"Ours worked well for two years; recently, however, one of the beaters has stopped turning reliably--the (plastic?) gears inside seem to have stripped. Since warranty service is 1/3 the whole cost of a new unit, we will probably try our luck with another brand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Power and value","review":"This mixer is great, and for $30 a steal. It's powerful -- making cookie dough is no problem -- and well-designed, including an air intake-output system (which is what makes the front look like a jet engine). The only issue has been noted by others -- there's no \\"very low\\" speed and you can't massage it into one (like on a Kitchen Aid stand mixer), so the lowest speed is 1/3 of max power, which is still pretty powerful! That means some splattering unless you're using a deep bowl, but it's not much contribution to the mess I make anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alot of power","review":"This mixer has a little too much power for my needs. Even at its lowest setting, the batter flies all over."},{"rating":"2","title":"It mixes","review":"This is a strong no frills mixer that does what a mixer should. It has none of those silly attachments that just clutter up the kitchen drawers and the 3 speeds you actually use. Perfect."},{"rating":"1","title":"too strong","review":"I have been very excited about making cupcakes and frosting lately and so bought a handy dandy hand held mixer. Nothing was wrong with the item except that it performed much too strongly than needed. I am only using it to mix my frosting and blend in ingredients. Bits of everything fly off and I am left with frustration and a messy kitchen. This is a big disappointment and maybe a cheaper model with a low setting would have sufficed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too powerful!","review":"This mixer is a great price, however, all 3 speeds are too powerful. The low setting is pretty much non-existant. I can't soften butter on the lowest speed without it splattering all over my kitchen. For serious cooking, I'd recommend you purchase a different mixer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerfull Mixer...","review":"This mixer is much more powerful than the older one I had for years. What can you say about a mixer, 3-speeds, does the job. Besides having a strong motor it operates like my old one. The 3-speed starts off slow and can power blend cold butter without a problem. Used correctly it doesn't splatter any more than my old one. Other Reviewers have stated that the blades don't stay in the unit. Well, this mixer has a separate left and right blade. They are each slightly different and when you put them in correctly you will hear a slight click. This click is the locking mechanism. It is all explained in the instruction booklet. Time will tell if it can hold up like my trusty old one that one day just disappeared -- those kids!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy","review":"I have had this mixer for a little over 2 years. I have used it very little during the time I have owned it. The speeds on this mixer are fast and faster. There is no setting to allow you to mix in dry items. It is a very powerful hand mixer so it is very good at making fluffy frostings. Last night I was mixing a cream cheese frosting (after stirring in the powdered sugar with a different mixer since you would be wearing it if not)the cuisinart mixer stalled and then quit all together. This was an expensive mixer and I expected to have it for a long time. My $5.00 Wal-Mart Black Friday sale mixer is older and more durable than this mixer was and for a fraction of the price. I am going to read reviews and search for a new hand mixer, but it will not be a Cuisinart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice :)","review":"Bought this for my mother this Christmas. I don't really know too much about it, but she says she likes it a lot. She doesn't use it too frequently, but when she needs it, she tells me that it's pretty much perfect. And I say, it's pretty much perfect too, especially for the price I paid for it!Haven't had issues with it. She says the speeds are just fine, not too agressive at all as long as you keep your mixer in the bowl when you turn it on. It won't splash batter everywhere if you also have a large enough bowl to mix in. But I'll assume that being obvious isn't what some of these reviews would have you think..Good buy overall!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not an all-purpose hand mixer","review":"This hand mixer probably would be great if I were making bread or something that needed the power that it delivers, but I am not. Unfortunately the low speed is just too fast and I am going to either return it or sell it. When I try and pre-mix sugar and butter I just make a mess because the low speed flings the mixture around the kitchen. It seems well constructed, but I tend to think that hand mixers should be versatile and this one is not. I am going to purchase a mixer with more speeds for finer control."},{"rating":"2","title":"Light, easy to clean, and efficient!","review":"I really needed a mixer for my pancakes and muffins and this does the job. Its compact with 3 possible speeds. Sometimes I even beat the eggs in a small bowl at the low setting. I really love how easy and simple it is and its fairly powerful. Also another positive is how easy it is to eject the whisks and clean it. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this little red mixer!","review":"After struggling for a couple of years with an inexpensive, underpowered hand mixer, hoping that its motor wouldn't catch fire with the next batch of cookie dough, I got smart and decided to try this little Cuisinart.

Both pretty and powerful, it should last through many, many batches of cookies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor mixer","review":"I don't know why people are giving this product such rave reviews. It was working fine for awhile. But the beaters got bent just by putting them in my dishwasher and now the beater sprays anything in a bowl all over the kitchen, literally. I've been talking to the company and trying to get them to replace the beaters, which they said they'd do.

I have been a faithful ELP fan since the 1970's, and have bought most if not all of the releases. The excerpts from the California Jam are worth the cost of this CD. This was probably one of their best performances when everything was firing on all cyclinders as they say. The releases from a smaller label company such as this one seem to be better than releases from the major companies. Anyway the California Jam stuff most notably Toccatta have excellent sound quality and make this CD a must buy for the avid ELP fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"I really like Billy Zane.I think he is not noticed enough.One of the things I enjoyed about this movie was the intense bond that grew between him and Mimi in one night.The Mimi Rodgers character never really revealed her motivations.

He also provides maps and timelines to put it into perspective and make visualization easier. It's a short, easy, and enjoyable read spliced with words of wisdom from the Analects. In essence we are all here to do certain jobs and should do them to the best of our abilities and not disrupt the social order. He was very enlightened for his time in that he felt jobs should be obtained by merit and not birth. He came up with the idea of imperial exams to make accession fair. Perhaps it would be expecting too much for a philosopher who lived 2,500 years ago but, his idea of equality and a level playing field didn't extend to women. This is left out of the book. It's a well documented biography and the writing is good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Prepare to be scammed","review":"I was very excited I was going to be getting this CD for my birthday, and I was expecting the REAL 11-track Origin yet when it came I was very disappointed. It was OF COURSE the 19 track bootleg and I was able to tell just by looking at the front cover, because it was an ugly skull design instead of the original one. I even tried listening to it, but nearly all of the tracks were either burned or out of order. I should've known better than to take such a risk so I'll end this by saying BUY THE MP3s, you can't get ripped off then!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bootleg","review":"Is CD is definitely bootleg, it is VERY obvious.

I have both the 19 track edition and 11 track . The 19 track edition is indeed factory pressed and legit. The 11 track Origin is the one listed here. The 19 track edition is almost completely different with a much more gothic look to it. The album has some really good alternate versions on it. It is much darker than Fallen and The Open Door. Awesome CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Darker but better","review":"Before I start this review I'd like to say that the very fact that this CD is barely known and kind of went 'Under the radar\\" whereas Fallen became quite famous is a true shame. I guess people heard how dark the CD is and got scared that Evanescence was a bunch of super depressed kids when that is simply not the case. If you get their DVD you will see that they are actually quite goofy at times, but that's besides the point. This CD is much darker than Fallen, but a lot better in my opinion. Whisper, My Immortal and Lies are 3 of my favorite tracks and the opening is truly artistic and it grabs you and pulls you in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome","review":"I have enjoyed this band since I was 12 (I am 22 now), and this CD has not changed that opinion.

However, Netgear's products are usually of higher quality... ie, metal cases, fall-back access to try re-uploading firmware updates if they fail (instead of just having to send the router back for a replacement), more onboard memory, etc. Don't get me wrong though... Linksys is also very good, however, in the quality of their hardware, I'd have to give Netgear the edge, at least in most of their routers. Anyway, I've had my Netgear MR314 for about 4 months, and couldn't be happier with it!

I never found that out until the end of my talk with one of the technicians about 1AM in the morning. If I had known this I would not have bothered to try and go wireless as I would have had to reinstall my dsl modem. Some of the techs seemed knowlegable but the wait time is as bad as I have ever experienced trying to get a tech. I'm going hardwire but not with Netgear because of the frustration of contacting tech support."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice, but the range is much less than advertised.","review":"Setting up the router and the USB adapter (MA101) was easy. First I tested with the two computers in the same room. It worked great, with \\"Excellent\\" signal strength. I then moved computer 1 with the router 40 feet (two rooms) away, in my house. The indicated signal strength dropped to \\"Poor\\" (1 or 2 out of 5 bars). Transfer speed was still good though--plenty fast enough for DSL communication. However, when the signal was poor, dropouts could occur. Then when I moved the router downstairs 60 feet away, the adapter was NEVER able to connect. Worst yet, whenever the MA101 was plugged in while no signal or the signal was lost, it hung Windows (XP). And the computer must be reset!It simply does not have the transmission range that I needed-I returned the products."},{"rating":"1","title":"issues with Earthlink DSL, but works fine with SBC Yahoo!","review":"My brother got this for his Earthlink DSL. It never quite worked right. (Both of us took a look at it.) The connection would work for a few minutes, and then disconnect. To reconnect, you had to go through the setup again. This was quite annoying for general web browsing. However, it just won't work with internet gaming.I had an older Linksys router w/o wireless and swapped with him. The Netgear works fine with my broadband service (SBC Yahoo!) I can VPN to work without any problems. The wireless works fine too.As for my brother's Earthlink connection, the Linksys router is as steady as a rock.I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because it does seem happy with my SBC Yahoo! connection.

In order to get reception on my laptop, you basically have to be in the same room as the router. In my bedroom (only 40 feet away from the router), reception is poor or non-existent. According to tech support (nearly impossible to understand through a thick accent), I should be happy to get at least 30 feet inside a house. The great range advertised by this product only occurs in a laboratory. In a real house, you'll be cursing yourself for buying this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst support ever","review":"They say that they have 24x7 support.But, when I called phone support I had to hang up after being on hold for 45 minutes.

The wireless PCI card worked perfectly out of the box. I wish I could say the same for the router.I took three calls to technical support to finally figure out that the router was defective. It could not sychronize the cable modem's signal. The worst part of my experience was the wait time for technical support.

However, I feel many of the customers have failed to consider one key feature that the MR314 lacks: SECURITY. This brand offers very little in regards to securing your wireless network. There is no way to view a log of successful or failed connections from wireless clients. Almost all other brands have this ability.My particular router locks up after 8-9 day of use and requires a cold boot. Although, this may be a bug in the current firmware that might be corrected in the next version. I've spoken with Netgear's technical support dept and their level of knowledge is no higher than someone who has read the quick install guide for this router."},{"rating":"1","title":"worthless investment","review":"The router portion of this device works great, and setup on a LAN is easy. However, the wireless feature fails at least 5 times per day and must be rebooted by unplugging the unit (there is no power switch).

While there may be a benefit in nitric oxide, this is for sure NOT the way to expose it. There is little information in the book. This should not be called a \\"book\\" it is simply a way for the author to sell his product. I agree with others that the book is not well written and is very tedious to read, I dropped it after a few pages because he keeps repeating a statement over and over and over and over again.

The discovery of Nitric Oxide as a regulator of Blood Pressure and overall function of the Circulatory system will increase the human life span significantly. The only reason a lot of people have not heard of it is probably that the Pharmaceutical companies have very little to gain from it since both, L-Arginine and L-Citrulline can be bought by the pound. The significance of their discovery is that now people have a way to heal and maintain their circulatory system in tip top shape, improving their life span and quality of life.

I've read some other reviews of this book,and just want to add that the book is an inerpretive book, and that it, not Mr. Peart, is being reviewed here. I don't necessarily agree wih his every word or feeling, but I am interested in the inpetus behind the songs that have graced my life for many years. If you focus on Peart's devotion to rand (mostly in his earlier years, and he didn't endorse her every word), then I think you're missing the point. The authors have done a good job at bringing some of the more obscure meanings to light, as well as educating us on the interesting world of human interaction. You don't have to be a follower of Rand to enjoy this book and gain a little insight into the writings of one of music's more thoughtful lyricists."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please Hire A Better Editor Next Time","review":"As a big fan of the Canadian Power Trio, I tend to seek out anything \\"Rush-Related\\".

Nothing earth-shattering here and some interpretations; \\"2112\\" appear to be way off compared to what Neil Peart acknowledged as his true inspiration.However, I hope the next time the authors embarks on such a subject, that they hire a better editor to proofread their product.

I did graduate work in an area similar to this, and I found the author's attempt to deconstruct (find hidden meaning) in what are very obvious lyrics, strained at best. The author sees very little in Rush other than themes of fighting programming, and the quest for the individual. While those themes are clearly there, sometimes a song is a song. I found myself rolling my eyes at many of the observations in this text. Do yourself a favor and listen to the songs while reading the lyrics. If you aren't bright enough to understand fairly simply lyrical meanings, you will really dislike this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow, pretty hard core...","review":"Quite simply this book is way too technical in a philosophical manner. I thought the book would simply review the songs, give insight and let the reader get a further understanding to what Neil had in mind when he wrote these songs. I made it through the first few chapters and then decided that this book was too much to handle. It would have been a bit more enjoyable if it examined each song in a \\"lighter\\" fashion.....I think the average reader will find this to be just too much to sit back, relax and enjoy...."},{"rating":"1","title":"For a good laugh....","review":"Who is Ms. Price kidding?!?! There is no question that she is quite intelligent and has an adroit way of expressing her opinions. But, the majority of her opinions/analysis is just a depravity. For example, when she analyzes A Farewell To Kings; she refers to lyrics from Time Stand Still (\\"...lets the ship run aground where it will\\"). Also, she is constantly stealing lyrics (from a song that she is analyzing) in order to express her views and/or those of Neil Peart. For example, \\"the troubles that threaten our civilization have sprung from seeds that we let grow.\\" Any Rush fan can read the lyrics themselves and understand what they mean. I beleive Ms. Price lacks originality in her views and refers to much on lyrics from Neil to express her views. Maybe next time Ms. Price can put away the lyrics and just let her views/expressions/analysis come from within her and not from refering to the lyrics in the jewel case."},{"rating":"1","title":"Philosophy Thesis, Save Yourself!","review":"Cannot understand why anyone believed this was worthy of publishing.

This DVD obviously contains overdubs here and there, especially in the backing vocals section. Even so, the live musical quality of the band's original members is questionable.I have been at many W.A.S.P.-concerts in my time, and they simply don't sound anything like they do on their studio releases. Sad, but true.I wonder how much of their \\"Live... in the raw\\" album is truly live?I have always been a big fan of W.A.S.P., and I have followed them since \\"The last command\\" was released in 1985.

I am a huge fan of his, and in retrospect, he made W.A.S.P.Don't get me wrong here...Blackie can really belt out a song, and his voice and songwriting abliity are just as strong as it was back in 1984.All in all this a a great DVD- the audio seems a little off during a couple of their songs, but that does not negate what they do best...Rock!I would recommend this DVD in a heartbeat."},{"rating":"1","title":"First off I am a WASP fan and have seen them 7x live............","review":"I have to say that I had very high hopes for this DVD when I got it a couple of years back.

The book was poorly written with tons of grammatical errors and spelling mistakes -- at the very least the book was rushed to press without any editoral consideration. Many times during the telling of the story the author was telling the story from the wrong character's perspective. A paragraph would start with one character's name as the narrator and then switch mid-sentance to the voice of a character that was not even in the scene. It became very distracting.The prose was overly dramatic and squishy. All the conversations between two people was always prefaced with the characters name.

The R rating is appropriate; don't plan on showing it in its entirety. Though you could probably show a few select scenes, definitely preview (luckily she did). None of the scenes with the witches are ok to show to a class. One of the witches is a hermaphrodite who lifts skirt and shows her junk, and in another scene--the part where Macbeth goes back to the witches to get more prophecies--the play's three witches are joined by about a hundred nasty naked old witches--gross. Also, the fighting scenes are super cheesy. Actually, the whole thing is pretty cheesy.

However i liked how the movie mad ross the thired murderer It was a very good idea that just seemd to fit and i also liked how in the final scen Donaild Bain whent to see the witchs it tied history in nicly and left the ending a littel more open and i liked that. Over all the movie was not really my idea of a great movie but those of you who are into old movies with fighting and gore its probably a good movie for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Macbeth Review.","review":"Well, what can I say. The movie itself was well done. The incorporation of the dark and halogenic atmosphere portrayed in the original play was well matched in this production. The acting was very stable and excellently delivered, and the use of the silver screen makes it possible for the average individual to understand Shakespeare more, even though the language is still bloody impossible to figure out... However, the film had setbacks: for instance, the music sounded terrible, much like a quadropolegic monkey was being pushed through a pipe organ. As well as that, many scenes were left on the cutting room floor and not expressed in the film, leaving some innaccuracy to be seen. Nonetheless, it was an excellent film with very high standards for being a quality piece of Shakespearean work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this as good as it gets?","review":"This film is produced by Hugh Heffner's Playboy productions, which allowed the production staff a great deal of freedom when it came to finances and expenditures. Heffner's attempt to be a part of the fabric of our culture seems to be the best film version of Macbeth, however that is not saying much. This is a film that desperately needs to be made again...Lady Macbeth does not give even a lackluster performance, Macbeth is stoic and doesn't give the character any depth. Perhaps we could get a joint venture soon with Baz Luhrman and Kenneth Brannaugh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Rendition Of The Play","review":"Out of the two great versions of MACBETH that I've seen, Orson Welles' and Roman Polanski's, I prefer Polanski's version. Polanski brilliantly adapted the play to the silver screen. MACBETH is an eerie, brutal, suspenseful, thought-provoking film. Many complaints can be heard concerning an unnecessary level of violence in the film. They are untrue. The brutality of the film only strengthens the points made in Shakespeare's play, the central ideas of betrayal and revenge. Polanski's MACBETH is a legendary piece of work."},{"rating":"2","title":"MacBeth","review":"So foul and fair a film as this I have not seen. The dark landscape and eerie sound track perfectly capture the mood of tragedy. (How brilliantly ironic when good King Duncan, heading straight to his murder, proclaims \\"This castle hath a pleasant seat. The air nimbly and sweetly recomends itself unto our gentle senses.\\") Finch makes an excellent MacBeth. And I believe this 1971 version produced by Heffner is superior to the Orson Wells film (Banquo shouldn't tell MacBeth to his face that he doesn't trust the king -- shame on you Orson.) This is my favorite Shakespeare adaptation to film ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"RRR- Rating,for absolute violence and blood.....","review":"I remember this film,if you like to see heads getting cut off by a sword,a woman getting raped,and a man getting hit in the face with a 'chain mail' and seeing blood splatter all over the place,this is the movie to get.In my opinion,I have never seen a movie of a historical figure depicted in this unique fashion or point of view. This movie has a lot of gore scenes,if you have kids,you'll stay away from this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe he made MacBeth boring!","review":"This has to be the most boring MacBeth I have ever seen!!!! I love Shakespeare and different interpretations, but this one was unbelievable. The only things remotely interesting were the naked witches and that was interesting only because it was weird. Really, why would witches run around naked in a very damp and cold looking Scotland? I actually fast-forwarded through the movie I was so bored. The actors had the charisma (for the most part) of dead fish. The only one who seemed flesh and blood was Banquo. Even Lady MacBeth was rather dull, though the fact that she looked the epitome of a California girl was interesting. Basically, rent it once. Do not buy it!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Amanda Caldwell-enrichment","review":"Mr. Yochum's Senior English ClassI think that this movie version of Macbeth just did not live up to my expectations. I thought that Polanski's version was quite boring to say the least. Not that it depicted the play badly but the characters were poorly picked and didn't act very well. I did like the bloody fight scene between Macbeth and Macduff in the end. However, it sort of made me laugh more than anything. Although, the acting wasn't quite up to par, the motif of hands was still used just like in the play. I think Polanski followed Shakespeare's metaphorical use of hand imagery well here by showing the scene with Lady Macbeth sleep walking.

However, it didn't turn out to be what I expected. The movie made it hard for me to stay awake during class. I thought that the scene where the forest came towards Macbeth was portrayed poorly. I could barely tell that they were trees that the soldiers were carrying. Also, the fighting scene at the end was very unrealistic, which disappointed me because it was the scene I was looking forward to the most. This scene was not suspenseful, it was just amusing. I feel that the director could have taken more time to make the movie more believable. Although parts of the movie were not portrayed as clearly as the play, I did enjoy some parts of it. I would advise you not to buy the movie due to the fact that it is way over priced."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice overview","review":"This is a big, fun, overview of women cartoonists from about 1895 to now. It would make a great gift. Lots of full-color reproductions of the work and some quotes from the artists make this a great introduction for anyone interested in women artists. That being said, it is really kind of a \\"coffee table\\" book in that the text is secondary. There is no analysis, just a chronological introduction of each artist, and the nature of the book requires that the author can only briefly mention incredibly important cartoonists like Alison Bechdel in a sentence, or not even mention Roz Chast at all. Still, you can't do everything in one book, and some people would not be interested in heavy reading.

An amazing actor. An amazing performance. Granted, this is translated from the stage to the cinema, but it is quite affecting in expressing the character that was Huey P.

As an actor, this is a master class in deep and committed artistry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful.","review":"I saw this performance first on Netflix streaming and then bought this to show to Introduction to Theatre students.

I had some reservation of purchasing this item for my PC but it works great with BioShock (popular PC game).As with most XBOX 360 games available for the PC, the game BioShock has a native XBOX 360 gamepad support builtin. Using this controller, instead of a third party one, will often save you the extra inconvenience of configuring the gamepad to your specific game.Otherwise, there is nothing special about this gamepad except it works well with both PC and XBOX 360. As an owner of PS3 and 2 other types of gamepads, I can't say this gamepad is better than others and vice versa.I wish MSFT had created a flexible gamepad driver (they sure have the resources) which allows more customizaton of each gamepad buttons.

All the buttons did the desired function but it felt different than my other controller so I took a peak inside. What i saw was terrible. One of the rubble packs was disconnected and the chip had saunter burns everywhere. I thought I could fix the rubble by plugging it in but then I saw the the connector was missing so that was that.

They're a bit pricey, but you will be happy you made the investment in a platform supported controller.

It works the same as the wireless controller but feels different in your hands. If you have never used the wireless before, I don't think this would affect you in the least. The wired controller is a little lighter and the wire tends to drape over or around my finger on the right trigger button. These are really only small issues, its a great controller but I do prefer the wireless version.EDITA week later and it feels better in my hand.

I don't own an Xbox 360 and my xbox in my closet collecting dust.The four button directional pad isn't as responsive as it could be, you really need to press down firmly, but that's not too much of a negative.Yes, it is quite expensive, but I do think it's worth it for sure.Overall I think this is the best designed controller for the PC, not quite for consoles, but close."},{"rating":"1","title":"Used controller","review":"This is a used controller.

An odd thing about it was that the right thumb stick is extremely sensitive when moving left.

Those transitioning from the first generation to the 360 will find controls as they were, so players don't have to re-learn button position. There is one exception to the similarities. Every time a new generation of controller has arrived, the \\"start\\" and \\"back\\" buttons always seem to shift their positions, and I'm not sure why. Also, the black and white buttons of the Xbox controllers have been replaced by the \\"LB\\" and \\"RB\\" buttons on the 360. However, all buttons are conveniently positioned, but the rather narrow range of motion of the left thumbstick makes finesse in racing games difficult to achieve. Instead you get either too little or too much input as you attempt to maneuver your car around the track, though you get used to it. Overall, a good controller and I have had absolutely no reliability issues (even through heavy use.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!!","review":"Plug & Play in my vista x64.

His rechargable batteries are hardly holding thier juice so he's always asking to use this one. The cord is also very long, so the kids can sit far from the tv. It also has a nice weight to it.

They ship a supposedly new controller that is unboxed and in a plastic bag. They say its \\"new\\" yet my controller was obviously used and refurbished. I can tell that is was used because the linings of the controller had dirt buildup, which accumulates only from usage. I suspect that the D-pad was a 3rd-party part. It did not even match up with the size of my other Microsoft controllers' D-pad and was extremely loose to the touch. Right away the A and B button did not work. The only plus side to this controller was that it is Amazon backed, so I could easily return this piece of junk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rumble works on some games...","review":"I bought this controller (Windows XP version) to use with Prince of Persia - The Two Thrones.

I suppose I was due for some bad luck or something, because this controller was the worst I've ever felt. The feel was completely wrong. It even felt incredibly light when I held the package for the first time. As far as the functionally goes, the controller was unplayable. The joystick felt as though it had been damaged already and passed off as \\"new\\" or something. I'm completely unhappy with the product I received. In defense of the seller, the item did ship here quickly despite being in Okinawa, Japan. I would highly discourage anyone from purchasing this controller from this seller.

Evidence for \\"cell memory\\" is an unverified story of an unnamed woman who had cravings for beer and chicken nuggets after recieving a heart transplant from a motorcyclist. Einstein proved that E=mc^2; even scientists admit the universe is a friendly place made of spiritual energy!

Why did a prosecutor who violated his own oath to \\"seek justice first\\" pursue Martha Stewart with a vengeance and even made up fraudulent charges? Why did the mainstream media conspire to taint the jury pool in New York? Why did a biased judge deny Martha her rights? Why was a man who lied to get seated at her trial, who hated Martha, and who had a criminal record, permitted to sit in judgment? Why did the jurors accuse her lawyers of not putting on a defense?Martha Stewart's trial and conviction is a blot on the escutcheon of our judicial system.

We laughed in every scene from beginning to end.When I worked for a library, I took home several of the titles of the Eloise books to read to my siblings. We loved the books and now I am enjoying this refreshingly clean and fun movie series. The first one is called Eloise at the Plaza. I do hope they write more scripts and film the rest of the series.Eloise is this rambunctious, loud, and very mischievous child who lives in the Plaza hotel. She loves to change the way the hotel is managed with her sneaky way of stirring things up a bit. She is a charmer to some and a brat to others, but as you watch you will fall in love with every part about her!

Julie Andrews is always a favorite and does a great job in this movie as the ever-patient nanny. Kids will like the high energy of the main character while adults may become exhausted by it all (much like Julie Andrews character). But happy endings and warm fuzzies are a hallmark of the Christmas season and this movie fits the bill."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engaging, endearing, and rawther marvelous!","review":"I grew up in the fifties with the Eloise books, and although I thought they were cute, this movie brought them to life and much more. The Eloise of the books was comical, but the movie gave Eloise heart and soul beyond humor. The characters literally seemed to leap off the pages of the book and come to life. Sofia (Eloise) is as perfect in the part as a girl could be--bold, saucy, mischievous, and good-hearted. And Julie Andrews as nanny is as nannyish as could be--authentic, heartwarming, and funny.

Hatching a bold plan, he and his girlfriend sought to obtain the blueprints for the Mirage, the aircraft which the Israeli Air Force depend on. The only fly in the ointment was an arms dealer who was hoping to supply subsonic jets to the Israeli.The writer gave extensive background not only to the characters, but also to the development of the air defence of Israel, showing in a logical manner why the Mirage was priceless to Israel.The only kink in the entire story was the involvement of CIA agents at a critical point, without proper explanation for their presence or stance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the right instrument","review":"The keyboard requires a computer.

But what I heard here is simply below any reasonable quality standard. High notes are distorted, orchestra voices are not heard at all, everything is messed up.

Total waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Moffo Momento","review":"I was really disappointed in the casting of this video. Moffo sings beautifully in dubbing but the balance of the cast is inferior to say the least. The costumes are pretty and the castle is grand but found myself totally unmoved. The Met version with Sutherland is better in my opinion, even though I'm a fan of Moffo. Must remember it's done in 1968 style as well, and not as much good acting as some today. Nice to have to remember Moffo, however."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good vocals, horrible production","review":"First off, let's be clear that I'm writing here about the Lucia di Lammermoor DVD with Anna Moffo. I'm completely confused as to the reason for the reviews here of Joan Sutherland. This production of a great Donizetti opera is simply awful. The soundtrack seems to have been recorded from a staging and does not match well with the many outdoor scenes of the film. The acting is poor, a weakness shared by too many opera performers but one that can certainly be overcome in most operas. Arguably worst of all is the camera work, which has the quality of a backyard home movie. I will say that the vocals here are very good, thus the second star."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT Lucia","review":"I just opened my Moffo's version of Lucia and lo & behold inside the case was Moffo's La Traviata!I didn't send it back because it turned out to be a fine DVD, but after all, I was looking forward to Lucia."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dollar General","review":"Dollar General sells the episodes individually for around $10 each, but I have not found this particular DVD anywhere but Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never received the video","review":"I never received this product.

Initially, wouldn't work after reboots. Subsequently, it seemed more random. I wasn't able to find a good pattern.Acomdata's web site states that they give free tech support for as long as you own the product, and promise an email response in 3 days. Wasn't sure how they could manage such an inclusive policy, but I soon found out.

Firewire and USB 2.0 are more compatible for older laptop like mine, which only use firewire and the slow USB 1.1.Yes there is an On/Off switch, which some external are too cheap to put on. There is plastic grill in the front to let air through. Very easy setup with big screws.One issue that I have noticed since using this case is the sound insulation. I got a noisy Seagate Hard-drive and the slim aluminum case has no sound insulation, which is quiet loud at time. My old Western Digital plastic case had a quieter hard-drive.

I loved the whole show, especially the breathtaking, beautiful 'Strange fruit', performed a-cappella by Ross.

Top rate musicians on hand are a waste as they are forced to wade through tepid arrangements that could induce deep sleep in an insomniac.This woman made it by having great songs and a sound studio with a huge echo chamber and a microphone with high reverb. And it didn't hurt that she \\"rode the hobby horse\\" with Gordy Berry.But she can't sing live to save the world.Stick to the real singers of this genre: Ella, Sarah, Betty Carter, Diane Krall"},{"rating":"2","title":"DIVINE DIANA","review":"Finally, Motown has released this fabulous concert on DVD. Diana shines in this jazz concert that she first presented on pay per view.

Along the way, they learn about the meaning of love and friendship, the reality of vulnerability and fears, and the power of perseverance. Tharthur's dream and the journey that follows it is one that we all, in a sense, seek after. That is, the desire to conquer evil, to fall in love, to be the hero, and to make friends with unlikely people is alive in all of us.Readers will enjoy the writer's style throughout the story as he combines humor and suspense that makes every flip of the page exciting. The book takes the readers far away to a mystical land, yet cleverly includes everyday dilemmas that we all face (the boys' encounter with the beautiful ladies is a wonderful example!). I thoroughly enjoyed reading DreamQuest and I highly recommend it to anyone who lives to see their greatest dreams come true!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kept me on the edge of my seat","review":"If you like Tolkein, Barron, Brooks or McCaffery, then you'll enjoyDreamQuest. It has adventure, magic, friendship, romance and tragedy.Itkept me on the edge of my seat. I can't wait for the next book,DreamQuest2: ProphecyQuest. I give this book four stars.Prairie Middle School 8th Grader"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"The book Dream Quest easily earns five out of five stars. Its plot is rich with unique characters, glorious and terrible places, and magic, the foundation of fantasy. Though the descriptions are always so realistic that they practically draw you in, you never find yourself reading the third page of a description of a building. This book is an appealing read to both obsessive fantasy readers, and those who can't tell a dragon from a lizard. This is because Dream Quest combines both well known fantasy components (Elves, Goblins, Wizards, etc.) and its own concepts (four elemental powers and the land of Daranor). In other words, I would highly recommend this book for any who dares brave the dangers the Death Lord, the evil of Marhyn, and the magic of the land of Daranor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elderly Reader Pleasantly Surprised by Dreamquest","review":"As a woman of advanced age, I am not into fantasy literature. After seeing commercials for \\"Harry Potter\\" and \\"Lord of the Rings\\", I knew I did not want to see the movies. But since \\"Dreamquest\\" was highly recommended by a friend, I figured I'd better read itWhat a pleasant surprise!It is a very interesting story and as the plot unfolded I found myself wanting to know what was going to happen next, who would live and who would die, and how was it all going to end.I loved the subtle bits of humor that popped up now and then.A very well written book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A heroic adventure","review":"Dreanquest is a fine epic full of colorful characters, drama suspense and action. The fate of the world hinge on the courage of two young men after a mysterious dream sets them on their destined paths. Will they succumb to the evil that wishes to control the forgotten powers of centuries past, and enslave the magical races of Daranor? Or will Tarther and Derlin rise above unconquerable odds and unite the Kingdoms in a final attempt to rid the world of evil?A fluid and witty style set Tarthur and Derlin up on an enchanted ride to greatness. Though they hardly lack in confidence they will need all the support they can get. Elves, merfolk, wizards and the Creator himself have recognized the importance of their quest and make the ultimate sacrifice to insure that Daranor doesn't fall into the shadows.A must read! Dreamquest has everything a fantasy lover needs!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Tori Amos CD","review":"Led Zepplin, The Rolling Stones, Nirvana -- all covered by Tori Amos on one CD, what more do you need to hear. . . as if that isn't reason enough to purchase this album this very moment. . .

Just buy it -- you will see what I mean."},{"rating":"2","title":"really good!","review":"i'm not a diehard tori amos fan, but i have to say this album is great. her voice has a way of making any song sound like a haunting, beautiful masterpiece. it's so poignant that she even has the ability to bring tears to your eyes (just listen to her \\"smells like teen spirit\\"; i almost cried). buy this, you wont regret it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Figures that my courage would choose to sell out now...\\"","review":"Cucify by Tori Amos is a great cd single. This cd also contains three covers: The Rolling Stones beautiful ballad Angie. Led Zepplin's Thank You, and Nirvana's Smells Like Teen Spirit. Tori successfully makes each song her own, this woman is amazingly talented. She plays the piano like no one else and the way she sings these covers gives you chills. Gorgeous and haunting ballads, this is one EP you won't regret getting. Buy it today!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Alot of reviews for just 5 songs...","review":"As a casual fan, the only other Tori Amos disc I own is \\"Under The Pink\\", and I'm not the biggest fan of EP's or CD singles, but these five songs are wonderful. I admit I got this for the covers, and it was my best decision of the week. It's true that \\"Angie\\" (Stones), \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" (Nirvana), and \\"Thank You\\" (Zeppelin) are all done in a very simplistic and beautiful way. These are the kind of covers worth doing in my opinion. Quite moving really. Her own two tracks are just as good I might add, but not a big deal if you own her debut album. I now wait for a full album of covers from her besides \\"Strange Little Girls\\", and it would be fine with me to see these three on there again."},{"rating":"1","title":"save your cash","review":"The three covers are tepid and dull. The two originals are excellent (IMHO, \\"Winter\\" is one of her best songs), but they're available on the full-length *Little Earthquakes*. Pick that up instead. I bought *Crucify* at a swap meet for a dollar, and I'm not sure it was worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre","review":"This EP could have been better. I didn't like Tori's cover of \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\". If you are a Tori Amos fan and would like to hear covers of songs by male artists, then buy \\"Strange Little Girls\\". I do love the song \\"Crucify\\", though."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"i hate when people say that they like someones cover of a song better then the orriginal song, and that there better. they cant be better, the person who wrote it is obvoiusly better at it. Nirvanas smells like teen spirit has angst, passion, and is haunting. sorry people but tory amos didnt get any of this. she got popular from doing a nirvana song, how stupid is that? do your own songs unless your doing a different one for fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"No nirvana covers!","review":"There just aren't enough reasons why nobody, especially Tori Amos, should touch Nirvana's music with a ten foot pole. For the same reasons that nobody covers Stairway to Heaven, or Thriller, likewise should nobody cover Teen Spirit. I don't care how influential the song was in Tori Amos' life, there is nothing more selfish than taking a generation-defining song and making one cent off of it. It is out of respect for the artist and, more importantly, the music that it should be let alone. If Amos had covered the song now, over ten years later, perhaps it would be forgiveable. But Nirvana was still alive and kicking when Crucify was released in 1992, and Amos did nothing but butcher an upcoming classic and steal Cobain's thunder."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Small Treat For Tori Listeners","review":"This EP has two songs on it from \\"Little Earthquakes\\", two classic rock tunes and the Nirvana \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\", which is absolutely haunting. The acoustic version of the three non-LP tracks are fascinating! She needs to put out more like this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Contains very pretty and well done remakes.","review":"If you enjoy covers of famous songs, and you're a Tori fan this is for you. The remix of Crucify is always getting stuck in my head."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mostly for the teen spirit...","review":"I liked this CD, but mostly for Tori's version of \\"Teen Spirit\\".

The are countless books available written by skeptical biblical scholars of such nature. Our society is replete with biblical scholars who don't have axes to grind and are devoted to studying scripture in a scholarly manner. MR. WHELESS IS NOT ONE OF THEM. A judge/lawyer does not a biblical scholar make. So far as I know, N.T. Wright and Marcus Borg don't write books on the U.S. Constitution.Stick with the real scholars, not angry lawyers."},{"rating":"2","title":"A superb legalistic indictment of Christianity -- timeless.","review":"Originally published in 1930, the arguments in this book (using referenced quotations from the defendent (Christianity) to present the case of the prosecution) are timeless. Wheless writes with the clarity of a practiced legal mind, and exposes evidence rarely (if ever before) seen or considered by the duped victims of the subject -- does all the work for you, but you can check the references."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too Hostile for Today","review":"I agree with all of his information and it is vitally needed to counter the sanctimonous powers today; but his style is too hostile and erudite.

The author definately got into the fighter's interior as to why they do what they do. Describes details about the complex relationship between trainer and boxer. William Plummer tries himself a go at the ring by sparring with the best fighter in the gym only to find out that a key ingredient needed to fight is the animal instinct of defeating your opponent and inflicting pain (something he found he did not have, which is something that cannot be said about writing since this man can definately write!). If you want to find out about the inner workings of young men raised in urban areas with little escape from their surroundins except by jail, death or by entering the ring, this book will provide that and much more! Also recomended on boxing are \\"The Sweet Science\\" by A.J.

In this case the answer key has a declension for a different noun than the one in the main text! As an unreliable answer key is fatal for self-study - particularly in an introductory text - I discarded this book and started reading another.

The Mavala Scientifique is an incredible nail hardener- on bare nails or over polish it seems to work well for both.

I installed the Canon security camera on my desktop computer and use it to pan and zoom around -- watching boats, people and the weather -- all for fun. The 22x optical zoom and low light capabilities allowed me to capture a still frame of a cresecent moon with crators visible. Late in the day, images are sillouhetted against the setting sun. There is a button on the controler which allows you to adjust for that, illuminating the immage in the shadow to see details.

The story, which deals with snuff films in Poland is treated as an action/comedy(!), it's impossible to follow and it's shot with the shakiest nausea-inducing hand held camera since Blair Witch. The editing mimics that of a bad rock video, and the result is an indecipherable bomb. On top of that, the DVD mastering is faulty, the picture plays back \\"squeezed\\" as if it had anamorphic processing, but it cannot be unsqueezed with any of the available settings in a DVD player.

The only problem is you need a PAL converter to play the UK sets....BUT ....I found on eBay the 30th anniversary collection from Korea and just received it....at about twice this price...but oh my the package is amazing... a beautiful book....bound like a wedding album...and the movies? The transfers are STUNNING....plus they have bonus interviews , trailers etc....After watching the Korean edition ....I put this set back in and it really made me sick...really poor quality....and for an Icon like Bruce Lee?

Even worse, I suspect that it was known that these tapes were bad before they were shipped to me. Two of the tapes could not even be rewound to play them and all of the tapes had/have a horrible sewer stinch to them.While I will not purchase used VHS tapes again, I will never purchase any product from Morebooks25.AVOID THIS SELLER LIKE THE PLAGUE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Box set lacking","review":"Its a shame that the priveledged company owning the rights to release four of Bruce Lee's movies would not do it correctly. I gave the box set two stars and thats just because Bruce Lee is in it. The dvd's offer no added features. The picture quality in Fists of Fury is awfull! the American 'John Wayne' voice dubbing for Bruce was even worse. I would have rather had the option to read subtitles and hear the original chinese soundtrack.Summary: Don't buy this. I would recommend finding a Chinese release of these movies with a English subtitle or waiting for the set to be re-done, because this set doesn't even begin to match the quality that Bruce Lee deserves."},{"rating":"1","title":"BIG DISAPPOINTMENT-STAY AWAY","review":"This was a big nothing!

But, at least, in their best years the released a lot of classic rock albums, with great tunes that influenced literally hundreds of bands to come.But in the middle eighties, they began to sell out to glam, and the mask was gone: the vanity and greed of Simmons and Stanley became clear for all to see. THat such hard-working and talented musicians became so shallow, it's something almost unbeliavable.This video (now DVD) is a fake from beginning to end, so bad as the newest SECOND COMING. The interviews are terrible, the girls aorund Paul Stanley's swimming pool are just models, most of them porn stars like Candie Evans and Blondi. As for the viedos, there are a handful of good old-ones, but most of them are from the glam phase.This DVD will add aboslutely nothing to you, just to Gene and Paul's pockets."},{"rating":"2","title":"no extra's?!? :-(","review":"Maybe it's a better and clearer view, but it's dissapointing that there are no extra's at all. The clips are OK, but the interviews are really outdated ofcourse. Still nice to see great clips like 'Who Wants To Be Lonely' and 'Tears Are Falling'. Really 80s like songs. Great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to see why anyone would like this video","review":"Where do I start?Low points:1. Make-believe interviews (c'mon guys, real ones are infinitely more interesting).2. Gene and Paul acting like sex-crazed eighth graders.3. Gene and Paul slamming Ace and Peter (especially Ace).4. Gene and Paul acting like buffoons (especially Paul).High points:1. A few minutes of excellent, early concert footage from around 1973 or so.2. Oh, well of course the girls are nice to look at.Conclusion:This video is awful and it was filmed during a time when Kiss was releasing some of the worst music ever. During this period they sounded as if they were trying to compete with Loverboy, or maybe Night Ranger. Don't buy it for the scantily clad young ladies prancing around. There are plenty of videos on that subject and you don't have to sit through Gene and Paul's ego trip."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eager --- To be disappointed","review":"Kiss is a great rock band. It is very difficult to find anything negative to say. Unfortunatly this dvd is an exeption. I saw the music video on t.v. for the live R n R allnight. Exposed was the dvd this version was on.

If an organization is seriously considering moving to a self-directed work team environment, I can see this book being helpful. However, for those who are simply reading the book to expand your own knowledge base, you will most likely find that you will learn little. This book contains little more than common sense solutions that can be reached without investing the time and pain necessary to read the entire book.

Pretend it's 4:00 am. If the boy walks form one tree over to another tree two feet away !POOF! It's 8:00 am. Then you go through the small cut scene where he finds the cave and!POOF! It's all the sudden 11:00 pm and time to go to bed, but there is nowhere to sleep. Other than that, the gameplay is fun, the mini-games are awesome, making tools is fun and hunting is awesome but difficult. Once you get the hang of keeping them alive for several 2 hour days, it gets a lot easier as things begin to float up on shore and other surprises. Hope you can survive long enough to escape, cause it almost made me pull what's left of my hair out."},{"rating":"2","title":"enjoyable but have minor flaws","review":"if u don't know the feel of this game, think castaway meets havest moon. in the begining u can gather coconuts, seaweed, clams to survive. later on you have the ability to fish, hunt, and explore the island that u are stuck on. sounds pretty mundane but just like watering your plants everyday in havest moon, you'll find it enjoyable. near the end u can explore ruins and solve puzzles. and depending on how u finish the game, u can open new modes to play as skye (the girl) and another secret character. (i can't say cuz it will ruined the plot).one minor flaw about this game is the character storage system. there just isn't enough space in your backpack to put everything in. but that isn't enough to spoil the major fun of the game."},{"rating":"2","title":"This game is the king of all gamez!!!!!","review":"This game is extremely awesome! No cheats, but a few glitches here and there, not extremely hard, not too simple. If U R getting a game for someone, U should get this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Refreshing, addictive experience","review":"This game is very much a cross between the hit tv show \\"Lost\\" and \\"The Sims\\". While i will admit that there is a significant learning curve in the beginning of the game, it gets relatively easier as you progress. It is highly addictive as I believe i am about half done with the game and I've had this game for about 2 weeks now. This is a very good addition to an NDS library. I choose this over Castlevania DS, Lunar DS, and Trace Memory, (all of which were released in a week's span) and I am glad i made a good decision. Innovative titles such as this one are what first drew me toward gaming nearly two decades ago."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lost in Blue is great!","review":"I just bought this game and it is very addicting and very fun. However, it takes some practice to master the game, and I'd recommend reading up on a walkthrough.Anyway, Lost in Blue is a survival game in which you must eat, drink and sleep to stay alive. You are on a desert island with only one companion who is blind after your character breaks her glasses.I would DEFINITELY recommend buying this game as it is well worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most original R&B singer since Stevie Wonder!","review":"From the beginning to the end of this record, it is pure music. Of course, you have your ATL skits, but that is part of what makes this record so original. Sleepy gives us what the Five Heartbeats gave us, the ablity to feel the music of the 60's and 70's in the 90's. All of the music flows together so when you listen to it you listen until the last song is done. And if you think you haven't heard Sleepy's before think again. Remember Player's Ball (Outkast), \\"All the player's came from far and wide...\\" He has also been on plenty of other albums which include Society of Soul's Brainchild, which is a must buy if you like Sleep'y Theme."},{"rating":"2","title":"If Sleepy was SMART, he's re-release..","review":"This CD is phenomenal.

I start to play it and the DVR said that the CD was scratched and needed to be cleaned. I took it to a store and they cleaned for $5.00. Brought it home and it did play. There are English subtitles but few and far between. I saw this film on Time Warner ON DEMAND and it had full english titles so that you could understand the film. Very disappointed in this package.

It's a great film and I still would love to own it.Linda Henson"},{"rating":"1","title":"A below par film","review":"I love foreign cinema and bought this film on the back of all the good reviews it garnered. I was bitterly disappointed with it. To my mind the plot was nothing new - the story could have been told in 15 minutes, and the ending was beyond strange. The acting was nothing special."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like an episode of Law and Order","review":"And I dislike Law and Order a lot! I was so looking forward to this film, based on reviews and the plot description, but it really left me cold. The thing I disliked most was the reason the detective figured out who the killer was- he could see it in his eyes! And in a photograph, no less! No surprises here, merely a pedestrian run of the mill, straight-forward detective story, much like one can see on Law and Order. Too bad, because the plot was dynamite. Never thought I'd say this, but this might be the first time an American remake might be better than the original."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"One of the best foreing movies I saw in the last years.

I can say that today Argentina has the best movies in South America."},{"rating":"2","title":"All you would ever want and more.","review":"This is an incredible movie...the type you see once every few years. Although it is a Spanish language film, it is accessible through the English subtitles. It has love, mysteries, murder, and revenge all in a multilayered and complex atmosphere right in Buenos Aires. The Academy got this one dead on...it is exceptional and very attractive for a wide range of audience. The acting is outstanding at all levels but the leads are off the charts. i only hope there are more to come from this amazingly talented group."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Foreign Film","review":"Being a foreign film, unfamiliar with any of the actors and having to rely on subtitles the entire movie, this was a pretty impressive flick. It is well acted and well scripted with some suspenseful and thematic twists and turns. The cinematography is well done; my favorite scene was at the soccer game how the camera just falls from the sky and the subsequent suspenseful footage that ensues. The final scene of the movie was pretty surprising, but made perfect sense when considering that Morales thought this as the ultimate justice, killing Gomez was an easy way out for him and Morales wanted him to live the rest of his life in absolute isolation behind bars. Overall, the acting is convincing and well done, I also like how the storyline is incorporated with flashbacks over the past 25 years while Esposito writes this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A well acted and written film","review":"This film won for Argentina, its second best film award in the foreign film category at the Oscars. This is a tale that spans about twenty years is about love, murder, mystery, revenge and unrequited love. I wished that I could have understood Spanish to truly enjoy this multi-layered film because I think a lot of the dialogue was lost in translation. However, I enjoyed it for the subtle acting by both the leads and the satisfying ending. This movie is like a well written book where the events unfold at their own pace but suddenly the book is over and we want more. I liked the movie but hope to enjoy it again without the help of the subtitles. Three stars 10/4/10"},{"rating":"1","title":"I would love to review this movie","review":"Unfortunately, once again, Amazon stopped streaming this movie just before the end.

Kind of European movies, a little slow and long, but very, very intense. Full of great actors..JJ Campanella is a great film maker ! For movie lovers this movie is a MUST SEE, like the Son of Bride !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb filmaking","review":"It won the Oscar for best foreign film in 2010 and it is well deserved.the story build up, told in two time periods is excellent. The two main characters played by Ricardo Dar��n and Soledad Villamil are very good and with a special mention for their excellent make up, you can see them as young and older and the transformation is good.The basic story is a thriller, a crime committed in the past and never properly closed. This is set in Argentina's troubled times when the secret police is a law unto itself. An innocent victim and deep hurts for the one left alive. The court investigator is left with the unfinished case, the one he cannot leave behind. He decides to write a novel and in doing so starts to do research that will lead him on a different path. Personal relationships and humour also form part of the story and the whole is very strong.A good example of great film making."},{"rating":"2","title":"Silence of the lambs","review":"I agree with all the previous reviewers that this is a superb film, even though my vote for best film of the year would had been for \\"White Ribbon\\".All the same the film is excellent; the actors are a joy to see; direction and photography are top rate. Again, I agree with all the comments about the actors in this film, but one actor that I particularly liked was Pablo Rago as the husband of the murdered woman. He was excellent, especially in the last chilling sequence. Also, I didn't spot a mention on that incredible single-shot sequence in the stadium. A combination of Orson Welles with Alfred Hitchcock as the camera moves from an aerial view of the stadium to the single spectator not following the football game.The most intriguing aspect of the film comes at that final sequence where all the moral dilemmas of crime, punishment, revenge, right, wrong, etc etc come to a head without any easy or moralistic talk from the filmmakers.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glad i watched it","review":"It has been a long time since I've seen such a fantastic movie.

But the longer it rolls the more promising it becomes. Somehow it is very personal and intimate.

While MSBP may occur in very rare cases, the rash of \\"diagnoses\\" (100 to 200 by a pediatrician, Kenneth Feldman, in Seattle alone)is not supported by scientific research.

The selections on this album are the signature songs. So what's the problem? In one word, it is the sound. This recording is like listening to someone holding up a cell phone at a concert. I get the impression that something wonderful is going on, but the quality of the recording is literally unlistenable. I tried playing it loud; I tried playing it soft. It was so garbled and tinny that listening was an excercise in frustration.If you want to delve into the Fairport Convention, this is not the recording for you. They call it the Woodworm Archives.

What I recieved was the opposite of what I was expecting. He sent me a alarm that was manufactured in 2000. He said had been in his garage that is why the packaging was yellow. I contacted the seller and told him how disgusted I was at what I had been sold for $26.00. He told me that I got what was promised which is a lie. He told me that I was threating him and that I should not leave a review because I was going to get in trouble. Don't be fooled stay away from this seller. He would not reimburse me. You cannot list an item as new if it has been sitting on the shelf for 10 years. You have to tell the buyer that it is 10 years old but never used. He wrote me an essay at why he wouldnt refund the money. The alarm is no good because it has a shelf life of 7 years.

The fact that they don't include Bara or Kira was confusing to me, but I was more than happy to settle with the main Rozen Maidens. They aren't as high quality as I thought they would be (or that the picture made it seem.) One bad thing about them though, is that if you put all of them on one keychain (which is what I first did when I recieved them) it becomes very bulky and difficult to do anything with. At the most you could have 2, maybe 3 on a single keychain. But since I can't have all of them on one keychain I simply make due with lining them up on my table. Like I said, it's a must have if you love Rozen Maiden, but just don't expect perfection like if you really had the dolls in your possession. :p"},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy this","review":"Are you kidding me?

What a wonderful book! You really need to read the first book in the series first. Once and again, that is great also. Gabe and Jordan are 2 of the 4 Buckhorn brothers who are all single and are little by little finding love and getting married. It makes you wish you were the lucky girl, Let me tell you these guys seem to good to be true. Gabe's story is the first half of the book and he is the one who always has girls hanging all over him and he plays it up until one girl comes to interview him for a heroic thing he did and he falls head over heels.. read the book to find out more. Jordan is the more laid back one with the voice that would melt any girls heart, he is a vet who loves animals and is against drinking and driving.

The scenery is stunning, especially on the Rhine River. Being a sucker for a river cruise and having a history for enjoying the travel videos of Rick Steves & Rudy - also out of Seattle, I found George Bauer's narrative style familiar - although elitist. At 41 years old, I would love to join one of these cruises sometime. Probably will as the cultural and excursion programs seem boundless. However, based on the narrative, one might think the producers of this video and the current clientele may be more comfortable without younger company. On the other hand, perhaps the passengers would love to have that variety of middle-agers to spice it up a bit.

Naturally, L.D. Brown may or may not be telling the truth. However, the documentation and witnesses that are continually coming out of the woodwork as this President's term draws to a close are beginning to tell an eeringly similar story. Not too may contradictions here, folks. As L.D. Brown has submitted - if anything is untrue, he is more than willing to accept the evidence to the contrary.

D. Brown knew these people and found as many others have that they aren't concerned about anything except self. Mr. Brown just doesn't make supportable claims about things such as Mena. Part of the problem in the book is that no editor is mentioned nor was one used. Beyond cleaning up very bad grammar, a good editor might have helped Mr. Brown clarify his points.There is a wonderful portrayal of a dinner with Senator Al D'Amato that is worth the price of the book. By doing this tiny, inciteful piece I have to conclude that Mr. Brown just didn't have the same sort of ammunition on the Clintons. Alas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty much no adhesive - poor quality control","review":"It's very strange but the first roll and part of the second roll worked great.

No. They're all that way!And now my \\"return window\\" has passed.I thought Scotch was a reliable brand, and has been before now, but this was a major disappointment. If it actually were sticky, it might be good tape. It is certainly tougher than the stuff I usually get that frustratingly splinters into tiny little pieces when you try to get it started.

But when it arrived, and I started using it, I was perplexed because the tape would NOT STICK to the box I was sealing. It would not stick at all! I thought there was another layer of something that I should have peeled before applying the tape so I looked as closely as I could at the tape, re-read the simple instructions for how to use it, but with no luck. I unrolled an entire roll of tape but NONE of it would stick. In fact, it wouldn't even stick to itself! So I came back on Amazon and immediately noticed that the last handful of reviews (all submitted in 2011) are reporting the same thing.THIS PRODUCT IS CURRENTLY DEFECTIVE. Clearly many bad batches have been made. Until Scotch gets this product right, AVOID it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Batch -- Tape Does Not Stick","review":"Bought received this item this month, December 2011, and still get a batch with non-sticky tape.

I don't know if this tape is old, or it if was not kept in proper conditions, but it's definitely not not as good as the same exact tape I've purchased in stores.

I mean, honestly, when was the last time you felt the need to read reviews of packing tape? Would you ever expect companies like Scotch or 3M to put out shoddy products? Heck no. So, I am happy to oblige, as silly as it makes me feel to actually type things like: \\"This is a fine, high-quality tape. Perhaps the best I've used. Sticky, thick, tough, goes on fairly easily, and is extremely clear.\\" Funny thing is, it's all true. But did anyone actually read this review?I'm going to give it 4.5 stars. The minor deduction being from the fact that it's not sticky enough to hold your bumper on to your beat up old Tercel. Several people complained about the stickiness. Sure, it's not duct tape, but it's not supposed to be.

It actually feels like the forgot to add the tape part of the tape. Silly me, I didn't look at the reviews before buying this. I always do, but this time, I didn't because it was just tape. The same brand I buy all of the time. Except this time, I bought something that they claimed was tape, but a three year old's fingers are stickier than this. Water woud do a better job than this garbage. That's $$ down the drain. What am I supposed to do with six rolls of tape that can't perform the one task its supposed to? Negative 11 stars for this thing. That's one negative for every dollar I spent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not stick - Defective","review":"I bought a box of six rolls in early 2011 and used one roll then which worked fine. Last month I had finished that roll and needed to start another. I found all the other five rolls in the box had completely lost their adhesive power. They simply would not stick at all. I threw them out. In future I will just have to buy rolls as I need them at the local hardware store.I should add that I have used this product before and it has always performed well, except for this one box.PS: After posting this review I phoned 3M Company and reported the problem. They are going to send me five replacement rolls with no hassle. Good for them!PPS: So now the replacement rolls have arrived from 3M Company.

If you are a true fan, you may find some gems, but this is not worth the $$$ to spend to find them. The concert footage is primarily from Munich 1983. Not a very flattering performance at all. The band looked tired and almost physically unable to perform. I have seen their live performances and I have seen 10x better than this! Why not compile their best stuff?If you are a fan of BOA and prior, this is not for you. Most of it is the post BOA Rick Davies new stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Supertramp deserves a better DVD Production","review":"This DVD is worth just because is the only one available from this all time great band (IMHO).

You have two options: PCM or Dolby 2.0, but don't worry, they are terrible too. The production is poor also. They simply put some clips from two decade ago in a roll. This DVD is a joke, just a way to get some money from Supertramp fans, but, Like one, I had to buy it. If you're a Supertramp fan, go ahead, it's Supertramp anyway. If you just think about buy this DVD without be a fan, stay away, you could take a bad impression about this great band."},{"rating":"2","title":"supertramp - story so far","review":"very good vintage footage of gigs, some of the newer videos and excellent interview viewing. great gift for any fan...new or old!"},{"rating":"1","title":"supertrash","review":"quick! go straight to \\"give a little bit\\" and sit back and enjoy the show. you'll feel like you're part of the crowd. the only problem is, you're in the back row, and all you can hear is clapping. i can't believe how loud this is. it completly drowns out the vocals. this goes on through almost every song. it's nice to know that the fans really enjoyed themselves at the show, but for home entertainment, this just doesn't work. supertramp might not be a household name, but they've got enough hits captured in this 1983 concert to fill a superdvd. supertramp deserves better, and so do we. i blame UNIVERSAL MUSIC & VIDEO and A&M RECORDS for not taking this product seriously. also, the extras feel like they were collected off the floor of VH1 BEHIND THE MUSIC. if you're a true supertramp fan, stick with the VHS version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring Waste of Money","review":"I loved Supertramp but feel they could have done better than this offering.

She doesn't bring a list of theological preconceptions or doctrinal preconditions to her relationship with reform, conservative, orthodox, and even hasidic Jews. That a person can actually come closer to God in a faith tradition other than her own is perhaps the central lesson of her book and one that more people would do well to emulate."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Baptist Among the Jews","review":"A very interesting and informative insight into the Jewish people and their religion and traditions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disarming passion...","review":"With the disarming passion of a neophyte (but withoutleaving her own faith behind), Howe plunges into therich world of traditional Judaism, emerging withjewels from which all of us can profit: a profoundsense of God's holiness, an insatiable hunger for andlove of God's Word, and an understanding of theimportance of ritual and community.

But, is that really the fault of a few political leaders or is it due to the money of lobbyists who are taking control from the general public. I believe that Whitman's arguments are sound; not only for politics but for any group working together for a common goal. You must come together and compromise in order to get the best possible for the group. We cannot let power hungry players make the choices because they will end up moving the group to the extreme.

I too, share Whitman's frustration at seeing my party overtaken by the extremist wing. So I expected to read a war plan outlining strategies to achieve a more balanced centrist party. What a disappointment. This book is more memoir than politcal stategy roadmap. And Whitman's constant admissions that she was \\"taken aback, \\"stunned and shocked\\" at reactions from political opponents only serves to demonstrate how naive she is and undermines her political gravitas. The droning on and on about the environment put me to sleep, her assertion that the GOP must reach out to miniorites was quite \\"shocking\\" to me. Christie, tell me something I don't know.

After all, if Christie Todd Whitman were indeed a moderate, she wouldn't be blaming the so-called \\"LIBERAL MEDIA\\" while at the same time saying nothing about the current righwing propaganda on the radio and tv and the rest of the media. In fact, she praises Rush Limbaugh and Fox News as trustworthy fair and balanced independents when in fact, they're not. Throughout the book, Whitman lies about being afraid of supporting an extreme conservative such as say Barry Goldwater or Ronald Reagan or George W. Bush. Yet, when push comes to shove, she's another partisan hack in wholeheartedly defending these extremists. Go ahead, Ms. Whitman, and cry all you want to.

Goes through batteries pretty fast. The recharge time between pictures sometimes causes me to miss another good shot. Takes way too much time between pressing shutter button and taking the picture. I just thought this was normal for digital cameras till I began reading later reviews. Then I accidentally dropped the camera onto a soft surface (loose dirt and sawdust)and now the lens is stuck most of the way out and will not retract and camera will not come on. Contacted HP to get it fix but will cost close to $100 and they will just send a reconditioned one.

Shortly afterward, her screen blacked out, without any great impact or weather damage.Naturally, I assumed it mustve gotten bumped in the wrong way, tough luck. I then proceeded to buy one for myself, and a couple of months after I had it, my screen also inexplicably failed to work.And then for Christmas, my sister received a replacement camera for her broken one, and yet again, shortly after purchase, the screen was broken.I do accept some responsibility for the damage, I imagine that if it was in a purse in a bookbag, perhaps it got rattled around a bit.

Well, Jimi's whole Monterey performance is presented here with those annoying black-bars and either side of my HD wide-screen tv. Trust me, it's not the settings on my tv.

The seller( Wholesalecables ) says it is most likely a problem with the port on the equipment which is unlikely because they worked fine before connecting to this switch.

This happens once every few minutes on the PS3 and even more when watching TV.I've tested the cables individually and they all work fine.Also, several times when i have touched the case of the unit there has been some sort of static electrical discharge that causes the HD reciever to flip out and power cycle itself...I'm not electrician, but that can't be good for the equipment...So, it works with lots of problems, one star may be a little harsh, if it did'nt short out and reset the cable box it would probably still only get two.

They see a lot of landscapes and havea couple encounters with poorly described little furry creatures. And that's about it. Yes, the central problem with this book is that it lacks purpose. Although billed as a story about self-discovery, none of the main characters really catch your attention. As far as imagination goes, this book is seriously lacking. It's just too long and boring to justify reading it, despite one decent action sequence.I might say that Engh's dialogue is wooden, but I don't want to insult wood.

At first sight everything looked somewhat unexciting. But I am now making three sweaters from it. So first appearances can be deceiving. One good thing about this book is the large variety of sizes. Models too. They're all attractive but they're real looking women - not skinny teenagers. That's a touch I like!

I have the feeling that I will read this work several more times with increasing enjoyment."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Abides","review":"I finished The Gate of Angels more than two weeks ago and still think about it every day. Perhaps it was simply that the finale to Lost's generally disappointing fifth season coincided with my reading of Gate, but the two feel like cross-media cousins. There is the struggle between two characters, one of faith and one of science, and the occasional glimmer of each into the other's world. There is a landscape of ghosts and strange histories. And there is the open-ended last scene, in Lost's case to lead you into next season, in Gate's case (with me at least) to lead you into the future the book leaves unresolved.In the short space of 167 pages, Penelope Lively recreates 1912 as if she lived it, develops characters that breathe -- and not just the couple whose bicycles and lives collide --, and weaves a mystery that is both specific and universal. She's a great writer and this is a fine, rightly praised novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"no, no, no, not even close","review":"Fitzgerald has a very quirky style. And the thing about quirky, too easily it becomes cute. It's a fine line, like a Gary Larsen cartoon that just misses. (Is that why he quit?)

This book is awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"A real disappointment","review":"Penelope Lively's The Gate of Angels [nominated for the Booker Prize in 1990] was a disappointment. The basic plot device is a bicycle collision between a fellow at Cambridge's St. Angelicus College and a young woman, Daisy, of an uncertain past.

The picture clarity, delay in audio/video signal, interference or green/blue clusters in picture, short range (no where near 600 ft, more like 100 ft), appearance of volume bars in place of child when adjusting volume, and frequent loss of \\"pairing\\" between monitor unit and parent unit.... all made this a frustrating purchase and effort, especially for $200.Dan"},{"rating":"1","title":"Digital picture did not look great.","review":"I liked the compact design of this monitor, but unfortunately the reception was not great. I had some type of intereference every 2 minutes or so. I could see 'pixels' on the screen and in some cases over half of the screen was just blue or black when the monitor was looking for a signal (all over the house). This used to happen with digital cable when it was new I remember. When the picture did come in, the quality of it reminded me of watching a movie on the internet. Quick movements were choppy and there seemed to be a 2 second delay. That also meant when our baby cried, I heard the real cry and then heard the cry on the monitor echo 2 seconds later (and then again and again at lower volumes). It is also a little annoying that when you higher or lower the volume, the picture shuts off and has to find a signal again which takes a few seconds. Overall, I expected a much clearer picture from a monitor that uses digital technology and was this expensive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good","review":"We bought this monitor four mos. ago and it's not that great for what we paid.

Since I am a sci-fi fan first thing I will comment on is special effects. As you know the previous seasons effects were good, but not as they should have been, the detail was lacking and a lot of shots were recycled. This season the effects definitely improved, a lot more definition to details, better realism, amazing space battles. The story has also improved considerably, they were interesting, had good continuation, made you think and be entertained at the same time. Overall every part of the show stepped up quite a few notches. So if you got through the first 3 seasons and have decided not to watch the rest, you are making a mistake.

After they came on the scene, the romance was really almost like an after thought.I would not recommend this book or buy another work by this writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"I am thoroughly satisfied with this controller! It was worth the price, on account most controllers cost quite a bit. I got it within three days, which was awesome, considering I thought it'd take a week or so to get it. The only thing that made me question the seller was the way the controller was packaged. The controller itself was wrapped in plastic wrap, and then in paper. But, it was used, and it works great! Creative way of shipping a product without the box! I would definitely recommend buying anything from this seller!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Outside good, inside not very good","review":"The control came sealed, but brings some problems.

I have two controllers, both wireless, but only have one battery charger for one controller. But this controller is nice, you can turn it on/off from the controller! And it has a big range so you can be far away from it. Plus no wire tangling trouble which I had alot with the Xbox 1. This is a good controller and worth the price, pick it up!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great but it came very dirty.","review":"The product came in good shape but it was really dirty. It worked perfectly however like I said it was really dirty. I had to take some household cleaning agents to clean it. It had some gunk between and on the buttons and triggers but it plays like new. I only say this because I payed a few extra bucks for it because it said that the item is in like new shape. After cleaning it. It looks practically new. Happy about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One extremely fragile controller.","review":"Whatever you do, don't drop this thing. Its awesome playing without a wire, but once you drop it you may be annoyed with the aftermath. A button becomes stuck, your player in the game moves on its own, and other things that could happen after it has been dropped. So just a warning: be extremely careful and don't endure the amount of time I have had with a semi broken controller. Mine still work, just not the way it should."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Xbox 360 Peripheral","review":"I love this wireless controller. The wireless system works great, and you never have to worry about unplugging the controller again! This is a huge improvement to me over the old controllers.

It makes gaming much more relaxed and fun considering the lack of wires."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"The seller stated that the controllers were new.

There is one small problem, unlike the PS3 controllers, they do not have a built in Lithium ion rechargeable battery which is a serious problem. I wish Microsoft had been less cheap and made that an included feature on their controllers rather than a separate thing you must buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing special, nothing bad neither","review":"Just the same wireless controller that comes with ur xbox360. Range is pretty good, I never thought having a wired controller was annoying until i got the xbox360 with wireless controllers. If you have this definitely pick up the rechargeable battery packs along with it as well as the quick-charge kit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wireless is the new way!","review":"This controller is great, and the fact that it is wireless means that it can work almost anywhere. There are no cords to tangle or get in your way. The guide button also works to turn on the console wirelessly.A good thing about this controller is that it can be used to turn on the Xbox 360. By pressing the guide button, the wireless controller sends a signal that turns on the console. This means that you don't even have to get up to turn on the Xbox 360, making it great for lazy people!(just kidding)The only bad thing about this controller is that it never is really turned off. Even when it is not being used, the \\"player one\\" light on the \\"ring of light\\" glows faintly. This greatly reduces the battery life if you do not disconnect the battery pack. It is not all that bad, but it is stupid that the battery pack can become depleted even if you don't use it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A superb controller","review":"I really feel Microsoft has done a great job with this pad. After the original XBox controller that felt like it was made backwards this one feels great. The buttons are placed right and it fits well in your hands. Generally I would say it's a toss up between the PS3 and 360 control. They both do the job right. The trigger buttons feel placed well and even the analog sticks are in a good place. This paddle also gets excellent range without loosing it's signal. My only qualm is personal. My experience after playing long hours is that right hand gets a little tight from gripping the control pad. I am sure most people feel just fine gripping this pad. Make sure you get a rechargable batterey pack so you don't spend a fortune on batteries. This pad is obviously a must have for anyone with a 360."},{"rating":"2","title":"no more tripping and clutterness","review":"i bought the wireless controller because i was tried of wrapping and twisting the cables on the controller up, getting tangled up with other things, and never reaching where i wanted to sit. the controller is versaltile and can be used as a wired remote when batteries are dead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Controller","review":"Over all the controller worked well the batteries it comes with didnt last long though that was the only problem with the controller."},{"rating":"2","title":"Got it for my nephew","review":"He was so excited to open this and now has additional controllers for his Xbox.

In a field still not widely researched, this book offers a revealing glimpse into the \\"hows\\" and \\"whys\\" of communicating with spirits. Information gleaned from interviews of some of today's most respected mediums - coupled with historical facts about personalities of a bygone era - combine to make the book very readable. Yet its insights challenge the reader to examine how spiritualism fits into his or her own belief system. It's well worth reading, for both those experienced in the metaphysical and those who are just beginning a spiritual journey."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book I would recommend","review":"This is a wonderful book for personal and spiritual development!

I apologetically lent it to a younger student of mine who was studying for the ISEE and SSAT, but you can't fool a middle school student, either, it seems.On the plus side, the vocab lists and exercises can be a good supplement to other vocab drills, and the \\"graffitti wall\\" is perhaps a clever idea, but again, probably will be scorned by today's teens."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a Great read","review":"\\"Until Angels Close My Eyes\\" was one of the most emotional books I have read.

This is fine except for the fact that they are poorly written, have no style, just cranked out (as the Beatles put it, \\"just another paperback writer\\"). I have to admit, that this last book is much better than the other two because there is some (not much) but some substance and style to it. Still, there is one thing that offends me as a feminist a Jew and a woman.

Since it consumes considerable amount of power, it goes to standby mode quickly and then, when you power it up, it is very slow to get signals. Its rather bulky antenna is not doing much good since it does not have strong reception at all.

They tell stories, give advice and even call out threats to those who oppose their Sac-town regime. All in all, producer Messy Marv keeps is gangsta and throws together some DOPE beats with that West Coast flava, while at the same time keeping it real, underground, and straight from the streets. Without a shadow of a doubt, the freshest tracks are \\"Connecto,\\" \\"Stello of a Hustla,\\" and \\"They Ain't Got Cha Back.\\" No doubt, this is one of the grittier heat-makers to hit the streets in awhile, so go cop it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Rezurecxtun of what?","review":"By the way \\"Rezurecxtun\\" is spelled, you can already tell that this album is going to be ghetto. I listen to all sorts of music, but with gangsta rap, and it's not easy to sit there and listen to a bunch of guys babble on about who they hate, and who they want to kill. To sum things up quickly, that is what this album has in it. Sac-Sin presents a lyrical massacre of violence, death threats, and gritty storytelling about being a gangsta in Sacramento (I guess it must be tough being Sac-Sin since he is \\"Mr. Sacramento\\"...hahaha, please). Anyway, what kept me from giving this album 1 star is the fact that it actually has some pretty fresh beats composed by Messy Marv (another \\"real gangsta from the streets\\"). Nonetheless, this album is full of violence, cursing, and threats...my solution, watch episodes of Jerry Springer or Cops and you'll save yourself some money."},{"rating":"2","title":"All This Talk of a Wonderful CD","review":"The Rockwells are back and better than ever with a harmonic convergence of several musical styles.

Unfortunately it doesn't work in the book which did not keep my attention well. It tends to drone on with mild distraction and unsatisfying end.

The American lady, Ruth, who is in town researching a history of the women who loved Hemingway, in her travels finds a chair that had belonged to Hemingway himself. Love (or what is imagined to be love)... lost Love (or shared interest, which should be the base of love) found. Shady dealings. A bit of blackmail. And the chair... is it haunted? Does it contain a ghost? Is Martin delusional? All of the above or none of the above? The reader will have to decide. No matter what the reader decides, s/he should find the book charming in its honesty and realism -- and perhaps, like I do, may discover a desire to read \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"And now for something completely different...","review":"I liked this book from the picture on the cover to the ending. The characters were well-developed, and the book held my interest. Who wouldn't like an assistant postal manager convinced that by replicating Hemingway's milieu in his bedroom that he could write. Martin is an endearing character and I was rooting for him from the start. A remarkable first fiction effort by Michael Palin. When I reached the last page, I felt like shouting HOORAY out loud."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, a must read for any book lover.","review":"I have always liked Michael Palin (on TV and in movies), this is the first book I have read by him and enjoyed every page.

Elaine who adores him in the beginning come to love the new postmanager Nick Marshall for his good ideas and plans. But who is betraying who here? Nick sells the postoffice in order to start his telecommunication-business. I will focus on Martin who lives in the shoes of HEMINGWAY,the great artist. when reading the end I get captured by the strong emotions martin create from being two personalties. Not only do I feel captured in the end, but also through-out the whole book. The chair martin gets which is vital to the whole story symbolises to me, strenght of life, but also death. when I sit in my Hemingwaychair I feel special after reading this book. I also loved the good humour which the fiction offers."},{"rating":"2","title":"A gentle and quirky book with a lot to love","review":"Palin was always the \\"lamb\\" of the Pythons, more quiet humor than the in-your-face bomastics of Chapman or Cleese, and it shows in this winning 1st novel. Centered on a \\"rite of passage\\" of one Martin Sproale - mild Postal worker and closet Hemingway buff. As an outsider comes in and turns his world (centered around the post office) wonk, Martin turns to an American Hemingway scholar and evokes the spirit for himself. Charming as can be (and even laugh out loud funny), one senses the real Palin throughout these pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh for another 50 pages","review":"I will admit I was in love with the story right up to the ending. The one fault was the very brief conclusion to the story. Without giving too much away, I would have liked to have seen a better interaction between the hero, Martin, and the American. A simple letter with a newspaper caption left me wanting more closure between the two characters. But alas, instead I am left with a hollow vacuum, wondering what happended between the two characters after the novel had ended. If it was Palin's decision to leave that tale up to the imagination of the reader, then so be it.Great characterization from the leads to the most insignificant. Palin continues to be the quiet genious of the Python writers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Summertime Read","review":"I've been buying copies of this to hand out to friends in search of a good summertime read. It's wonderful fun, and I can almost picture it as the movie it deserves to be.They should stock this at the Hemingway House in Key West, but they don't. Instead, create a bit of fun for yourself.

You won't regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing started off well-went nowhere.","review":"This book started off well, then took so long to get anywhere, by the time that it did I didn't care any more! Palin's quirky humour has been put to much better use. Several of the early characters were abandoned, and I struggled to stay with the book... to the rather disappointing end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snoozer","review":"Palin turns a nice phrase a few -- and I do mean few -- times in ways that remind you of his wonderful wit, but overall this is a pretty simplistic plot-driven story with a fairly uninteresting plot and characters that don't hold your attention for a moment after you put the book down. Put another way, for the last 80 pages the only thing I felt was an earnest (no pun intended) desire to be done with the book so I could move on to something else -- hardly a good sign."},{"rating":"2","title":"I only wish it was longer","review":"I was hesitant when I first picked up this book - although I'm a fan of Palin's Ptyhon work, I wasn't sure that I was ready to read that vein of comedy in a novel. However, I needn't have worried - Palin's writing is engaging, and with \\"Hemingway's Chair\\" he has created a cast of characters that *breathe*.I fell into this book from the start, and the imagery that Palin brings forth is fresh; the plot one that I found hard to resist, despite it being partly centred around a writer I have no interest in, or knowledge of. However, Palin's characters carry the story along honestly, and interact with each other believably.If you enjoy witty, enjoyable fiction, especially that which carries an strong English feel to it, then you cannot and MUST not pass up this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Done up like a dog's dinner","review":"I have long enjoyed Michael Palin as an actor, comedian and world traveller. I was not expecting much from him as a novelist, however, thinking he would be predictably zany and lightweight.It was a very pleasant surprise to find a book about ordinary people with secret lives -- a topic that always hooks me.Very well written, with British characters that ring true to my experiences in England, I truly enjoyed this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this bag.","review":"The best carry-on I've had.

All fans of the Rawhide series should see this movie! The story is great and the entire movie is superior to a lot of movies they are making today (2004) because there weren't a lot of special effects so they focused more of character development and storyline. The issues of morality and the bold interactions in this film are simliar to those seen in the Rawhide series. A lot of classis old west confrontations in this movie. This should be on DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"A vampire rides tall in the saddle.","review":"Altho not a good film, this effort from the very end of Universal's SF/horror cycle deserves a footnote for establishing, more or less, the minor sub-genre of the horror western. (There actually had been a few films in the Thirties which fit into this category, but they were forgotten by virtually everyone until being released on home video.) Michael Pate (a sort of sinister James Coburn) is effective in the role of a vampire menacing folks on a ranch. This particular vampire is perfectly capable of walking around in the sunshine (hey, no fair!) and the fact that the climactic destruction of the vampire takes place in broad daylight greatly lessens the film's effect. Worth a look for horror fans, however."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vampires in the Wild West","review":"I saw this film, when my town had SciFi Channel free for 10 days in January.

So, it was disconcerting to me to find myself pulling for the main character in this mystery/family drama that spans two families and many states.I enjoyed the vivid descriptions that the author provided, especially of the flowers and fauna. Carl must be an avid gardener.I found the relationships believable, the characters complex and the read a mini thrill ride.

It's a great story, and I have gained even more respect for Leguizamo... It's great to see him in a small budget made for HBO film. It just proves that he acts for the joy of acting, not money. If you like John Leguizamo or great plots and great acting, this movie is for you.

The book is packed with information, from repertoire (catagorized by instruments and/or accompanying ensemble) to information about equipment or biographies of well known players and instructors. Looking for a concerto other than the Vaughn-Williams? Then, this book is for you. It is also helpful with writing program notes. There is also a listing of disertation subjects.

If you enjoy \\"Progressive\\" or \\"New Age Rock\\", then you'll will not be disappointed by this CD. It is simply one of the best \\"Alternative\\" rock and \\"Ambient\\" rock albums of the last 10 years. It has been described by many as: \\"A masterpiece\\", \\"The coolest thing on progressive rock\\", \\"A solid work of ambient rock\\", \\"Takes your imagination on a musical roller coaster\\", \\"The best instrumental album of the year, if not the entire decade\\".....from some of the most influential critics in music today.

If not, your library is not complete."},{"rating":"1","title":"This aint Nazisploitation","review":"This is a thick chick who masturbates like 7x throughout the movie.

What would the early 80's have been without \\"Bad Reputation\\", \\"Fake Friends\\" and \\"I Love Rock and Roll\\"? JJ and the Blackhearts were rock at its core with some bad chick image. I held back one star because there is plenty of blank space left on this disc and with so many excellent tunes to choose from, why couldn't we have more? If you need examples, I would have considered the following: \\"Nag\\", \\"You Don't Know What You've Got\\", \\"Bits and Pieces\\" and maybe \\"Jezebel\\". There are some covers included on this compilation but many fun covers were left off, like \\"Star Star\\", \\"Tossin' and Turnin\\", \\"Hanky Panky\\" and \\"Summertime Blues\\".

But the pinky and ringer finger, which are not exposed, have serious problems. When you put your hand in and get a secure fit, it feels like your pinky and ring fingers are pushing against something on the inside of the glove.

British veteran Michael Gough, British cutie Judy Geeson in her film debut and the handsome and heroic Ty Hardin are all on hand. It's a great film for Halloween season.

This isn't one of them. It does have the ludicrous advantage of Crawford walking around in skin-tight slacks and being made love to by a guy who, compared to her chronologically, is a fetus. But there are far too few gruesome murders (the only reason my friends and I wanted to see it back then to begin with), and the movie is actually padded with way too many legitimate circus acts, so many that you begin to feel really ripped off.

Their first four albums were some of the best heavy metal of the time, but their second & third albums \\"Narita\\" and \\"Fire Down Under\\" were landmark recordings. If you want to experience some extraordinary hard rock, pick up these two albums.This was a great era in rock history: the late 70's/early 80's hard rock. Before we had all digital effects and before the studio engineers destroyed albums with extreme reverb and loud drums drowning out the rest of the band, there was this short period of just plain great hard rock, not too over-produced. Riot was one of the best in that genre. Seems like they were only known in certain circles, and I would have never heard of them had it not been for a guitarist I knew who had their albums.

His insight into the people and the times are so candid that he frequently wound up in more trouble than a prisoner of war. He bought a terrier, Felix, in 1939 and detailed its exploits until its death in 1942. His future wife wrote from Athens Greece during the Nazi occupation, \\"it is a good think you did not leave Felix with us. He would have starved to death.\\" More likely he would have been eaten.Cy tells of his interviews with Tito, Churchill and his futile efforts to interview Stalin.

That book was the new Thomas Friedman polemic. I was going to read it but, as I am a student, could not afford to invest my time in its hundreds pages length. So instead I turned to Neal Pollack's Beneath the Axis of Evil. He, Neal Pollack, is surely the only man who can make brutal regimes, war, and other stuff like that funny. And believe me, he makes them very funny, indeed.And in these trying times of duct tape and gas masks, surely its economical length is a benefit.

They take the fun out of travel and have very few photos.This book is different. Here they came up with something very useful and novel for the traveller. When you go on a cruise normally you do not have a clue. You just follow what your travel agent recommmends. But anyone that has taken an extended cruise or two knows there are big differences betweeen boat lines and routes etc.( I like Holland America myself). So here is a nice review of what boats and crusies are available, it describes the boats, and where they go and what you can expect including on board entertainment.

Boy was I wrong! A little while later, I looked down at the page number and realized I was on page 76, by then I was too far gone to stop reading! This is a great story. It will tug at your heart. I am so impressed with how the author pulled off so much story in such a short book. (I say short as in it's probably a 5X7 in size, even though there are 300 pages. It really only takes a few hours to read.) Each chapter begins with a short entry or quote from Mark's Diary. The story goes along with what is going on, and then you'll hit a chapter that will take you back in one of the character's past. It's all woven together beautifully.I hope you'll read this book and after you do, I'm sure the story will stay with you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rick Evans Latest Novel A Winner","review":"Finding Noel grabbed my attention from the very first chapter.

You cannot put the book down once you start it...a rare quality for novels of this type.If you have never a novel by Rick Evans, this book would be a great place to start.

Not only are they great musicians/entertainers, but they are unashamedly ministers first and foremost. I only wish that they had some additional \\"behind the scenes\\" footage.

It is. The very title is. And when you watch it you will know why. There is no hiding it, and the very words presented from the Koran and Hadith are there to testify to it. The very words of the Imans and believers are there to testify to it. Not once are the claims refuted, because they are backed by the very word and history of Islam.

This is nothing but a web of lies, exaggerations and theories presented to display Muslims as blood thirsty animals to justify what the West is doing to Muslim countries. This ideology is shared by some Muslims- the inhumane terrorists that refer to Quranic verses based on completly different events and situations to satisy their own means. That group also represents 2% of the entire Muslim population. Just as the Christians crusaders killed with no mercy, just like some Christian sects believe that a man needs to marry as many women as he can to enter Heaven, and just like some Israeli Jews kill children without a blink, there are some messed up people of ALL religions- not just Islam.

More than the negative comments of the scholars, the lack of opposite scholars is disturbing. They colected scholars that are all on the one side, and all of them without an exception have either misunderstood the message of Quran and the prophet or they intentionally divert the message. It would be more convincing if they have brought at least one scholar that could answer the allegations. They sometimes take a verse, without referring to the context of it, skipping the previous two verses that is essential in understanding it. If you have prejudices about islam and want to reinforce them, buy, otherwise buy something at least more objective."},{"rating":"1","title":"Carefully Constructed Hate-fest","review":"This movie is awful! It's sole purpose is to bash Islam, to paint the religion in a negative light without ever examining all the dark early traditions of the Christian or Jewish faiths. It's cheaply made, dull, and is supposed to look authentic by featuring some constipated director of an organization no one has ever heard of and some geeky, self-important webmaster of very questionable authority or expertise. They even hauled out an fat ex-terrorist who is supposed to be a legitimate source of 'inside' information, and he is... if you want to know about terrorists. But if you want to know about the Islamic religion, don't waste your time on this hateful trash. Unbelievable that Amazon would even hock this type of film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Selective Memory","review":"This piece attempts to pick various verses in the Qur'an and decontextualize events to prove the predetermined notion that Islam is fundamentally backwards and violent. It does a great job of fooling those who have not had the opportunity to travel to see how Muslims live, study what Islam is, and it successfully and irresponsibly scares the common viewer into hating 20% of the world's population.

It appears to be an honest attempt to catalog historical Muslim beliefs in a context that Westerners can comprehend. That said, taken at face value, the information presented is indeed disturbing.

It's almost like he's writing these short stories in order to keep his SF Writer's Club membership card active or something."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh Bruce Sterling, what happened to you?","review":"I have thoroughly enjoyed most of Sterling's past works, but this compilation of short stories was just awful. Starting with the pretentious title (why not just name it \\"Genius Author\\" or \\"I am a Brilliant Wordsmith\\"), every page I turned left me more aghast. Most of the stories read like the rough draft a college freshman would turn in for his first creative writing course. The sheer silliness of Luciferase made me put the book down for three days. The quality of these stories makes me think that Sterling needed quick money for a down payment on a new car."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very comfortable and sexy too!","review":"If you're a man looking for a practical thong that you can wear all day, this is it. I know a lot of people feel that thongs should only be worn by women, but for a guy, nothing looks better under a well-fitted pair of jeans, and they feel great.However, never forget that mens thongs should only be worn by men with slim athletic bodies - \\"the slimmer the guy the slimmer the underwear\\" is a good rule of thumb (it works for swimsuits too!)

Amazon.com usually does very well with customer service, but when I wanted to exchange my sons cell phone for a different one within 30 days, they said \\"NO\\". This is a practice that is very common with Carriers like Sprint, Verizon, and AT&T. Yet Amazon refused. I made a commitment of 2 Years with 4 phones, unlimited data, and unlimited messaging through them, and they couldn't even commit to a 30 day satisfaction garuantee? Very disappointed, and not worth the money saved by going through them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A star is too much","review":"Sprint pushes you to pay for a 4G network which they have not enough coverage for... but they DARE to charge $10 more for that service!! The phones by themselves have 4G capabilities, so that means you can activate or deactivate this option... so if there is no network... you shouldn't be consuming 4G right??Why should it be charged if your phone is NOT getting and detecting info from a 4G network? I would agree on paying the 10 more just if they had the service and I pull info from it. Else... it is not worth it, forget it! stay with Tmobile... Boost, metroPCS if not!"},{"rating":"1","title":"watch out","review":"Every time you make a change in your plan Sprint automatically renews this two year contract. I have been a customer three years and have changed my plan a couple times, always to increase the number of minutes...yet when my phone recently went kaput, Sprint only offered me the deals they give their new customers towards a new phone, but at the expense of renewing another two year contract.

The \\"Ultra Edition DVD set\\" has the original Kimba; the others have later re-workings of the series. This DVD here is one of 4 Kimba DVDs released by Genius Products. It comes in a cardboard envelope and contains 2 Kimba episodes: \\"Egg Hunt\\" (original title: Scrambled Eggs) and \\"Jungle Restaurant\\" (original title: Restaurant Trouble). These are the 1993 version of Kimba, not the original. The picture quality is really washed out; these DVDs were very poorly made. The only thing they have going for them is that both episodes have both an English soundtrack and and a Spanish soundtrack."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brings back great childhood memories!","review":"I bought two copies of this cd (one for each of my nephews).

The songs are so good that even adults love it. My personal favorite is \\"Sleepytime\\"-I am 35 years old and I often listen to it for its dreamy lyrics saying that one can be whatever he or she wants to be as long as they believe it can happen. \\"Hey Daddy\\" is a song that you can't listen to without singing along. It is often a top request at Anne's concerts. \\"You are My Sunshine\\" could have been a country single and hit for Anne-it is that good. \\"Teddy Bear's Picnic\\" is a song every child will love. The lullaby medley she has at the end is so touching, so soothing, you wish you were a kid again. This album is timeless, enjoyable and thoroughly wholesome.

My three year old niece loves \\"hippo in the bathtub\\" (or hey daddy) and always asks to listen to it. When I was young, my favorite was teddy bears' picnic and I always imagined that I was in the forest having a picnic with the teddy bears.

I was interested in finding out more information on full time employment opportunities for academic lecturers and professional experts on ships. This book is a guide on how to get free cruises by offering to lecture onboard. There is nothing in here that common sense would not dictate (if you know about a topic, then you can lecture about it ... seems self-evident to me!). The font is revealing ... GIGANTIC type which would qualify as large print by any standards. I have the impression that this is aimed at retirees hoping to get free travel. If you expect to get paid for your work, then this is not the book for you...I rate this the lowest possible rating, and that is too generous, especially considering that this is such a thin paperback with a steep ...price tag!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not a good price","review":"Actually I am looking to buy this book used .

Apparently I was sent one of the ones that did not work! The timer has a very short cord, and did not come on at all, regardless of the various settings I attempted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost worthless","review":"This timer is not a \\"set and forget\\" device by any stretch. You can set it to turn on at dusk and off at dawn, but it generally only works for one day before resetting itself to stay off permanently, until you set it again. None of the settings you program are saved, you can set it to stay on all of the time and before long it will just shut off and won't turn back on without your intervention. I have tried all of the different settings, hoping to stumble upon one that works, but no such luck. It may work properly for a day or two, but it defeats the purpose of having an automatic timer if you have to manually turn it on when you want it on. Might as well just plug and unplug the light. I guess the only pro I found with this item was that it was cheap in price as well as quality, but even getting ripped off a little is still getting ripped off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked last year.

Maurice and Robyn were still alive at the time. I had followed their music before the disco era but had not delve into their humble childhood beginnings. This 2 DVD Set will give you both, a first class evening of entertainment and music performances on one DVD and the wonderful story of the Bee Gees from the start of their illustrious career on the bonus DVD. You will not be disappointed and if you start with their story DVD you'll begin to understand how much they contributed to Rock and why they generated top sales and the awards. You'll stand up and cheer as if you are live in the audience. They are by far the most misunderstood Rock Group of all times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what you'd expect","review":"My son and I got this book thinking it would cover Irish folklore. A better name would be Irish bar tales... Considering the richness of the Irish storytelling and folklore traditions, this was painful. Most tales were disjointed and not very entertaining. If this is the current oral tradition, then it's already pretty dead. Overall we were not impressed and wish we had returned it. We kept hoping it'd get better. It didn't. Maybe it's of interest to a scholar, but it's not to read for entertainment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Irish Folktales","review":"Irish Folktales (Pantheon Fairy Tale and Folklore Library)Henry Glassy edited six different sections,nineteen different subsections, and all together one hundred twenty four works. That's a lot to organize, let alone read. The quality of some of the work he put in the book is lacking, but its part of the culture. You can't wipe it away because you don't like a story. There are just as many little stories to like in this book. Granted it wasn't to my liking or geared for my work.

Throughout one's life you always hear the usual myths about the period of history known as \\"The Middle Ages.\\" Pernoud shows that the Middle Ages were a time, for the most part, of peace and learning. She brilliantly shows that the Middle Ages were a time of wonder and acomplishment and juxtaposes that against the cynicism and skepticism brought on by the so-called \\"Age of Enlightment.\\" This book should be in every history lover's library. Keep it handy when someone, who usually has not actually read a history book, spews forth on the following subjects, women in the \\"dark ages,\\" the Crusades, the Spanish Inquisition, witches and cats and the usual nonsense one hears from the unread and uninformed nowadays."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book is extremely hard to read","review":"Book is translated from French and is ridicklously hard to read.There are better books out there about the medieval ages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Be Fooled By The Chatty Title","review":"Based upon the title, I expected this to be an easy-read, colloquial book written for the masses. NO! This is a scholarly treatise that is very dense, and difficult to read.

It isn't particularly friendly or intuitive. My concern is more with a program that takes fully 15 minutes to uninstall ( ...what the heck is going on?) and then, after I finally do get rid of it, causes Windows XP to pop up a message telling me that it is unable to restore my computer to the System Restore Point that I had set up prior to the installation. What on earth is it doing to my systems that prevents me from doing a clean uninstall and putting my PC back to where it was?

It is one of the shiniest, most metallic-looking silvers you will find in a gel pen, and I use it a lot in my artwork. If you are looking for a good silver pen, do buy it. Just don't buy it here. The price and shipping cost me $8.78 just for one pen! I previously bought a two-pack of Uni-Ball Impact gold and silver pens in an office supply shop for a little over $6, so this is a huge rip-off. To make things worse, the pen I bought from Amazon was advertised to be a package of 12, so I was vastly disappointed to receive only one pen. The only reason to buy this pen from Amazon is if you have looked in all the shops in your area which sell pens and cannot find it, which unfortunately is what happened to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fragile valve parts. Short life.","review":"This works about as well as any inexpensive in line hose valve. They can be handy. As with many of them the plastic valve handle assembly breaks off. It lasted me around 8 months. Better to get an all brass one.I use these in line valves as sprayers. When the valve is partway open most deliver a satisfactory spray for boat washing ect. without a separate spray head. This does not because of the hose length. This is very convenient when you have an outboard engine with a flushing port where you screw the hose on the the port then flush it with water. The added distance from the valve makes it easier to use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unforgettable and adorable Polar Bear Cubs","review":"I first saw this show on TV when it came out and it made an unforgettable impression on me.

To watch these tiny cubs being rescued and reared by these incredible loving people, was an experience I haven't been able to forget. They are so adorable with distinct personalities you just fall in love with them.To realize after a while that you now also understand the sounds Klondike and Snow make and know what they are asking for is amazing.

But I was pleasently surprised to say the very least. It is a charming book that gives you a real glimpse inside of Adam Copeland's (aka-Edge) head. I personally found it interesting to read/find out about how he made his rise to the top and everthing he had to do to get there. Especially when it may have seemed in his younger, formative years that the chips were against him. Definately a book that get's two thumbs up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Informative/Positive book","review":"I bought book for my husband, Rob.

Copeland is a great writer and the book is simply amazing when he recounts his childhood, the attempts of getting into wrestling, being terrified of his injury, and WWF/WWE matches and trips. I wasn't a big Edge fan before I read this, but after I finished I became an \\"Edgehead.\\" I was actually pretty upset when I finished the book because I didn't want it to end. I hope he writes another book to follow-up to this one since so much has happened from where the first one left off. You won't be disappointed, Copeland has a great talent for writing.

He's the reason that Matt Hardy and Amy Dumas (Lita) are no longer together. She was cheating on Matt with Edge while they were on the road and Matt was still recovering from a knee injury. Edge's wife broke the news to Matt. That' why I titled my review what I did. Edge is a great wrestler but a bad friend, watch your girlfriends fellas, or else Adam Copeland will snatch her up."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Read ...","review":"Wrestling biographies are really hit or miss. In my mind there are many more hits than there are misses, but the misses still exist.On Edge is a very solid book. It doesn't rank up there with some of my favorite wrestling biographies, but I don't regret spending my time reading it either. This is not the kind of wrestling biography that is going to appeal to fans outside of the wrestling world, but that's not who it is trying to reach. It's meant for wrestling fans, and in my mind it reaches that audience perfectly.It's a different perspective. Alot of wrestling biographies show people moving up from \\"the old school mentality\\", Edge came from a different generation and thus his story is alot different.When reading On Edge you get a true feeling that Edge appreciates the blessings he has recieved, and you also feel that he truly loves what he does for a living.All in all, this is an entertaining read that I would recommend picking up if you're a wrestling fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"This is a great book for any Edge fan. It tells of his struggles growing up and how he rose to be one of the best superstars in the WWE.It was a very easy read,I finished it in less than a day.I highly recomend it to any wrestling fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"I was on edge, reading On Edge","review":"I bought this book thinking that it would be another 'poor me, I'm rich and can't handle it now' type book. Man, was I wrong! Adam \\"Edge\\" Copeland paints a picture of growing up poor, I can relate, and having dreams that he worked hard, and took a lot of crap, for. I was truly shocked to discover that he really wrote this himself instead of hiring a ghostwriter. There seems to be something missing from his memory, but he attributes that to many hits to the noggin. I've always been a wrestling fan. Now I understand the inner workings of the business. Well, not everything... Try reading this, it'll open your eyes to this man. I thought he was really like his character, turns out, I was wrong about that too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good read","review":"This book was incredibly good, even if you aren't an Edgehead. He's not one of my all time favorites, but I am a collector of wrestling books, and this one was better than most. It was written by Edge himself in long hand, and is a very entertaining and humorous read. Even though I don't approve to what he has done with the whole Lita situation, this book shows that deep down, he has good character."},{"rating":"1","title":"I think I know... this book is awful.","review":"I took this with me on vacation, and while Edge seems to have an interesting story to tell, his mechanics of telling the story are distracting. You really get the feeling as if Edge were right there with you narrating the story, but that's not a good thing. He repeatedly drops names, spouts clich��s, and rips off Mick Foley's gimmick on ripping on Al Snow. Edge's childhood and the early part of his career are interesting, but the final third of the book is definitely skim-worthy. I would definitely say this book lacks the crossover appeal that Mick Foley or even Ric Flair had, but wrestling fans will probably enjoy it to some degree."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY DISAPPOINTED... plastic case...

George C. Scott was born to play Scrooge, and his performance is so superb you can overlook his lack of a British accent. The supporting cast is excellent too, especially David Warner as Bob Cratchit and Edward Woodward as the Ghost of Christmas Present. The production values are top-notch, and it's a very faithful telling of the original story.

Great acting, powerful message, good filming and music -- all in all, perfectly enchanting. The creepy parts really ARE creepy, make no mistake, which is good because Scrooge's frightened reactions would be melodramatic otherwise. I was touched the most by Tiny Tim, and the wretched little Ignorance and Want. I cried when the Spirit of Christmas present showed them to Scrooge, and was so inspired by the whole story that that night I got out of bed to write a poem about unfortunate children.

Scott. But unfortunately after seeing the Sim version, you are ruined for all other versions because no Scrooge holds a candle to the Sim portrayal. He crushes all of the other Scrooges like little poser bugs beneath his feet. For this reason, and this reason only, does the Scott version get four stars, because to give this one five stars would mean that it is as good as the Sim Scrooge, which it is not. But this version definitely gets kudos and is well worth a view. Warning: make sure you watch this version (or any version) BEFORE the Sim version or, alas, it will seem small and puny in comparison and you will be unable to look at the Scott version as anything more than a cheap imitation, which it is not."},{"rating":"1","title":"This \\"Patton meets A Christmas Carol\\" is missing one important \\"spirit\\"","review":"Great production values, costumes,cinematography...but this version is as serious as a heart attack and almost as fun..the great George C.Scott (unfortunately)portrays Ebeneezer Scrooge nearly the same as he played George S.

George C. Scott is not even remotely believable as Scrooge. He's just too much the General mixed with Archie Bunker and not at all the version of this I'd ever pick for my Christmas film.

However, the copy I received was in the 1.85:1 aspect ratio, rather than the full-screen 1.33:1 which it should have been (and as was indicated on the back of the case). So, until this production issue is fixed, I recommend NOT buying this movie for now, unless you like seeing the tops of people's hairlines cut off.

To make matters worse, I I I I I have to pay for the $2.98 shipping to return the garbage for a refund?! Just to get a replacement??! I didn't even ask for my money back! All I wanted was the DVD I ordered in good working order. I get a piece of crap and I have to pay and it ruined our Christmas traditions night.

It came across as flat and lifeless compared to the book and the 1951 Alastar Sim version I have. Instead of taking you back to the time of Dickens, it takes Dickens up to our time.

Includes some additional footage during Scrooge's visit from the Ghost of Christmas Present. This includes a displaced impoverished young family. Living in a slum of London, it gives the wealthy Scrooge a view of the non-wealthy population of the industrial era.

The special effect are indeed good, alright, but they deftly enhance the story rather than wow us. The supporting actors are first-class as well. The setting deserves \\"best supporting\\" kudos. The location, the authentic music, set design, and attention to period detail really elevate this production. The best rendition of the Dickens classic ever.Gene Stroble"},{"rating":"2","title":"This has become a Holiday tradition for me","review":"When I first saw the advertisement of \`A Christmas Carol' staring George C. Scott on TV I thought of General Patton as Scrooge. I was very cynical towards the movie at first. Don't get me wrong. George C. Scott was a brilliant actor, but I could not picture him as Scrooge. I was totally blown away by his portrayal of Scrooge. He brought a certain level to the character others did not. The movie is fun to watch, and a great Holiday classic. Your family will enjoy watching this time and time again.

This adaptation is very good and I'm very impressed with George C. Scott's acting, he gave an excellent performance as Ebenezer Scrooge and I also liked David Warner as Bob Cratchit and there are many other fine performances too, Edward Woodward, Suzannah York, etc. I very highly recommend this adaptation which seems pretty faithful to the Charles Dickens classic book and I like that they included aspects of the book that are not in the other Christmas Carol movies!

I disagree. I just watched most of it on TV. \\"Quality\\" acting is as much a matter of one's tastes as of objective standards. I thought Scott's acting was OK, if a bit overdone, but the direction plodded, and the ghosts, especially the Marley's Ghost performance, were so badly over the top that they would have fit better in a remake of Rocky Horror Picture Show.I recommend sticking with the Alistair Sim version.Of course, your tastes might differ from mine."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautifully rich visual presentation","review":"This version has THE BEST Ghost of Christmas Present- presented with the power and joy communicated in the novel. The character of Scrooge is well-captured, and the adaptation well-considered. The costumes and sets are wonderful; a romanticly rich Victorian-esque world. There are a couple of moments that could use polish (like the Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come being a statue in the cemetery scene- what, did the actor quit at the last minute?), but overall a lovely adaptation, with a powerful Scrooge."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Christmas Carol with George C.

Then I got one of the best Christmas presents ever, a new release of 'A Christmas Carol' starring none other than George C. Scott. I immediately felt his interpretation of the Dicken's character was much more 'real' than any other I had seen, plus, the supporting cast, cinematography, direction and sets were absolutely first class. What a special treat for anyone who loved the book. One of my absolute favorite movies of all time without question."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb Production","review":"This made-for-television movie is an extremely faithful reproduction of Dickens' classic tale. Very little has been added in the way of newly-written scenes nor have many names been invented or changed. A few minor omissions include the interlude scene where Scrooge dines at a local tavern after closing the office on Christmas Eve. There is no depiction of the fettered spirits surrounding Marley upon his departure through Scrooge's window. The Ghost of Christmas Present does not take Scrooge to visit others celebrating Christmas. Other films have shown the lighthouse keepers, the sailors and the miners. Excellent interpretations of Dickens' characters include those of Fred, Jacob Marley, The Ghost of Christmas Present, Tiny Tim, and of course, George C. Scott as Ebeneezer Scrooge. You can read in more detail a comparison of this and other film treatments of the Dickens' classic at [...]."},{"rating":"2","title":"my all time favorite Christmas movie","review":"I absolutely love this movie...George C Scott is the best and I recommend this for everyone who loves to watch Christmas movies!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A favorite in our house","review":"The only version of this story that we really enjoy.

All the actors are great in their roles and the Ghost of Christmas Future is about as scary as it gets.George C Scott manages to inject humor into spots in the movie which are pricless. No one does it better. I had it on video but recently have been unable to use my video player due to the new digital cable, so had to buy the DVD so I could watch it several times before Christmas.Love it.If you haven't seen it, buy it.

This seems to be the only thing that bonds them. No talk about the culture and beliefs of Nokose's tribe and how that ties into the storyline. Nothing to support or backup the time travel.

There aren't any particularly original or interesting songwriting ideas expressed here, the whole thing just seems redundant compared to their other albums. As far as I can see, I'd say that they didn't really have anything to say when they made this......they were just churning out filler to keep the royalties coming in.

That fixes the error every time...BUT the next error says you've installed a refilled ink cartridge and once again you can't print. Or it can't recognize the cartridge when you put it back in. The only solution I've found is to replace a 3/4 full ink cartridge with a new ink cartridge. That's not cheap, but cheaper than throwing a brand new printer out the window.

I use it once a week for business and I was having to turn it off and on to get rid of error lights. The most common error was Printer Head Incorrect. I called Canon and they sent me a new Printer Head to replace the old one. It worked for a few months and then it no longer worked again. I called Canon and it was past a year now, even though it was the same problem they would not help me. They want me to take it somewhere and pay to fix it again or pay them more money and upgrade to another Canon which I will not do.Also the amount of ink this printer takes is unbelievable, I spend way more than I ever have for any other printer.I am going back to HP."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good MultiFunction Printer - Recomended","review":"A short review here. I've had this printer for about 8 months now and have been very impressed. All aspects of the printer work quite well and photos also come out good looking even though that's not this printer's main purpose. Installation went well and I have had no reliability issues with it over the last 8 months. That time includes several semesters with a lot of printing done for grad school.As the IT manager for our company, I've used many HP and Epson printers and this one is far better than the HPs and just as good, if not better than, the late model Epsons. I use this printer at home.Overall, it's a great MFP - only downside is that the printer output is a bit slow, but otherwise, I highly recommend this for all your printing, copying, faxing, and scanning needs. Also, as with most printers today, the replacement ink cartridges are a bit on the pricey side. If the output was faster, I'd give it a 5 star rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great All-In-One, but it Drinks Expensive Ink","review":"I purchased this printer because I wanted an All-In-One device that would still give me quality printing. The print quality is great and the fax, scanner, and copier are fine HOWEVER this printer drinks ink and it is EXPENSIVE ink. I can't find the ink at COSTCO , where I normally buy discount, and it seems unavaileable online for the most part. I already miss my old HP. This printer follows the Gillete shaver model. Give them a cheap holder and make a killing on the accessories (ink in this case)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ink expires with time, not usage","review":"Although this multi-function printer produces good quality prints, it is not good enough to overcome a completely flawed ink cartridge design. If you installed new ink cartridges in January and printed 5 pictures, let the printer sit idle until July, you would have to replace the color cartridges all over again. Spending $50 for cartridges every 6 months, you'll quickly realize there are better alternatives out there.Before buying this we owned an HP deskjet color. My wife worked in publishing and would print thousands of pages off of one $15 cartridge. That is what I expect from a printer. Conversations with friends of mine confirm HP inkjet cartridges still last a very long time (i.e. years).We regret our purchase of this printer and will not purchase another Canon printer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent all around printer and fax","review":"I would have bought this from Amazon, but it didn't qualify for Amazon Prime shipping. Instead, I picked it up at my local Staples. The only drawback is the expensive cartridges, but the entire machine is top-notched. I say this having purchased and returned 2 HP's."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I've had this unit a little over a year, and it's the first Canon product that has failed to meet expectations. As others have noted, ink consumption is bad. Furthermore, it appears I need to do a major cleaning or replace the print head.Mac compatibility is OK, but not entirely as advertised unless you read the microscopic print. First, you can't save your settings. I would like to set duplex as default, but it never holds so I have to select it every time.Wireless printing requires the purchase of a Canon accessory. I tried connecting the printer to the USB port on my Airport Extreme, but the drivers don't support that mode. You can share it from another networked Mac - as long as the sharing Mac doesn't drop into sleep mode.I love my Canon digital cameras, and I hear the scanners are good. Guess they'll have to settle for 2 out of 3."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete piece of junk.....","review":"Since day 1 this printer has been nothing but problems...constantly calls for replacement color print cartridges, very slow to print, FAX doesn't work properly...I could go on and on about what a waste of money the MP830 was. Just read some of the many other one and two star reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deserve NO Stars!","review":"I have owned dozens of printers and at least 10 multifunction machines. This my most frustrating purchase, ever. It's slow. It's an ink hog. When you want to switch between fax and copy it's software gets paralyzed. Even when it does work it's ponderous. Little give away HPs work better. I have owned this for two years and I give up - I'm going back to HP!"},{"rating":"1","title":"TOTAL DUD, AVOID AT ALL COSTS","review":"What a disappointment this printer turned out to be - it is so unresponsive and takes forever to perform a simple function, if it performs it at all. I have owned it for 6 months and it has given me nothing but trouble - I can't get it to scan, the copier function is a pain in the butt and it is pretty slow at printing. Plus it guzzles ink..very disappointing printer from Canon. Wish I had saved my money and bought an HP instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good MFP... for 2 years","review":"Purchased this via Amazon in April of 2007. As of end of December 2009 - dead. Well, ok, it still turns on, but it doesnt do anything else. I got stuck in the Error code 5010 - which tells me that the scanner lock is on. After repeated and multiple troubleshooting steps, it's still non-functional. In the 20 months of use, it was great - good quality printing, even better scanning. Unfortunately, it's not great with Mac OSX - it works, but not like it should. Ink is expensive and goes quickly, but you get a good product. All in all - $270 for 20 months... was it worth it - no."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ink Problem","review":"Printing, scanning is great. Copying is slow - for the unit is not really meant for it - for emergency copying only). But the main problem is the ink. The colored inks goes low even you print only in black. If one cartridge goes out of ink, the machine is useless. It is \\"a must\\" to replace it. Using all black cartridges does not do the trick. It will give a message something like \\"not compatible color cartridge\\". I remember that I had a canon before (12 years ago) and I had the same problem - the ink. That's the catch on why it's cheap. Canon should work on this area. Ink problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Ink Usage","review":"I've become convinced there is a timer or expiration mechanism on the ink cartridge usage on this device. I didn't notice right away because I used the device a lot and it seemed OK. But my usage has waned and here is what happens: I replace all cartridges and print two pages. 3 months later I go to print 2 more pages and it claims the ink is half gone. 2 months later I print one more page and it claims the cartridges are empty and need to be replaced. 7 PAGES AND THE CARTRIDGES ARE EMPTY! I ignore the empty warnings for another dozen pages or so before I break down and buy new cartridges. This is still terrible performance. I've now read on other forums if you ignore the empty warnings long enough the whole device will lock up and become unusable. I will never buy another Canon product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Canon Pixma MP830","review":"Fantastic unit - prints quickly and the quality is great! I haven't yet figured out how to not get the fax to pick up when it's turned on and I haven't yet tried the document feeder but I'm very pleased with this unit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great deal on a multifunction printer.","review":"We are very impressed with the photo print quality, speed, and ease of use.

Amboy Office Equipment fixed it in 3 1/2 days.The device works great. The only thing that I'm not used to is the startup time. The 1st page takes a while to load in to the printer before it starts printing. My HP printers were a lot quicker.Everything works as promised.

I even got a new computer to go along with it after a few months, and that is where the trouble began. My new HP and the Canon function ONLY as a printer. The other features do NOT work. Canon blames HP, saying it is a twain issue and something on the HP is preventing it from scanning. HP blames Canon software. After dozens of hours with tech support on both sides, neither will accept responsibility for the problems. I cannot get a refund on either product, and here I sit with a glorified printer that uses enormous amounts of ink. AVOID THIS PRODUCT!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"PIXMA MP 830","review":"\\"Up-Graded\\" from a Dell 960 and am pleasently surprised. All-in-on was an easy set up and the print quality is very good.

Haven't had it long enough to comment on use of ink but, otherwise, impressed with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"piece of junk, nothing works if printer doesn't work","review":"The MP830 turned out to be an expensive piece of junk. As I am not a heavy printer user, and although I have been warned by a colleague to use the inkjet from time to time so that the cartridges wouldn't dry up (which I did, but apparently not frequently enough), the printer stopped working, the unit produced an error (5200) each and every time I turned it on, and refused to do absolutely anything (faxing or scanning included) unless I fixed it (which is hard to do, the error wouldn't just go away after replacing the ink cartridges, and I am still jumping through hoops trying to do a deep cleaning of the print head). To say the least, it is very frustrating not to be able to send a fax or scan a document when only the operation of the printer is affected by the cartridges. Canon just lost a customer, this is simply bad engineering."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good printer considering....","review":"I sometimes power this thing up in the mornings and it just makes a racket that wakes my wife up. It takes too long to get ready so you can print(about a minute or so). It can consume a little too much ink, but I've been able to find affordable ink through Amazon. Other than that, this printer is pretty good. It does everything you need for a home business setup. Fax,scan,copy and print like any big printer out there. Plus it has ports for your picture discs so you can download your pix right to your pc w/o plugging in your camera."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless Duplex Printing","review":"The duplex printing feature is useless because in duplex mode the printer mixes color inks to create black rather than using the black tank. This wastes an incredible amount of expensive ink and produces lousy, washed-out black.Tech support claims that this is because the black ink would show through to the other side of the paper, whereas the lousy washed-out black may not. I haven't yet tried a paper in which this was the case (I reverted to the old-fashioned method of printing odd/even pages and flipping them around) and am convinced that it's really just an underhanded ink-selling strategy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Prints fast, everything else is slow","review":"Prints fast, great results, but everything else is slow. The selections on the printer's control panel lag and the motors for the ADF intake seem slow and labored. It's okay."},{"rating":"2","title":"Canon Pixma Printer","review":"For the money, this is a decent all-in-one printer. I liked the individual ink tanks which keeps you from wasting an entire cartridge when one color is gone. I found that the front panel is not very intuitive and takes some time to navigate and understand. The paper capacity for a printer of this type should be larger--it seems like you always run out of paper in the middle of a school paper!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Best To Stay Away From This Printer","review":"It's credentials make it seem like the perfect all-in-one,but it's real world capabilities will leave you frustrated. Lots of troubles getting it to perform properly. I am not very tech-savvy so I had our IT guy set it up and troubleshoot it and by the third call to him in one week, he said, \\"get rid of it,\\" so I did. Thank goodness Amazon has such a terrific return policy. I'd be sooooo angry if I had to keep this dog."},{"rating":"1","title":"good features but ink tank protection system is a real hassle","review":"I chose this machine because of the good feature set and generally good reviews, but I regret the purchase.The ink tanks are an almost constant problem. I'm using the original ink tanks that came with the machine, and most times when I turn the machine on it gives an error message, either that there are two ink tanks of the same color, or that it can't recognize one of the ink tanks. In either case, the machine will refuse to print or copy anything, even in black and white, until the error is cleared. That requires several iterations of remove/reinsert the ink tanks, and/or reboot the printer.Probably I would buy an HP machine if I could do it over. This one is way too much trouble."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Poor Paper Handling","review":"I bought this computer yesterday and went through the complete installation process only to find out that it has very poor paper control. The paper feeder (very flimsy) is in the back which difficult if you change paper sizes alot, but the worst is that if you are a Paper Source addict like I am, you can forget about printing on Paper Source Luxe Paper and Envelopes. This printer jammed everytime I ran a thick piece of paper or envelope through. I read every review on this website before I bought and all anyone discusses is its copying, faxing and printing photograph capabilities. A printer should print beautiful documents and invitations, too. After my two paper jams, I loaded that printer right back to the store and bought an HP All in One Officejet 7410. I've been printing on thich cardstock and square cards all morning...its perfect!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, but could have been dominant","review":"I would have rated the printer 5 stars until I found out that the version they sell in the U.K has a CD/DVD printer. This printer has done everything I needed it to do. I own a video production company (Badjo Productions LC) and I've used it to print professional CD case inserts and labels designed in photoshop, contracts, business cards, flyers, pictures, etc. This thing does so much. The text quality could be better, but that's a minor annoyance. But it does make fast text prints. Canon could have had this particular segment locked down if only they sold us the version they sell in the U.K. Is there some type of agreement between the manufacturers?Though I now use permanent weather proof labels for disc labeling, DVD printing could have given me an option. I could have gotten the Epson RX700 for that, but it does not have a fax.Be careful unpacking the unit. If feels flimsy, I thought I might break it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing value for the price","review":"I have a small home-based business - didn't want to pop for a laser printer, but needed something that created quality prints for major presentations.

Worked AMAZING! Until the error codes showed up, first there was 6A00 which in NOT in the book under problem solving error codes. Then error code 5100 started showing up. I called tech support who were great, except could not help me. They said the problem is in the circuit board and I could either buy a new one at their discount (they gave me a code that is good for two weeks) or pay to get it fixed and I would have to pay for the estimate to see what that would cost. SO my dilemma .... buy it again... or get something else. Lemon or Cherry... roll of the dice. But buying a new one every two years is not what I want to do!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this printer","review":"These printers have widespread problems recognizing their own ink cartridges. After a few weeks with a new cartridge, or even just a few days, suddenly error messages begin appearing telling you that the ink tank cannot be recognized.If you enjoy repeatedly buying new ink cartridges to replace cartridges that are still full of ink, then this is the printer for you. Either the printer itself is faulty, or the ink cartridge manufacturing is poor, but these printers really have problems. I have gone to several troubleshooting sites to try to remedy the problem, but the only solution is to continue buying new ink cartridges (expensive) or yet another new printer. It seems that most other people owning this printer have the same problem.I purchased this printer based on reviews in Consumer Products and the positive reviews on this website. Amazon does its customers a disservice by posting the most positive comments about this particular product up front."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a Lemon","review":"There were problems with the unit from Day One. Ink cartridges weren't recognized and thus the unit could not operate. A call to tech support brought some replacement cartridges, but not the right ones. It required a second call and another week's wait to get the correct, working cartridges. Then the unit would not scan from the machine, although it scanned from the computer. Another 1 1/2 hours with tech support, and they couldn't get it to work, so suggested I take it in to one of their reps in another town. I thought about it overnight, and decided that I had a lemon on my hands, and shipped it back to Amazon. I had read positive reviews of this Canon product, but after this experience I decided to go with HP as a replacement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cordless Phone Users Beware this All in One","review":"I just purchased the MP830, replacing an old HP Officejet T45. I have one phone line in the house, and a cordless phone base station connected to the MP830 for use in my office. When the home phone rings with ANY VOICE CALL, you HAVE TO ANSWER IT ON THE PHONE CONNECTED TO THE MP830 or else the MP830 continues to ring and click over the phone line then picks up and starts a handshake over your conversation. You can only use one base station in the house, and it MUST be the one with the answering machine, and it must be connected to the MP830. Tech service says the only solution is to set the fax to Manual so it doesn't answer, or purchase the DRPD service from your phone company. My 7 year old HP answered automatically with no intervention, and picked up faxes automatically regardless of whether the answering machine had them or if someone physically answered."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big, Unreliable and Ink to expensive","review":"Have had 1 year.

Consider these type printers disposable and buy the cheapest HP you can get."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good machine","review":"Overall, I bought it for the paper handling capability, which is a little better than the MP780. The only negative is that the ink cartridges are still very expensive and the generics are pretty much useless because of the chip transfer requirement, which is much to time consuming and clumsy for my taste. But then, that's why Canon did the chip thing on the cartridge in the first place, since there is no other reason other than to eliminate the competition for cartidges."},{"rating":"1","title":"was ok, as long as it worked","review":"after a light use for over a year I started having a problem with this machine not being able to recognize the ink.

It WILL be my last. I will be getting an Epson dedicated scanner to go with a Brother black laser printer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does Not Power Up Anymore???","review":"Literately i have only used this printer approximatley less than 10 times to print out basic stuff and to make a copy or two, i purchased it a couple of years ago, but it has just been sitting there most of the time, and the machine just died on me.Two days ago i was using my PC and i turned on the printer, and it did turn on just fine. About 20 minutes i began to print and windows said it was offline, then i went to this printer and it was turned OFF, i tried unplugging the power cord for 20 minutes with the same result, then i left it unplugged during the whole night and in the morning it was still dead. VERY disappointing!! I am hoping it is the power supply that is bad because i can buy that for around $40 dollars or so and it is very easy to replace. I was not expecting this from Canon.If anyone has information as to what the problem might be i will appreciate your input."},{"rating":"2","title":"Small office copier/FAX/Scanner/printer","review":"This machine does it all for the small, home office, albeit a bit slower than some of the larger ones.

Within the first week the display only displayed in japanese. Apparently this was a common defect as I later read while trying to trouble shoot the problem. Canon was great about promptly replacing the printer for free. Now just as the warranty has expired I'm getting an error that the print head is incorrect. I can't even scan documents as the whole machine does not function with an error. So, my experience has been that these printers last 1 week to 1 year. The cost to assess the problem at a Canon recommended place is $49 to look at it. And an additional 60 for one hour of labor plus parts. SO not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good but the ink's VERY expensive","review":"I bought this about two years ago. Yes, it's good but the ink is frightfully expensive. Unless you really do a lot of color printing, you might want to shop around for cheaper options. Also, note that the ink expires 6 months from when you open it.

My expectations are extremely high and I hate to buy anything that leaves me disappointed.The MP830 is remarkable in every way. Before purchasing it I read countless user reviews and I appreciate all your input. Initially, I was looking at an HP but read some negative feedback about their document feeder, which is an important feature for me.Not only does this printer do what I expect well, it does so with exeptional print quality. I am even impressed by its print jet technology which lowers the cost of replacement ink wells.My only concern is when printing my return address from Microsoft Word on an envelope, I get occasional streaking. I get no streaks in any other print mode and this is tollerable as I usually use return labels anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Quality","review":"Have owned several Canon multifunction printers over the years and I'm afraid the MP830 was a real disappointment.First, quality control. In the last year, I am on my third unit. First one, the motherboard died and the unit was replaced under warranty. Second one, the paper feed jammed repeatedly. That unit was no longer under warranty and looks like I'll be on the hook for the cost of a new unit.But, it won't be a Canon.Other disappointment was the batch scanning function to a .pdf. With manual scanning, the images were clear and dark. However, in the batch scanning function, the images were very light, almost unreadable in some cases. Customer service admitted that this was a known problem with the software - but didn't know what Canon Japan would get around to fixing it.Overall, buy something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Problems and more problems","review":"I am so disappointed with this product. It has so many great features and I was very excited to purchase it. I have spent hours trying to get it to print in color (even purchased new cartridges and performed all maintenance items) and it still does not print in color. The scanning process is quirky and repeats the scan so that I end up with multiple scans of the same item. The Canon web site is not helpful. I could not even locate this item on the web site. I am so frustrated that I will never buy Canon again. I had HP for many years and different models and never had a problem. I switched to Canon because of what seemed to be better features. What a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Printer","review":"I have been using personal computers since 1982. This is unfortunately the worst and most unreliable printer that I have ever had. I am dissapointed as it was recommended by consumer reports.

I would see it, but I would not want to stick someone with it unless I had given prior disclosure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Junk!","review":"Reliability seems to be an issue with Canon Pixma multifunction printers.

My last multifunction would automatically store both received and sent faxes. If I didn't want them they would disappear at the click of my mouse.A whopping big No Thanks from me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drinks Ink","review":"I've had this unit several months. It works fine when it's filled with ink BUT it uses ink so quickly that one tank or another is always low or out.When one tank runs out, the machine won't function at all! If a color tank is out of ink, it won't print in black & white. Nothing works until the tank is replaced.And the tanks look half full when the sensor registers them as \\"empty.\\" No doubt a mfr. setting to sell more ink and I don't see a way to override it.Despite the low initial price of this unit, it is extremely expensive to operate. I'm sure Canon sells it at cost knowing they'll make $$$ later on the ink. After replacing the tanks a few times with costly Canon ink cartridges, I realized I should have bought a unit with a higher initial cost but easier on ink usage -- and one that would work when a tank is supposedly empty. I feel ripped off by Canon and will never buy from them again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its back in the box where it belongs","review":"This machine is too fancy and expensive for what it can do. Ink is too expensive. The software package is not too great. You can't receive faxes via your computer and view prior to printing. I get a lot of junk ad faxes at night. I'd come in to work and find a bunch of wasted paper and ink (expensive ink) from junk faxes. I finally boxed this printer up and put it in storage. I replaced it with a Brother all-in-one, which does everything and more, including PC fax receiving and sending, for much less money. Also, the Brother takes off-brand ink cartridges, which only cost about 3-4 a piece! And they work as good as the name brand cartridges. I own several other Canon products in which I am well pleased, but not this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"scan from panel doesn't work, tech support said it's Micro$soft's problem","review":"The print functions work fine, both color and text. It will scan from software, but it won't respond to scan requests from the control panel, which is the main reason I bought it. Thankfully, I did not waste money having this boat anchor shipped to me, I'll just dump it off back at the store. I put a call in to tech support and he walked me through some tests, then gave up and said there must be something wrong with my pc. I tried installing the software on 2 different pc's: 1 2003 server, the other xp pro sp2, neither one allowed one touch scanning. In fact the xp machine didn't recognize the device at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good to Great on everything.","review":"I like all of the options on this all-in-one. The only drawback is the marginal quality of the picture printing. Otherwise, the easy printing and scanning of multiple pages is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Canon MP830 All-in-one Printer","review":"This is one slick machine. The ability to do two-sided scans and copies with automatic feed is the best I have seen. For the most part all actions are intuitive. The flexibilty of each application gives the user a range of options that are simple and straightforward. The quality of copying and printing is outstanding. If there is any shortcoming it might be in the scanning software. I had a some difficulty getting scans formated properly but that might have been more my problem than the machine. I also had a problem getting my computer to recognize the printer but that was cleared up with a quick email to tech support. Overall I am very satisfied with the MP830 and would recommend it to anyone looking for a compact, quality machine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Killer end credits song","review":"I just watched the DVD of the film and out of ALL the DVDs that I own (500+) very few have a end credits song that keeps me from just hitting the stop button. This one did.Sung by Katie Knight-Adams (a former performer in the Broadway play \\"Cats\\"), the song called \\"Riding on the Rocks\\" is a catchy pop rock song that starts off with a soft melodic vocal, but then kicks into high gear during the chorus with rock guitar backings that really give this tune some \\"ummph\\". What makes this song ear catching is Katies vocals. Very unique as she sings a select few words during the chorus.I listen to it and this could easily be a song sung by recent American Idol runner-up Katherine McFee. Do yourself a favor and sample \\"Riding on the Rocks\\" above. You'll see what I mean."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't track, frayed on the sides","review":"I purchased these belts becuase they were less expensive than the 3M brand belts. Big mistake.

If anything touches the cable horrible feedback is produced. In fact, horrible feedback is produced if any of the following conditions are met:- The wire is touched.- The wire is moved.- The microphone is muted.- The controller is moved.- The controller is not held at a steady 90 degree angle.It seems that everyone who orders this is getting a different unit (all probably sent by the private address on the label).

Anyway, now Microsoft fixes the previous headset and locates the mute switch some 12\\" from the controller somewhere near my adams apple or whatever - not sure the brilliance with this or how this was supposed to help the gaming experience, guess I am not as smart as the richest man in the world.

They are definitely of much less quality than the Playstation sets that still work after more than a year of solid use. We have friends who have had the same frustrating experience, which is a shame, since the 360 wireless controllers work great and the game system itself is totally awesome. You'd think Microsoft and even 3rd party companies could have put out headsets of equal quality. I highly recommend you try some other 3rd party headsets first. If you have the 360 set that sometimes comes with the game for free, then try being very VERY gentle with the wire connections on either end (the headset and plug ends) - don't wind the cord up etc. - and maybe they'll last for you a little longer than a month."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't last long","review":"My daugher loves the mic.

So I gave this item 5 stars for it's fun aspect. It is hard, however, to have fun with an item when it's broken, as is almost guaranteed to be the case with this item after six months. The one that came with my 360 broke after about six months of use. I figured it was a fluke, so I bought two more. One of them has already broken. I'm waiting for the next one to join the first in headset heaven (or hell, depending on how much you hate these things) soon.

Apart from constantly breaking, they are also very finicky when they are connected. Sometimes I'll have to twist it around while it's plugged in for it to register. I have been able to extend the lives of the mics for a little while by doing that, but in the end they will break on you after a short time.Seeing as you can get a wireless mic for the price of 2 of these POS mics, I'd say go for a wireless mic.If you value your money, stay away from these mics at all cost.

Also, I left feedback on the order and then received a demand from the seller to remove my rating, basically telling me that I was a stupid buyer. I am sending the headset back because it squeals, statics, I am not able to hear and no one is able to hear me. If you are looking a cheap product, then by all means purchase this one.

There simply aren't enough of them to accommodate my head.In case the physical discomfort didn't bother you enough, it's hard to get decent audio quality even from the new set. I plugged it in as securely as I could, but still heard little audio output. My games also didn't register my speech, regardless of which setting the microphone's on/off switch was on.

With the headband vertical, my microphone rests somewhere near the side of my nose.If you tap the cord in any way, you'll get a burst of static in your ear.

I treated this thing very gingerly, it wasn't ever stepped on or abused. It looks like new, but it just stopped working.

It's a better bang for your buck."},{"rating":"1","title":"What were they thinking","review":"To make a good headset isn't that hard. For some reason they just couldn't do it. First off, the mic isn't long enough to reach close to your mouth and the mic sensitive enough to work when its not right in front of your mouth.The second big thing that they messed up is they put the MUTE button in the middle of the cord instead of by the controller. Think about it, your hands are already by the controller, add a mute button where your hands are. It is a such a pain if you have to mute you have to find this switch somewhere half way on your body and look at it to figure out which way to slide it.Don't buy this headset when there are better ones for the same price."},{"rating":"1","title":"came with 360","review":"Xbox live is one of the greatest entertainments of the 21st century, being able to connect with millions of people worldwide is a great thing, this headset is NOT!!!

The underlying love story is the underpinning of the whole scenario, although it is not intrusive by any means. Despite not achieving his love eventually, the butler has got to know the real meaning of that word and remains a man of real honour till the very end. In other words, a great book by an even greater author with an amazing biography."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than I thought it would be","review":"An intriguing look at life during that period and one man's review of his life choices.

There are pictures, captions and full text running under each page of graphics, so these books will entertain ages 2-10, and they can be told by the reader in different ways.The captions rhyme, while the story is regular verse, and slightly different than the caption story line (more detailed).For lovers of Tin Tin, Babaar, or any adventure graphic story book, these editions offer a great twist at story time."},{"rating":"1","title":"An curious early attempt, but not their best album.","review":"I own about 14 Manhattan Transfer albums and am a big fan. But this one was a definite dissappointment. As their first album (1971?), even one of the members called it a \\"false start\\" for the MT and their move into conquering the genre of vocal jazz. This album is interesting from a collecting standpoint, but with only one true MT member here, it doesn't reflect their true sound as exected. There's some country influence here as well. If you are new to the MT and want their real jazz sound, try something else and leave this for the MT completists.Also, where are the 2 and 3 star ratings from last month? It seems as if someone at Amazon is erasing the negative reviews, which leaves those of us who want true reviews with no one to trust."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad","review":"although the shipper was very prompt in delivery.

I did use a power tool to put the screws in, and there were naturally quite a few. Without the power tool it undoubtably would have been harder to do. The directions were good, though, so there weren't any terribly muddled moments during the assembly. The assembled frame is sturdy and is pretty easy to put into recliner mode. I just wish that there were more slats, because my all-cotton futon tends to follow the dips between the slats which isn't too comfortable for sleeping. I put an inexpensive closed cell mat between the futon and the frame to help with that."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is rated by me O.K.","review":"THe reason I gave this book 2 stars is because I thought it was very boring.

Of course, as with all the Dear America series of books, our heroine finds herself facing many problems - ranging from the mundane [her pesky younger sister Netta wanting to read her diary] to really serious concerns like battling illnesses, losing loved ones etc. Teresa is a strong-willed and courageous heroine and we come to genuinely care for her, despite the fact that this is not a real person.There is a historical note at the end that describes the founding of so-called experimental colonies from the 1600s to the 1800s, and the issues the settlers faced. There are also lots of archival photographs of early Italian migrants, illustrations of wagon journeys as well as an Italian recipe and song. This is a book that will apppeal to young history buffs."},{"rating":"2","title":"West To A Land Of Plenty","review":"The story of Teresa Angelino Viscardi is a wonderful book! It tells the first person story of her life on a train from New York to Idaho territory. Her family is ready to leave...besides her.

However, it isn't bad. The second half of the CD is material that was released as 'Red Patent Leather', the sound is pretty sketchy, but it is a good example of later period Dolls, when things were beginning to fall apart. The first half of the CD is material from something I can't think of right now. The sound is good, but David's vocals are too high in the mix. IF you don't have a lot of the bootleg stuff that goes around, this is a good buy. It does give you an idea of what the Dolls were about live.

We all know that African Americans use a variety of products to achieve the most optimal results. This product cannot be used alone due to our hair demands, and there are many other products out there that don't flake up when used with other products.

After I let my hair dry, I did my usual flat iron routine and my hair seemed like a feather which I didn't like.

However, while I didn't have an overly negative experience, I think my search will continue for the \\"perfect conditioner\\".Pros- It smells great. It's nice and thick, covering each strand of hair.Cons- Left a residue on my hair; residue turned gooky over time which then turned flaky and was hard to wash out.

Two visitors come and shake things up. They don't do anything wild or unusual, but they question and intimidate the young man, until the reader becomes unsure what sinister plans the two men have in mind.Pinter's strength lies in his dialogue, which is thoroughly believable and memorable. Not for a moment does the reader doubt that these scenes could happen (and may HAVE happened) in real life.As this reader read the play, the tension built and built, as I became more and more sympathetic to the young man, awaiting to learn his fate, as his own will seemingly deteriorated.I would agree that this play is a funny read, but it's certainly very unsettling as well.If you haven't read anything by Harold Pinter, or are curious because you've read his other plays, _The Birthday Party_ is worth checking out.ken32"},{"rating":"2","title":"Laugh Out Loud, Funny!","review":"A side splitting send up of the misunderstood artist.One of the funniest plays of the century, by one of England's greatest playwrights.Bring your knife and fork!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent astringent for oily acne prone skin","review":"This is an excellent astringent, I had my doubts with products touting \\"oil eliminating\\", \\"oil free\\" as they never seemed to work.

Its been a terribly compulsive habit that I was sure I could never break.

Its been almost 3 weeks and for the first time in my life, I can actually see the \\"whites\\" of my nails growing. The disgusting taste of Malava is enough to make even the worst nail biter (me) stop this terrible habit and the whole process became so mental that now I don't even have the desire to bite anymore. I would recommend combining this treatment with a nail strengthening polish as well...because for me, my nails have never even had the chance to grow past the fingertips and are very weak from the years of biting.

You can not like your fingers or thumbs with this stuff on it. I have used it for a little over a month and have officially stopped sucking my thumb after all these years.

The flavor is comparable to a cross between rotten grapefruit and the numbing gel the dentist puts on your gum before he injects it with novocaine. I have noticed that it each application lasts about 3-4 days.The only drawback is if you are eating something like chips or a donut and go to lick your fingers, you will quickly remember that Mavala Stop has been applied!

Apparently the taste grew on her as it hasn't deterred her since. It's as though there is nothing on her nail. She doesn't even mention the taste. Just happily sucks her thumb same as ever. I even took to painting it on more than once a day. Still nothing. I am disappointed as I wanted to stop the daytime thumb sucking more so even than the night time sucking.

Its a few dollars more than the other brands, but works much better. Brush it on like a clear nail polish, and any urge to bite nails or suck thumbs will be gone a few seconds into the act(the stuff does NOT taste good at all)! Our kindergartner has had the nervous habit of sucking her thumb. We tried everything from punishment to positive reinforcement, but nothing worked long-term, and certainly not if we weren't there to catch her in the act. Once we applied Mavala, the bitter taste kept her from doing it again. The product doesn't easily wash off, so it works even while she's at school or with friends. I highly recommend this product....and buy it before wasting time and money on the competition. You'lll save yourself a few bucks and tons of frustration."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what I was hoping for!","review":"I read some reviews that made me hope this would be the cure for my 5 year old daughter from sucking her fingers. I personally think this stuff tastes nasty, but my daughter will still suck her fingers, even with this stuff on. Doesn't seem to phase her. We had also tried \\"Thumb\\" which also didn't work. Mavala seems very similar to Thumb. We probably should have started trying this stuff when she was younger. Thumb worked for two of my other kids when they were two year olds to wean them from their binkies. It may help you, but didn't work for us :("},{"rating":"1","title":"extremely nasty but not nasty enough","review":"I feel bad giving this a 2 star because if it were me, I wouldn't put my finger in my mouth with this stuff on.

I thought it was great and recommended it to my sister in law. Right after that, he started sucking it again. I guess he got used to the awful taste. It is so bad and stays on so good that if he touched my lips with his thumb, I could taste it for a good 15 min. I would still recommend this product. It is worth the money to see if it works for you. I just wish they had different awful flavors..... Now we use bandaids and that is working...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mavala works to stop Thumbsucking!","review":"I used this product to help my daughter stop sucking her thumb and after the first use, she has never sucked her thumb since.

My mother even threatened to put gloves on me that I would have to wear 24/7. I'm 27 now, and hopefully am out of the habit without relapse.

A great product, in my opinion, that performs as advertised."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally!","review":"Finally a product was strong enough to break the will of a stubborn 7 year-old with a 5 year habit of biting nails!!!!

It was a great reminder for her and the taste was really bad. Tried it myself. It was yucky enough to help her stop. Was NOT so yucky that she threw up though. Read reviews that it made other children vomit. I think that is probably because the children wanted to vomit and knew it would make the parents stop using it. Kids are smarter than we give them credit. My child once tried making herself vomit to get out of eating a dinner she didnt care much for. My advice is to try it. Its only $11.00 and it may save you hundreds on dentristry later."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great (for some)","review":"I have a pair of 3 year-olds and this worked great for one but not the other (she was just determined to suck her thumb no matter what!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome","review":"My daughter's dentist recommended this product a couple of years ago to help her quit sucking her thumb.

My 4 year old tried sucking her thumb a few more times, drinking a couple cups of water every time she tried, to wash the bad taste out of her mouth.

I continued using it for the rest of the week just in case she had a relapse. I also used the product myself since I have been a chronic nail biter all my life. It works great!

That said, I am not sure it was really the Mavala Stop that did it so much as her orthodontist telling her she would end up with so much damage they would have to do painful surgery to correct it. That really motivated her; the M.S. was more of a reminder not to do it (like when asleep). As many others have said, it DOES make finger food taste terrrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"so-so for toddler thumb sucking","review":"I bought this to stop my 4-year-old son from sucking his thumb.

My three year old at first didn't like the taste but a day later she became immune to it and it had no effect. I am sure this product would work for some people just not for me or my daughter.

I put it on while she was sleeping and the first time she tried to put her thumb in her mouth, she got a very strange look on her face. She wouldn't go back to sucking that thumb even after several days when I was sure it had worn off and I hadn't reapplied it.

Our 3 year-old quickly figured out how to take a suck at her thumb and then take a drink repeatedly until the mavala was sucked off and she had rinsed the taste from her mouth. So, alas, it didn't work for us. However, I've heard great stories of success from others. Bottom line, the stuff isn't that expensive and much cheaper than other methods to get your kids to stop sucking their thumbs. It's worth a shot. Maybe it will work for you.On a side note. The stuff DOES taste NASTY. My 3 year old (for whom this was purchased), climbed to get the mavala stop on a shelf in the kitchen and then painted ALL of her baby sisters' fingers (baby sister was 9 months and a finger-sucker). We tried to get the mavala stop off of baby sister's fingers, but she still threw-up from sucking her fingers.

Also keeps them from eating their dinner with their hands. Beware string cheese! If you pick at your cheese with your painted nails it will taste horrible as well! : ) Helps them keep their germy hands away from their mouth just in time for flu season. I'm buying my second bottle right now, it really works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works like a charm!","review":"Used for my 2 yr old daughter's finger sucking...I only had to put it on once and she actually only tasted it maybe twice!

Important info...","review":"**Important to know**I read that a child's taste buds are not fully developed before 2 years old. The reviews that say this does not work were usually for children under 2. Your child needs to be able to TASTE this for it to work.

It took ONE application and he stopped completely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Completely Stops Finger Sucking and Nail Biting!","review":"My son has completely stopped chewing on his nails. My daughter had reverted to an old habit of sucking her index and middle finger. After using this product they have both stopped. She has not reverted back to sucking her fingers, but I do have to reapply it every other day on his to keep him from chewing his fingernails.

Best product we have used so far."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stop nail biting","review":"Our four year old bites the skin around her nails and her nails when she is nervous. The first time we used Mavala Stop it tasted so bad she almost threw up. The taste also got on her finger foods and made her not want to eat.

Making her nauseous is not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"lid glues shut!","review":"If you wash your hands or use antibacterial stuff, it comes off so you must reapply about every other day.

She agreed to try it and she hasn't sucked her thumb at all during the day for 4 weeks. We have found her sucking her thumb occasionally in the middle of the night (not sure how she can stand the taste but I don't think she realizes she's doing it). We never thought it would be this easy. She reminds us all the time to put it on and seems comforted and relieved that she has something to help her quit. We will gradually reduce the applications over the next month and see how it goes. I highly recommend this product to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best (worst tasting) stuff out there","review":"It feels odd that this product is getting such a great review for tasting so bad, but hey, that's the point.My problem wasn't nail biting so much as nervous finger chewing, causing ugly callouses. I do it absently while coding or reading at the computer, and was finding it hard to realize that I was doing it.The only thing I think is good to know about this is that it's more like a fingernail polish than a dollup of bad tasting stuff. It sits better on your fingernail than directly on your skin. And it lasts a while, so you can actually be flossing a few days later and still taste it.I see this more as the downside of a bad habit. Two weeks after applying this three times, I'm not *even* chewing my fingers anymore. Yuck, but cool!Oh, and stay away from that \\"Thum\\" stuff; totally ineffective for adults.

I read all of the reviews I could find, over 300. The main thing most of them had in common was that it worked. So even though it was supposed to not be used for children under 3, I used it. We only to use it 3 times and it was done. I told my son that it was special thumb medicine for scratching his face and put it on the day we got it. He told me it was yucky tasting. I had to put it on again the next day. The not again for another 5 days. Now, we are done. No more sucking and his face is starting to heal.

Needless to say he didnt like the taste and the experience. He kept at it for 3-4 days and we would occasionally hear him during his sleep. BUT believe it or not, he has now completely stopped it.

So, I began dabbing mavala onto all of her fingers. After 2 weeks, I'm happy to say she's no longer a thumbsucker!The only difficult part is that when finger feeding, she'd get the awful taste in her mouth. All in all, a small price to pay for the end result.Never had any vomiting issues as I've read on others' reviews, but again, I only used a tiny dab on each fingernail.

However, when the product came, there is NO safety seal on the outside box, and NO safety seal on the bottle cap. As a result, I'm afraid to use the product for fear of tampering or tainting. It's shocking to me that a product aimed for finger-suckers and nail-biters, and on the box states \\"An effective deterrent for adults and CHILDREN\\" has absolutely no safety seals to ensure the product can't be tainted or tampered with, in the long line of distribution from manufacturer to consumer!!!

It detered him for maybe 30 minutes ~ but that 30 minutes was filled with a HUGE meltdown after the initial taste was first discovered. While trying to restrain my son during this meltdown, I must have wiped my arm against my mouth and the taste is NASTY. I couldn't get the taste out of my mouth for at least 10 hours and that is after multiple teeth brushing and mouthwashings with Listerine.

The next night, I found her sucking those fingers. The third night, after my daughter's bath, I coated her fingers again.

It arrived yesterday and I figured I better try it on myself before I give it to her to see what I should expect, but I'm confused because it doesn't really taste like anything. It just tastes like really strong fingernail polish, but not horrible or disgusting as others have posted. I don't bite my nails, but I do occasionally put my nails in my mouth when I am bored or just sitting around and I just realized I had the nail I painted in my mouth and it really didn't have any affect on me whatsoever, it just started tasting a tiny bit bitter and that is how I remembered that it had the polish on it.I'm not sure if I got a bad/old batch, or if different taste buds perceive the taste differently.

I hate biting my nails now. It brings back memories of 'Nam, and I wasn't even born yet.CAUTION!CONS-you can't remove the taste from your nails right away, it'll slowly fade (usually gone by day 2 or 3, but you can reapply a fresh coat!), so if you're going to have any lady friends nibbling on your hands, you should probably warn them...-eating finger foods? not anymore.

I continued to use Mavala Stop on him for one week just in case there was a relapse.

He had to drink 2 huge cups of juice to get rid of the taste in his mouth, and has tried a couple times to put his thumb in again, but I haven't seen him sucking it at all...even at night. So that he doesn't just attribute the taste to the polish (and think it will go away), I put it on when he sleeps now, and told him that his fingers taste bad because he sucked them for so long.

The first time my daughter sucked on her thumb (after I applied Mavala) she was crying and spitting the whole night. I tried it too and I had a bad taste the whole night. And if my daughter dips her thumb in milk or water or any other food the whole thing gets bitter and can't be eaten. Not very happy with the product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works every time","review":"My mother used this on me and I used it on my daughter. Just works. No fuss. Best one out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Effective","review":"As awful as this tastes, our daughter, who is a major thumb sucker, said \\"well, not too bad\\" and kept rigth on sucking. It doesn't even slow her down. It does taste horrible though and does last a few days. Just didn't help habit...at all...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Great! Needs daily application.","review":"I purchased this to help my 10 yr. old daughter get ready for braces. She loved helping with the nightly application. She became very encouraged seeing her nails grow and stopping her childish habit. She earned a manicure several times during the process!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good product!!!","review":"This product really relieved alot of stress for my husband and I. I tried it myself first just too make sure my child would not get sick. we had tried another product but, made her very sick. After a couple of days she is no longer putting her fingers in her mouth. We owe it all to Mavala, thanks it really works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tastes Yuck but my daughter got used to it","review":"The product tasted really really bad. My daughter hated it so much that she felt like throwing up the first time we applied it to her nails. We wanted to get rid of her finger sucking habit. Looked like it worked during the first 2 days but then she stopped worrying about the taste and started sucking her fingers more. Guess she understood we were trying to get rid of her bad habit and so started doing it more. Might be its good for older people biting finger nails but not so good for 2 year old kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"does not work","review":"MY 3 year old daughter totally forgot this product was ever on her nail. And after using this product I noticed her hands are already dirty or bitter when shes putting her thumb in her mouth. I feel so stupid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stubborn Thumbsucker","review":"Okay so i ordered this product hoping it would help my 2yr old and 4yr old with sucking there thumbs and bitting her nails so very disappointed because my 2yr has gotten used to the taste and now she still sucks her thumb i don't know what to do. the first day it worked great and after that it was over just simply hopeless i guess."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING!","review":"My 4 and a half year old daughter was an addictive thumb sucker. I used Mavala. She was horrified by the taste - she put her thumb in her mouth twice with Mavala on and then never again. She has not sucked her thumb in 4 weeks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I bought this because of the positive reviews. My 3 year old sucks her thumb, and I am desperate to get her to stop. The product definitely smells bad, but my daughter just rubs it off and then sucks her thumb. I try to keep her from touching it so it has time to dry, but it doesn't seem to matter. It is a deterrent at best for us. Unfortunately, I won't recommend it. It might be a better product for a younger child who doesn't think to rub it off."},{"rating":"2","title":"YES! FINALLY, SOMETHING THAT WORKS!","review":"My daughter is 3 years old and has been sucking her two fingers since TWO DAYS OLD! This was the hardest thing to break her of. I tried everything but Mavala Stop worked, THE SAME DAY!! Her finger sucking was beginning to affect the growth of her teeth. I would definitely recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"does not work for my kid","review":"The box says it doesn't work for kids under three because of undeveloped taste buds but the online description does not (my kid is three-and-a-half). The serum is supposed to work for two days, but 24 hours later my kid is unaffected. I tasted it and it is just like wet nail polish. Maybe this will work on her next year...bummer."},{"rating":"2","title":"This stuff works!","review":"I ordered Mavala to stop my four year old from sucking her thumb. It has worked wonderfully! She also had a habit of biting nails/putting fingers in her mouth. She now grows her nails out and does not put her fingers in her mouth. This has to aid in less germs and sicknesses. Product is excellent. Would highly recommend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"ahhhhhmaaazing!!!!","review":"absolutely wonderful! friend sent me this product as we were desperate to have our 5 year old stop sucking his fingers!I mean nothing would work with him!we are still not 100% broken of the habbit, but we are 99% there!this product truly works! or it did for my son anyway!I would recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"Quick Shipping by the seller. The product works better than what we found in our local stores. Have been applying it once every 2 days to my sons fingers to keep him from biting. Seems to be working as I can tell his nails are growing.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enough for my stubborn 3 year old!","review":"When we started trying this product I was expecting it to take a while for my 3-year old (who is a serious thumb sucker) to give up that habit. That was not the case at all! My wife and I were extremely surprised at the instant effect this had on her. It's been 3 days, and she has not been sucking her thumb at all. I'm fully confident that she is now done with the disgusting habit. I'm not going to guarantee that this will work for your child, I can only tell you that my 3 year old is one of the most stubborn children I know and it worked for her."},{"rating":"1","title":"DOES NOT WORK","review":"My dentist strongly recommended this to me for my daughter at about 4-5 years old- she is now six and we are still using it to no avail (we have been trying to kick this habit since age TWO). She said it had a 100% success rate. Well, meet the first failure. I think maybe it did not work because we eat spicy and ethnic foods- not chicken nuggets and mac-n-cheese. Her palate can tolerate the strong taste. Either that or she is just determined to suck that thumb!! Hope it works for you. : ("},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked on my son","review":"My son has had a habit of sucking on his pointer and middle finger together at once since he was 4 months old. He was sucking on the fingers so much that he has sores on both of those fingers and the nails are extremely soft and brittle. Now he's 2 years and 8 months old and I desperately wanted him to shake the disgusting habit. I put this on both nails and 15 or so minutes later he stuck his fingers in his mouth. He shuddered and pulled them back out. It's been a week and his fingers haven't gone back in his mouth, not even while asleep. I'm still putting it on him every other day just in case but this was definitely money well spent! I just want to add that part of the reason this worked so well for us is firstly because my son is very sensitive to taste and secondly because once I ordered it, every time his fingers went into his mouth I would tell him that if he didn't stop his fingers would start to taste bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked great for my 3 year old!","review":"The dentist was putting pressure on us to help our 3 year old stop sucking his fingers. For a while we kept trying to remind him, but it never worked and he just felt bad. We were desperate and decided to try this. I got his buy-in prior to putting this on his fingers. We have been applying it for about 3 weeks now. We apply it after bath (3 nights per week) and it works great! It is just like clear nail polish; you cannot see it on his fingers. Every now and then he puts his finger subconsciously in his mouth, but removes it immediately. Yes I tried it....it tastes horrible! My son is very proud of his success. I highly recommend this product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work for us","review":"Bought this for our 3 year old. He ended up just biting anyway and the stuff seemed to wear off quickly once that started. We've tried is on several different occasions now over the course of a year and he still bites."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"I'm serious...this \\"magic juice\\" as we called it worked so fast! Within two days my son completely stopped sucking his thumb. Homerun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stopped our 4yr-old thumb sucking immediately","review":"Our 4yr old daughter stopped sucking her thumb in one day -- no joke. She was constantly sucking her thumb, when she was tired, bored, scared, hungry, and all through the night. We tried everything else like bandages, gloves, positive and negative reinforcement. But nothing was going to come between her and her thumb. One taste of the Mavala Stop on her thumb and she never wanted to put her thumb in her mouth again. A week later we've stopped using it and the habit is broken, no more sucking. I know this product won't work for every child, but it was the perfect solution for our child."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Product","review":"Wow, what can I say. This product is amazing. I have been biting my nails for 28 years and finally a product that has stopped me. Thanks so much and May God Bless You!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"too powerful","review":"I tried this with my 12 year old son to get him to stop nail biting. He stopped. But it rubbed off his fingers on to other parts of his hand or face so he ended up tasting it even if he was not biting his nails. When that happened he refused to keep using it."}]`),M={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:E},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:x,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},C={class:"card-container"},O=["disabled"],N={key:0},B={key:1};function W(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=w("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",C,[(a(!0),i(y,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",B,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",N,"See more"))],8,O)):b("",!0)])}const H=d(M,[["render",W],["__scopeId","data-v-40fe9ae1"]]),P=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotesmag/66.md","filePath":"quotesmag/66.md"}'),R={name:"quotesmag/66.md"},L=Object.assign(R,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(H)]))}});export{P as __pageData,L as default};
