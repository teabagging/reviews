I read reviews about it getting stuck, but I haven't had that problem.

But remember their is no zoom on a prime lens, so be prepared to run around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Fragile!!!","review":"I love the photos that I took with this lens. I had the lens for about 11 months and it was one of my favorites. I was very gentle with the lens and it was never dropped. Around 11 months of having the lens, the glass lens and ring fell out of the barrel as I was taking off the lens cap. The camera had not been dropped, damaged or bumped. It is a poorly constructed lens and is made of cheap plasics parts on the barrel of the lens. If you want to buy a cheap lens and are okay with replacing it every 6 to 12 months, then get this one. If you want to make a lasting purchase, then go with the 50mm 1.4."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome results!!","review":"I purchased this after watching/reading numerous reviews and felt I needed this lens. I am using this on a canon 60d and currently been using the kit 18-135mm which has given me great results too. With this 50mm, am I able to capture images that have a completely different feel and has capabilities of creating awesome bokeh!! The bokeh you get at 1.8 is superb especially at this price! Images are also very sharp and contain very good color. The lens focuses pretty quick with noisier than average motor sound. No big deal. Yes, it feels plasticky, but if you take care of your equipment, it should last. I've only owned if for a few weeks, so I can't comment on long term use, but I expect I will be able to do so. People say you can't not own this lens. I agree!! For the price you can't go wrong. If you only use a kit lens on any camera and want a different lens for whatever reason, this is what you should get!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Portrait Lens","review":"This is by far the best lens for portraits I have used.....It is worth much more than the money you pay!

DO IT.Those cheap, slow telephoto glass that they throw in with all the kits are trash and will discourage you from making images.

A lot of people mention the build quality as being poor, this is true. I do not think the lens would just fall apart like some people have been reporting, those are obviously defective models. I've had mine for about 4 months now and it has been a great photographic companion. If your looking to expand your camera's creativity capabilities for a total bargain buy this lens, I can't imagine someone being disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best lens for the money, every EOS owner should have one.","review":"5 star for value and picture quality.With the money of 1.4 version, I can have 4 of this, you only lost half stop of aperture.

I mean that literally! It has rendered many sharp and colorful pictures!Also, I know that the build quality has been condemned universally, but for some reason I don't think the build-quality is all \\"that\\" bad.Obviously, for the price, anyone who has a EOS 20D or Rebel XT (both of which I own) or a contemporary Canon 35mm film camera should own one of these!I love and recommend this lens!"},{"rating":"1","title":"made in malaysia, not japan","review":"I purchased this product based on the info that amazon is an authorized dealer for canon products in USA.

Then, based on this info, I purchased this lens, however the one amazon sent me is made in Malaysia. Also, box was not sealed and there was no us warranty card, that means this product was a grey market product which you can buy from other dealers for a lower price. I return it and will buy from other dealers."},{"rating":"2","title":"No IS","review":"This is a great lens and works perfectly.

Out of the box I noticed dust on inside of lens and a possible scratch. I still tried to use the lens since I had read reviews about the lens taking on dust and usually its not a big deal unless its at the center. One day of shooting and the sharpness I had been reading about just wasn't there. Packed it up and returned it. Love Amazon.Disappointed, was really looking forward to a sharp lens. Possibly got a bad copy? Don't know."},{"rating":"1","title":"good but not what i was looking for","review":"This lens was too zoomed in for me I wanted a 28mm but didnt know exactly how the mm's worked out but I guess a 50 is like a 75? anyways I guess if you like standing back from the photos you shoot then this is for you.

Having looked through both Zeiss and Leica,Alpen RAINIER 8x42 Waterproof Roof Prism BinocularI was amazed how little difference there was between the Alpen and the more expensive brands,especially considering that they cost over $1000.00 more. It is comforting to know that the Alpen has a lifetime warranty. The Rainier has a really fast focus to keep the birds in sight. It comes with a very nice case, rain guard, and neck strap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken before first use!!!","review":"I got this lens for Christmas. Got it out of the box to try it out yesterday. I accidentally dropped it, not a big drop just a small drop but onto a tile floor. The lens broke in half and is unrepairable. Warranty does not cover drops. Do not buy this item! It is plastic and cheap. We all have those accidents, and I have dropped my other lens in even worse conditions, and they survived just fine. Spend a little more and get the metal body it will pay for itself in the long run.If you do ignore this warning, prepare yourself for buying a replacement or be extremely careful with it.

Had it for a couple of weeks and I can't stop using it. Incredible sharpness and at a 1.8 the background completely blows out. For the price you can't get a better deal. It's plastic build and over time it will acquire some wear and tear much easier than the 1.4. But with the quality of image this lens produces, it's a no brainer wether or not to buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Quality","review":"I am taking picture with this lens for a while.

The images are quite sharp and the f1.8 aperture allows you to achieve great depth of field and decent bokeh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great lens for the money","review":"I heard this lens called \\"Plastic Fantasic\\" somewhere. The description fits. It is light and a bit flimsy feeling and I wouldn't bang it around but then I don't do that to my expensive lenses either. The image quality from this is, in a word, ... \\"Fantastic\\". I don't need the faster version myself and could purchase many of these for that price. If you need the speed, spend the money on the better ones.

Not only is it one of the sharpest lenses I have ever used, it gives you a ton more flexibility for shooting in low light situations. Plus, the depth of field and bokeh when shooting wide open is astounding!On another note, the 50mm focal length (when used with the correct magnification viewfinder) represents the normal magnification of the human eye. I got a chance to shoot with this lens on a 40D and I could easily shoot with both eyes open, therefore dramatically reducing eye fatigue.Sure, it is quite lightweight and a little more plasticky than I would normally prefer, but for the price you really can't go wrong. Cheap, sharp, and fast...that's how I like it. Great for macro shots when reversed as well. Every SLR photographer, no matter how novice or advanced, should have one of these little guys in their gear bag."},{"rating":"2","title":"3D Photography, amongst other things.","review":"For may years now I have been involved in beam-splitting for 3D. First with my Pentax, then with my Canon EOS 10S. I found that the best overall quality for my stereo work came from the Canon using a 50MM, f1.8 lens as in this ad. The focal length, and clarity, linked up with my beam-splitter gave me the results that I desired.Recently,I purchased a Canon Rebel XTi. For beam-splitting, I use the 50mm lens from my 10S. The results of course is outstanding. Keep in mind though that I only use this lens for my 3D work. I have 3 other high end Canon lenses which I use for the majority of my work.The lens in this ad is perfect for portaits (and 3D), but should be seen as an auxilliary lens, not the primary one.Mary-Margaret"},{"rating":"2","title":"conon 50mm lens","review":"Just as item was described.

Some of my best portraits have been taken with this lens. And with f/1.8, you can do handheld pictures in much less light.However, be careful as to not move after you focus when shooting wide open. A deviation of only a couple of inches could result in a slightly out of focus subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"Price & Performance","review":"I wanted a fixed focal length lens for my Rebel since I heard they work better than some of the lenses that come with the cameras. For the price this cannot be beat, great shots and decent overall performance. Since it a fixed length lens it is limited in what it can be used for, so if you were shooting a family gathering this is not one you would want, unless you just want to shoot more potrait type images. Small and light enough though to carry with a general lens for the times you are looking for what a lens with this focal length is meant to do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Portrait Lens","review":"Great for the price! Excellent for Portraits and artsy photography. Made of plastic, no zoom feature. You also have to stand back further than you would think due to it being 50mm."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very very pleased","review":"The lens is great. I used it to test my Xsi as I was having focusing problems and it revealed it clearly. I sent my camera on warranty repair and came back perfect. The low f-stop allows you to see the screen marking in low light. The only drawback is the build which OK for my use. Sharpness wise its great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good lens for indoor sports","review":"I use this lens for photographing my daughters basketball games. For the price this is a great lens.

Definitely worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth It While It Lasts","review":"I do not regret buying this lens. I got a good year and a half out of it. I produced beautiful images and received many compliments, everyone always wanting to know what lens I used.With the 1.8, you get great versatility. The only time I had legitimate problems was in really, really bright sunlight.I'm going to be quite honest. While the quality of this lens's pictures does degrade significantly after the first few months you have it, with good upkeep, you can keep it awhile. Mine never really \\"broke\\" - I never had the front half fall off like what happens to most people with this lens - numerous bumps and falls and sand from the beach eventually took their toll."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very loud focus","review":"I would have gotten the 40mm, or the 50mm f1.4 if I knew how slow and LOUD this lense is; it also feels very cheap.

I was thrilled to have a lightweight lens for my Canon 7D as the other lenses I have are quite heavy. Although it had a plastic casing, so many reviewers felt it produced excellent images. I was sold and agreed this was good purchase and, indeed, I liked the images produced with this lens.However, now I have a different perspective about the lens. In the middle of taking a photo about a month after purchase, the front of the lens literally fell to the ground. I could not believe it came apart. This also damaged my Tiffen UV Protector filter. I have contacted the seller and will await the response before commenting about customer service. Perhaps I just received a defective lens and all will be remedied with a replacement. None the less, I wanted to post this review as a indication that perhaps you get what you pay for!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Confused","review":"I read all the great reviews and I was sold. This is the lens for the price.

I bought it because the kit zoom lens on my cannon xs is not suited for indoor lighting, and I didn't have a lot of money to spend on a fast zoom lens.

For a little more that 100 bucks can't beat it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Starter lens","review":"This was my first non-kit lens. LOVE IT.

I've probably taken over 2-3000 pictures with it so far.The only drawbacks I have seen, are what most people have seen:The auto-focus can be a bit \\"pokey\\" in the dark/low light situations - sometimes even in good lighting conditions. Learn to use the manual focus.It's plastic. Yep, like others have said. That's one of the things you need to deal with when you pay $100 for a great lens.The only other complaint I really have is that it took over a month to get to me - it was supposed to be my Christmas present, but I didn't get it until the third week in January. We ordered it on December 10 or so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent value","review":"I've used this lens for about two months now and, so far, I love it. I use it on my crop-sensor Canon 7D which makes the lens equivalent to an 80mm.My copy of this lens is really sharp at f/2.8 - 4.0 which has allowed me to take very nice portraits with smooth bokeh. AF is a little loud, but with my 7D, fast and accurate.It has no outer threads for a lens hood. I bought a 3rd party lens hood which screws onto the inner filter threads.I've read some other reviews where this lens can be easily broken by over tightening the filters or lens hoods.It is VERY lightweight. It appears to have same quality in construction as do the Canon kit lenses so be careful not to drop it.This lens is an excellent value at about $100."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great","review":"Everything about this lens is perfect. Great quality pictures, good size for everyday pictures, and awesome price. The only thing I would consider is the plastic mount. I would have preferred a metal mount like the 50mm f1.4, but thats a couple hundred more.Great kit lens replacement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best bang for your buck lens.","review":"I was a little concerned about getting this lens at the beginning due to the fixed zoom nature of the lens. Once I got it, I slowly fell in love with it. There is a lot of trust you place on this lens that the entire frame of interest fits within the picture. What I realized was that for most day-to-day shots this works. Hopefully you are not a sports photographer or interested in shooting wildlife for this woud not work as well. It is great for candid, close-up shots. Play with the f-stops depending on your end goal. the 1.8 f-stop is new for me and I love it for the low light shooting opportunities. I had a kick-[...] time on New-Year's day taking shots of the fire works. Finally, for the $100, it is worth adding to your suit of lenses."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lens for Christmas","review":"I purchased this lens as a Christmas gift for my spouse.

They are made ten times better than the lenses they are selling today.This lens does the job for the most part, but I would not recommend it or purchase it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Out of the box goodness","review":"Easy to use, right out of the box.I've been using it consistently for 3 weeks. Yesterday I noticed that it wasn't registering bright light situations as well as some of my other lenses, but it responds well to low light. A distance of 2-3' seems to be its sweet spot. This is definitely worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is indeed Nifty","review":"Ok so basically i call this a disciplinary lens , since it is a fixed lens it definitely teaches you to zoom with your feet and forces you to experiment with range. Although it is a low light lens , DO NOT be disappointed when the auto focus creeps. The AF sucks. I rarely use AF on any lens always MF. The depth of field is really strong so its great for portrait photos. The casing is made of plastic but I haven't had any problems with it. I personally love the lens. ( i find that you either love it or hate it . . . although i think if you hate you don't know how to use it )"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic beginner lens, makes people beautiful!","review":"I know people will argue that there are \\"better\\" portrait lenses but for around a c-note this is as good as it gets.For a beginner, just getting a DSLR means you are in awe of how much better your pictures look... but this lens will make your friends love you that much more. It makes people's faces/skin look fantastic (especially since it works so well in low-light you can usually go without flash... and on-camera flash is the ugly-maker)!Get this lens, and then count how many of your friends start using pictures from it for the Facebook profiles... if you could get a dollar from each of them it'd pay for the lens in no time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"Awesome lens for such a great price. Using this on Canon 7D and taking video with it is amazing. If you want a Prime that is great, has low f-stop and produces great images and video look no further.

After checking out various reviews of the 50mm 1.8 I decided to purchase. For around $100 you cannot ask for a better upgrade. I had no idea how much better my pictures could possibly be. I totally recommend, I have kept this lens on my camera for 3 months now and take LOTS of pictures. Love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Light and Tight Nifty Fifty","review":"This is a very good lens for beginners. It is fast and does very good in low-light situations (just open it up and bump the ISO).There may be other lenses with a better Bokeh, but they are way more $$$$$-expensive-$$$$$ than this. If you're just printing regular sized photos (4x6's and 5x7's), you won't notice any difference. The lens is light, a plus when you have to carry your camera for hours. The plastic casing is fine as long as you don't drop it. It's so cheap, just get another one if you break it.I highly recommend every n00bs to get one. This lens is a very good way to learn the basics of SLR photography."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful lens, great price","review":"This is my first non-kit SLR lens that I've owned and very happy with the performance thus far. The fast f/1.8 aperture is wonderful to use in low-light conditions, especially indoors. On top of it, the narrow depth-of-field at that aperture blurs the background nicely for wonderful portraits. I've heard the lens is rather fragile and the plastic construction is not durable, but keep in mind you are getting a fast SLR lens for close to a bill. I have only had it a month but believe it will hold up well if you take care of it. If you wanted something more professional or sturdy, you could spend triple the price and get the upgraded f/1.4 lens, the choice is yours..."},{"rating":"2","title":"shocking results","review":"This lens cost me $85. The image quality worth 1 million dollar. Sharp, sharp and sharp. Excellent saturation and contrast. Compare to my sigma 17-50, I feel shame to have the sigma lens. Just returned sigma 17-50.

I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good for the price","review":"My own opinions on this lens are very similar to what I have read elsewhere, viz., that it is a very good lens for the price. Testing showed the first lens I got to be pretty soft, especially around the edges and especially at f/1.8 and f/2. I returned it and Amazon very graciously sent me another which was better. In summary I would say that at f/4 and above it is really quite sharp, and you have the higher speed if you need it. Stick to the center of the lens (at the higher apertures) if you can. Not the best lens in the bag, but not too shabby either.rps"},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good lens","review":"I have used this lens for 3 months and find out this is really useful, espacially for taking close-up facepictures.

My wife has told me to buy one for our camera and I agree with her. No zoom if that is what you're looking for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Lens","review":"The price is fairly cheap for a nice lens. Yes, you have to use your feet to get closer but the lens does take great pictures. It doesn't focus as fast as the 85mm for sports but it is a good lens at a bargain price. If you can use this length of lens, you won't be disappointed with the results."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great if you get a good one","review":"This is probably the best value in any lens. The problem is finding one that is good. I had to return two of these because they produced blurry results and the autofocus seemed unreliable.The third I bought was so much better than the first two. It was hard to believe that they are the same product. Canon is offering this lens for a little over $100 and that is amazing. However the value comes at a cost, quality control. Even the box is tiny and the documentation is crammed in it.I think this lens when working as intended deserves 5 stars. Quality control is lacking and I had to go through three before finding one that was good. Maybe I just had bad luck, but that's my reasoning for taking off a star.If you find you're not getting sharp images and the autofocus hunts more than you feel it should, send it back and get another one. For me there was a ridiculous difference between a good copy and the poor ones. Night and day,"},{"rating":"2","title":"fantastic plastic","review":"My husband loves it!!

I would highly recommend this to anyone who is looking for a good overall lens AND a fabulous price. This is Canon's cheapest lens, but don't let that scare you from getting it!Since it has a 1.8 aperture, it handles low light or night photography VERY well.The only thing I have against it is the construction of it. It does seem a little cheaply made, but I think the great quality of the images and the awesome price overrides this fact. Simply put, don't ever, ever drop your camera. This was my second time to buy this lens because I broke my first one by dropping my camera.Once again, I highly recommend this lens!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quite so","review":"This lens is nice outdoors, but sucks in low light indoor photography!

Like... HATE.","review":"So I ordered and attached this f/1.8 50mm lens to my Rebel T1i after reading all the awesome reviews about it. Here is what I thought.1) It was awesome in low light setting.2) Image quality is GREAT... when focused.3) I started to notice that the auto focus was missing about every 2-3 shots.4) I went to swap another lens on the camera and the 50mm f/1.8 II would not come off. It turned about 1/4\\" and would simply stop. I looked this problem up online and found that I am not alone. Shady construction of this lens is to blame. I did nothing wrong. It simply broke because it's built cheap.The good news is that I called Canon customer support and they are going to fix it (within warranty) and send it back. I won't ever put this lens back on my camera. Spend the $$ and get the f/1.4 50mm. This one is garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing !!","review":"Delivery was very prompt.

I'm amazed of the results, especially considering the price. My friend paid 249 for the lens alone (Nikon). I paid 130 for the KIT. We could'nt resist comparing our lens and honestly, Canon's lens is as good as the Nikon. The Nikon is a tiny bit sharper (full cropping shows it) but the bokeh is better (alot) on the Canon. Colors and contrast are similar.Again, for the price, this is a no brainer-get it! The results are amazing, especially if your are using a kit lens and want a sharper, quicker, brighter lens.My Canond 60D with that piece produces photo good enough for magazine :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent value for the money","review":"Truly \\"good\\" lenses start at $400, so you should probably know what to expect when buying a $100 lens. It's not going to be perfect, but this is a great performer for the price.Image quality (sharpness, lack of chromatic aberration etc.) is totally acceptable under good lighting and subject conditions. Under less than ideal conditions (wide dynamic range, high contract subjects etc), it doesn't fare quite as well, but that should be expected from a lens at this price.My biggest complaints? It feels cheap and light, almost toy-like, and consists of mostly plastic construction. Also, you can't help but notice how loud the autofocus is, it kind of took me by surprise at first. But again, for the price you expect such things!Bottom line - this is a great \\"starter\\" lens, the price/performance simply cannot be beat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great lens","review":"This lens has been on my camera for a month now, and I love it. I have always use a 70-200 f4L, but this little booger is sweet. Don't get me wrong, I love my \\"Money Maker 70-200\\", but this little guy can REALLY throw the back out of focus with the 1.8.I have not seen the Pentagon shaped flares that I have read about when throwing the back out of focus, but I have also not had lights shining at me from back there.I am sure the L version, would have a better bokeh, but this guy has been great for me.I will probably get an L, but I figured for a little over 100 bucks, I could play with this focal legnth, and make sure I wanted one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Lens","review":"I shoot alot of portraits and this lens came in very handy for me..

Worth every penny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great lens and all, but handle with care!","review":"I agree with most comments here. It's a lot of bang for the buck. But this lens is not robust and should be handled with care. Because the mount is made of plastic instead of metal, frequent switching between lenses can cause damages and in worst case it won't come off anymore. My 50mm got completely stuck and I had to resort using brutal force to remove it from the body, destroying the lens in the end. Fortunately my body remained intact. My advice is to be careful and always take the lens off very gently and firmly push the unlock button. Although I loved the pictures I shot with this lens, the build quality just put me off. But in fairness what to expect for a 100 euros (130 dollars). So my next 50mm will be the 1.4.~ Jan Willem, Netherlands"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great lens for the price.","review":"I have to say that this is a great and affordable lens that is so small and light to carry.

Granted, I only own four, but for the price...wow! The thrifty/nifty fifty can't be beat. It's especially wonderful for portraits. I don't use it often as an all-purpose lens as, if you're trying to capture a wide scene or several people in one shot, you have to step way, way back. Prime lenses can only do so much. But this compact, light-weight lens goes a long way toward making me feel competent. I honestly don't feel I need to go down to the 1.4 for much of anything and am completely happy with this guy. I dropped and broke my first one and ordered another right away. Get it, you won't be sorry!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It does what is intended, wider aperture.","review":"Works as expected, great for lower lite photos and shallow depth of field.

Other than the obvious benefits of faster shutter speeds in low light and a shallow depth-of-field for portraits, there is the added benefit of improved autofocus performance.Combined with the Auto White Balance (or custom, if you prefer) of today's digital cameras, available light photos are now more realistic than ever. You can now do those existing light photos and get the colors the way you see them, not yellow or green because of the light source indoors!This lens is very good optically. Although made of cheaper materials mechanically, it has a good record of reliabilty.

Others say the build quality feels cheap but I don't think this is a big issue, considering I take very good care of my camera equipment (never dropped anything once ;p) It goes great with my Canon Rebel T2i, considering the T2i is also made of plastic. FYI,on APSC sensored cameras, this 50mm lens acts more like an 80mm due to the 1.6x crop and is perfect for portraits. Overall, This is the best $100 you'll ever spend on a Canon lens.

I've heard quite a few complaints that the f/1.4 motor fails after a short amount of use, and feared spending 2x as much on a product I may have to quickly replace. While I've only had this lens for a short period of time, it does the job for me! I'm very amateur, but this lens has created great images with a sharp focus, and beautifully blurred background. I'll be sure to post some images soon! Some complain of the noisy motor, doesn't bother me! While the body is fairly light weight, I think if you handle it properly and don't toss it around, it should last the desired amount of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent photos!","review":"Just like most of the other reviewers stated that you can't go wrong getting this lens. The 1.8 gives a depth of field that is beautiful for portraits, pets, flowers and objects. But remember, this is not a macro lens. I was also surprised by the sharpness. Although I am spoiled by the 18-55 wide angle versatility of the lens that came with my camera this lens takes better photos in sharpness and beauty. You have to step-back more often to get the shot. I think of it as an old school lens like when I had my first film SLR. I also got the recommended lens shade which also makes the lens look a little \\"cooler\\" and adds protection. Of course, if you have a $1000 to burn then look for another lens but for this price, you get a lens that will give you professional looking results at a fraction of the cost of professional lenses!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT lens for the money","review":"I'll admit this was an impulse purchase.

It is a surprisingly cheap lens for the performance that it delivers. I highly suggest that evey photographer has it among their other pricey lenses. It was well worth the money. Thanks Canon and Thanks Amazon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Amazing!","review":"This is one amazing product that I bought for my camera. At first I was so hesitant to buy this lens but it's all worth it. The picture came out nice and crisp."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great first timer lens","review":"I just bought this lens and thus far I am so impressed I can't wait to get some of the L lenses if they are any comparison to this prime lens! Sharp quality pictures and a lot of fun to play with as a newbie to the field. This is my first prime lens and it won't be my last, and you can't beat the price! It really is something you should get along with your camera if you are purchasing one as it won't add onto the hit your wallet takes, but it will add a great deal to your pictures! LOVE IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Like a toy, but man is it sharp.","review":"I've had this for a day or two and snapped some pics and was extremely impressed with the IQ on my XSi. All the reviews are correct that this is a very sharp lens. I'm sure it'll take some nice action shots and portraits of the kid. At f/1.8 it does soak up the light too.I compared it to 50mm on my Canon 17-85mm and to 70mm on my Canon 70-300mm and it is way sharper. I know that's not scientific and I just used the LCD to view the pics, but it's pretty obvious this thing has some nice optics.It does look and feel like a toy, but I knew that and no loss of points for that. It's so tiny and all plastic'y, but I will use my kid gloves with it. If you are curious, just buy it. If I were going to use this thing a lot and not be too careful, I'd probably splurge for the 50mm f/1.4 since it's more rugged with a metal mount, but for the price of this one, as someone said, I could buy 4 of these for the price of the f/1.4."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"This is a wonderful lens!!! Can't believe it took me so long to buy it. I do puppy pictures in half the time!!

Overall, I've been happy with the quality of my pictures, but not really impressed. My interest in taking photography to the next level started when I cut a check to a professional photographer to take pictures of my kids. Good grief! A friend recommended this lens and off I went. The prime lens requires that you be a more active photographer, but that's actually kind of fun. My primary shooting consists of indoor/outdoor shots of my kids and it works beautifully for that. I would highly encourage anyone that wants to take it to the next level try this lens AND get some good post-processing software. This lens plus Adobe Lightroom have made a world of difference in my photos."},{"rating":"2","title":"Satisfied","review":"Love this lens! Came exactly as described, and couldn't work better.

I have only had it for a few days, and have already learned so much about using my camera. It is small and compact, and will make going out in the city to take pictures much easier than it was before with the bulky kit lens."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was disappointed...","review":"I received my lens quickly in the mail and of course immediately started playing with it as soon as I got it. First off, the motor is INCREDIBLY loud. Secondly, it wouldn't focus in auto mode and continued to distort the colors. I don't know if this is just me or this is true for everyone. It was usable on manual focus and I had to keep playing with the exposure settings and white balance for it to expose correctly and be true to color. Keep in mind this was with the same environment. The pictures I got after all these adjustments were nice but I'd sooner save the 100 bucks and put it towards upgrading to the USM motor. Unfortunately, mine is going back immediately."},{"rating":"2","title":"Takes in more than I expected","review":"When you have less than a full-frame DSLR, the lenses are effectively longer because they focus the light on a smaller sensor. I have always thought of a 55mm lens on a 35mm film camera to be what the human eye sees. This lens, with an effective length of about 70mm compared to film (please don't rely on this math!) takes in much more field than I expected. Inside at the Thanksgiving meal, I had to step forward to narrow in on my subjects. The speed is fabulous, the pictures great, the lens excellent!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value","review":"Great optics but the plastic mount makes it feel a bit unsubstantial (the only reason for the 4 stars). You will, however, be very impressed with the sharpness and the blurr factor when used at fast apertures; it is a great portrait lens. If you have a Canon EF mount, you just cannot justify not owning it when it is under $100???Unless you have an \\"L\\" class lens to cover this range, in which case you probably wouldn't be reading this review."},{"rating":"2","title":"Focus is off at f2.8 or less","review":"Phase detect autofocus is off at apertures greater than f2.8 (to f1.8)Have to switch to contrast detect or live view focus - which this camera is not fast.I don't know how the 50mm 1.4 would compare but my Panasonic GF1 20mm f1.7 focus sharpness is far superior to this lens - when wide open.I miss my GF1 20mm - it's so sharp. I'm considering going back to GF1."},{"rating":"2","title":"REALLY AWESOME LENS","review":"I HAVE SEEN THIS LENSE IN ACTION, BELIEVE ME YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED.

I am likely to buy another one of these lenses, because they take EXCELLENT pictures. But when people talk about how flimsy the lens is, they aren't whistling dixie. I broke one of these lenses accidentally in a fluke accident that would not have damaged ANY of my other lenses. It's a problem because I'd gotten so used to using this lens it became my default. If you do happen to purchase this lens either be prepared to buy another one--and given that it is comparatively inexpensive this may not be a problem--or be prepared to really really care for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great glass, junk construction","review":"I use mostly canon L-series glass. I was thrilled with the performance of this lens-- super sharp-- but dismayed when the lens rolled off my pelican case and fell 7 inches *onto carpet* and broke clean in two. Ridiculous. I've handled a earlier version (with a metal) mount that felt far more robust."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best for the Money","review":"Images with this lens are RAZOR sharp, cant ask for more out of a lens. Would like it to have a metal mount, but for the money you cant complain... would have paid twice this if need be. Actually... I bought two. One for my father because he was so impressed with the lens: and he was a pro for 20 years shooting with only AT-X glass."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good lens for the price","review":"Very good for portait, even in indoor dim light condition.

Totally worth the price - actually worth twice the price. Get this lens - you need it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this lens","review":"I bought a 50mm 1.8 MKII in the Philippines for 70 bucks used. I love this lens, sharp, light, and quick. It was soo cheap that i just bought another one for 75 yesterday just because it was so cheap. This is by far the best investment that i have made for my camera. I never have any problems with it. It NEVER leaves my 500D one because i love this lens, and 2 because my friend dropped my kit and it needs recalibration lol. I HIGHLY recommend this lens. I am an amateur photographer who does not have a job, still in high school, and has to pay his own gas. This lens is what really is paying me not my camera."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Lens for the Price","review":"Got this lens after doing a lot of research and was the best lens for the money. Great photos the only drawback is that during focus makes a lot of noise but other than that it's a great buy and would recommend any one to get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good lens for the price","review":"For less then $150 you can't find a better deal for a lense. Being able to shoot without a flash is great in alot of situations and i was stunned at the sharp picture quality even when down at f1.8. I'd be looking at a room that looked sort of dark and the picture would come up and the room looked brighter then i thought the shot would come out like.One thing to note is that on my XSi body and the 1.6 crop factor it turns this from a 50mm to more like a 80mm. So taking shots of things close up requires you to step back a little bit which can sometimes be annoying. As a result i'm planning on also getting the 28mm f1.8 which will give me a little more wide angle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great lens for the money","review":"This is a great lens for the money. It's a huge step up from the kit lens. What a difference. A great portrait lens."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't be beat for the price","review":"Great lens for the price. Photos are razor sharp. f 1.8 for $$125? Can't beat it for the price. As you may of guessed this feels like a toy, not a tank."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheaply Great","review":"Great starter prime lens. Very light and easy on the wallet. The only thing is the build quality... Extremely cheap. I do recommend this lens to people who do not own any prime lenses, I really enjoyed it strait out of the package and it was very easy to use. After a nice weekend with the 28mm 1.8, I quickly felt the quality difference and lost the love i once had for this lens. I will keep it as a backup always as it is VERY small and light and only takes about half a lens spot in my bag."},{"rating":"2","title":"great lens","review":"I started out with the bog standard 18-55 canon lens that shipped with my EOS 1000D. I began getting frustrated that the quality of my photos were not as I wished them to be in terms of clarity and colour, espeially for food photography, even though I was sure I was working the camera properly. After purchasing this lens, my photos are a lot better immediately. and its great value for money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheaply made","review":"Okay. So I ordered this lens two weeks ago and I'm pretty sure I wore it out. It's plastic and very cheaply made. The lens literally fell apart. I would reccommend spending around $200 more and getting the 1.6 because it is made from metal and not plastic.I must praise the picture quality, though. I was very pleased with the detail that it picked up when the f-stop was low. The pictures were so clear and crisp. I really couldn't believe I got that quality from a $100 lens.In conclusion, this lens is cheap and will fall apart if you're a photographer that uses your camera everyday. But you do get what you pay for, image quality wise. Just note that it's extremely fragile and will break without you dropping, slamming, throwing, etc. I never even bumped mine on anything and it still fell apart."},{"rating":"2","title":"sweet","review":"for 100 bucks it sure turns my canon vixia hf11 into a different machine. with the aid of an adapter i can now get that depth of field look i need. Be careful, its very easily breakable. broke mine first day, first hour. i read reviews on canon website that say the same. it has something to do with the way it is built were the focus ring is in an awkward position. after i reverse engineered it, the thing still works perfectly. I would recommend this to everyone in need of a good cheap pro lens, but please keep it in bubble wrap all the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great for low-light video","review":"I got this because I frequently shoot video in low-light situations with my Canon 5D and needed a lens that could do the job.Well -- this one DOES, and then some. I used it today to film some interviews in a dimly-lit meeting room and the results are beautiful. It nicely achieved the coveted blurred-background look while my foreground subject looks clear & crisp.Not being able to zoom with this lens actually makes the filming easier. Just set up the camera, position the subject and you're good to go.And I don't find this lens to feel as \\"cheap\\" as some others on here have said. It's well worth the price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great lens use it till it pukes.","review":"super cheap lens. but also sharp as a tack. everyone should start out with this lens as a step up from a kit lens. i had it for years first on a film canon 3. then on my first digital camera the canon 1d. loved this on the 1.3 crop. works great on a 1.6 crop as well. i would recommend it to anyone needing a super sharp fast prime lens. great for portraits i always wanted the 1.4 but this one was so good that i kept it until it puked. it didnt actually puke i really dropped it with the weight of a 20d with a grip on it. landed right on the front of the lens right before a shoot to boot. its a sharp lens sharp as an l zoom. but not as solidly built as the original canon 1.8 but they are hard to find and are about 100 bucks more then the 50mm 1.8 ii. i now have the 1.4 and i love it. even sharper and stronger built. still not an l lens so i wouldnt want to drop it. if you are paying for photography i would get this 1.8. if photography is paying you i would get the 1.4."},{"rating":"1","title":"Optically Fine, Poor Build Quality","review":"I bought this lens for my daughter's Canon Rebel camera. Although I read the reviews and understood that the lens had questionable build quality, I concluded that for the price and given the Canon name, it would be ok for a teenager. Sadly, when I received it I was surprised to find it was almost entirely plastic... almost toy-like. After about 90 days, the lens became jammed on the camera and could not be removed. I have owned 4 Canon DSLR's and 10 EOS lenses and none have ever jammed in the camera mount like this. Ultimately, the plastic casing around the lens fell apart while we attempted to remove the lens. Very disappointing. I am sending it back, but I really don't want it replaced because the way it is built it will not hold up under any sort of field use. A minor bump will damage the casing around the lens."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Images, But Mildly Disappointing","review":"What's great about this lens is:1) Sharp images with great color, imperceptible distortion, no fringing. This is really what it's all about, right?2) Lens front does not rotate when focusing, allowing the use of polarizers and graduated ND filters. Rarely found in a lens at this price.3) Excellent price, which leads to a great value.I'd wish for (even if it costs more):1) More solid construction, as mentioned elsewhere,2) A USM motor - the lack of which means this lens is slower to focus & a bit louder compared to Canon's USM lenses, and3) Full-time manual focusing ability. (The USM motor would fix this too.)Every photographer should have a \\"nufty fifty.\\" For the price, this lens should be in every EOS shooter's bag."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this lens","review":"I bought this lens to use on my Rebel T3i and so far it works great. The portraits look great and I also like the bokeh produced. I have had no problems removing this lens as others have. My only complaint is that it does take awhile to focus sometimes and hunts around but for the price, it wont be a real loud complaint."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lens","review":"This Lens is a great entry level fixed lens. I have been using this on my Cannon T2i camera and it has been taking some wonderful pictures. The only issue is the auto focus, its to slow and non-reactive. However, this problem is quickly rectified by taking the automatic setting off and just manually adjusting the focus ring. Overall this seems like a high quality product, and the quality of my pictures is definitely risen to a height which was unattainable with a standard kit lens."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awesome for 2 months, now blurry","review":"I have hardly used this lens and abused it in no way. After 2 months it's no good to me because I can't get a sharp picture out of it. The AF is way off. If I manually focus I can come close, but no cigar. All my other lenses are awesome so I know its not the cameras fault."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nifty fifty!","review":"No photographer should be without this lens! The price is amazing and the quality superb.Pros: Great for low light shooting. Small and lightweight. Price. Very practical for shooting faces indoors and outdoors. The bokeh is really neat (not everyone thinks so, though).Cons: It's all plastic (but it is sturdy enough for its size). slow focus in low light. the focus ring is very small and not too precise- it is usually better to leave it on autofocus (and just focus with the middle focus point in the camera).Overall, this is a superb lens and it should belong in the camera bags of all photographers that are at least somewhat interested in photography!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great lens, BUT...","review":"This is a great lens for the price. However the 50mm is a little too powerful for some things. I do have a digital with the 1.6 conversion factor, so a 30mm would of been much better. That being said for less then $100 (tax and shipping) you can get a 1.8 lens that works very well. If there was a 30mm at the same price I would swap, so I have not. This is currently the lens I shot 80% of my shots with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great lens for the price","review":"This lens is great it's currently the only lens that I use.

Well I had to give myself a break...This lens is Awesome and for this price WOW.I love it for portraits the detail and color are just amazing, I was skeptical because of the price thought it was a plastic lens but it looks solid. It does makes lots of noise while focusing but if you have your headphones on you wont hear a thing :)Now time to go and see how it looks in different subjects - hmmm the city???"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Buy!","review":"First,this is not a L series telephoto lens, but it is a fantastic prime lens for about $100!!! The construction is not real sturdy, and has a lot of plastic but for the money it is insanely great. Pictures are CRYSTAL clear and sharp. This is a great way to learn the lower f/ stops which is what I totally expected. The f/1.8 is more than enough to give you a ton of experience on what to be watching for. I missed focus on some secondary items in the picture due to setting the f/ stop too low, but that is my point, we need to learn by using a low f/ stop lens and this is a great way to learn. I also found that I will be looking much harder at prime lenses instead of zooms in the future. Without all of the compromises that zooms require, primes can get incredible sharpness! I have a lot of money in lenses, but this is the best bargain in my kit. And Amazon gave its usual great service on this purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"works fine for occasional use","review":"Works fine and is as reviewed by other customers.

They are very sharp, the color is not perfect but I just post process that anyway. Eventually I will get the more expensive 1.4 lens, but for now this is plenty of lens for my portraits.

Compared to the kit lens on the canon rebel class cameras, it is much better with less chromatic aberration and less fuzziness.

The only optical problem is barrel distortion, but that can be fixed in photoshop if it is noticeable in the picture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent potrait lens for the price","review":"This is an excellent portrait lens for the price.

At beginning I was scared that I may not be able to get it off my T3 camera if I put on after reading some reviews that it stuck on camera body in a few cases. I tried anyway and I am happy I did not encounter such a situation. I took a few shots. The quality is good, even though I cannot see obvious differences than the shots made by my EF-S 18~55mm zoom lens while I set the aperture at 4.0. My issue is that I found out that my T3 camera shows the shots by this lens are in aperture 4.0 instead of the expected 1.8. Could anybody tell me why? I score it one star because it is not f/1.8. If somebody tells me I am wrong about this I can correct myself by adding more stars later.-----That's was my fault.

I bought it because it was in my price range and within a week it had broken in half. I was changing my current lens out for this one one day and the lens simply tapped on the table underneath where I was changing lenses and it broke in half. SO, I figured this was my fault and that I had tapped it too hard on accident which is why it broke. I ordered a new one. The next DAY the same thing happened. It tapped my larger lens and broke in half. I definitely think something is wrong with the construction of the product and even if this hasn't happened to you, I would strongly recommend buying the more expensive 50 mm f1.4 lens rather than risking it with this one. It will be worth your while"},{"rating":"2","title":"Still working with it","review":"While it's probably just me, I seem to be having a hard time getting the hang of this lens. I like it for the most part and think I will enjoy it more once I get a handle on it.

It's also a great buy considering how inexpensive it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Noisy, loud, but for $85, I'm not going to complain.","review":"Yes, its noisy, loud, and sometimes slow. But for a f1.8 aperture, for being lightweight, its worth $85 for sure. Great for a beginner photographer like I am to use this to try different shots with a prime lens.

I use this in low light sport situations like basketball or volleyball - and especially gymnastics where flash is not allowed.I'm not a huge fan of being locked into a focal length, but for anything under 2.8 you don't have a choice.This is definitely not a primary lense for indoor sport shooting, but it's a fun companion when you need the speed of a 1.8 indoors."},{"rating":"2","title":"By far, the best \\"bang for your buck\\"","review":"Because of price, I ordered this lens instead of the EF 50mm f/1.4 USM because that one was 3x the price of this one. While I still wish I had the more expensive lens, this f/1.8 50mm lens captures some amazing photos for me and I couldn't be more pleased. It works great on my Digital Rebel XTi.If all you have is the kit lens that came with your camera body, you owe it to yourself and your camera to spend the $70 to get this lens. You will be amazed...your pictures will finally come to life. It does take some getting used to not being able to zoom in/out, but the low fixed aperture ability that this lens has is what gets you the sweet shots."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing lens for the price and to gain experience","review":"When I first bought my Canon XSi it was mainly because I wanted to take quality photos of my newborn but when I started shooting I realized how exciting and wonderful photography can be. I wanted to get more experience and I wanted more than just my kit lens but I didn't want to invest in the high end lenses just yet. When I came across the Canon EF 50mm on Amazon, saw all the great reviews, the great price, and the wondeful photos posted I knew I had to order it. Times have been tough in this economy, but not too tough to get this inexpensive and incredible lens (hopefully). So far the quality of the photos are incredible! This lens is so worth the money and it only makes you crave photography and all without breaking the bank."},{"rating":"2","title":"the buck bangs big on this lens!","review":"For $86 to my door, this lens has wowed my friends and family with some amazing portraits and nature shots. The background blur is fantastic when focusing within 2-3 feet, and the clarity is exceptional. I just couldn't be happier. Who cares if it is plastic. This compares with other $500+ lenses, meaning you would have to buy at least 6 before losing money to the others for equivalent performance. It's definitely the first lens you should consider to buy when upgrading to SLR from point and shoot. It is a real confidence booster for the novice (my wife, for example; she can't put the camera down now!)..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great lens for the price.","review":"Needing a lens with a wider aperture I chose this one. It works well and the photos come out great.If you're expecting more than an inexpensive plastic lens, do not purchase this. If you are looking for an inexpensive lens with a wide aperture, it's your lucky day.Definitely worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for an amateur photographer like me!","review":"I wanted an affordable lens that would provide me with a very shallow depth of field and also handle low light without a flash. This lens at f/1.8 is great for what I need. The manual focus feels very similiar to the 18mm-55mm kit lens that typically is bundled with Canon's DSLRs. It'll definitely come in handy when I start shooting portraits in my photography class this semester!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good inexpensive lens","review":"Good lens for the money. Could spend more but unless you are a professional photographer there is no need to."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Nifty 50 Rocks!","review":"This lens provides the best bang for your buck! The build quality is average, but optically it's a dream! The images that this lens produces is almost L quality. Not to mention having f1.8 on such a cheap lens. I've owned 2 of these so far (the first died when it fell out of my bag), and if my 2nd ever dies, I'll buy another! It's great for both beginners and pros!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great lens! esp. for the price!","review":"I know everyone has said the same thing, but it's so true!

Definitely a good lens to have in your kit"},{"rating":"1","title":"very badly built","review":"Dont' get it unless you have warranty on both the lens and your camera. Very badly built!!!! (the connecting piece is made of plastic, instead of metal, which other canon lens usually use.)!!! On the 10th times using it, it get stucked in the camera when i was having my vacation in sdyney ( i live in California) . Eventually I took no pictures for the whole day in sydney. and now both the lens and camera were sent to Canon for repair."},{"rating":"2","title":"Canon EF 50MM 1.8 Lens","review":"I purchased this lens to take pictures of basketball and volleyball in high school gyms that are not very well lit. The lens takes very clear pictures. While the 50 mm lens is not always large enough, the cropped pictures still have a sharp definition. The lens is very light, which makes holding the camera easier. Although it does not focus very fast, that is not a problem as I typically focus prior to taking the picture and \\"anticipate\\" to get a good action shot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Canon EF 50 mm f/1.8 II Lens","review":"Cheap build it has; but it does do a great job as a normal lens. Images are excellent. (Amazon had a good price too.) I probably should have purchased this lens with the Rebel XTi rather than opt for the kit lens; and later put that money into a great lens like perhaps the 70-200 f/4 L, or a wide angle. The only reason I gave it a 4 rather than a 5 is the narrow manual focus ring; just a a little bit awkward to handle located at the end of the lens."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but Cheaply built","review":"Pros:+ Awesome image and light.+ Turns DSLR into a point and shoot for novices, even a kid an use this lens with the camera on full auto.Cons:- Casing is made of plastic, and it shows.- Casing is a magnet for scratches and has a dirty look."},{"rating":"1","title":"super value, but incredibly fragile","review":"I bought a Canon 400D (XTi) with the kit lens in October. This lens was my first addition to my kit. For portraits, it's super. You can snap away indoors without a flash because it's so fast. The narrow depth of field also makes for some super outdoor shots. And if you stop it down some, it's super sharp.Overall, just a great performer.[Later edit]My review above was published soon after purchasing this lens. I stand by my thoughts on the performance of the lens. It's awesome. However, the lens is so incredibly fragile that I have broken two of them (I dropped one, so I don't hold that against Canon). My second version of the lens broke through normal use. I think they made this lens out of tissue paper. I will be replacing the lens with something more expensive, but sturdier."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nifty Fifty","review":"I love love love this lens. Sure, it's cheaper made than the $400 and up lenses, but I'm not going to be throwing it around....and the f/1.8 gives me what I want without spending 3 times as much.Very glad I bought it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Canon Lens review","review":"I bought this lens for my husband for his birthday and he loves it!

If your on a budget thanthis is a great add on to your kit.

I still need to play around with using it with a flash, though, my pictures often end up washed out.It's been well worth it.Only complaint (minimal) is that it often refocuses onto something besides my primary object/person. If my child moves a hand, it'll bring the hand into focus and blur my child in the background."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great lens, perfect price!","review":"This lens is just what I was expecting when I ordered it. So far, no problems at all. For me, I feel that I have to stand to far back for some of the photos that I take, but that's because I like to be close :) Especially when I'm taking pictures of my kids in their little bedrooms. The noise is a little loud, but I expected that also from reading the other reviews. Overall, fabulous lens for the price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice lens","review":"I haven't had the opportunity to use the lens as much as I would like so far. But the one time I did put it to the test so far, it performed beautifully and as advertised. I know i will make great use of this lens as I use it more."},{"rating":"2","title":"You can't get better than this","review":"You can't get better than this for the price. I bought this lens for my Canon Xti and it has performed better then I could have imagined. I use it for portraits and low light situations. I take a lot of low light night captures and this lens is perfect. It is a bit noisy and feels cheaply put together, but don't let that stop you from getting this lens. You will not be disappointed. How can you beat a great lens for under a $100."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sharp!","review":"I am not a photographer but I need to photograph my sculptures.

I was learning enough to have outgrown the kit lens, and a good friend who's a photographer recommended a 50mm. I couldn't be happier with this lens...the pictures I took are so much crisper, I'm able to get better shots in lower light. It's just incredible. I was skeptical about a prime lens because I'm used to being able to \\"zoom\\" depending on the shot. But the quality of this thing is just unbelievable. It's GREAT for portraits, esp for kids and babies.I'm by no means skilled yet, but I got so many compliments when I posted the pics I took with this lens. The lens itself makes a huge difference! And the price is really good considering how much it retails for at other online stores.One thing - don't forget to buy a UV lens filter and I recommend B&H; Photography - all the filters on Amazon seemed pretty low-quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Help me anybody","review":"i ve just set it on my canon 550 D and autofocus doesnot work ! what the hell is going on"},{"rating":"2","title":"A dream come true","review":"I'm taking some of the best photos I ever had and its all thanks to this lens. And for this price, I just can't believe it. Thanks to everyone who reviewed before me, it's changing my life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good lens for the price","review":"This a a great lens for the price. It does great in low light and does great background blur. It was kinda tricky getting used to a lens that doesn't zoom in and out but once you get the hang of the lens, it's not so bad (I'm a total newbie to the photography world). It does have a hard time focusing sometimes when on auto focus. I have had issues where it can't decide on what to focus on or something and I have to point my camera at something else and snap a picture. This is fine unless you're trying to capture kids being cute. Again, great lens for the price, I don't regret buying it at all!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Man just buy it!","review":"Forget the plastic mount, the plastic construction, the fact that it's not USM, etc... This little thing is AMAZING!!! I own the Tamron 17-50mm f2.8, and even though I like the focal length of that lens (and also the fact that it has a constant f2.8 aperture), I always find myself increasing the sharpness of my photos a little bit in post processing. With the Canon 50mm 1.8 I don't have to do that. This thing is RAZON SHARP and for $100+ dollars, you can't beat that.I was a little worried (before I bought it) about the focal lenght. I thought because of the cropped sensor in my Canon T2i, the lens was going to be too close to use in close quarters, or that I would have to stand 50 feet away from my subject, etc... Boy I was wrong, this lens is just perfect. GET IT, YOU WON'T BE DISSAPPOINTED!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Things In Small Packages","review":"I was advised about this lens by the local newspaper photo chief. He said that with all of his lenses, this was the one that he continued to use for pictures where you want a balance between the context and the subject. I have lenses of every size and shape. Recent trip to Glacier NP convinced me that this is the base lens to use. It gives you a basic picture and works well for landscapes, group pictures, and pictures. The plastic is a little cheap (Come on, Canon, spring for the metal!!) and I still use the plastic and bubble wrap for transport in my backpack. For your basic lens with a wide angle, this is the answer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke 1 Month After Warranty Expired!","review":"I bought the lens last April and it sat in my camera bag until last weekend. After a year, I decided to finally use it and just a week of use the auto-focus no longer works!! I will say, the pictures it can produce are great, but if you like auto-focus look elsewhere!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great economical lens!","review":"When I made the switch from film to digital, I splurged and bought this lens. It's my first prime and I bought it to use as a primary lens on my Rebel XTi. I've been really surprised at the speed and usefulness. I rarely find myself switching to a zoom.Picture quality with the lens is superb and it's quite speedy. Some complain about it feeling 'cheap', but this feeling is minimized once it's on the camera. There is a tiny amount of play with the focusing ring (in autofocus mode) and I'm not expecting it to last a lifetime, but for the cost I heartily recommend this lens - especially for beginners / intermediates who rely on zooms. 50mm is a perfect 'all-around' length, and this baby is all you need!"},{"rating":"2","title":"1.8 is the way to go","review":"I was a little worried that I made the mistake of buying the \\"cheaper\\" 1.8 lens vs the 1.4 lens. I don't worry anymore. I have had this lens for awhile and the pictures turn out great. In my opinion, they look just as good as my friends 1.4 lens. I enjoy being able to take low light pictures without flashes. The lens itself is extremely light, and feels like a toy, but the pictures are just fantastic. I would recommend this lens to anyone looking at a 50mm fixed lens."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent lens for such a cheap price!","review":"This lens is really good for the price. The tiny aperture allows for beautiful portraits! The video looks great on this lens too. Shot a Doritos commercial with it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Like Magic","review":"I love this product.

I miss the days when hip hop artists actually rapped about something. Instead of just telling us how good they are, or how rich they are. It's pretty pointless. Also lots of songs nowadays are just \\"dance dance in the club\\" songs. Nothing really has a story or a soul to it anymore. Kanye turns in an album that's well produced (and that can easily be taken for granted) but very uninspired if you ask me. His lyrics are pointless, so it basically comes down to whether or not his beats are fun, and well, a few songs are.. the rest are kinda off and just not catchy. The best beat is on STRONGER, and that's only b/c of Daf Punk. Anyway, if you can tell... i'm not a big Rap/hip hop fan... anymore... but i was really hoping this album would bring me in again... it did not. The last album to dissapoint me was Eminem's curtain call, which was just terrible.

I will never understand what the hype is about Kanye. I get tired of hearing how great his album is because he sampled some obscure band from the 80s. Lets talk about Kanye's rapping talent. The rhymes on Can't Tell Me Nothing remind me of some white kids \\"rapping\\" in their cafeteria. \\"I feel pressure, under more scrutiny, And I do, What act more stupidly?\\" Under more scrutiny, Kanye should work harder not to make whack rhymes. For an artist that's fan base talks about his humility and internal strife, Kanye does nothing but declare himself God and announce his greatness on the \\"hit\\" Stronger. I hope this is the last of the trilogy. Maybe now that Kanye is graduated his next contribution will be \\"Getting a Real Job.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"worth every penny, and then some","review":"I bought \\"Curtis\\" instead of this when they had the sales showdown.

It still wasn't convincing me to buy the album. NOW......Graduation-Every music artist has their 1 classic album. This is and probably will be Kanyes classic album for a long time. The beats are unbelievable. I dig how he mixes techno and middle eastern beats into his hip-hop flow. He stepped up his game on this.

All of the songs on \\"Graduation\\" sound and feel colorful. There are tons of catchy melodies and lyrics throughout the album. We get to hear excessive infusions of techno and funk in songs like \\"Flashing Lights\\" and \\"The Good Life\\". And it's nice to hear a Daft Punk sample in \\"Stronger,\\" which is my favorite track. \\"Homecoming\\" with Chris Martin is a treasure, while \\"Barry Bonds\\" with Lil Wayne is interesting enough. \\"I Wonder\\" is probably the weakest song; I don't like it very much.So this album is basically Kanye's most colorful so far. It'll probably be a long time, however, until we hear another Kanye album like this for a long time, since \\"808's & Heartbreak\\" marks an extreme musical and lyrical departure.Grade: A-"},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh","review":"When Kanye West first started out, I thought he had a lot of potential to be a decent and credible artist. He was new and fresh, plus I thought he had quite a few catchy songs. Nevertheless, I don't feel that way anymore. Kanye West just seems like an a s s hole, plain and simple. He's extremely arrogant and think's he's the best rapper who's ever gotten signed. Bottom line, is that he let the fame and money get to his already enormous head. In my opinion, the singles he's put out on \\"Graduation\\" aren't very unique or different from anything else that's out there right now. Granted, I have not purchased the album nor have I ever attempted to listen to it. But why would I? If the best songs that are on the album are the ones that are playing on the radio right now, then I'm not going to waste my time or money to hear the rest of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Um...","review":"So apparently, Techno is now Hip-Hop? 10 years ago, he would have been laughed at by Hip Hop fans. But since today's hip-hop fans are a completely different generation who have no regard for what hip-hop actually is, he's put on pedestal instead.This guy is so full of himself after his initial album's success, that he barely raps on this album. He's just letting his image do the talking.So this apparently the situation...the guy is no good when it comes to making music. BUT wait, HE HAS A LOUIS VUITTON BELT! OMG, LOOK AT HIS JORDANS! WOW! HE'S ALL INTO THAT JAPANESE FASHION! WOW! Let's just overlook his lack of musical talent and judge him by his shutter shades and played out sneakers.

I had low expectations, and was still severly disapointed. The cd was supposed to be a fun gift for my friend. Instead it was a waste and a crappy gift. We skipped through at least half the tracks on the first listen because the beats were either cheesy or weak. Later listenings confirmed the first impressions. Download his singles and save yourself some time and money. Or better yet, pick up Talib Kweli's new joint."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get back to School Kanye","review":"I have always enjoyed Kanye West. Since hip-hop has strayed away from relevant lyricists Kanye was like a breath of fresh air. When College Drop Out and Late Registration dropped it reminded me of hip hop legends like Del the Funky Homosapien and The Pharcyde. His delivery has never been that great, but his beats were always on point and there was definite substance to his rhymes. So when Graduation came out I picked it up as soon as possible. And while his production skills are still at the top of the game, Kanye has succumbed to the hip hop mentality of braggadocios rhymes. The heart just isn't in it anymore. We always knew that Kanye was his own #1 fan, but now that's all he is. He's saying a lot without saying anything at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointed","review":"this album is by far kanyes worst. yes, the beats are amazing as usually but kanyes flow and lyrics are absolute garbage. stronger is a good song but is ruined by the fact that he is rapping about klondikes. there are very few good songs on this album and none of them are even close to being college dropout material. once again, i cannot emphasize enough how bad the lyrics are. kanye should stick to producing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pfffft, whatever get some real hiphop instead","review":"Its aight, some of it is really lame and pop techno BS, some of it is tight, all of it is \\"not that great\\" It is a shame that he is selling so many albums while so many real hip hop artists with more talent don't sell anywhere near this; go out and buy the new Pharoahe Monch album!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This was an awful album","review":"I was never a big Kanye West fan, but once I heard his hit song \\"STRONGER\\", I thought it that the album would be awesome.

Most of the tracks are so inspiring even without listening to the lyrics, one is left feeling hyped and engaged. I love the beatiful futuristic Kanye-esque sounds mixed with top-notch sampling and the end result is the future of Hip-hops greatness. I think its Kanye's brilliant production that does it for me. The songs are also great lyrically. The one stand-out track was BIG BROTHER, a song dedicated to his mentor, Jay-Z. Its very dear and real and thats why I like Kanye, he says what is in his mind and doesnt care about PR BS. He is the voice of the everyday man but is more talented and rich then you and I. I think that most who are \\"haters\\" of him are those offended by his realness.This is a must have for your music collection!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"Kanye West's Graduation has what you come to expect and love from this artist.

I recommend this album to anyone with a pulse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the Best of 2007...But Definitely One of the Better Ones!","review":"I Won't Attempt to break down everything on this album b/c there is alot, but if you know Kanye, not much has changed in his beats formula when its comes to sampling so if you hate that, then it may not be for you. Otherwise, it is a solid enough beginning to end. This album's theme is very much uplifilting in its demeanor compared to the Graduation and has a balance of positive feels (i.e. I Wonder, Stronger, Champion) as well as the light hearted fell good one (i.e. Good Life, Drunk & Hot Girls) and the introspective ones (i.e. Big Brother, Can't Tell Me Nuthin). The only thing I think that may be lacking is increased lyricism but its still better than most out.Standout Tracks:1.Good Morning(Intro)5.Good Life6.Can't Tell Me Nuthin9.Flashing Lights10.Everything I Am13.Big Brother (Best Song)Beats = B+Lyrical Content = BArtistic Growth = B-Cohesiveness = A-Overall = B+"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW kanYe wEst is the BEST!!!!!","review":"Well, I got both 50's album as well as Graduation and I gotta say Kanye did it again. Graduation is SOOOOO GOOOD!!!! BUY IT!!!!

On This Release, His Lyrics, Aren't The Best In The World, But I Respect Him & Give Him His Kudos Because He At Least Moves Away From All The Money, Killing, Gangsta, & Club Music, That All The Other So Called Hip Hop Artist Make. I Also Give Him His Props For Writing & Producing His Own Music. I Have Been Waiting For This Album For A While Now, & Now That I have it, I Now It Was Worth The Wait.

GENIUS!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get what the big deal is","review":"The stuff on this album is ok, but it doesn't seem to be anything all that different or that much better than the hip hop or rap from the past. I guess he should get extra points for not promoting the thug life like many artists in his genre do. This sounds like compentent stuff, but I just don't hear anything that's blowing my mind here. Kinda makes me yawn when compared to the old school stuff. I mean, great for him that he's selling tons of records, etc. But so did Britney Spears, so obviously that's not a sure sign of artistic merit on its own.I can only assume that those who continually use the word \\"genius\\" when talking about West are simply buying into his press hyperbole as much as he is himself."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must buy","review":"I see all of the negative reviews and I wonder what kind of music are they listening to. To be quite honest, there is not a lot of good hip hop out there. By far I believe that he is creating original concepts with his music.There are 2 songs that I am not really feeling, but who cares? They arent wack, they just arent for me. Get the album and see for yourself. It is worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will someone please give this so-called genius a hand","review":"And the winner between 50 cent & Kanye is neither: Both albums suck! Kanye's album is slightly better than 50 cent but that aint saying much. Well its now official, all the good hip hop is coming from the underground. The tagline for Graduation Day album should read: \\"An album so weak it needs help off of the turntable\\"BTW: You know what this album needed? More cowbell"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Effort From Kanye","review":"I feel like this album is one of today's better releases, it's my most recent purchase after Talib kweli, Common & Pharoahe Monch (I picked up Curtis also ...).My favorite tracks are:Drunk & Hot Girls (featuring Mos Def)Can't Tell Me NothingFlashing Lights (featuring Dwele)HomecomingI enjoy almost the entire CD, some of the samples are a little annoying at this point, but I'm sure I'll end up loving them as I continue to listen.As far as all of Kanye's CDs, I rank this third out of three, but I don't consider that a bad thing. His other CDs were classic - and featured more guest appearances (something I normally don't endorse, but Kanye pulls it off very well), which I was looking for more of on this album. Common isabsent, no Talib, No Jay - well, no Jay verse ... (Spoiler!) and Jeezy makes an appearance in the first single that is classic, without spitting a verse also.The CD is filled with some classic lines, and is a pleasure to listen to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like the CD different that all the garbage on the radio but doesnt live up to Late Registration","review":"Loved Late Registration but this album leaves me lacking felt like Kanye dumbed it down for people a little bit on this album. Regardless still one of the best albums of 2007, definetly worth the $15."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible CD, Too many samples!","review":"Kanye needs to become a better rapper and producer. Most of the songs in this album are sampled off of other artist songs. Look at Strong and Drunk Hot Girls, Im getting images of Gold Digger all over again! His rapping skills are also horrible.Save your money and don't buy this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mr West does it again","review":"Ok lets get one thing straight, Kanye is one of the best out there. Since coming on the scene with College dropeout he hasn't stoped. Kanye is one of the only artists to get better with time. Graduation is easily Kanye's best album to date. Every track on this disc is a classic. When I first heard drunkin hot girls, I couldn't believe it. Had to rewind it several times. I hate all the people that say Lil Wayne is the best rapper alive. Haha, lets get one thing straight Jay-z is and will always be the greatest, case closed. Kanye deserves all the good things that come to him. On this album once again he invites you into his world. You hold your breath on every line he says. Lyrically Kanye isnt the best, but damn this man is creative. I love Kanye, I love what he bodies. Sure he is cocky, but lets face it he can be. Thank you Kanye for releasing another hip hop classic. Thank you Kanye for all you do for Hip Hop."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its Kanye West, what else do i have to say","review":"Any Kanye West album is pure hip-hop gold. He is one of the best rappers alive, and his lyrics and style are original and creative. If you are actually wondering whether or not to buy this, it's a simple decision. Just do it. You wont regret it. Favorite Tracks: Homecoming, The Glory, Flashing Lights, Can't Tell Me Nothing, Stronger, Bittersweet."},{"rating":"1","title":"complete trash.","review":"This guys is one of the lamest rappers out there. His flow is weak set to mediocore beats and he comments on social issues he knows nothing about. The only rapper i can think of thats as bad is Benzino. Don't waste your money theres better things you could be buying.... like toilet paper."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you can, bootleg it so you won't waste your money","review":"Well I was looking for something spectacular like Late Registration and you know what? This cd was so far from it. I think I must have skipped the first three cuts and then a couple more until I got to a song that was even decent. Mind you there's only 13 tracks so not much of a cd. I don't see how anyone can hype this up. Fifty's cd is a lot better. And to think that I bought this cd. Fifty's cd isn't like the first one he dropped no or the Massacre but it still tops this cd hands down. No doubt the guy has talent improving beats, but only with samples of other peoples stuff. Anyone that is over 30 would know this. I thought I was a kid again in the 80's because of all the samples he had on here. And as far as his lyrics!! Well I have heard better on the street corner. Much better. In my opinion this cd should be called, freshman because he should have made this cd before the others. Maybe it would appear like he progressed."},{"rating":"1","title":"an insult to real hip-hoppers","review":"Kanye West is an insult to real hip-hoppers everywhere. What he does best is buy a track from an established artist like Steely Dan or Daft Punk and then lamely rap over it. Or get the guy from Coldplay to sing along. The result is a CD that reaches the crossover market of people who can't wrap their minds around the the true creative artists in the form. What they get is soothing and familiar Rap Pop. Kanye is the James Blunt of rap. Expand your horizons, people. Browse the hip-hop section and thrill to something fresh and new."},{"rating":"1","title":"booooorrrrrrring","review":"im glad I downloaded this because its corny, thats all i gotta say. this is for nerds, not something for your car. just look at the cover, pink and purple. this was obviously meant to target a rainbow audience."},{"rating":"2","title":"As good as Late Registration","review":"Having the benefit of 4 songs being released as singles before I purchased the album, I knew this was a good purchase.

This album proves to me that it's time for Kanye to get back behind the tables and let the MCs do their thing and let him do his thing, which is produce. We will have to wait for Murs and Moka Only and Atmosphere to break onto radio before Hip-Pop can be a legitimate art form again and draw some market share back from country music."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT AS GOOD AS YOU'VE HEARD","review":"I believe that this album is a little over-hyped. In the late 90's people jumped all over Puff Daddy for sampling and not being original and rhyming very weak. Now in 2007, we have a new Puff Daddy. Seriously, on every song he samples another song, and then raps weakely on it. What's the difference? On this new album there are some songs that are darn right laughable. I will also admit that there are some good songs on this album as well, but this time around, the bad outweigh the good. I consider this a very average album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I will always enjoy Kanye for his artistry, but unfortunately this album just falls short. The songs have no replay value and his beats & lyricism are becoming predictable. Hopefully his fourth release will be much more enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kanye's best album to date.","review":"Graduation is, by far, Kanye's best album. Each song has a good to great beat and the lyrics go with the song. One might be thinking of course the lyrics would, but some artists forget this is a vital part to songs. My recommendation would be to buy the album because every song is great. It is really hard finding an album this good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sounds good, no encoding errors, song titles are [Explicit] annoying","review":"Just finished listening to these MP3s on my Mac. They sounded fine coming out of my Onkyo receiver but I'm not an audiophile so I can't comment on the \\"warmth.\\" I didn't hear any of the typical bubbly-sounding MP3 encoding errors either. The Amazon downloader application worked flawlessly with iTunes, the album cover art loaded and everything.My only complaint is that the album title and every song title has [Explicit] on the end of it, just as you see on this page. And I'm not talking about the little red explicit box you see on iTunes, I mean the actual file names & ID3 tags have [Explicit] in them. When I rip CDs the CDDB database doesn't toss that in so it's kind of annoying / inconsistent, thus minus one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"More drivel from this prep-school \\"dropout\\"","review":"Boring, boring, boring.

Lil weezy's verse... so sic. \\"Big Brother\\" still gives me goosebumps, and \\"Flashing Lights\\" is still one of the nastiest synth samples in the world!! Just another great addition to the database."},{"rating":"2","title":"Graduation from Kanye West","review":"I liked a few of the songs from Graduation by Kanye West, his third album. It was broadcasted that Kanye West and 50 Cent went head to head since their albums came out at the same time, but Kanye won the battle, and according to Wikipedia, Graduation sold an amazing 957,000 copies in its first week and eventually went double platinum. Professional critics gave this album good ratings, including Allmusic, Robert Christgau, Los Angeles Times, Rolling Stone, and USA Today. The album released 5 singles and included 5 videos to go along with them: the swagger-like \\"Can't Tell Me Nothing,\\" \\"Stronger,\\" \\"Good Life,\\" the brilliant \\"Flashing Lights,\\" and the piano \\"Homecoming.\\" \\"Champion\\" has a chorus that boosts your self-esteem. \\"Big Brother,\\" the last track, has a hot beat. The album went to No. 1 on a few charts."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Badelt's best!","review":"This score is one of the best Badelt has ever composed. This score, even more so than his recent \\"The Promise,\\" proves that he has his own immense talent beyond his work with Hans Zimmer. This work is quiet and subtle, rich and beautiful, mournful and hopeful. It's centered around a generously lengthy theme featured in the opening track, one that comes to a double climax in \\"Rescue.\\" The song, unlike many on soundtracks, is well-integrated with the score and doesn't interrupt the listening experience.If you like Badelt, or if you like scores like \\"The Thin Red Line\\", then \\"Rescue Dawn\\" is a must-have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing music adventure","review":"As a film score enthusiast, I am always amazed at the talent of some of todays composers. Mr. Badelt has written a movie symphony for this score and as I read in other reviews, the music stands on it's own because of the richness of the themes, and the orchestral colour. Well done Mr. Badelt. I discovered your talent in the soundtrack for the Time Machine. That music also has some soul stirring music.I would recommend both soundtracks highly to all fans of motion picture scores."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute slap in the face!!!","review":"If you like any of the true artists on this album or love any of the songs listed, you will be in disgust when you listen to this album. While listening to this album I am reminded of bar bands doing covers of other bands with little or no practice. The result is this album. An album of complete covers that sound nothing like the true, perfectly perfomed, songs of the true perfomers. I really didn't expect much but I EXPECTED MORE THAN THIS. My suggestion is to stay away from this album. The Beastie Boys would be so disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective at 14 months","review":"I was attracted to the many cool features of this product, and it worked well until 2 months after it's warranty expired.

Kathleen Flynn-Hui kept my interest throughout this book. There was one event I never saw coming and enjoyed every minute of it. I liked all the drama and felt for the characters involved (well some). I did not want this book to end. As someone who lives close to NYC, I started to see many similarities between my Salon and the book. It was an eye-opener. I have a new appreciation for my Stylist. Although, I have yet to be offered a baggie for my purse. Not that I need one, of course. Read it, you'll understand. It's an entertaining read."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've read better.","review":"I actually couldn't bring myself to finish this. The issue wasn't the plot or dislikeable characters, I just found the writing to be redundant. It really made the hair world seem boring. If she was trying to disect the upper class of American society, like Julien Fellowes did in \\"Snobs\\" for Britain, \\"Beyond the Blond\\" lacked depth. I guess that even though the author was trying to convey the ugly side of beauty, its deeper meaning fell short and it remained ambivalent, gossipy and superficial in its tone.Also, I had a hard time with the time line. During \\"Farah Fawcett\\" hair and Studio 54 days, the main character was 16 and about 6 or seven years later, people had cell phones and were getting botox. This really didn't make any sense to me.Overall, if you are looking for a book with a bit of analytical gossip, I would recommend \\"Snobs\\" because this book did not live up to its title."},{"rating":"2","title":"SO MUCH FUN!","review":"I had such a fun time reading this novel that I could NOT put it down.

No I do not like this particular CD of his. It is way too bland, too much towards the soft-jazz genre instead of nuevo flamenco. Look at his album Flashback. There is a reason that NONE of the tracks on this cd appear on that album. Buy Flashback instead and you'll be very happy with your purchase. These other reviewers must like bland, middle-of-the-road soft jazz. There is no kick or passion to this album. Sometimes it happens when you have to produce just to produce. This isn't from his soul, there is it a decent album for background music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rock solid","review":"I had the first edition of this book as a student about 30 years ago and found that although the text was for the most part readable, the notion of universal element notion from category theory was introduced in a baffling way very early on and this was the stumbling block.I've been rereading mathematics books out of pleasure of late and wanted to read this one, so I looked up the Amazon reviews. It was written that you should get the third edition. I ordered it and was not disappointed. The stumbling block has been recognized by the authors and pushed to much further in the book. A new chapter on Galois Theory has been added.The contents of this book is more basic in general than say Lang's book and the reader is not left to fill in the missing pieces and it is generally more readable. What's more the exercises are well chosen to consolidate the learning.The book is not encyclopedic, but to my mind constitutes a very solid modern grounding for any mathematical student."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost Fab","review":"I love these hose, and I would totally recommend ordering them.

Once I got this product, I plugged it in, and have continued to use the toilet seat without issues. (I am still not using the heated seat due to the weather, but the heated water works without problem.)Honestly, I just have to assume it works, since my toilet seat also worked plugged into the wall...but it's supporting the <500W device I plugged into it, so until it breaks, the seat breaks or some other issue arises, I'll give this high marks for doing everything I expected it to do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works As Described","review":"Easy to setup, easy to understand, works as expected.

The whole \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\" is just boring and cliche. It's become the theme of hundreds of other Christmas movies. Frankly, I think audiences are becoming sick of it. It's fine to preach that people should appreciate their lives, but adult life is more complex than shown in these films.The Christmas Clausetries too hard to preach the virtues of family life, but instead comes across as unoriginal. Part of the problem is that the acting is lousy. Lea Thompson sounds like she's repeating her lines rather than engaged in emotional dialogue. I just couldn't get excited about it or the story - especially when there are so many other great Christmas movies to watch, likeIt's a Wonderful Life."},{"rating":"1","title":"A SERIOUS WASTE OF TIME!

A very well researched and poignant book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great analysis","review":"This book is an excellent analysis of the Bosnian war. While the writer at times might ramble on, it is still one of the best books out there by a great journalist. Rieff knows his stuff and I would say that this book is essential for any study on the conflict. His points are quite cogent and he makes an excellent case against the UN's conduct in the war. This is an important piece for the serious Balkan reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Limp","review":"David Rieff's book is one of many I have read on the Balkan conflict in the 1990s and I must say I was pretty disappointed with it. The book reads like an extended news report -- dry, factual and extremely boring. There wasn't much personal interpretation of the events, or sadly, anything new to say. The worst thing about Rieff's book I can think of is that it does nothing for one who knows zero about the war. A background of the conflict was not given, and he just went straight into talking about the war itself and the crimes on all sides. Mind-boggling and unfriendly."},{"rating":"1","title":"interesting story but infuriating writing style","review":"I have been interested in reading about the history of the Bosnian war as my father was in the US army stationed there for a time during my youth and I am now married to a refugee from that war. This book has a very interesting story but I was thrown off from becoming lost in the book due to the writer's aggravating writing. The run-on sentences and rambling made me feel like he was just writing down his thoughts of his experience and its too distracting. In addition the lack of organization of the chapters, topics, the book period makes it even more frustrating.

Food was hot 12 hours later. After only a few months of daily use I noticed that the food wasn't as warm. The problem lies in the silicon rubber gasket on the stopper. It stretches and no longer seals properly allowing leakage and temperature issues. Eventually the gasket starting falling off into my food. After simply placing the gasket back on for a while it tore. The gasket is not available as a replacement part nor is the stopper with gasket available although for other models they do.

This was especially unfortunate considering it was a cold alcoholic beverage and I only became aware of the leak after it caused my car to reek of liquor.

About ten minutes later, I go to pick up my backpack, and there's a large puddle of coffee where my backpack was lying. The stopper was leaking prodigiously no matter how tightly it was screwed on. Giving up on carrying a hot thermos of coffee through the day, I \\"sealed\\" up the thermos and left it on the kitchen counter. 10 hours later, I come home and check on the temperature of the coffee.

The real downer was that this piece of junk radiated enough heat inside my ski bag to melt chocolate bars into a big lump of wrappers and chocolate.

Nothing better than hot coffee on a cold drop zone.It has many battle scars, dents, dings and scratches. I ain't throwing it away, just getting another one as the lid is finally starting to wear out.Worth every penny and if you run hot water in it before you put you hot beverage of choice, it WILL stay hot for as long as 16 hours in my experience.I expect to be back for at least 2 more.

They had a party at work and fed us. I then forgot to bring home my Stanley and clean it out. The next night when I opened it the stopper SHOT OFF and cracked.

Francis's voice is quirky and a bit obstinate, recalling that of Faulkner. The sentences echo hauntingly and are often lovely. One of the finest stories is \\"The Boulders\\" which discusses a woman confronting heinous acts comitted by her son. The change in this story is graceful and daring.The book deals with loss, death, memory...it's intellectually hefty...which explains why, in America, it's so unknown."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun read of love","review":"Great story line of three great couples thrown together by accident??? hummmm What's Mamma Rose up too?

They were masterpeices in their own ways, and I loved them all. Travis and Emily's story was simple but sweet. It seemed Ms. Garwood was just getting her juices flowing with this one. In Douglass and Isabell's story, she seems to pick up speed. The characters become more developed and they plot more intense. Adam and Geneveive's story top it off. They are what save the novellas from becoming washed up. The characters are, again, more developed and three dimensional. The story is also more intruiging. But, they are all extremely well written, and I think much more praise then they have gotten. As usual, the romances are unique and touching. Ms. Garwood makes a genuine attempt to help you get to know the brothers better. In short, if you've read For The Roses, these novellas are for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love you Julie!","review":"This book was so good! I loved how funny and romantic it was!

However this historical one just doesn't cut it. The collection of short stories, has thin character development and weak plots. The stories are simply too simplistic and you never develop a connection to the characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Clayborne Brides","review":"Not up to scratch from Julie Garwood. It had potential but too short a story on each couple to fully develop the characters and the same MO too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a huge fan","review":"Personally, I like Garwood's Highland novels the best. This American trilogy seemed weak and lacking in basic emotion. On red rose was the best out of the three, it's the only one where the hero has even a chance to love anything about the heroine but her appearance. Unrealistic though...do you expect me to believe that an African American was treated equally in the Wild West? Nice Utopia dream world Garwood has going there, something I'd be proud to have in the history books, but it's just not believable! The Clayborne guys are sweet though, and worth reading about if you have the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"More of the Claybornes from \\"For the Roses\\"","review":"It was so nice to get to read about Douglas, Travis, and Adam. I had wondered about Cole until I saw that there was still \\"Come the Spring\\" to tell about Cole and more about Daniel Ryan who was introduced in these. The only thing I could find wrong with this book was that each story was too short :) I know that they had to be shorter to fit all three in one book, but I wish they each had their own novel! :) Other than that I thought these books were all great just as I think every single book Julie Garwood has written was great. I don't think she'll ever write a bad book - she's just not capable of it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Sniper's Handbook.","review":"I agree with the sniper instructor. This book is excellent. It has many pictures and diagrams to show and explain the topics discussed in this book. Some topics include weapons, concealment, training, and scopes. The book gets down to the point with no BS and is easy to understand. Mark V. Lonsdale in my opinion is a great aurthor and his other books are just as good as this one. I would highly recommend this book to snipers and anyone interested in the art of sniper/counter sniper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow - why buy this book at all?","review":"There are quite a few other books on sniping that you need to buy before this one. I do not know about the background of the other reviewers but to call this a good book on sniping is BS. A very, very light introduction, maybe, but the book does not cover ANYTHING in detail. It is at best useful for a wanna-be sniper and maybe not even so: If you include so little details, but still manage to explain where to shoot a man in the head it is at best missguiding.I am sure that mr. Lonesdale knows his stuff, but this book is lightweight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time and money.","review":"The reason I bought this book was the title: Counter Sniper. As a former rifleman, counter sniper is the most difficult task. This book has zero info about counter sniper. However, the info about sniper operation in this book is very basic; at least nothing new for me. That just total waste my time. Some other sniper experience history books would be better reading material if you are into this subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"some choice fantasies","review":"The collection Nightfall and Other Stories was initially published as 2 volumes due to some inexplicable publishing vagary, then recollected into one, so copies of this book are rare. It contains some fun stories and one of my all-time favorites, It's Such a Beautiful Day, about a society so mechanised people no longer set foot outdoors. This must have been an outlandish idea back in 1954 but it no longer seems so. Strikebreaker and In a Good Cause are powerful and rather bleak stories about the uglier aspects of politics and society, offset by the parodic humor of The Up-to-date Sorcerer and What is This Thing Called Love?. The deep concern for humanity that marks most of Asimov's later stories is evident in this collection. Some stories are slightly dated, but it adds to their charm. The only one that does nothing for me is Flies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Should set the standard for quality in Russian Gypsy music!","review":"The surging rhythms and intoxicating melodies with the clear uncompromising vocals of Mr. Pobedinski immediately assured me that THIS is music one can settle into and trust. If you're looking for heart felt, faithful renditions of beloved and respected classics like \\"Dark Eyes\\" and \\"Talk to Me, My Guitar\\" then you're sure to be impressed by the obvious effort, dedication and alacrity these artists have put into producing this wonderful selection. It is to me the core of what I feel, in my own hoplessly limited way, (I'm not Russian, I'm not Gypsy : ) )Russian Gypsy music is in its heart of all hearts.

It gets filled and heated up maybe 20-40 times a day. The first ones I bought lasted about a year and 1/2 the second one is going strong at 6 months. Only a year!? You are thinking, no really that is awsome for a household product in a professional setting. If you were only heating it 1-2 time a day I have no doubt that last forever. It is convienient and easy to use and solid construction.Why only 4 stars? I wish it heated a little faster 5-7 minutes for a kettle full of cold water (ok I'm demanding but when we are busy we're busy!) But you don't have to fill it all the way up. Also I wish it held the water warm instead of just turning off.An excellant buy for anyone or family (or cafe) who drinks tea or french press coffee regularly."},{"rating":"1","title":"On switch doesn't work","review":"On switch will not stay down to turn on the machine.

I guess the only thing I would like to see on this one is some notification that the water is done. The Phillips would auto shot off and when it did, it would ring this little bell inside. The new kettle just turns of, it's quiet and you forget about it, then you have to reheat... a little 'ding' would help."},{"rating":"1","title":"great kettle, but ours developed a leak","review":"This is probably the best kettle I've used (out of maybe four in various countries). It heats water quickly, pours extremely well, is ergonomically designed, and is a pleasure to use, honestly. Our kettle, however, developed a leak at the bottom seal, ranging from a slow to fast drip. Braun no longer services these, so we have to send it in for a simple refund (at our expense). I would definitely considering buying another, however."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another leaking kettle","review":"Like other reviewers, our kettle started to leak after 8 months. Too bad, as I absolutely loved the kettle. After reading all the negative reviews about the customer service, I guess I will end up trashing it instead of trying to get it replaced. The real shocker is, we paid $36 for this kettle on Amazon. It is now selling for $130!!! I can't recommend anyone buying this kettle for that amount of money.

It is crushing, bruising, fall-outta-the-sky-and-land-on-your-forehead Swedish metal! At the same time, this album is melodic and intricate. The music will satisfy the most discriminating death metal advocates. The bass and guitar riffs stay fresh throughout the whole CD, and the drums will crack your chest in half with the speed and precision. The vocals have improved since the last album (The Chainheart Machine), which I didn't realize was possible. This truly is a 5 star album from the neo-Swede scene. This band is probably the most dynamic and prolific band of the new Nordic scene."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply awesome...","review":"First off, I am not huge fan of Death Metal. I enjoy listening to In Flames, Opeth, and Dark Tranquillity, but that's about it. And then I heard Soilwork. Wow!This is one amazing CD. Every song on it is excellent. The guys in the band are very talented songwriters. The guitar playing is fantastic; crunching riffs and melodic solos.If you haven't heard Soilwork, their style can be best summed up as being of the classic \\"Gothenberg sound\\". The singer moves between traditional death vocals and clean vocals seemlessly. The drumming is fast paced, and the guitars never let up.If you are a fan of Death Metal, I imagine you already own this disc. If you don't listen to Death Metal, but are a fan of aggressive music, this disc will very easily bridge the gap between the two genres."},{"rating":"1","title":"Logic or drivel?--drivel","review":"This textbook suffers from several salient defects: (1) it lacks any treatment of truth tables (even though they are mentioned in the index on a non-existent page, oops to the editor!), (2) it confuses two definition types, associative and connotative, (3) the examples, though infused with pop culture, fail to engage students or to draw out any relevant features of logical reasoning or critical thinking, and (4) although the writer teaches at a Catholic college her examples go too far in the direction of condoning homosexual relations and drug abuse.

The writing is captivating and the plot isn't formulaic. A lot of the technical and historic details were not correct however (and I'm allowing for fictional characters of course). The russian tank forces were much more varied than just a horde of t-34's, for example. Half way through the book, the author gets mixed up and starts referring to the t-34's cannon as a 75mm one. Turrets with 2 separate hatches were in production by 1943, and so on.

This is a story of tradition, love and marriage in a Jewish family living in the face of persecution in Tsarist Russia at the beginning of the 20th century. Based on the 19th century stories of Sholom Alechem, it tells of how Tevye, a poor Jewish dairyman, Golde, his somewhat shrewish wife, and their five unmarried daughters face their dreams amidst the reality of rampant anti-semitism. Director Norman Jewison's treatment of this story is wonderfully sensitive. The cast - especially Topol as Tevye (nominated for a Best Actor Academy Award for this role) and Norma Crane as Golde - bring to life all the strength of character, the comedy, and the poignant tragedy of life in the village of Anatevka.

While there are exceptions to the rule, most musicals seem too artificial and the songs lack spark. 'Fiddler on the Roof' is an exception to the rule, with a story that is very compelling and songs that are catchy. You will be humming them for days following watching this very special film.Aside from a great story and music the cinematography is beautiful and as 3 hour films go, this one breezes by like a warm afternoon. I caught this film on an HD channel and it looked wonderful. I do not have any information about the various DVD editions, but if you're looking to getting into some musicals, this is a good place to start. Other favorites of mine include, The King and I, The Sound of Music, The Wizard of OZ, Grease, Little Shop Of Horrors and Hairspray(new version).

This is one of my all time favorites, and always will be. It's a funny/silly/serious/shocking type of film. It will make you pay attention a little more to the real world, but still give you a wake up call to how \\"the others\\" think. By this, I mean the culture outside of your own.

The nine year old wandered off to read sometime during \\"Matchamaker, Matchmaker\\".The acting is great, the music is wonderful, the scenery fits the story perfectly.

I listen and dance to the rhythm, she listens, she becomes irritated by the lyrics. Talking about \\"head banging music!\\".

Great Electric Blues With a Hot Les Paul!","review":"This is the best album Gary Moore has ever made, period! Actually, blues purists will be somewhat negative about it! However, he has taken the blues to a more exciting level. The song \\"Still got the blues\\" is simply a beautiful slow number with some awesome guitar work that would make many guitarists feel like beginners! There are some blues rockers such as \\"Movin On\\" with great slide guitar. \\"Pretty Woman\\" gets your adrenalin flowing and has a great solo you won't forget!

Gary Moore's singing and guitar work on this album is his best!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A screamer!","review":"Wow... lights, camera, action... Talk about a screaming Les Paul induced set of tracks!

There he played blues rock and even Peter Green liked it. In fact Peter Green helped the band to sign a record contract. After Gary Moore leaved the band he went to hard rock/heavy metal water, but he never forgot his first love. Finaly, after not so succesfull 'After the War' album, he deceided to come back to rock blues, and here is what we get, an honest blues album, a tribute to Chickago Blues, Rock Blues, R'n'B of 70's, one big celebration of music. Albert King and Albert Collins helped to Gary Moore to make an exelent blues masterpiece, both technicaly and emotionaly well. Hardcore blues funs maybe want like the album, but Gary Moore's playing qualities are in the same class as those of Eric Clapton, Peter Green or John Mayall. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gary Moore and the blues!","review":"One of the greatest guitarists who ever lived is down right awesome! A must have for any Gary Moore fan!

The complement is well-deserved. Considering Gary Moore's talent, he iseasily one of the most under-recognized axemen of our time.

King, Albert King and Albert Collins, then this isan album for your collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will disappoint blues fans","review":"This album features some real nice guitar work. However this is album is more pop than the blues. I personally am not much into pop music - as a result this album left me disappointed.This album can appear bland and almost synthetic. If Electric blues artists like Micheal Bloomfield, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Buddy Guy or Eric Clapton interest you - you probably want to give this album a pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made it about 12 seconds in","review":"I just popped this CD in and popped it out about as quickly. I gave track one about 12 seconds and track 2 about 4 seconds before I heard all I needed to hear. I'm not saying this is necessarily a bad CD, but calling it \\"blues\\" is a bit of a stretch. He may be playing some blues standards but the sound is very much hard guitar rock."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still got the blues","review":"My Uncle recently loaned this CD to me. All I can say is it is obvious Gary Moore ate too many lead paint chips as a child and has no concept of real blues music. The reason for this harsh review is that my uncle was a member of a harshly reviewed band by Gary Moore himself and my uncle before the review considered Mr. Moore a wonderful and talented artist. BUT, after reading his review of Frost music, one of Detroit's premier groups of the late sixties and seventies, I have come to the conclusion that Mr. Moore has obviously lost more brain cells than we had originally anticipated.

I love all his books he is so true to the travel the country and the food, so far of most that I have read this is my favorite book makes me want to go grab my passport and fly away (with my wife ofcourse)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great travel book","review":"Bourdain is funny, caustic, and yet very articulate in this entertaining book that takes travelers around the world. The quality and honesty of his writing is admirable. Although COOK'S TOUR is focused on food experiences, it has loads of cultural and personal insights. I like the show, but this book is actually better. I wish he would do another book like this that covers the whole experience of travel and the unusual experiences with interesting people he meets."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Salute to the Inedible","review":"Mr. Bourdain takes a tour through different parts of the world, mostly Asia, and lives on food most Westerners wouldn't want to look at. Yet many of the dishes and condiments he describes in loving and precise detail do make sense. Others he swallowed, I am sure, more or less on a dare. He gives us excellent chapters on the places he visits. But mainly it is the food, the hero of this book, that you can almost smell and taste. Some of the well-reasoned asides hit hard on vegetarians, on all the places where you can no longer smoke, and today's pasteurized, sanitized and emasculated mass food production.If you are curious about unusual food, then this low-calory, high-intensity book is for you. Bon appetit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well written journey for travelers and the food obsessed.","review":"A humorous, dark and entertaining read. After becoming obsessed with his travel channel show \\"No Reservations\\" I was drawn to delve deeper into the depths of Mr. Bourdain's twisted brain. I would say that the subtitle of my 2001 edition, \\"in search of the perfect meal\\" is slightly inaccurate. I see that the 2002 edition was renamed \\"Global adventures in extreme cuisines.\\" While that may be more accurate, I would say that the book is more of a personal journey for Tony. The food descriptions are delicious, the stories are shocking and funny (sometimes in a dark way) and the book is terribly hard to put down. I loved it will probably tear through a few more Bourdain books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun!","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book and Anthony Bourdain's irresistible writing style. Friendly--not flowery or snobby. I guess I'm one of very few who found it much more entertaining than Kitchen Confidential. I liked reading about what went on on the other side of the camera and that some of the feasts and locations were not his choices. I was surprised that a star of a television show was flying coach class to Asia. Could that be true? I do know that the average tourist or even a very wealthy one would never be able to duplicate some of the special attention and exquisite meals he was served--especially in Japan."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent!","review":"Much better than the show.

Plan to get hungry!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh dear","review":"As bad a book as Kitchen Confidential is good. It reads - and to some extent he confesses this in the text - as though it was written in a hurry as a bolt-on to the television series and has been rushed out for Christmas.What made Kitchen Confidential so great a read was that it was clearly written from a position of expertise and contained a lot of truth. A Cook's Tour seems to have been written because he was looking for another project after finishing the endless publicity rounds for his great success. This new book has no depth of information, frequently resorts to cliche and the obvious (eating deep fried Mars Bars in Glasgow, scoffing haggis which has been introduced into the room by a bagpiper) and certainly does little to convey a love of food.Personally I find his expletive scattered writing style a little grating out of the kitchen...this book has a lot more Fu**s than any of his previous works and with far fewer reasons to include them.Altogether, a huge disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Global Gourmet!","review":"this was a fun, enteraining read. if you enjoy Tony's show on Food TV, then this is added excitement.

(I won't be having any of this on my next vacation overseas.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A tasty and funny world jaunt","review":"Anthony Bourdain's writing is steeped with the street-smart coolness that can only come from a lifetime New Yorker. In A Cook's Tour he manages to combine the travelogue with food writing without it being completely fruity.Bourdain travels around the world sampling local cuisine and meeting interesting characters. You can tell how passionate he is about food and life and it's wonderful to read an author who really loves his subject. He's also side-splittingly sardonic about the different situations he finds himself in.This book is also much more personal than I expected. His manic-depression shines through: one moment is a blissful celebration of life and the next is full of self-loathing. A trip to his boyhood haunts in France and a scary side trip to Cambodia are especially poignant. Bourdain gets four stars in my Michelin Guide."},{"rating":"2","title":"An entertaining travel/food or food/travel book","review":"A Cook's Tour centers on a search for a \\"perfect meal\\" This perfect meal stuff is a little dopey... after all, nothing is perfect... but it is fun to think about. Meals range from primitive to haute cuisine in locations around the world. The best bits are about Vietnam and Mexico.Bourdain has softened since his preceding book, Kitchen Confidential. He is kinder to TV chefs (a good idea considering he is one now), and seems to feel less need to shock the reader. His crankiness has nearly decreased to the level of Bill Bryson, which is,in general, an improvement."},{"rating":"1","title":"No flavor","review":"After loving \\"Kitchen Confidential\\" I was so disappointed in this! The descriptions are shallow and tossed off -- even of the food (we're told again and again \\"this was great,\\" but never WHAT IT TASTES LIKE!!) and the adventures all sound the same (all variations on \\"I wanted the childhood adventure story dream but this wasn't it\\" OR \\"and this was it but it really scared me and wasn't fun like I expected\\").

Take the act on tour of course. Climb aboard the Bourdain express for a culinary road show that would have Bing, Bob and Dorothy scratching their heads in disbelief. The places that this man is willing to go and the things that he is willing to eat go above and beyond culinary passion. It's extreme eating. Durian fruit, live heart of a cobra (still beating), embryonic birds, assorted bugs. . . and these are just the appetizer! All these experiences and more are described in a style that will be familiar to Kitchen Confidential readers. Bourdain manages to come across as funny, honest, prickly and even sweetly sentimental (for a smart-[aleck]). It was fun to go on the journey with him. Too bad I can't take him along on my next trip, almost anything I do is going to feel dull in comparison."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reminds me of Fear Factor.","review":"Enjoyed hearing a taped version of A COOK'S TOUR by Anthony Bourdain, the chef who left his job to discover the perfect meal . . . his journey took him to Japan, Cambodia, Saigon, France, and many other locales . . . that part was interesting; what was even more so was the author's description of the many foods he sampled (many of them reminding me of stuff that folks devour on FEAR ACTOR), such as blowfish, the live heart of a cobra and a bird's nest . . . my only regret that I've never gotten to see the TV show that came about as a result of Bourdain's travels."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Brave Person!","review":"I first read Kitchen Confidental, which I found wasa wonderful book, sooo I was looking forward to a CooksTour.

But they picked the wrong guy.I cannot believe this man can taste food, much less be a professional chef. He is destroying his taste buds, through the abuse of alcohol and nicotine, not to mention myriad forms of cannabis and the occasional cocaine amuse-nez.

Though highly criticized, it is not without a sense of irony that Michael Crétu is able to retain his former sense of style, despite his transition into New Age, with the Enigma project.'Legionaere,' as well as 'The Invisible Man,' follow an 80's Rock-style. While this may not be very interesting to hear in the year 2005, there is a nostalgic element to Michael Crétu's older works, which are interesting for a long-time Enigma fan, such as myself. Still, it is interesting to hear the roots of such a popular artist as Michael Crétu, who really only gained his popularity through the production of the Enigma project. (The prime of his career, I suppose.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Peter David is a great Star Trek novelist","review":"And this book is a testimony to that earned \\"greatness\\" and was sheer pleasure to read, not to mention own.

JPJ did not disappoint! This is a much more nuanced and ecletic album than Zooma, not relying so much on skullcrushing bass as JPJ plays more guitars and mandolin. Overall, the album is quite a bit more mellow with tracks like Freedom Song, Ice Fishing at Night and Down to the River to Pray. That being said, tracks like Leafy Meadows, the Thunderthief and Shibuya Bop will remind fans why JPJ was an essential component of Led Zeppelin's sound. Jonesy actually sings on a few tracks and his voice isn't too bad.

The macks (Mac this and Mc That), the Scots planters who were original settlers of the North Carolina land, were in constant opposition with the indiginous people of the land. The landscape of Scuffletown changes like shape-shifters, as these proud Indian descendants move from place to place.Rhoda Strong, daughter of Cee, tells this rambling tale of good vs. evil.

You've met all these characters before, from the Plucky-Independent-Heroine-Who-Is-Ahead-Of-Her-Time to the Handsome-But-Dangerous-Antihero. The historical details are interesting and the book is rich in atmosphere and emotion, but the characters are straight out of Creative Writing 101. Too much of this will destroy brain cells.

To my surprise, the album is a great collection of acoustic pop that belongs in your CD collection right next to Elliot Smith. His lyrics are personal, but his craft is strong enough to avoid excess sentimentality or didacticism. The songs on it are assured, good, and pretty fun. He may not have anything \\"flashy\\" about him, but Teddy Thompson's first album is simply a great collection of strong songs. I love it, and if you're the acoustic pop/folk rock type, then I'm sure you will too."},{"rating":"2","title":"incredible","review":"Extremely mellow album.

I will not buy again. I could only imagine the yearly cost of this product considering I have two GSDs. Trust me, there are better products that cost much less and actually work, sometimes within days, not 6 weeks!!!! Yikes. Imagine the time 6 weeks for a dog's life is.

Thanks for the Great Read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I have read many,many war novels over the last 40+ years so when one reader said in an Amazon discussion forum that this was the best war novel he had ever read I had to try it. Very disappointing. It is a well written story but the jungle war in North Burma is just a backdrop to the character development of a number of men and women. Very little action here. When I read a war novel I like to go from one graphic firefight to another. This is definitely not that kind of book. The writer is very talented but this book is not my cup of tea because of the scarcity of combat scenes. Not worth it in my opinion. Definitely not the best war novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not From Here to Eternity","review":"As an account of what was apparently the author's experience in Burma in World War II this book has some interest. But as a novel I thought it had little merit. I found myself being dismayed at how thick the book was and when would it end? The accounts of the romance between Con and Carla added nothing to the book, so far as I could see. The battle scenes were well-written but if they were factual, I would rather know it--namely a non-fiction account would have enabled me to know what was true and what was made up. The incident of the Chinese killing Americans, of which the author says he had first-hand knowledge--really second-hand, though--added an attention-holding portion to the novel, but that incident occupies only a small portion of the story. Frankly, I was glad when I got to the last page of this book. If you liked From Here to Eternity, I think you will be disappointed by the plotlessness of this pale imitation thereof."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Review of\\" Poetry: A Pocket Anthology\\"","review":"An excellent text that includes an impressive number of poems as well as useful commentary on the art of poetry and specific terminology.

I also found that all the intermediate chapters recruited Spenser's so-called sweetheart Susan were totally meaningless and could be deleted. I found the only small vice in this book was that Parker to waltz a very boring and trivial plot into a jumbo book by using totally pretentious, try-to-humor-me, totally unnecessary dialogues to balloon into a third rated novel. Parker is still under the hypotic effect of Raymond Chandler's lazy genre and still failed to come out it. The whole book is just a waste of time, even considered waste on the toilet.

Being a Spenser fan is a bit like being a fan of The Who - no matter how worn the product, I rush out and consume it. But tried and true fans will surely be disappointed, as you likely were with Chance and Thin Air. The brilliance of Catskill Eagle is long dead, though it showed briefly in Walking Shadow. There are many of us who think it's time for Susan to die. That might breath some life back into the series. And it's time for co-eds to stop hitting on Spenser every time he walks into a bar. Some authors freeze their characters in time. Parker did not, and should recognize that a 60 year-old with several gunshot wounds, scar tissue on his eyes and a oft-broken nose is not the kind of guy that the buxom girl in the college bar wants to sleep with. This book was way too close to Valediction. Parker is running out of story lines. This book is for serious fans only, and even then I'm not so sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spenser Rocks!","review":"Robert B. Parker hit a homerun when he created Spenser. That's Spenser with an S like the poet. Parker hit a grand slam with this novel Small Vices.If you were ever a fan of Spenser for Hire on television in the 80's You need to pick up a Spenser novel. Take your pick there are over 30 of them out there.Parker's Spenser is a wise cracking former boxer, former police officer turned private eye. His sarcastic sense of humor will keep you laughing and the hard pounding action will keep you reading/listening until the very end.In Small Vices Spenser goes up against corrupt high society and a hired man in Gray hell bent on killing him. Along with Hawk, Susan Silverman, and a cast of others. Spenser finds himself in the fight of his life. The book covers areas in all our lives with racial humor, morality, integrety, and a quest for justice."},{"rating":"2","title":"My first Spenser, and I loved it!","review":"This was my introduction to a series that I'm sure will become one of my favorites. Spenser is a delight -- as are Hawk, Susan and especially Pearl. I like a mystery where the characters have more on their minds than just the plot. Spenser's relationship with \\"the gray man,\\" Susan's desire for children, issues of police corruption and racism all made the story richer for me. The only thing I didn't like was Burt Reynolds' performance. He sounded too old for part. Worse, at times his delivery made it sound like he was reading the book for the first time.

I am sure he would not be happy to know that this is out there available for anyone to read. It would have been better left unsaid. A one night stand with a celebrity is not love. It comes off sounding like something written by some giddy school girl, not by a grown woman at least in her 40's. This is a warning to any true John Denver fan. Do not buy this book. Donate the money to some worthy cause instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"John Denver and Me","review":"This book was apsolute trash. Don't buy it. It's hardly about John Denver. It's mostly about \\"ME\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just another one-night stand...","review":"Pathetically, the author describes what is essentially a one-night stand with John; as envious as many of JD's female fans may be, it's a story that simply doesn't need to be told. I'd expected much more insight than was offered, and was disappointed with the author's clear lack of understanding of male libido! Hey, sex with a star-far-from-home isn't love."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please don't buy this book.. its not worth it!","review":"Before I purchased this book, I read some of the other reviews, however I just did not believe that the book could possibly be as bad as all that so I had to see for myself.Well, i learned a lesson, this book is not bad it stinks and i mean more than a skunk.The woman who wrote it is named Jean St. Marie. It is obvious that she wanted to use John to try and give herself a career. To this day, i have never heard of this woman and I probably never will. Most of the book is about St. Marie herself. There is only around one chapter that focuses on John at all.If it were me, and i had \\"relations\\" with a star I would be quite embarrased and I certainly would not want the world to know about it.So, if you want to read about a flight attendent who worked on airlines back in the 1970's this book is for you!but, if you want to read about John Denver... This is not for you!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bragging is not a Biography","review":"As a John Denver fan and an avid reader, I found this book to be nonsense.The writer(?)made her indiscretions and New Age beliefs sound as if she were destined to have a night of hot sex with a lonely musician/songwriter.The more ridiculous this story became, the faster I skimmed, looking for some redeeming value.

If in fact what the author says is true, it should remain as her memory ... not for public consumption. It's a travesty to the memory of John Denver to see that the only motive to some people is how much money can I make ... hopefully with the complete text of the book online, no one will waste their money on this dribble."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keeping it intimate","review":"I think anyone who cared so much about John should have kept the intimate details just that, intimate, Isn't that what caring, loving and trust is all about. Sure it might be cool for your friends to know that you were intimate with John but was it really worth a few bucks to share what he probably thought was between you two. I guess I just see things different. Why now? What do you think Johns mother or any of his three children would think about reading your book, how would they feel. Would you and John still be friends if this had of been printed earlier. I think to me his friendship and trust would be more important. But good for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass this one up!","review":"I have been an admirer of John Denver for most of my life. After having read this book I have decided that it is a poorly written kiss and tell type book. With the exception of the one night stand type of relationship that the author had with John, there are very few details about anything here. She leaves out the names of people involved in her life and is very vague about dates. I give it one star only because, as a previous review stated, it does satisfy some of the curiosity that some people may have about what it would be like to be alone with John. Personally though, I have to question the true value of that information. Pass this one up and read John's autobiography if you can find a copy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure garbage","review":"This book deseves negative stars.

She obviously cared nothing for John or she wouldn't have written what she did. John was a human being with faults - he was single & lonely, she was waiving it in his face...so he did what any red-blooded unattached male would do.

But for the future I can always use the reference indexes for info about JD websites, videos, John Denver's music history, and resources for more material about him. Great story about a fan who had always loved the artist and her eventual meeting with him and the subsequent experiences she had. I never saw John Denver in concert but how I wish I had. The author paints a wonderful picture of this amazing soul - and of the 80's & 90's, and of amazing spiritual experiences - she questions what the world would be like if he were still on this plane. I wonder too."},{"rating":"2","title":"A reverent tale","review":"This book is a tribute to John Denver, not a dis-service to fans, as previously \\"reviewed\\" here.

Fans of NOSFERATU will definitely want to take a look here."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've seen better Veidt silents","review":"Couldn't wait to watch \\"The Hands of Orlac\\" since I already new the gist of the story anyway and have seen many Veidt movies (both silent and talkies). However...after sitting thru the first 30 minuets (waiting for it to get better) I couldn't wait to turn it off. Maybe I shouldn't comment on this silent as I haven't really watched it in total. I have a vast silent movie collection but I don't know if I even want to give it shelf room. And the soundtrack!!! KINO! What were you thinking!!! It sounds like a 6 year old at his first violin lesson! After watching this with my wife and looking at each other from time to time and probably having the same agonizing look on my face as hers...we just couldn't take it any longer. If you want to see Conrad Veidt at his \\"silent best\\" watch \\"The Man Who Laughs\\" instead! And if you want to see the same story/plot in an early talkie, watch \\"Mad Love\\" with Peter Lorre.

This CD shows a much more mature, confident and creative person and his saxophone sound is still quite distinctive. He has broken out of the smooth jazz/instrumental pop genre with a very enjoyable collection. Even if you are not wild about the rap piece, admire him for breaking new ground and savor the unique, sultry sax!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Warren Hill-Love Life","review":"If you like the wonderful sound of a sax you want this CD?

The drawings and diagrams are fantastic, the information is very useful, and it is overall sympathetic to the mother's plight. :)Some of the various things the book includes is distinguishing between different cries, how to swaddle a baby, what to do with a colicy baby, how to burp a baby, different methods of feeding baby food, which foods to start with, and just an entire array of useful information. And the way the book is set up makes it an easy read that you can pick up at any time.Also, I wouldn't limit this to just dads either.

Many masculine examples, starting from the basics, as well as instructing fathers on what to do and what should never be done are included in the book.

If you've ever seen the movie Knocked Up you may remember the controversy over getting the dad to read the birthing/parenting books. That bit rings true for all guys, I think, because most of those books are so geared to women so they feel like a chore to read.

This book was given to him as a gift and the chapter titles cracked him up to the point he'd want to read more.

It's a nice book that explains to new dads how to handle their new bundle of joy. From how to bond with your new baby to chasing a one year old around. My husband was never around babies when he was growing up so this helped him a little. I think it's a great book to give to new dads. It's certainly not a medical book on how to care for your baby, but it is a light-hearted book which is perfect for dads to be!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My son loved it!","review":"Bought this for my son when he was about to become a new father.

He relied more on the ones written by doctors and pediatricians."},{"rating":"1","title":"its funny, but just ok","review":"based on the reviews that I read, I thought that this would be a great book for my husband since we are expecting our first baby. In reality, it offers some practical information that everyone's book seems to have, only put into a more humerus light.

The book is OK, but really kinda lame. Honestly, the graphics make the book look like it was made in 1940 and some of them are down-right weird. There are a few good, humorous points in the book. I have not finished it. Not sure I would recommend. Hopefully I'll pick it up again and it'll turn out to be a great book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Average at best","review":"I received four fatherhood books over the holidays and this was one of them.

Their attempts at humor are lame and offensive. Some of the information is inaccurate or inappropriate. Some of the advice is flat out bizzare. It seems to have been written by a guy with a 1950s mindset - outdated. It's not all bad, but enough of it is, that I would not recommend it to any Dad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book for dissertation reference!

But I bailed after 30 min. After a couple of weeks I thought to myself \\"It can't have been that bad, can it?\\" & sat down with it again, starting where I left off. I managed another 20 mins & gave up. I am a fan of several members of the supporting cast & can't fault their performances. I thought the script was pretty decent & the oddball collection of characters interesting, if mostly stupid &/or unlikeable. But the pacing was absolutely dreadful. Maybe I'm spoiled by heist films like \\"Snatch\\", but in between brief bouts of slapstick violence the main character seemed to move in slow motion.

From the first episode to the last, the show gave the fans what they wanted. This show blended science fiction with a love story and it worked every time. If you were a real fan of the show, you felt every emotion the characters felt. This show is worth a watch if you like scifi and enjoy a good love story.

I didn't come into Roswell until after it had been cancelled, but I think you can tell that the makers of the series knew that the 3rd season would be the last. They tried to fit too much in -like a once grieving Isabelle suddenly falling in love/getting married - and ended up leaving a lot out - like where did the evil aliens go? The government stepped up their antics, but the aliens that had been trying to kill the \\"royal 4\\" for so long seemed to take a back seat. The ending, however, was fantastic.

He was very stiff and it was hard to warm to his portrayal of Abraham. Also, there wasn't enough vocal input from God, expecially since his promises to Abraham and indeed the world should be center stage and offer the viewer a wholistic picture of the first covenant. There were some omissions and scenes out of order from the bible.

The movie covers the period shortly before Abraham's calling by God to his wandering to Egypt and finally back up to Canaan. It also tells the story of Lot as a sub-plot. It then concludes with the birth of Isaac and Ishmael and the offering of Isaac.Scripturally, the movie is pretty sound. Their artistic license was not distracting from the Scriptures as happens sometimes in other films.From a production point of view, it is very well done. The actors are good and even know how to show emotion (I've seen too many Biblical movies where the actors talk in some strange distant tone of voice). Lots of action, too.This movie is definitely PG-13.

Not sure if this toaster was defective but it should not take 3 cycles to get the bread toasted. The heating elements are too far away to toast regular bread...it looked liked the inside heating element was hotter than the other & therefore the bread on one side was darker than the other. The wide slots are better for toasting bagels than regular bread.

Overall, I recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lasted 15 months","review":"For a toaster this expensive, one might think it would last a few years. NOT! While it was working, it worked very well. Just after the warranty expired, the lever that you press to make it toast decided it would no longer stay down. The toaster still works, but you have to now stand there and hold it the entire time you are toasting something.I am going back to a less-expensive Black & Decker model. This was not a good experience at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Poor Durability","review":"We had the KMTT200 for a little over a year when we fianally gave it up. The lever would not stay down; ego, no toast. We did not have the sales receipt so the guarantee would not be good even if we had had it less than a year. We paid about $70.00 for the toaster. We do not use the toaster a great deal, not even weekly and there are no children using it for PopTarts or whatever.The lever problem had actually existed well before we fianally gave it up, sometimes it worked and sometimes it did not.I called the KitchenAid service center and was told that the high cost of repair parts made repair inpractical and KitchenAidno longeer reparied the KMTT200. I was told that KitchenAid would give me a new or rebuilt toaster at 30 per cent off.I asked why would I buy a toaster at any discount price that would not last even one year, and said good day. I was thankedfor calling KitchenAid and tolded to have a great day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Toaster","review":"How difficult is it to make a solid toaster without all the bells and whistles? We selected this toaster for our wedding registry last year. It lasted 16 months. It toasts unevenly. It sucks. Now it doesn't work at all. The only positive I have to say is it looks nice and matches our appliances. We're planning on going with the $15 Proctor and Silex. Stay away from this over-priced unevenly toasted garbage!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent and Informative research book","review":"Very well written and highly informative book on the white collar crime issue of Fraud. Dr. Albrecht has outdone himself with this extremely useful and easily understood literary work. As a fellow researcher in the white collar crime realm, I feel that this book will be an excellent reference and referal for me when I am conducting my empirical research. I feel that his in depth but easily understandable definitions of the various kinds of fraud are a useful tool for the reader who is essentially uniformed about the global growing concern of fraud. I strongly believe that his sections on the pressures involving white collar crime are quite true and accurate. This book should also be used as a tool for professional law enforcement, accountants, and attorneys to expand their knowledge of the many faces of fraud."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best pregnancy books on the market","review":"This was a great book.

Gone is the sense of openness and wonder which characterised \\"Valley in the Clouds\\" and \\"Another Star in the Sky\\" and adventurousness of \\"In the Wake of the Wind\\" and \\"Quest of the Dream Warrior.\\"There is one small, beautiful gem, however. Track 3, \\"The Jade Mountain,\\" is an understated and lovely performance. It gives one a glimpse of David's true creative depths, which are otherwise sublimated by the bland, generic offerings of \\"Caravan of Light.\\" For an introduction to the REAL David Arkenstone, I recommend the other albums noted in this review."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some helpful ideas","review":"This book had some helpful ideas, but is really for a beginning choir director, as it really deals with basic techniques.

It was all the six of us who watched it could do to see the whole thing. Some problems:1. Jimmy's apartment is described as being in need of cleaning up and also called a dump. What you see on screen is an immaculate apartment that most would love to have. At least have your production designer read the script to see what the apartment is supposed to look like.2. Technical problems include shoddy blocking, continuity problems during cuts, crossing the imaginery 180 line, and amateurish camera work.3. Ok, the first two were picky things, but the biggest problem is this movie falls flat on it's face. Attempts at humor fail, characters are not believable, the story is not engaging.I never saw the stage production but my hunch is it MUST have been better than this movie. I suspect much was lost in the adaptation. This one is not even worth renting."},{"rating":"1","title":"A marginal film version of a great book","review":"Jimmy Zoole is having a bad streak of luck. He's been robbed twice in the past three months, his best friend died, his girlfriend broke up with him on New Year's Eve, and his cat is dead. Things are about to change when the burglar breaks into his apartment again and gets caught by Jimmy.Steve Guttenberg's directing debut is a margianl film at best. The action takes place so fast that there doesn't seem to be enought time to get to know the characters. Shirley Knight does a good job as Jimmy's Aunt Claire, and Lombardo Boyar plays Eddie Tesoro, the burglar, very well. But, anyone who has read the book or viewed the play will be disappointed with some of the character and scene changes. The humor of the book is missing, as well.The DVD does contain an okay commentary, some behind-the-scenes footage and an alternate ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Movie Sucks! Save yourself and READ THE BOOK!","review":"Steve Guttenberg is such a whiney mess in this movie. It has absolutely none of the charm of the original book. James Kirkwood would turn over in his grave if he knew what Guttenberg did to his play/book!The book is one of the funniest things ever written. The movie is painful to watch and destroys the book. If you must watch the movie, make sure that you read the book first! The movie has absolutely no redeeming qualities."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT funny and very unpleasant","review":"Unlike the reviewers who had read the book and perhaps thereby gained the strength to stick with this lugubrious film, I came upon it naively at Blockbuster. I want to disclose at the outset that I couldn't watch the entire DVD and had to turn it off after about an hour, so maybe I missed something profound. I suffered miserably through the first hour hoping that it would redeem itself, but the principal character is so thoroughly unpleasant, both in the way the part is written and the acting, that it was sheer torture. The supporting cast was more appealing, but the pace of the film was excruciatingly slow, the attempts at humor repeatedly fell flat, and since nearly all the action took place in the main character's apartment, the result was unrelieved claustrophobia. All of which left me with a whopping case of renter's remorse -- life is too short to waste watching films like this, even if you live to 100!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Someone needs to apologize to James Kirkwood","review":"This was a pitiful and painful adaption of a really great book. It could have been a really wonderful movie, in different hands. I'd seen Steve Guttenberg on a talk show quite a while ago discussing his having made this film, and was really looking forward to it. I'm sorry now. Within an hour of watching this dreck, I was curled up with the book again - just to put the shine back on the memory.

The plot keeps your interest and you find yourself drawn into the drifter's world. You can feel his pain and long to see him move forward. The acting is first rate and I was particularly surprised by Chris O'Donnell's role as a hitman. I had to look twice before I realized it was him. There are many twists and the scenery is wonderful. I recently visited Twnetynine Palms on a trip to Joshua Tree Nat'l Park. While the town isn't depicted as it truly exists, the overall desert scnenery is right on target.

But the intrigue ends there since the movie feels like it was left on the drawing board. The movie wallows in headachey camera edits and chrachters that are never draw out. The plot line feels familiar and rehashed. the shear confusion of the storyline and awkward charachters difuse any sort of interest in whats going on.The performaces are patciualrly poor by Chris Odonnell in faux cool mode and acting as hollow as ever.

It portrays everyone there as... well... ignorant thieves. This movie jumps so much that I was almost lost, and thats a hard thing to accomplish.

Downtown is half New York City history and half autobiographical. Yet, because Hamill has spent his whole life in New York and has come to know it so well, the autobiographical parts of the book become a history of New York described by one of the City's most respected residents.

Like a previous reviewer, I have had to reset the AP at least once a day for it to resume to work. At first, I thought it was my cable service; however, when I switched to a different router, I have absolutely no problems. I have updated the AP with the most recent Firmwire and have purchased several to test them. Unfortunately, they are all lemons and the problem lies within the AP itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY IT!!!","review":"I've owned this unit for a week and I've had to reboot it over a dozen times. My experience with Netgear's FWAG114 is apparently the rule rather than the exception; message boards show many people face this problem. Things like VPN are worthless if you have to do a local reboot twice a day; Netgear is irresponsible for selling this product. This is a very expensive product that I would think Netgear would want to work. Why they would stake their reputation in part on a product they know doesn't work is simply baffling. In short, the fancy specs obfuscate the fact that it just doesn't work. The Netgear FWAG114 is ultimately a glowing example of \\"too good to be true.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Owned since June 2004 and not one major problem or issue","review":"For me this has been a sound electronic device running constant for nearly four years now. Solid firewall capabilities, never a reboot other than firmware upgrades, and plenty of configuration options to enable/disable or jackup various features.No product will ever be perfect and in fairness I have to add my gripes about this one: wireless signal strength varies and at times drops off when I'm outside (router is in a basement) which pisses me off but generally has not problems inside home, management interface is bland and cluttered, a bit expensive but you get what you pay for.If I could give it 4 and a half stars, I would. It loses one star because connectivity outside and only 75-80 direct feet away should work without 50/50 chances. Again, the FWAG is in a basement so going up one flight and out the front door (or through the concrete and earth) is probably tough for such a little signal wave. Nonetheless, I've been very happy with it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Blues Piano","review":"This is a great book but you really have to be an accomplished intermediate as it lists.

A great book nonetheless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the price","review":"I play in a 60s/70s cover band that also plays a few blues standards and am always looking for new ideas. This book feels like a bunch of 3x5 cards grouped into chapters, a confusing arrangement. Richards doesn't address many basic blues piano techniques and never discusses soloing. The last part of the book wanders into jazz territory. I would recommend the book to jazz students, but not blues or rock fans.The \\"lessons\\" are a piece of sheet music (played on the CD) followed by bulleted points on parts of the piece and assignments for working on the piece. Frequently, the key and corresponding scale are reviewed before the piece, which seemed silly to me.I got so frustrated by the irrational organzation, I finally just put on the CD and listened for any phrase or riff that caught my ear, and referred to the book to find out how it is played. The CD is only piano, no band."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst picture quality","review":"When I put the disc into the player I thought I was watching a series from the early 1930s based on the decrepid deteriorating film quality. How can a TV show from the 1950s be this bad of shape? But it is. Hence the price.What's really odd is that they throw in ONE of Basil Rathbone's Sherlock films into the mix...what's he got to do with any of this? Was it done to mislead buyers so Basil's face can appear on the cover instead of Ronald Howard's? Makes no sense, the set contains 39 of R. Howards Sherlock series, 3 movies from the 1930s and just one of Basil's.What I do like is that they imprinted the episode # and title on the discs so when you are looking for a certain episode you can quickly find it by reading the label on the disc. 39 episodes are split among 3 discs. The 4th disc contains the 4 movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sherlock","review":"I enjoy the older productions and so generally like this collection of Sherlock Holmes, however, I was disappointed that there was only one production featuring Basil Rathbone who is a favorite of mine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste words...","review":"\\"With just slightly less vigor than that of the Moors when they took Spain, the chironomid-pupa fly fished deep on a floating line took western lakes.\\"This is just a sample of the hair-pulling sentences that the reader must endure.

That means the product description is a lie - it says it contains the \\"original network broadcasts of their thrilling four-game post-season run\\". But the original network broadcasts were in HD, and you can't have HD on standard DVDs, HD can only be on Blu-ray.The NFL messed up on this one. They released the Saints \\"Road to XLIV\\" set on Blu-ray, and now they're going backwards with the Packers set. Standard DVDs only look good on old CRT TVs.

Don't follow my lead. I was stunned by the poor video quality of the Super Bowl broadcast. To say it looks like a VHS recording off an analogue source is being only slightly hyperbolic. The sound is OK, so long as you don't have it turned too high. But the picture is fuzzy and with poor detail even in close-ups.

Why would you even consider not releasing a Blu-ray version of a sports spectacle that was meant for HD? If Vivendi decided this on their own then the NFL needs to get in touch with them and TELL them \\"if you release our product it has to be on Blu-ray\\". Maybe when Vivendi is sitting on a few freight cars full of unsold SD dvd's they will realize their mistake (but probably not if they were dumb enough to do this in the first place).

It seemed pretty \\"bubble gum\\" at the time, but I had read that Sweet wrote great heavier music. This album is in no way as good as \\"Desolation Boulevard\\" or \\"Give us a Wink\\", but is a very good representation of the transition to harder rock. \\"New York Connection\\" is an excellent song with a great lead from Andy Scott, one of the most underrated guitarists ever!! \\"Done Me Wrong Allright\\" is a barnstormer, as is \\"Man From Mecca\\". The early tunes that are bonus tracks such as \\"Poppa Joe\\" and \\"Jeannie\\" are too poppy and cheesy for my taste. They should have included the original \\"Need A Lot of Lovin\\" that was on the original 1973 album version on Bell and also one of the greatest hard rock songs in the Sweet canon, \\"Burning\\", a true classic. Still an essential purchase though."},{"rating":"1","title":"First effort","review":"this album is interesting because it has \\"Hellraiser\\" on it.

For hardcore Sweet fans only, and because it contains a slew of Nicky Chinn/Mike Chapman drival, I give it only two stars. The band does better in the future writing their own material. Maybe not album sales-wise, but the albums written by the band members are WAY better than this.

I recall the acting was excellent and the themes of each of the shows was outstanding. The show centers around SGT Saunders (Vic Morrow) and his squad of men patrolling against the Germans. You'll see ambushes, movements to contact, and practically the entire array of actions small units experienced in WWII. Great stuff!I'll be viewing this over and over. I just hope I don't over analyze the episodes based on my 20 year career in the Army many years after the show aired. Either way...it will be a blast to see the characters again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality of classic war dramas","review":"If you like old war movies you will like this series. I have watched over half of the first season and have not found a bad episode yet. The writing, direction and acting are all super!"},{"rating":"2","title":"In the trenches again with Sergeant Saunders!","review":"I watched this television series back in the 1960's when I was a kid. I loved it then, and I still do. It was great seeing these excellent episodes again. The DVD release is fantastic! Excellent quality especially when you consider these shows are 40 years old. Excellent extras as well...I loved the commentary tracks. If you loved COMBAT! back in the '60's, you'll love these DVD's. If you are a war film fan and never saw COMBAT!, then buy these DVD's...you're in for a treat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disk one defective","review":"I have had two copies of this DVD. In both copies Disk 1 would not play. The other disks are OK.I am trying a third time. Hopefully I will have better results on my Sony DVD player."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring first season boxed set","review":"This first boxed set sucks. I remember the show somewhat, but these first shows are very slow. I may still buy some of the season 2 boxed sets because the series has a good foundation, and I have hopes that the later shows are better, as has been noted by others. There is one good episode in this first boxed set where the sarge has to work his way out of some town, and there are some thoughful moments in that episode. And there is another episode where one of the guys has to pretend to be a German officer, but he can't say anything because he doesn't speak German. There are some tense scenes in that one, but most of the episodes are not worth a second viewing, though. If the other seasons are really good then I would get this set just to have the complete collection, but I'm not sure how good the other seasons are going to be. The picture quality is nicely remastered though."},{"rating":"2","title":"As GREAT as I remember!!","review":"I watched this series as a kid and always remembered it as one of my favorite shows. Just got Seasons I and II for my son for Christmas. I enjoy watching it as much as I did back in the 60's.Great buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"really enjoy watching","review":"Have not seen these in years are really enjoying watching this series and plan to get the rest of them. The shows are done really well. I say this is a good buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Baby Boomer Favorite!","review":"Combat! was a truly unique show in the early and middle 60's. My friends and I were in 2nd grade when it premiered, and we'd play army afterwards, based on the story and our own imagination of course. Viewing the episodes as an adult these many years later, I am truly struck at the quality of the entire production. Many of the story themes are much more sophisticated than I remember, and more complex than you would associate with TV in the year 1962 and shortly thereafter. Recall that there were hundreds of thousands of men, still in their 30's, who had actually lived through all of that, when this show was on. Anyway, whether this show brings back fond memories of the days when it played or not, it most certainly stands on its own, a work enjoyable even in today's lurid world of special effects and CGI. I hope they will put the entire series on DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best War TV Show Ever","review":"I remember this show when I was growing up. this show had action and adventure. My dad was a WWII vet and he said that it was pretty close to the real thing. I really liked all of the characters, SGT. Saunders, Lt. Hanley and Cage, Littlejhon and Kirby. they were great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD Flu","review":"It is great having these on DVD. It brings back alot of memories. I have several Seasons and Campaigns. My only complaint is the picture stalls and/or pixals blotch up half way into the shows. You have to stop the DVD, then hit play. Most of the time it didn't work so you just skipped to the next show. I have tried on several manufactures DVD players and the same thing occurs. Also on friends DVD players. It was all quite annoying. But I still rate it 2 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, BUT...","review":"This is marvelous vintage TV, probably the best episodic treatment of WWII ever done.However, there is one glaring bit of bad taste apparent in the documentary \\"Memories of Combat\\" that I can't believe was allowed for release. As Vic Morrow's career and untimely death are being discussed, he is shown in a scene in which he looks in a disturbed fashion at a HEADLESS MANNEQUIN.Even if this was done inadverently, why didn't someone catch it down the line and prevent its release? I mean, come on, people, show a little respect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"If you do a lot of work with numbers on a laptop, and, like me, you are much more familiar with a number-pad than with the numbers row of the keyboard, then an external keypad is a huge benefit.Unfortunately this one does not realise the benefits: so frequently do keystrokes fail to register that I have to check the screen after every entry. This seems to apply to all the keys. The keys make a noise when you hit them, but that noise does not mean that the keystroke has worked. The keys are also a little narrower and therefore harder to hit than a standard number-pad.The retractable USB cord is a nice feature.The calculator feature is absurd: why would you need a calculator beside your laptop?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy for Mac","review":"I bought this product because I had just bought a beautiful new wireless keyboard for my Mac. The keyboard does not have a numeric keypad on it. In the past, I have never had a problem with Kensington products, but this one would not work to save it's life, hence I returned it. If you have a Mac, do not think this product is plug and play, because it's not. I was never able to get it to work. I bought instead a Goldtouch Apple compatible keypad and it worked immediately.... total plug and play. If you want ease of use, go with the Goldtouch. BTW, Amazon as always was fantastic at taking the gear back and issuing a refund. They're the best. No questions asked, no equivocations. Hope this helps."},{"rating":"1","title":"No good for my G4 Powerbook","review":"I kept this thing and it does work as both a calculator and a keypad. However, if left plugged in to the USB port, the battery drains very quickly. I don't move my laptop very often and wanted to be able to leave the keypad plugged in for any numeric entries I might need. By having to unplug it every time after use, and not be a heavy number cruncher, it is more of a hassle most of the time to attach the unit than to hunt and peck at the top for a few numbers. The keyboard layout is also not nearly as easy to use as the numeric pad on the keyboard that I have from an old iMac. I was able to enter numbers easily with that pad without looking but do not find the same ease of use with this unit. A great disappointment for me although I'm still using it. The power problem seems to me like an easy fix by simply adding a power on/off button, which it does not have."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite book on needlepoint","review":"I have books by Graham Rust, Candace Bahouth, Kaffe Fassett, Beth Russell among other notable designers in needlepoint and this is the only one that I want to do every design in the book. The charts are easy to read, with symbols in addition to being colored. I wouldn't recommend it for a true beginner, but it is a fantastic book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful needlepoint book!","review":"I was absolutely delighted when this book arrived. Not only are the designs superb, the general layout of the book is excellent too. There are full page close ups, so that you get a really good feel for exactly how the tapestry will look. The instructions and graphs are very clear and the photography is beautiful. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moose Tracks","review":"A great book enjoyed by my 4,5 and 7 year old. Terrific pictures with lots of detail for young non-readers to enjoy. Superb writing that is classic Karma Wilson. A great gift for any child -- boy or girl."},{"rating":"2","title":"great children's book","review":"I'm a huge fan of Karma Wilson, and I'm hoping my two-year-old will be too. Ms. Wilson has a great ear for rhyme, and I always enjoy the illustrations. This is a fun book with a silly ending. Great for reading at bedtime."},{"rating":"1","title":"warning: read at your own risk!","review":"I read this for my M.A. in History, now I know why I never read it as a undergrad. It is a bit drawn out. I like Morgan, he is very interesting and I would say the same thing about Winthrop. But like Morgan sometimes does, he draws out Winthrop's story so much that you begin to forget what the original thesis was, a people striving to be perfect in an imperfect world. Morgan's thesis would have worked much more effectively as a Journal Article in the Journal of New England History. Although, Morgan's thesis might have been ground breaking in the 1960's, it is hardly earth shattering today. I didn't feel anymore educated about Puritans than I was before. It is a good book to reflect on how historians thought about 17th century New England before the 1960's but I didn't see much use for it beyond that. Morgan has made a fine argument, it is just too bad that it was so long winded that it could have been summed up in a journal entry."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring and overwellming usage of big lengthy words","review":"I think the book was well over done. It could have been summed up in much simpler and easier terms than it was. The book did give great depth on the dilemma that the purtitans had on their travel to and in the New England colonies"},{"rating":"1","title":"Put on your pajamas and grab a pillow","review":"Having trouble sleeping? If so, I highly suggest you pick up Edmund Morgan's Puritan Dilemma. This book should be perscribed by doctors nationwide to help cure insomnia. I was forced to read this book for an American history course and I am so happy that I have finally completed it. It's not that the book was long (only 205 pages) it was just very drawn out. The essential information of the book could have easily been summed up in about 30 pages. The book did have its moments, but overall it was a major disappointment. If you are thinking of picking up this book for personal reading, please think again. Otherwise you will definitely need a large pot of coffee to keep your eyes open through this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overly long, Over written...","review":"the book was much too lengthy, it could've been summed up simply in one chapter. Secondly, it doesn't read well- theres no character development at all. I guarantee you'll struggle through this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Fiance","review":"Although this book was required text, and I am usually just a reader of novels, the book held my attention. Slow read but still rather good for being required. It really makes Withrop out like a king and mentions many things I would have never thought about.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent bio","review":"Short and sweet is the word. Morgan is a first-rate historian who, unlike some of his colleagues, can write in an engaging way that draws in the average reader. This book will not only shed light on Winthrop, but is also the best description of puritanism that I have come across. If you want to understand this influential movement, and one of its most important leaders, here's your book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read","review":"I agree with most people that have read this book, that is gets somewhat boring and is a little drawn out.Other than that, it's a great informative book on the Puritans and John Winthrop."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best from the best","review":"Edmund S. Morgan is simply a wonderful historian and writer. As I get older I find I appreciate a writer who can get to the nub of his subject without blathering on for hundreds of unnecessary pages. This excellent short biography concisely tells the story of Winthrop's leading role in the Massachusetts Bay Colony established during the Great Migration of Puritans. Great books challenge us with new insights. Read this book and leave your preconceptions of Puritans behind."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent review of Puritanism in Massachusetts and England","review":"While this book is an excellent biography of John Winthrop, Massachusetts' first Governor, it is also an excellent review of the various types of Puritanism and the issues faced by Winthrop and others in their American experiment to found and develop a colony based on Scripture. Morgan gives a very balanced portrait of Winthrop: his genius and his foibles. While looking closely at the Puritanism of the Massachusetts colony, Edmund S. Morgan, also show the Puritanism of England and its leaning toward Presbyterianism and the dangers of seperatism that were very threatening to Winthrop and his supporters. Overall, this is a very readable and entertaining biography that looks at the development of Winthrop's thought from his youth in England to his great contributions to Massachusetts' survival."},{"rating":"2","title":"modern labelling","review":"I originally used this supplement for its then stated purpose of increasing blood circulation in the legs.

I dislike this one so much, I haven't even finished it and I don't think I will. I would not categorize this book as a romance but science fiction. I admire her for trying something new,but she should stick with writing romances."},{"rating":"1","title":"I have to agree with the bad reviews","review":"I was a fan for years, but I've found several of Jude's more recent books to be lacking in quality. Maybe I'm just getting older and my tastes have changed, but in my opinion, she used to be much better at making the reader connect with the characters. Most of her characters lately are one dimensional and boring, and the stories aren't believable. Sad as it is to say, I'm not likely to purchase any more of her books."},{"rating":"2","title":"I read the back cover and wasn't gonna buy it, but ...","review":"it's by Jude Deveraux. The back cover blurb is rather hokey, and it's a sequel, but Forever and Always is by JD so I snapped it up. Jude does not disappoint in providing yet another scrumptious fairy tale for us grown up girls. While this is not my favorite of her books, it still makes an excellent bedtime story (if I start reading hours before bedtime that is, because a little thing like needing sleep is not going to make me put it down.)Note - this is a sequel, read Forever first.Also, don't expect a romance book, it is a well written, well paced, amusing, Jude Devereaux paranormal mystery.Fun light read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forever Trilogy","review":"I can't believe I am going to say this, but I actually want to burn these books. This is the worst trilogy I have ever read. I have read books by Jude D. before and that is why I bought the Forever Trilogy. These books have to be the worst I have ever read. I feel like a child saying this, but they are dumb. Save your time & money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Horrible","review":"I used to love Jude Deveraux! This book reads like the description to a video game; they have to go here, run through this corridor, get this item... with all the warmth and depth of character of a video game, too. What happened to you Jude?DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the Jude Deveraux I know and love?","review":"I have read and collected every one of Jude Deveraux's books. She is the ultimate storyteller, and a gifted writer. I would love to see an end to this trend of late to write \\"murder, she wrote\\" type stories and have her return to the heartwarming and romantic novels of her earlier style. These included \\"spirits\\", ghosts, angels and time travel themes - not a disappointment in the bunch!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Forever and Always","review":"The mystic appeal in this book is interesting. It creates a different story approach when at times stories can become the same old thing. There is more mystery than in most of the books by Deveraux. Excellent character development adds to the entertainment of the book.I do not care for books that require one to get the next in order to finish the story.People who like romance, mystery and mystic stories will enjoy this read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad, but not great","review":"I really enjoyed Jude's first novel in this series, Forever, except for the ending. It fell a little flat. The second book Forever and Always, jumps around too much. It leaves us asking too many questions at the end of the book. I realize there is going to be a third book, but I'm left too confused about certain people and what part they are playing in the story. If you're looking for romance try A Knight in Shining Armour, or my personal favourite Sweet Liar (there's a little bit of mystery in this one)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time on this book","review":"I wish I could have had some of that True Persuasion to make me like this book. If it wasnt' for the fact that I have never not finished a book I started, I would have thrown this in the fire. Now, Im disappointed that I didn't. A complete waste of my time. I have never finished a book and felt mad and confused at the same time. Horrible Ms. Deveraux! And I am a huge fan!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened???","review":"Jude D has always been one of my favorite all time authors but her last few books have been a total waste!

I think I'll go back and read the Lady series or the Velvet series again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good book !","review":"I'm sorry that so many other readers didn't enjoy this latest offering by Jude Devereux. While I'll agree that the style is very different from the way she's written, I did think it was an excellent follow-up to \\"Forever\\", which I also enjoyed. I wouldn't recommend reading this book without reading \\"Forever\\", but I do believe that fans of Devereux's new writing style will find this to be an engaging and fun read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Linc ruined it for me.","review":"I love Jude D. I even liked the first book of this series. Rememberance is my favorite romance novel of all time. The main male character in this book was simply horrible. A bundle of offensive stereotypes. Linc is the gorgeous black man with this cold hearted black girlfriend and he is secretly in love with white women. As a black women I was offended. I love romance novels Nora Roberts is great because she sticks with what she knows she is white and Irish most of her characters are the same. I love sci fi so I read Laurell K Hamilton who is female short and very pale most of her main characters are the same. I am not saying ones charcters cant be diverse but if you want to write about a character who you mostly cannot relate to at least do some research not what you see on tv and hear on the radio but talk to people."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I like many other have read all of Jude Deveraux's books. And I too agree that her latest books have not been good at all. Maybe she needs to start over with a new line of family or something. But definately more romance. I have now resorted to trying a different author.I am only 1/2 way through this book but I'm forcing myself to finsih it since I started it. I did read the first book. It was okay but still not like any of her other books.If anyone wants books like her try Julie Garwood...some of her are excellant."},{"rating":"2","title":"fantastic","review":"I love this book I thought it was fantastic. people keep saying the characters were weak i don't understand how they were weak i thought they were great characters and Darci sounded very realistic. I like this story better then most of her books. don't get me wrong i love all her books i have read. expecially the new ones. Keep up the great stories i cant wait for the next to come out in the Forever series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the price","review":"I picked the book before a long flight, because I generally like Ms. Deveraux.But this one was dissapointing and weak from the beginning. The way it is written, one chapter told by Darci, the next by Linc, is interesting. But the plot is lacking in structure. Darci's psychic powers are used as an explanation of the characters' personalities, but in the end, they come out boring, silly and utterly void.Not worth the price of the book, at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different in a good way","review":"Once again, Ms. Deveraux has provided a story that is both different and refreshing. I finished this book understanding a lot more about Darci's actions and why she behaves as she does in the previous book, Forever. Linc was a wonderful and interesting new addition to the story line, and I hope to see him again in the future. Hats off to the author for being brave enough to write a male lead of African American descent outside the Multicultural market.Like Forever, Forever and Always is a departure from the Romance genre norm, but in a good way. I love traditional romance novels, but I also think it's nice to read something different every now and then. The one thing I had difficulty adjusting to is the heroine lusting after a man other than the hero, however, I tried to keep an open mind and it didn't detract from the story as a whole. Overall, I thought Forever and Always was interesting and entertaining, and I am anxiously awaiting the next installment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forever and Always","review":"First off, I love to read Jude Deveraux and didn't think Forever was up to her standards. The sequel, Forever and Always, is the worst material I've read from her. I'm very disappointed in these two books and don't plan on going for the next one. The story line jumps around between Linc and Darci. Linc's character doesn't develop well and Darci is on a goose chase while having no real presence in the book. At least in Forever, she had a little zip and chemistry. I think Ms. Deveraux is trying to expand her writing and is excluding what made her exciting to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jude could have done MUCH better","review":"I was extremely disappointed with this book. The first book in the forever series was intriguing, suspenseful, and had just the right amount of romance. I was anxious to read Forever & Always because I thought it would be just as good if not better than Forever. Wow, was I wrong! This book was horrible! It focused way too much on racism and the story itself was choppy. I'm not sure if I'll be getting the next book in the Forever series because, frankly, if it's as bad as this one, I don't want to waste my money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What was she thinking","review":"First, what happened to Adam -he is the only person from the first book I liked. Also, what is with this interracial thing - I'm a black woman annoyed by the this scenerio. This book was a waste of [money]- I'm writing the publisher and asking for my money back!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Give this one a pass","review":"I was interested to see what had happened to the main characters since \\"Forever,\\" so I picked up this book. It is a big disappointment.Darci's husband is missing, and someone supernatural has him since she can't get a feel on where he is with her psychic abilities. She ends up helping Linc find his missing child since she feels that will help her find her husband.Linc is a stereotype of a black man. All he thinks about is sex, and just about every scene he is in has him lusting after someone. He even has sex with someone he's never met when she wakes up while he is sneaking into her room to steal something for Darci. He really brought the tone of the story down.I normally enjoy Jude Deveraux, but it was like she was trying to hard to please everyone with this book- those who want a lot of sex, and those who want a supernatural story. In the end, she failed all of her readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blech!","review":"I may not have been a fan of JD's books for as long as another reviewer has been, but I have very much enjoyed her books in the past. This one, however, was not worth the time it took me to read it. I don't like that she switches from one character's point of view to another's. I don't like the characters, especially ditsy Darci. And the story line was difficult for me to follow. I regret buying this book and will definitely not be buying the next one. In fact, I hesitate to buy any of her books anymore. They're either too sad, or like this one, too disjointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good story","review":"I think that if you are looking for a typical romance novel you may be disappointed in this novel. It focuses more on the paranormal than the romance. I thought that the story and characters were strong and entertaining. I liked this book more than the first in the trilogy simply because the ending concluded this section of the story. That's all I will comment on the ending...If you like a good ghost story with a hint of romance, you will probably like this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I LIKE DARCY A LITTLE MORE THIS TIME","review":"I liked her a little more this time, but still the book wasn't very good, first I don't get what the publisher review had to do with the book, and the book is really sad and it doesn't have and ending, of course Ms. D. wants us to buy the next one, but still, how more tests does she have to pass??"},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly","review":"I too have read all of Ms. Deveraux's books, but this one was very disappointing. It was just too silly! A complete waste of my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ditto to Blech","review":"Jude Deveraux is definitely a better author than this book would lead the reader to believe. The characters were poorly developed, the storyline sloppy and disjointed, and the ending was thrown together in the most implausible manner imaginable.

Your readers deserve a better effort for the nickel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over rated","review":"I decided to buy this CD just because of all of good reviews about how nice this CD is, very disappointed! too boring to feel relax."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soothing, melodic background music","review":"This Merlin's Magic album is a solid piece of music to use as a background score for healing work or meditation. It has some nice melodies and instrumentation, and the only reason I don't like this as much as Merlin's Magic's other Reiki CDs is that the music contains some fairly dull lulls in some spots, whereas the subsequent Reiki albums from this artist are more consistent in setting the mood and maintaining soothing melodies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what it looks like","review":"The picture for this product is extremely misleading. It doesn't look anything like what I actually got. The hair is in a different style, much longer and a different texture and with lots of very visible glue keeping it to the rest of the mask. The face is differently shaped/not as detailed/a different color (plain brown instead of brown/red/black) and the mouth/teeth are different and just look dumb. The hand print on his face is barely visible and you can't really tell what it is, and to top it off the mask arrived to me smushed in a box and misshapen. Basically you can't even tell that this is supposed to be an orc.

This was one hell of a television show. I was 8 years old when the premiere episode came on and it was my father's favorite program. He was a WW2 veteran. This program premiered when writers knew how to write and they did not depend on fast cuts and digital images. The stories were very powerful and the acting was great! As a child , I was always waiting for the next episode and now I am happy to see these episodes on DVD. The main stars are dead now, Ric Jason and Vic Morrow and then Dick Peadbody. Also some of the production crew are now deceased. These people have certainly left a legacy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Combat","review":"Combat has to be one of the best shows to come out of the black and white era of television and though many times memories set us up for disappointment when we revisit decades later, Combat was no disappointment.

We just opened it and haven't put batteries in the guns yet, so I can't speak to them, but the holster is defective. One piece of velcro on one of the holsters is on the wrong side of the strap, so I had to twist the strap to connect it. As another reviewer mentioned, the length of the belt is just bizarre.

The listing for this product was unclear as to what size of a person it was for. Given that the electronic pistols had batteries and associated noises, I assumed it was for a child. However the belt was enormous -- I would guess it is for an adult with a minimum waist of probably 42\\" and was not very adjustable to a smaller size. Since the item was purchased a couple of weeks before Halloween, there was no time to return it and get a replacement. There was a considerable amount of cutting and taping that had to be done in order to get this product to work for an 8-year-old. Also, the pistols in the picture appear to be silver while the actual product was white. As far as we can tell from looking at the movie, Jango Fett's pistols are SILVER, so we don't know why we were sent pistols of a different color."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good buy.","review":"I bought Star Wars Jango Fett blasters for by boys to go with their Jango and Boba Fett costumes.

All of us were disappointed :( I would never recommend these blasters or the company that made them."},{"rating":"1","title":"LOOKS NOTHING LIKE THE PICTURE","review":"I'm super disappointed in this purchase.

Remove the old lamp and disconnect the 3 prong plug. Install the new bulb and reverse the process. Simple and easy. One tip is to wear gloves so you don't touch the bulb with your hands, as Sylvania suggests you could get your hand oils on the bulb and that area would burn hotter.Highly recommended, easy fix for dull headlights."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Bought these for a 93 nissan pickup an they worked great.

Living in a rural area in New Jersey I wanted headlights that would brighten up the road better than the halogen headlights that I was using. The lights do brighten up the road and do extend so I can see further and the path of the light is wider as well. They seem do a nice job in foul weather as well. Lately it has been rainy here and I have to go out at night and they do a nice job of brightening up my drive to and from where I have to go. Either in dry or wet road conditions they do a nice job.

I then tried printing directly from a compact flash card pluged directly into the card slot using the same image and the print still had visible banding.

Secondly, all types of foreign vocabulary was introduced to me, and lastly--Forsters whole way of writing was just too complex. Then to add to all this, the story was not interesting at all.

It deals with the tension between the British and the native Indians of India, as well as with the tension between the Hindus and the Muslims. It also deals with the mystical in its portrayal of characters in search of the infinite and eternal. The book is divided into three sections which correspond with the seasons of the Indian year - the Cold Weather, the Hot Weather and the Rains. Each section of the book is dominated by each of the seasons. Each section also focuses on one of the three ethnic groups found in India during this time (1920's).

British rule in India and its consequences constitute one of the most interesting and important aspects of world history. It is strange, therefore, that British novelists have rarely tackled the subject. But if this is the best they can manage, then it's probably no bad thing. Forster has no insight to offer on the nature of colonialism; how it affects the characters of the exploiter and the exploited; on the nature of racism; on conflicts of culture; or, indeed, any of the major themes suggested by a subject such as this. None of the characters seem fully realized, and the Hindu festival in the final part of the novel seems to me particularly embarrassing. Perhaps it's time that novels written in Indian languages were translated into English: they are bound to offer more insights than this hugely disappointing book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This book never grabbed me the way I had hoped it would.

There are only three or four memorable scenes in the whole book, and only one of them possesses any dramatic tension. I think Forster set out to make a statement about relations between colonial power and colonized people. Certainly he accomplished that, but then again he could have done it in a page or two. Instead he threw together a mediocre work of literature to demonstrate his point."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sections Missing","review":"A great book, but this version is marred by far too many typographical errors; moreover (and what's worse), entire sections are missing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"excellent book; poor Kindle edition","review":"I won't add to the other positive comments about this book.

Nevertheless, some of the prose is absolutely stunning, and the end of the book (in my opinion) is one of the most beautiful achievements in any novel. A book I would highly recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious, overrated and boring","review":"How this book, and Forster's work in general, can be so highly rated by critics who actually appear to be intelligent at the expense of genuine geniuses of the time like Joyce, Huxley is amazing. Just because I find something dry and boring doesn't mean it isn't great literature, but this does not apply to Forster, who is dry, boring, shows no psychological insight whatsoever, has wooden, unrealistic characters and dialogue and very few redeeming features at all. This novel has been described as \\"enchanting, epic and profound\\"; if you've heard this and are thinking of buying it then you should direct your attentions to Joyce's \\"Finnegans Wake\\", Huxley's \\"Point Counter Point\\" or T.S.

It remained in the rain all night. I also noticed that the box was damaged at one end. It stayed in the rain for 24 hours or so until someone strong enough to bring it in. We unpacked it, and the chair did not seem to be damaged, so I am not returning it. It is very stiff, however, compared to my old Travel chair. Does anyone know if it can be adjusted?

This movie describes the rapid global spread of a new virus which ends up killing 26 million people. The CDC, WHO, and other government agencies are actively trying to find a cure, or more specifically a vaccine to combat the aggressive new virus. This movie has an all-star ensemble cast including Matt Damon, Gwyneth Paltrow, Kate Winslet, Lawrence Fishburne, Jude Law, Elliot Gould and others. (NOTE: Damon and Paltrow had smaller roles that I thought they would.) The immediate breakdown of society due to panic over the virus and subsequent limited vaccine supply was disturbing.

Big names actors with an awful script! Terrible writing, bad acting, woeful music, trite plot, how did this ever pass the test audience? Even if this was a TV movie on a low budget I would rate this a burn for uselessness. It was like a bad joke! I felt that everyone was paid to not act!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Talk About Being Sick","review":"The climax wasn't delivered. There was NO build up to a climatic moment. It was very slow paced & there was nothing that had us on the edge of our seats in anticipation of something big happening. From the previews we saw, it looked to be an \\"edge of your seat\\" type of movie, but when we watched it we couldn't wait to get out of our seats. We almost walked out, but we stayed hoping that something good would happen, but nothing ever did. If you want to watch a good movie about a viral break out then watch \\"Outbreak\\" or \\"Resident Evil\\". This movie had a lot of good actors that performed well, but the story was not captivating to us. What a waste of money spent to make this. Maybe the book is fantastic & captivating but the movie didn't show it."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like stupid, this movie is for you","review":"Nothing ever happens in this movie. Thousands of people are supposed to be sick, but NO ONE ever works, municipal services collapse- it's the end of the world! Hollywood always goes for the cheap shot: if a bunch of people experience life in the same way (in this movie they are sick unto death), then we all must be having the same experience. No matter that people outside of big cities would not have the same exposure to disease that people in LA have.And the ending about the source of the virus could hardly be any dumber. If it were even remotely true, the human race would never have gotten off the ground...Get the old Dustin Hoffman movie about ebola disease, Breakout. Much better movie. It even has some explosions! And Rene Russo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Contagion...good over all","review":"This movie is done well. The story and plot are feasible and perhaps the realness of it makes it somewhat scary. The breakdown of society and scrapping/fighting for food and survival. The Day 1 reveal at the end was good. I was expecting something more along the lines of a remake of \\"Outbreak\\" with the nice little fantasy of finding the host and the cure and all ends well before it gets too awful. Obviously that is not what Contagion is all about. An outbreak in today's world and the reality of how it will hit and hit hard. That is Contagion. Even though it was not what i expected, it was still a good movie. I don't normally like \\"reality\\" stuff...have enough of that in my own life and don't care to watch it in movies or television...but this movie was done well and was, if not enjoyable (because of the subject matter), then mind-turning at least."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid movie with a great story; not for people with low IQs or ADD though","review":"I thought I was going to hate this movie, but I loved it. It had great acting and a great story line that managed to capture how a real-life outbreak would really happen. Surprisingly, there was conflict and tension that will keep the viewer interested during the entire film. Unfortunately, everyone has friends that do not like to use their brain or can't focus on a movie because they have ADD or are not educated enough to comprehend the material. They will be frustrated by the movie. There was nothing to hate about this film. If someone cannot stand the movie, perhaps they should read a bit more and broaden their horizons.

The story line is plausible, this event could very well happen and is populated by big name actors. A virus threatens to destroy a large fraction of humanity, and the first victim is Gwyneth Paltrow who transports the virus to Minnesota from Hongkong via Chicago. Her husband Matt Damon is unaffected by the deadly virus but it devours her young son. Kate Winslet,Lawrence Fishburne and Marion Cotillard are doctors trying to figure out the origins of the virus but little is revealed about their backgrounds. Exciting and terrifying.

This movie was with out a doubt the worst I have ever seen. Just when you think they isolated an actor, they switch to a different actor.

Had to be good, right?Wrong. I don't know how this film managed to be a cliched, boring drag when the subject matter is a 1918 Spanish-flu-like virus spreading around the world. But it seems to be lacking in anything stimulating or exciting. The characters were wooden and shallow, making it difficult to care about any of them.And the plot dragged on and on, showing scene after scene of people panicking. There was the usual conspiracy theories produced by a cliched internet blogger, the government of the United States was ineffectual and bumbling, and the government of other countries either didn't care or had no clue as to what they should do, so they did nothing.Avoid this turkey and if you want a thrilling virus movie, find Stephen King's The Stand, which is absolutely true to his book.Jeani Rector, EditorThe Horror Zine"},{"rating":"1","title":"Contagion","review":"This movie streams in great on the roku.

With ultraviolet you cannot download the movie onto your device. You have to stream the movie. Therefore, if you would normally watch your digital copies on a portable device during a roadtrip or on a flight - you won't be able to do this with the ultraviolet digital copy unless you have continuous internet connection with a strong signal. Also, the ultraviolet digital copies do not play on itunes; they only play via flixster, so if you're an apple person this may not be best for you.

THANK GOD I didn't just open it and pop it in the bluray player like I did with some other movies I purchased from Amazon (which Amazon also provided the wrong information for) because then I would just be stuck with this bluray too.

When I go to see a contastraphy movie I expect panic, there was a thin amount of panic once in a while, but for the most part it was all scientific with citizen's waiting it out at home. There were a few good parts where the young woman inoculated herself, and then went out of her way to infect herself, the prom dance, and the kidnapping. I am pretty sure that what I viewed about the politics within the world's governments and the health departments was right on target. But when I go to see a movie, or in this case rent one, I want to be removed from normalcy, and moved into fantasy for that short while, this did not fulfill that need.

But this is it. The film is essentially static. It has all the dramatic impact of a dead fern. Awful script. Words are uttered, but they seem almost disembodied. And I really could have been spared seeing the divine Kate Winslet in a body bag, with the attendants dumping her body and telling us that more body bags are on the way.

I was not even a little impressed. Yes, it was well intentioned, but on a whole, it barely rose above a public service announcement: cover your mouth when you cough and use a lot of hand sanitizer. That, and don't mix your bats with your pigs. Like who does!?I also found the pacing dead slow until, inexplicably (under time constraints?), there was a rush to wrap everything up. Well, not everything, there were a few glaring loose ends that I also found annoying. Why bother mentioning something if you're not going to follow through with it? In addition, the flashback coda was a bit pretentious and not a little insulting; got the point, no need to hit us over the head with a sledgehammer.So glad I didn't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not contagious","review":"Jude Law's profiteering web journalist was actually a pretty clever plot device.

Depressing.","review":"The basic plot is about a contagion that quickly spreads and kills, while the medical community races to stop it and create a vaccine. Unlike in the movie Outbreak, Contagion has no needed moments of comic relief. No smiles. No bits of humor. It is grim and depressing throughout. Though that's how things would be in real life should a pandemic breakout out, it provides agonizing entertainment.

The Holocaust research is also interesting and well adapted into the story. Unfortunately, my praise ends about there.

At the threat of the Austrian election being influenced by Israeli revelations, bombs go off and assassins get busy preventing disclosure of a candidate's family secrets. This is a page-turner that shines the light on world history and current anti-semitism."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gabriel Allon","review":"I love series, but at first I did not think that I would. My sister told me about this and how the Vatican plays a part in the series. How he is a painter at heart, but can not let injustice continue to happen to his people the Israelies. Every new book is an adventure in helping someone."},{"rating":"2","title":"AN ISRAELI ASSASIN WHO TRAVELS THE WORLD?","review":"A Death in ViennaAn Israeli assassin accidently recruited by being in the wrong place at the right time for the Mosad. International intrigue and compelling characters grab you and don't let go. Gabriel Allon is a reluctant protagonist the reader wants to know more about and cares where he goes after a mission is complete."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites in the series!","review":"what a wonderful read; this was the first Gabriel Allon book I picked up, not realizing this was a series, then went back to earlier books and all through the newest novel in 09. This book is heavy, but a wonderful novel neverthless. It is well-researched and thought out, well developed characters, nothing is left 'unresolved'. Highly recommend this book to any history/action buff."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great spy tale, backed up by historical research","review":"This was my first Silva book, (I know \\"A Death in Vienna\\" is the final book in a trilogy). My misstep in no-way took away from my enjoyment of the book. The leading figures were complex, realistic, and flawed. The heroes were not the typical James Bond or Clint Eastwood types that populate too many espionage novels. The author obviously has first hand experience of living in Vienna, since the descriptions of Vienna and the rest of Europe are ultra-realistic. The significant background information on the Holocaust made the book even more enjoyable since it added to the credibility of the plot line.The author's journalistic background gives his writing a tight, but rich feel. My only complaint was the evil characters lacked the depth that Silva gave the heroes. The bad guys were cold, unforgiving, and entirely evil. Despite this minor point, I look forward reading the first two books in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome information and story","review":"Another awesome book written by Daniel Silva. I have always enjoyed Mr. Silva's books, but this book is great. After reading this book, I got addicted to reading more about Adolf Hitler, Adolf Eichman and the Mossad. Mr. Silva simply did a wonderful job with this book. The letter written by Allon's mom described the atmosphere of the camp, the emotions all the prisoners were having and the punishments that they must endured while they were in camp. So sad, so sad. While reading this book, I cried and prayed for the Jewish people."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like Silva","review":"I happen to like Daniel Silva. His Gabriel Allon series is like those of John Sanford and John Lescroart. The plots are always different, the characters fully fledged out, and each book is hard to put down. I am happily retired so I can stay up all night reading and not have to put these books down. Great reads, all. Hooray Silva!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great read in the series","review":"I have become a definite fan of Daniel Silva as I enjoy working through the whole series. I've been impressed with each of the six novels I've completed so far and would have a tough time picking my favorite. His consistency is outstanding, the writing is first rate and the characters memorable. I recommend this book and the series to anyone who enjoys this genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Silva takes his place at the top","review":"This is the 4th Silva book I have read, all with Allon.All good, exciting, educational and with a purpose. As a recent spy novelist, I rank Silva at the top.....A good read...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait for the Movie!","review":"Not great literature, and not a page turner either, it is an OK read. The Austrians are efficient, protective, and resemble the authoritarian picture of them from World War II. The Swiss character is a banker. The Americans are pragmatic, looking at a greater world view. The main woman in the story (who has a small part to play) is beautiful, cunning, and as effective as any assassin. And the Israelis are efficient, determined, intelligent, and get their man. Obviously, lots of stereotypes.It would probably make a better movie than a book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent and intelligent novel","review":"I truly enjoy novels that are more than just good writing, though Silva's work clearly meets this standard. This book is intelligent, thoughtful and well researched. Silva calls upon historical references to WW2 and the holocaust, making the novel both an excellent read and emotionally charged.Beyond these points, Silva's writes a darn good spy/assassin/intrigue novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Death in Vienna","review":"Excellent!!!! and the best part is the author informs you at the end of the story of what is real and what is not!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as his others","review":"Daniel Silva disappoints in this fairly formulaic story. Characters are subordinated to another fairly standard recap of the Nazi era. Not his best work."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book","review":"This is a very very good book for teens and young adults especially. The book centers mostly around teens and young adults growing up. Its wonderful!"},{"rating":"1","title":"a definite disappointment","review":"Having read this book, and things Ms. Foxe has said in other books, it's easy to see that she is bitter about not getting more money out of Steven Tyler. She manages to gloss-over the fact that she dumped her first husband, David Johansen, for the wealthy Tyler. All in all, her ranting makes for an annoying, uninformative read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacking taste and maturity.","review":"It is disturbing that any human could make a profit off of immature angst and exaderated hardships. Any Aerosmith fan would feel disgust at this trashy excuse for a biography that rests below the prestige of a tabloid article. Shame on you Cyrinda; for sinking so low and showing the public such a horrible side of who you are."},{"rating":"2","title":"New York Dolly Girl","review":"Personally, I quite enjoyed this book. I wish, however, that she would have mentioned more about her time with David Johansen. And perhaps she does sound a tad bitter about Steven Tyler, but if everything she says is true about their relationship, I'd be bitter too! All in all, a good solid rock and roll girl bio. Totally recommend! ' '"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bitter, Tasteless, and Smacking of Disloyalty","review":"I came to this book through my love of Steven Tyler's autobiography. I thought his was fascinating, creative and well-written, but it left many questions. To answer them, I ended up reading Mia Tyler's book, Walk this Way, Joey Kramer's book, and this one. All of them were worthy in their own rite EXCEPT Cyrinda's. Although I do feel sorry for her, it is not for the reasons she wants me to. I find her slamming of Steven Tyler cynical sour grapes and also distasteful. And while it is pretty clear that Cyrinda was an abused child, it is so hard to read this book knowing that she has a child with Steven Tyler...how could she do that, how could she write this terrible book knowing that her daughter would and could read it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is so stupid, don't waste your money on it!","review":"If you wanna read about Steven Tyler and Aerosmith, not about his ex-wife then do not buy this book! This book is so stupid it's not really even about Steven and Aerosmith."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting ...","review":"If this book is entirely true, more power to Cyrinda. If not, she sure does put on a great show. I found it hard not to believe her. I thought the book was pretty good though."},{"rating":"1","title":"disturbing","review":"This is the first book I've read since Walk This Way. I loved that book! I found Dream On to be a page turner. I also found it disturbing. I dont want to hear bad things about Steve. I will believe the drugs destroy so much. I also believe if you truley love someone you love them no matter what material things they have or dont have. love should come first . love conqures all. I believe she lived a fairytale life in which most of us Aerosmith fans dream about. can you imangine! I'dbe sure not to blow it! cyrindas ended in a nightmare. I'am sure it was tuff a times but I choose to be a stand by your man type. Remember this is no every day life like 9 to 5ers live. It is a fairytale with highs like no other and low s just as low. I love them just the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"You have GOT to be kidding!","review":"Im going to make this short & sweet. I found 99% of this book totally unbelievable. I mean, geeze, give Tyler a break, there is no way he could have been that messed up and still front the best rock band in the world. And that stuff about Tyler and Perry, I just dont buy it, nope."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cyrinda is a little full of herself","review":"I know Steven Tyler should have done more for his daughter with Foxe and she is bitter about that, but he is her father and she should let it go. I guess she needed the money so decided to dish the dirt and try to make herself look good. It had its ok parts but most of the book was just Cyrinda whining."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK","review":"As a close relation of Steven Tyler now and during the time he was married to the author, Cyrinda Foxe, I know about their relationship quite well. This book is full of ridiculous exaggerations and fabrications. It's not even entertaining, but it does manage to be both whiny and a great instant headache.Poor Ms. Foxe, who only receives some $300 weekly in alimony never stops complaining. This is what you'll want to say to her: Get a job, stop trying to mooch off of a man you divorced when he was broke, and turn yourself off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should not of been made to look as if its all about Steven","review":"I thought Cyrinda's Bitterness showed thru in many aspects of this book!It should of been named \\"I want to talk about Myself But Let me put Stevens pic on the cover\\"considering Both her & Steven were admitted heavy drug abusersduring the time they were married How factual can either of them be?"},{"rating":"1","title":"(Post)Moderns Respond to the Ancestors","review":"This disc consists of three short films in which living filmmakers try to respond to or recreate films of the Silent Era. \\"Queer\\" in the title means \\"non-normative,\\" as not every one of the shorts has homoerotic content. Because there are so many subtitles here, one can't watch this as passively as one would with a \\"talkie.\\" In fact, you can't blink because you'll miss something. This work is meant to give a forum to young filmmakers. Its intended audience is hardcore fans of independent film. The last of the three works is the most touching, but also the most predictable and facile. I am not sure who worships the Silent Era in this day and age, but the disc is for that small group."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recommended","review":"There are over 500 entires in this A to Z video guide. Each contains plot, five-star movie ratings, cast, credits and ratings for sexuality. Also there are multiple indexes and a hard-to-find video locator. Many of our finest actors got their start in coming-of-age films. Tom Cruise, James Dean, Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Dillon, Edward Furlong, Ethan Hawke, Chris O'Donnell, River Phoenix, Jason Priestly, Keanu Reeves, Brad Renfro, Mark Wahlberg, Scott Wolf and Elijah Wood are just a few. What is a coming-of-age film? In simplest terms, a coming-of-age story is one in which a child or a teenager reaches a critical turning point or event that results in a loss of childhood innocence. Not surprisingly, most often this turning point revolves around adolescent sexuality. Recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"ANOTHER ONE OF MY FAVORITES!","review":"The sixth book in the series, Lost and Found, was one of my two favorite books out of the first six. Madison's friends are having a big ice skating party but Madison doesn't want to go. So she wishes for a snowstorm because then the party would be cancelled. Then, her wish comes true and the snow falls and falls and falls. Wanna know what happens with the party? Read the book! Madison and her Mom decided to organize the attic because what else is there to do on a snow day? Madison finds a letter back from second grade when her and Poison Ivy were friends. It says that only they can open it and they can't until 7th grade. Wanna know what happens with the letter? Read the book! And if you wanna find out a surpise that has to do with Phinnie, Madison's pug, read the book! This was really excellant and I recommend it and the whole series to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Winter Fun For Maddie and the Gang","review":"Madison Finn is oh-so excited about the upcoming snowstorm warning. The strom then hits, and Maddie and her classmates are out of school enjoying the super snow day mania. While Madison is looking through some old junk of hers in the attic, she discovers a \\"secret document\\" she and her ex-best friend Ivy made in grade 3! Ivy is now an evil, conniving popular princess who hates Madison, but Maddie keeps wondering if that still means she should show Ivy the document, friend or enemy. Madison goes skating on the lake with her classmates Fiona, Chet, Hart (her crush), Aimee, Drew, Egg, Ivy, Rose, Susie, and Joanie. Madison discovers that secrets are not always best kept, and you have to know who to entrust to share your secrets with. Madison learns a valuable lesson about friendships, secrets and peer pressure in this book, which I think gives teens something to aspire to."},{"rating":"2","title":"jesi's thoughts","review":"This is such an awesome book, I hope Susie's in some other books. I love to ice skate, even though I'm not that good. Madison on the other hand is wishing for snow so that it can put off. Why doesn't she at least tell her BFFS that she can't ice skate and leave it at that? I thought it was so weird to hear the letter from Ivy and Madison. I would have immediately told Ivy, maybe that way she wouldn't be so mean to me. Of course Madison opened it and THEN showed Ivy, what a lame brain idea."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Cute","review":"This product is very cute and I would definitely recommend it!

Not only is this person completely unethical for writing such a book, he is also shameless to the point of pitifulness. If this book was written as a joke, fine. If not, shame on you \\"Mr. Kim\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"The only thing \\"Forbidden\\" should be this book!","review":"Thank God it's out of print! Ashida Kim is basically a trap for making money. No real Martial Arts or Mind/Meditation aspects are in any of his books. Please don't waste your money on his books. The only thing you'll get out of any of this garbage is less space in your bookcase and a lighter wallet. Take the time to search out real practitioners of this or any art."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Good About It","review":"I felt bad giving one star to this book. It doesn't deserve it. This book is great for bloodthirsty wanna-be's and other miscreants. It is valuable only as an example of what ninja arts are not. From a martial art perspective, it contains no orginal material. Some people might like it. I think Ashida (funny name for a white guy) is a fraudulent sham."},{"rating":"1","title":"This guy is fake","review":"Ok, I will get straight to the point and say that you should NOT buy this book. Ashida Kim is not Asian, and his name comes from 2 different countires (Ashida=Japan, Kim=Korea). Now, Stephan Hayes is also not Asian, but has practiced NinjUtsu. Ashida Kim does not even say in his books how he got to be a ninja. He writes this farfetched stories that couldn't even get published in a fictional book.Save your money. You want NinjUtsu, not NinjItsu, go to Hatsumi or Hayes. Not Kim."},{"rating":"2","title":"fantastic","review":"Ashida Kim has done it yet again. This is a very interesting book covering various aspects of Ninjutsu. Shown are some interesting offensive and defensive striking techniques. Also a large range of weaponry skills are covered including the walking staff. I recommend this book to any Ashida Kim fan and Ninja enthusiast alike."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Poor Audio Quality","review":"First note, because I hate not knowing: this is a mix CD. None of the songs go full length, they're all mixed in and out of. Even the first song has beats from another song (one that comes later in the disc mysteriously) laying over the intro!!!!The song selection is great, which is what drew me to this item. Like others have noted for other CD's in the series, the audio is sub-standard. I didn't see the reviews of the other entries in the series until after I had ordered this. I'm fairly sure this was mastered from vinyl because there seem to be a lot of pops and hiss. If you're just looking for something to rip to your mp3 player, this might be OK. The mixes aren't world class but not bad and the song selection is good. IF you need something to play in a club or through a powerful car or home system, this is not the disc for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"straight up dissappointed","review":"i for one enjoyed pretty much all the music in this cd but what i hate that all of these songs were cut down to size they weren't the full versions i was expecting them to be if i would have know about this i wouldn't have purchase any of these cd they should have been a 2 disc box set but it wasn't know i have to find the full version of these songs . (Work It Out Vol. 6DISCO BOX VOLUME 6 WORK IT OUT)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful prose, no plot","review":"Make no mistake about it: this book has beautifully lyrical prose. The writing is quite enchanting. But simply put, there is no plot. Nothing happens. The book's foundation is essentially on the relationship between a mother and her daughter. The daughter is a health worker living in Niger, West Africa, where she'd spent some of her childhood. The narrative alternates between the present and the mother's reminiscence of her daughter's and husband's years in Niger and Nigeria. Despite the heavy interior monologue, I never felt I had much insight into any of the character's psyches. I like character driven novels, but I didn't feel Ms. Hill's characterization was particular strong. Having lived in West Africa, I did appreciate some of the description; it was very heavily sensory, but you can't make a whole novel out of that. All in all, I was impressed by the prose, but the story was not very compelling. It was a struggle to finish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rambling, re-hashed and NOT scary!","review":"More historical than anything.

The best tracks are Zabalaza, Nizalwa Ngobani, Lahlumenze, and Kwanele And they run a range of styles.And the woman's deep. She sings about the problems in SA society, and speaks directly to youth in both Xhosa and English--her songs are almost a textbook for living for young people.Buy this album if you want to know what actual South Africans are listening to (and loving), rather than the watered-down stuff what's mostly on the shelves of record stores on that side of the Atlantic."},{"rating":"1","title":"for people who hate music","review":"If wuus rock is too threatening for you, cosy up to Peter and his wimpy blandness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Having been a church organist for 40 years, I was excited to receive this CD \\"Best-Loved Hymns.\\" However, I was disappointed in that only 7 of the 18 selections were melodies that I expected to hear. The choir performances and quality of the productions were excellent, however, there were several songs that were completely new to me and some familiar titles were not the melodies we sing at church. Ones that would be familiar to most American church-goers are: Be Thou My Vision, A Mighty Fortress, Let All Mortal Flesh Keep Silence, Praise to the Lord the Almighty, The Lord's My Shepherd, Thine Is the Glory, and the Doxology.

Not that big of a deal and I'm sure every bike is different.The bag is nice quality and seems to be made very well.

If the price were lower I'd feel better about it though, (since I paid 5 dollars s/h for it to arrive in a small bubble sleeve..)

A very good value."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Rarer Pieces","review":"As very few will probably check this CD out (as the number of votes I've received for my Vol.1 review has proved--2), I will keep the number of words to a minimum. This second installment of Marco Polo's epic series of Lumbye's music is by far the most delightful. As far as I know, all the numbers in this set are premiere recordings. This volume starts out with the invigorating \\"A Little Ditty for the Party, Galop\\" and ends with the charming \\"Goodnight Polka\\". As with Vol.1, the Tivoli Symphony Orchestra, with Bellicampi conducting, perform this music masterfully. However, the sound quality is still a bit poor for a DDD recording (sound seems distant). But on the whole, this volume is excellent. It's got my 5 star vote! For those who care, read my review for volume 1 for more information."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lumbye:Complete Orchestral Works Vol.2","review":"I enjoy the works of Hans Christian Lumbye (the Strauss of the North) very much.

This Cubs music CD is okay, with some songs about the Cubs, but mainly compilations of game highlights from Sosa, Grace and others. It also has Harry Caray singing. But not enough Cubs songs for my taste.If you want a new CD full of songs about the Chicago Cubs, including \\"GO CUBS GO,\\" and Harry Caray, I prefer \\"Take Me Out To A Cubs Game\\"-which has a website with the same name. The CD also features a cool new song about Fukudome. Amazon should sell this CD. Cubs fans will love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Idea, but didn't last","review":"This holster was a love/hate relationship. I loved the way I could get at the buttons/screen w/o the holster getting in the way but I hated how it effected the unit. Specifically when I had the Treo 650 in the holster, I found that that it squeezed the screen in a way that prevented the digitizer from working right. when I tried to point at something on the screen it the \\"click\\" would be somewhere else. Try to click the appointment at 10am and get the one at noon instead, things like that.Took me a while to figure out that I had to take the treo out for it to work right.one of the sides that hold the treo in place broke off, I assume because i had to keep removing the treo to get it to work right.Total time of use, about 2 months"},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't get behind this product.","review":"Short and sweet....I loved this item. However, the tab on the back broke off twice turning the holder into a useless paperweight. I am now using a $2.99 plastic version from China."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too tight and it BROKE!","review":"This holster arrived so tight when installed, it interfered with the touch screen. Also this holster has to be removed to put your Treo into the docking station - which is no easy task as tightly as it fits. I tried to loosen the holster's grip a little by \\"spreading its wings\\" but this resulted in the cheap metal the leather is glued to BREAKING instead of bending. The clip itself is also huge - nearly 3/4 inch thick! Hardly a slim holster. Mine is getting returned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good to the Last Drop","review":"I'll be the first to tell you, I'm hard on phone cases. I have had a Treo 600 since they first came out, and when I upgraded recently to the Treo 650, this case was included. I've tried at least seven different cases, and have worn them all out (except for one).Like other reviewers, I really liked this case. It allows great access to all the features (screen, keys, camera, connections, etc.). Easy to put on and pull off the phone, held the phone tightly, easy to fasten and unfasten from the belt-clip for easy, instant access.All was fine, until I bumped it somehow, and the phone fell out. Then the phone hooked onto my seatbelt and fell out again. But after only three weeks, the phone made its final drop when it fell out onto the Sam's club floor for no apparent reason - until I noticed that the case was broken.When it comes to cases, durability is the number one issue with me, and unfortunately, an otherwise great design couldn't take the heat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice while it lasted","review":"I enjoyed this holster for about 6 months before one of the side wings broke off rendering it useless. Overall it has a simple, sleek design, that allowed full access to all the functions of the phone while still in the holster, and the exterior leather gives it a nice feel. But the design has a major flaw in that the encased structure is made of stiff, brittle plactic that eventually failed. If the manufacturers had used metal instead of plastic they would have had a winner. But unfortunately they went the cheap route and I paid the price ($30). I give them 2 stars for a structurally inadequate design."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet","review":"My daughter, Sophie, loves this story not only because it is a beautiful story of Sophie the mouse finding happiness, but because it is filled with calming and interesting illustrations."},{"rating":"2","title":"A HUGE Eye-Opener!","review":"\\"The Screwtape Letters\\" is perhaps my most favorite C.S. Lewis book. In it we read a series of letters from a \\"senior\\" demon to his \\"junior\\" temptor. And in it we learn all about the fine and subtle tricks that demons play on us. What makes this book so amazing (and quite honestly frightening!) is that as you read you begin to mentally check off each trick that you've encountered in your OWN life! By the time I finished this book, I was so convinced of its truthfulness that I started telling all my friends and family to read it (and read it carefully!) Read it yourself -- you'll be shocked, but you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"You *can* take an old dog to breakthrough levels!","review":"Being saved takes you from nothing to everything, but there is still room for a lot of growth after that. What \\"The Screwtape Letters\\" taught me changed me in the most dramatic ways since reaching out to God and getting changed directly by him. It opened my eyes in amazing ways and profoundly improved my walk with God, with the people I love, and with all God's creation.I didn't know this much renewal was possible at my age, and with what I thought I knew. Buy the unabridged 3-tape set to hear once and pass on, and the abridged 2-tape set to hear over and over. The paperback is a nice back-up when you want to put your finger on something right away.

I would recommend this book to anyone. including those that do not share my faith."},{"rating":"2","title":"C.S. Lewis was a wonderful writer.","review":"If you haven't read it. Read it now.

Are you trying to decide whether to part with hard-earned money for a copy? Well, say yes. Do it. Read it, or read it again.My son, a wishy-washy ex-Catholic, is not interested in anything Christian, but is interested in the \\"spiritual,\\" and he reads constantly. But the book has to be catchy, full of wisdom, and preferably full of belly-laughs. Mamas, this is the book for your boy! It is full of more wisdom, wit, irony, and real laughs than almost anything else you can find. He couldn't put it down.How much good did it do? I dunno, we'll see whether, years from now, he says, You know, Mum, it was that book that got me to thinking...You read it, then give it to an adult child who needs a nudge.Review by Janet Knori, author of Awakening in God."},{"rating":"2","title":"Temptors","review":"The Screwtape Letters are a unique perspective on Christianity in that the faith is seen through the eyes of those who have given their soul to Satan. It is interesting to think of the faith from the perspective of those trying to undermind it.Uncle Screwtape mentors Wormword, through a series of letters, in Wormword's attempt to make his \\"patient\\" fall away from the faith. Through Screwtape's letters, we see a broad range of topics discussed including coming to faith, life in the faith community, love and sex, and other ideas on life. These topics make interesting reading when discussed from the perspective of how to fail in your faith.The Screwtape Letters at times are a tedious read as nothing really happens in the story. The good thing is that it is a short read. It never hurts to think a little more about your faith."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent read -- enchanting look at an old subject.","review":"Lewis handles an age old subject in a new light that only he could manage. While injected with humor, the subject matter is also very serious at the same time. A must for every C.S.

Lewis' Screwtape Letters, read by John Cleese wins my all-time greatest audiobook award. Cleese is a perfect festering, seething devil.

Either way it is joyfully inescapable."},{"rating":"2","title":"This was a so - so book.","review":"This book was a book chosen for one of my book clubs. I have not finished the book but I think it is an interesting premise. I will finish reading it because it is a classic but I have problems liking some old English literature.

Not bad different, just different."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Screwtape Letters","review":"The book The Screwtape Letters is written for a more mature reader, one that is interested in philosophical thinking. The book is more a theological book, than an exciting book. I would not suggest this book for a high school student. Not that it is too complicated for a teenager to read, because the story is easy to understand and follow. The book was dull, the author could not keep my attention or interest, because there was little action or excitement. Although I found it dull the book is well written, the writing style is very creative. The story makes the reader think about their one life. The \\"patient\\" represents the every day man, therefore the situations in the book parallel people's own life experiences."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, it just didn't make it.","review":"Written by C.S.Lewis, read by John Cleese? This is going to be great! There were a few chuckles I'll admit, but I kept waiting for some revelation, some new understanding, a new light on the matter. Alas, it was not to be. I found this book mostly boring and old hat, very old hat. I feel I wasted my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too heavy for summer","review":"This book was the selection for my reader's group this month and I must say, no offense to the member who picked it, that I couldn't get pass the third chapter. It's just a little too heavy for a summer read. It is problably best left for a person who is in the mood to delve into the corruption of human nature. Maybe I'll get back to it when the weather is dreary and I am already depressed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good For Youngsters","review":"I read this book when I was about ten and really liked it. Now, over thirty years later, I have reread it. I was surprised to see that the logic was so sophomoric. I think this would be a good book for a child, but for someone with a college education the arguments are too strained to provide enjoyment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long and tedious even though it's under 200 pages","review":"This is an incredibly dull book. I was forced to read it for a religion class and I can't believe there aren't more bad reviews of it. It is very tedious and the wording is old, making it all the more hard to read. I am not a hugely religious person and I would never recommend this book to a friend, possibly an enemy, but never a friend.

That is a great idea and fast and convenient since he lives so far away from me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some wit and insight but way too repetitive. Mostly for Christian readers.","review":"It seems here like everybody absolutely loves this book. Whilte it does have some witty moments of insight, I found the book to be enormously overrated.The allegorical form of writing, as letters from a demon to another demon, gets old pretty quickly and it gets extremely repetetive and frankly quite boring. Way too much time is spent on how to tempt humans away from Christianity, and to a non-Christian, those long portions of texts are completely uninteresting.Lewis does make some good points about human behaviour in general that are both witty and insightful, but those are exceptions and for the most part \\"The Screwtape Letters\\" is quite boring. The novella would have been good if it was about one third as long and not be so centered on Christianity. Christians will probably enjoy it more than I did, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Animal Farm\\" About Jews","review":"C. S.

I have heard extracts of it and wanted to keep it in my truck for long trips. I found the narration on cassette on the Amazon site, then took a link that seemed to offer the same narration on CD. Guess what?! The CD was not narrated by John Cleese, but the site did not inform me. I ordered the wrong version because the Amazon site mis-informed me. When I received the product, I went through the hassle of returning it. I should have just contributed it to my local library. I would have got more in a tax deduction than I did from the refund process at Amazon. WHAT A RIP !!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Well-Written, But Extremely Boring","review":"...It is very well-written, and the premise is interesting. However, I found it so boring I could hardly pay attention. C.S. Lewis does make some good points, but he really beats them to death. The reason I'm rating the book two stars instead of one is that it really is very well-written, in spite of being extremely boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is great!","review":"I really enjoy this reading of \\"The Screwtape Letters\\". Mr. Cleese puts a lot of emotion and life into his reading. I felt that in some places, the pausing/emotion got a bit too much, and I detest the musical interludes, but otherwise, this adaptation is lovely. One of my favorites, and I recommend it highly to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny yet scary!!","review":"It's funny because most of us think we're so much smarter and more progressive than the ones from the past generations. We act as if we've grown out of certain things and 'evolved' since our grandparents' time. Yet, everytime I read books from people like C.S Lewis and Watchman Nee, who were active 50-60 years ago, I realize the true wisdom come from the Lord not our schools or the cutting edge science we boast.While reading this book, I caught myself doing exactly the same things Screwtape was instructing his newphe to get his 'patient' to do. There're so many distractions in our lives that we constantly lose our focus from the most important thing! Jesus Christ! I also loved the way Screwtape described the true prayer. It's about communicating with the Christ as who He really is not as who we want Him to be or think He should be. It's amazing to see C.S. Lewis glorify the Lord with the amazing talent that's given to him."},{"rating":"2","title":"entertaining and thought-provoking -- a great read","review":"I loved this book when I first read it a few years ago, and still learned a lot on reading it again.

It seemed so realistic at times, although you know it is just an approximation. These letters gave me loads to think about, as I believe it will for serious believers of Christ. I don't know that much about Lewis other than the viewing of that movie \\"Shadowlands.\\" I've yet to step foot in the Chronicles of Narnia. But the time will come. I could tell I was dealing with brilliance from just reading this one book.

The book came quickly, in great condition, and included \\"Screwtape Proposes A Toast,\\" which is a wonderful addition to the story. I suppose a cheaper, used version is safe enough too, but this price definitely beats a store-bought copy in every way. The cover I got was the one with the actual photo of a gargoyle statue thing, not the red one pictured here, but I didn't really care.The book itself is powerful and very readable.

Anyone who enjoys reading great thought provoking literature needs to add this book to their collection. Bravo C.S. Lewis"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lewis and Cleese In a Joint Performance","review":"CS Lewis' masterpiece of contra-counter-Christian fiction as performed by John Cleese. A master work by any standard. The text itself is a well known work of moral philosophy, but the Cleese performance (despite a faltering effort with the very difficult ideas expressed at the beginning of side 2 on the tape) elevates this to a supreme work of both art and intellect. Cleese has absorbed the temper of the literature and expressed it in an amazingly precise way. A performance comparable to Muller & \\"The Green Mile.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"This was a very hard book to follow","review":"Self-proclaimed, I am not the brightest light in the chandelier, but I struggled with the symbolism in this book. I enjoy allegories, but this was just way too far out for me. I believe to better enjoy this book, you have to have someone to study it with. It is definitely not for pleasure reading. Love other CS Lewis work, but not this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"everyday life as a christian","review":"This is a book to show how Satan is using the people of the world and attacking Chrisitian, in the mind and actions. He is a winner if it takes us away from the Lord, regardless of what the method is. It makes for an excellent Bible Study material to create awareness in the Christian's heart and mind. A book everyone regardless of their belief should read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some deep thoughts","review":"This book is designed to get a person thinking about how one fails to live up to their best or to put it into theological terms, how one is enticed to commit sin. It sometimes seems a little dated, but is still relevant as man's ability to fail himself and his Deity has not changed. It will make you re-evaluate some of the things that you do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoroughly Enjoyed","review":"Though C.S. Lewis himself said he disliked writing this book, I enjoyed reading it more than almost any other book by him or anyone else. It's an incredibly funny book about a deadly serious topic. The letters are laced with moral implications and incredible humor. Even for a non-christian, this is a truly funny book. The constant references to \\"Our father down below\\" was funny, and the one letter where Screwtape gets so angry he accidently transforms himself into a millipede is alone worth the price of the book! Please, purchase this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Typical Lewis Wit","review":"This is the first Lewis book that I have read and it made a permanent impression on me. This cut me to the heart when I read this my freshman year in high school. It has also given me hope in my darkest hour.As many know, Lewis engages the reader into a dialogue between two devils, Screwtape and his apprentice, Wormwood. Screwtape gives advice to Wormwood on how to tempt a new Christian.I have read this book several times and am conviced that it is either a perfect witnessing tool, or a tool to build up a young believer. I encourage the matured saint to master the book and become conversant with it, being able to enter into dialogue with Sceptics and young believers."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the few books I re-read every few years","review":"Awesome book.I first read \\"Screwtape Letters\\" in high school.

Lewis has done a magnificent job of giving us the devil's perspective on temptation. By this method, we understand better the nature of our own temptation.While The Screwtape Letters are a pleasure to read, Screwtape himself comes to life in this recording by John Cleese (of Monty Python).Hilarious, moving and never boring, this is without execption the BEST recorded book performance I've ever heard. Even if you have no desire to experience Lewis' text, Cleese's performance alone is worth the price.Your Nephew,Wormwood"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book","review":"We are living in the \\"Last Days\\" and it is important for Christians to be spiritually awake and know what the enemy of the Kingdom of Christ is doing.

It is an amazing piece of work for C.S.

I am skeptical about the existence of God, but I don't rule it out entirely. I bring this up because this book is based solely upon the belief in God and (conversely) the Devil.The entire book is a one-sided view of a correspondence from an aging devil to his apprentice devil protege. The aging devil, named Screwtape, dispenses advise and wisdom gained from years as a tempter of humans.From this point of view, the reader gets a truly horrifying and entertaining view of one's own life and pursuits. I still don't profess a belief in God, but now I am beginning to believe in devils."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me","review":"I know this is a classic. I know I should have loved it.

S. Lewis' old classic \\"The Screwtape Letters\\" as an electronic book because my old copy is stored in a box someplace.I have read it again and the truth it unfolds is as relevant for today's human situation as it was when I first read it many years ago.Screwtape and Wormwood, his bumbling nephew, appear as cunning and evil creatures, while being humanly approachable. This was, and remains, such a great way to address the problem of human sin because other-worldly treatments lose their believability so quickly.Certainly, this volume deserves to be called a classic because it continues to be quoted by theologians, clergy and ethicists alike, in this age. It is a short and good read of a very difficult part of the human predicament."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Screwtape Letters audio book","review":"Pretty good version. The vocal quality of the performer was good, but somewhat nasal.Overall, great audio book for the students."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poignant Observations","review":"This work is a collection of letters constituting a one sided correspondence between a demon named Screwtape and his nephew Wormwood. Wormwood has been assigned to corrupt an unnamed human. Screwtape coaches Wormwood on how to tempt the man and draw him away from God. Several of the pieces of advice given by Screwtape make poignant observances on how the soul can be corrupted. They will help the reader to examine his or her own spiritual life. At times, Wormwood disappoints Screwtape, and his \\"affectionate\\" uncle will lash out in anger and contempt. These letters take place during the Second World War, and it plays at least a minor role in the work. What can also be seen is Lewis's own thoughts on current cultural trends (of the 1940s) and how they affect one's faith. This book is an excellent read and not difficult to understand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thanks for the reminder","review":"Great book. I know Wormwood and Screwtape.

Ms. Wentworth has done an admirable job here in portraying English Village life.

I am not sure why the quality of the picture is so poor. This was filmed in 1970 and it looks like a home move shot on 9 mm. If only someone could enhance this and find the missing scenes. There are a number of scenes that are cut from this film. It almost looks like the manufacturer set a video camera in front of a television and filmed an edited version. Many of the initial scenes are too dark to see."},{"rating":"1","title":"No good!","review":"Stay away from this one! the video transfer sucks, PLUS, it was edited so it lacks the nudity scene.

It was never a great film to begin with but this version I recieved seemed dark in contrast and edited for TV or something. In fact it was cut so bad that the film barely made sense, and it was a very weak story to begin with. Once Joe tells his gang buddies \\"You don't hit something as pretty as that.\\" When we never see them hit anyone??? I only got this film to collect some of the films of my youth but watching it now as a grown up makes me laugh at how easily impressed we were as youngsters. This is a \\"Cheezy\\" film with a capitol C. Top it off that when the CD arrived it was rattling inside the case and it was scartched all over, but somehow it still played without a problem. No more than i'll be watching it I decided not to send it back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst transfer of movie to dvd ever","review":"hi, this is the WORST quality dvd i have ever seen. dont waste any money on it. buy the vhs version i guess. i have that and its way better. stay away from this version of the dvd."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD QUALITY","review":"I was very disappointed with the DVD. It looks like it was copied from a bad VHS tape. I remember seeing the movie at the theatre when it first came out and although it isn't a great movie it was still fun to watch at the time.

THIS one became an instant favourite. Gorgeous fonts and use of color; perfect layout - mostly a photo on one page (for us visual-oriented males ;-), and the complete recipe on the facing page. Most important: very tasty, visually-appealing, and quick recipes.There is nothing in the book that isn't a photograph or recipe, yet I still think of it more as a COOKBOOK than a recipe book -- after you've made a few of the soups, you'll find yourself absorbing and adopting the common philosophy behind all these recipes. Even the photographs suggest new ways of making and serving soup.I hardly need the actual book any more -- I just head off to the produce section and grab whatever is freshest and most appealing.Favourite recipes? Out of the 60-odd here, I haven't found a dud yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost as fast as \\"fast food\\" but with wonderful results","review":"I like this cookbook so much that I bought a dozen of them to give as gifts to best friends and family. The recipes meet two major needs. First, when I'm exhausted and hungry and want real food, these soups can be made in 30 minutes with a minimum of fuss. Second, the results are amazingly complex in flavor. There is something restorative about the combination of little effort and great results. Don't mess with the recipes the first time around. You'll be surprised how good they are. Some of the ingredients will not be regular inhabitants of your larder, so pick out a few soups you want to try every week and buy the ingredients to have on hand. Because of the short cooking time, the recipes call for fresh herbs added last thing, but if you don't have any just add dried herbs with the liquid ingredients and you will get good results."},{"rating":"2","title":"A refreshing, right-on performance","review":"The first recording I heard of the Schoenberg concerto was the live Glenn Gould performance with the CBC Symphony (a great recording, despite drastic ensemble problems). Ever since then, all performances were a let down, until this one was released. Uchida gives a very intelligent performance of the piece, showing more clearly than in any other performance I've heard, the great emotional depth and romantic quality of the music. The difference is clear right from the beginning, when she unifies the opening piano solo into one coherent, beautiful thought. And the quality of sound is far superior to that of the Gould recording."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting Performance!","review":"I've heard two recordings of this work in the past and thought it was just ugly music.

Ex-Jefferson Airplane/Moby Grape member Skip Spence made this totally DIY album in 1968; it was to be his last one before schizophrenia permanently sidelined him. Personally and musically sharing some of the same sad/brilliant territory as Syd Barrett, \\"Oar\\" has perhaps a more singular, intentional artistic direction than Barrett's work did. Spence's condition seemed to give birth to an entire style of Blues - beautifully honest and confessional viewpoints that we're richer for hearing. There are moments of lightness and subtle humour here too, and a fascination with the way Spence's ghostly, minimalist guitar and percussion so effectively embellish his unsettling interior sketches. This CD edition has an extra 10 tracks (nearly doubling the length of the original release), and a 14-page booklet with essays and photos."},{"rating":"1","title":"hummmmmmm..es loco o se hace?????????'","review":"sinceramente, no puedo entender la devocion de muchas perosnas, incluso renombrados artistas, hacia este musico... ungido de la leyenda GRAPE, amparado en el descontrol y la libertad absoluta que encierra la locura, esta coleccion de temas no genera mas que sentimientos encontrados..lastima, piedad, curiosidad...no se , me genera igual sensacion que muchos discos de erickson (13th.....).. en ningun momento se me revela como la creacion de un genio.. en fin, son opiniones, nada mas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh my... this is unfortunate","review":"This is unfortunately a dreadful album...Skip must surely be embarrassed by this, much as Emmylou Harris is chagrined by the \\"Flying Bird\\" album of her youth. Spence was recovering, from what is not much of our business, but recovery is seldom pleasant, and this opus shows that. It is poorly recorded, and his singing is not engagingly off key as Neal Young or the Band's is, it's just...well it's just not much fun to listen to. He's in pain, and pain shared may be pain halved, but an album is hardly the place or the time...A \\"cult classic\\"? I hardly think so, a glaring example of talent wasted by some unfortunate circumstances or substances is more like it. This is a piece to be put away, mercifully, and forgotten."},{"rating":"1","title":"He's Up A Creek Without One","review":"Spence, like Tim Buckley in his later years, is a reminder that most experiments fail.

Instead, expect something like an American version of Syd Barret with a lower voice. He may be a cult hero and a big influence to a few famous rock stars, but this album doesn't cut it for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very different, very good...","review":"I just got this album yesterday so I haven't had a chance to listen to it thoroughly. What I have heard has definitely been good. Some songs are really moving with a sound all their own. The best are nothing short of amazing. Then again, some others sound like Spence was joking around. Overall, it is definitely worth buying though. Sundazed, under Sony Special products, did an excellent job re-issuing the album, something I wasn't sure of before my purchase. They mastered the original album directly from the original tapes. Then they threw in several outtakes and things, I haven't listened to them yet.The recording sound is poor on a few tracks, but most songs sound great. The liner notes are good too, they give a lot of insight into the recording session.I like Moby Grape, but I'm not a die hard fan or anything.

Great price and functionality. Just what I was looking for. By the way, my camera lens combination measures 7.5 in deep. There is even room for the camera strap inside."},{"rating":"2","title":"Functional camera case","review":"i was amazed at how much room this case actually has. it fit my canon T1i camera with the standard 18-55mm lens plus a 55-250mm zoom lens, both protected by 58mm UV filter and lens cap. although the fit was \\"tight\\", i managed to store the camera with the shorter lens in the main compartment area, and the telephoto lens in a ziplock bag behind the supplied velcro attached divider. i stored the battery charger, lens tissue and a blower brush in the small exterior front zipper pouch and a small bottle of lens cleaning solution on the inside zipper pouch. This was all i needed for daytime and simple close up evening photography. All in all, a great value and a \\"must buy\\" for protecting the camera from the elements. the case comes with an adjustable strap that fits around your waist, and if not in use, can be stored in a hidden sleeve in the back side of the case. you can also carry the case by holding the simple strap (that is sewn into the case) for short distances."},{"rating":"2","title":"This camera bag is required for hiking with your camera.","review":"Originally I ordered a camera bag that fit all my lenses and other accessories which is also really needed but it is too big to easily carry around when you are walking and taking pictures. So, I ordered this holster style bag and found it to be just what I needed - it is bigger than the point and shoot on my belt but it is not very heavy. You can either carry it over your shoulder or around your waist with the included strap. You must have this bag If you walk or hike and take pictures.It has quality construction and was a very good purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, portable and practical!","review":"This bag can hold my Canon Rebel T1i with 15-85mm lens + lens hood (rectracted) easily! And still have space for a larger lens! Also I use the pockets to carry a spare battery, a second memory card, a remote control, a cleaning brush and a cleaning cloth! Nice ergonomic strap, I found it very practical for the adventurer photo enthusiast that doesn't want to carry large cases. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent day holster","review":"Love this holster! Sturdy enough to protect the camera and lens well but still very light. I only use the velcro closure which makes access easy and quick. It has a sling which can be removed for a longer zoom. I originally bought it for a gift and liked it so much I bought myself one."},{"rating":"1","title":"larger than picture","review":"Plenty of padding. Larger than picture. Camera fits well with plenty ofroom for longer lens and extra discs, cleaners. Belt strap on back adds bulk. Would be better if designed for using the camera's own neck strap instead of adding another neck strap to deal with. Also, there is no way to attach this case to your own camera'sstrap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frays","review":"Okay product but there is a lot of fraying around the top of the pack.

There is a reason why you cannot see a preview of the movie before purchasing. Nobody would buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not as good as Level 1","review":"As with Level 1, the split-screen video presentation is very effective. Also, there is a good mix of playing songs and learning basic mechanics such as hammer-ons, pull-offs, slides, bends, etc. However, the authors seem confused about whether to make this a true follow-on to Level 1 or a stand-alone product, and end up with something that is not quite either one. On the one hand, it starts out with some very basic things (how to hold the guitar, how the strings are numbered, etc.) that are covered in Level 1. On the other hand, there is no book with this one, so if you don't have level 1 you will want to buy a book of chords, as only a few are covered in the video."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would be zero if it could, ridiculous","review":"This book is the most ridiculous kind of tripe. All over the world there are people who just never quite fit in with other people, it doesn't make them aliens! This book attempts to tell such people they are really alien souls sent to inhabit human bodies on Earth for some purpose. It is nonsense. If your socially maligned don't try chalking it up to being ET, you may have some underlying psychological issues.What a coincedence as well when the author, midway through the book, decides, guess what he's an alien too!.The book also deals with another ridiculous topic, called walk ins. People who were normal, but then through some kind of alien soul magic, are now filled with the soul of an Alien!This is ridiculousness to the highest order. It is also very low, attempting to exploit those who don't quite fit in for book sales with cocomamy theories that have no critical or empirical evidence whatsoever into this tripe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite disapponting....","review":"This book can give you basic knowledge which is helpful for new VB programmer on serial port communication.

Try technical notes from device manufacturer on the web is a better solution."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is mostly fluff","review":"What do you expect from an author who admits in print that her favorite language is BASIC? I found more useful information after an hour's search of the web than can be extracted from this painful text. As far as I can tell, this book was about 10 pages long before the Visual Basic listings and irrelevant information about various microcontrollers was added. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"This book is quite disappointing. It's coverage is both narrow and shallow. If you're after some code to do serial programming from Visual Basic it's probably ok, but any different or deeper than that, you're better off with what you'll find on Google."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasn't that helpful ...","review":"The examples in this book were too advanced for the project I was working on. In the end it was just a waste of time. I wish I'd spent my money on a book more suitible to my needs. Nuff said."},{"rating":"2","title":"Title Matches Content","review":"I bought the book hoping that it would cover RS-485 well enough for me to use it as a reference for my next project. I wasn't disappointed. It has all the needed information.The really nice thing I didn't expect was the helpful \\"guidelines for trouble-free RS-485 links\\", which included hints on how to deal with cable delay, impedance, termination, reflections, noise, topologies, circuit protection, etc...I'm not sure how some of these other reviewers were disappointed. The book is very detailed (for the expert), but still easy to read (for the beginner). There is information about how to use microcontrollers and PCs, but it doesn't come at the cost of information on serial communication. In fact, I found that some of the examples using microcontrollers gave me a few ideas for my project.( )BASIC is a completely logical language to use for showing examples in this book. It is simple and concise. Anyone who complains about it is a zealot, fighting some language war."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good source of info, but not for the beginner","review":"This book is very complete indeed, but it assumes you already know a fair bit about electronic circuitry. As a computer programmer with little electronics experience, I first had to read up on basic electronics. Also, some sections could have been easier to understand if there was more supporting details or examples. However, the book did answer most of my questions about the serail port and I was able to complete my programming project on time. I would rate this book a 3.5 to 4.0"},{"rating":"1","title":"Printhead failures common?","review":"I've had this printer for over a year now and for the past 6 months, the print quality has been terrible. This month, it won't print at all and I've been told I need to buy a new printhead which will cost at least $70. I've tried cleaning the printhead, doing any possible maintenance I could and none of this helped. I have always used Canon ink cartridges and never abuse this printer. Reading the last review makes me wonder if it will be worth it to replace the printhead or just invest in a new printer.

Earlier releases felt like bulletins from a parallel world - this one sounds like creative people playing with new toys. The technology is way out front, calling attention to itself.

The authors assume alot but back none of their assumptions up. This book is so flawed on the angel debate, I could be here all day. It really annoys me when authors spew out thoughts and ramble on but don't offer any evidence. The pages on Satan & the dark angels are utterly laughable!!!

He had raved about the fact that he didn't have to charge it for a week. I received this product and have found that I must charge it every day! I listen to 2 AM radio stations for approximately 5 hours out of the day. After one day of listening, they just fade and I'm usually unable to pick them back up. If I do, they fade away within minutes again. I've cranked this radio 90-100 times (figuring this would be approx 30-45 min playing time) when it fades and it usually fades way before it should. For the price and time/effort I've put into this radio, it is far from worth it! I'll go back to a radio that uses batteries. Even though I must pay for the batteries, it won't fade on me for a month or more!

My oldest was raised 'the old fashioned way' - my youngest had the benefit of a mother with experience , a mom who could afford to stay home and who read the latest studies, books, and every parenting magazine out there in an effort to find 'the right way' for baby dear. Guess what ? My youngest is a brat ! Ok, maybe not a BRAT, but he was well on his way. My life went from balanced, to kid-centered. My parenting techniques went from, 'you'll get over it' to 'we can't blame him for expressing his feelings, he needs to be heard'. I still wanted to be the best parent I could be, but how was it that after spending all this time paying so much attention to my kids, I couldn't leave the house ? Thanks to Anne Cassidy, I've learned to have more faith in my gut - and more appreciation for the hard -learned lessons my Granma taught."},{"rating":"2","title":"If every parent read this book, I'd still be teaching.","review":"Being a former high-school teacher, I can easily say that most of Anne Cassidy's observations are true! The majority of kids I taught were disprespectful and unruly, and seemingly didn't know appropriate behavior for the classroom. Evidently, I set very high expectations for these children of the 90's, i.e. to sit quietly, to pay attention to the lesson, and to practice what they learned after the lesson. Believe it or don't, this was too much for most of my students to handle. Cassidy hits-the-nail-on-the-head on how parenting of late has gone awry.

This plot has everything: Humor touching spots and many twists and turns that provoke thought about what our priorities in life should be. there was much thought put into this story which is rare in modern films.

It provides basic information about pens and ink, how to select the right pen, ink, and paper, and how to maintain the pens. The remainder of the book describes and illustrates techniques and methods using many, many examples.

It's very slow, very predictable, etc., etc., just like most other so-called horror flicks. Waiting on Hollywood to release a worthwhile movie of any kind is like waiting on the next pass of Haley's Comet..., this is especially true with horror movies. The last time I saw a good horror movie was \\"The Descent.\\" Now THAT was a horror movie!! It was so original..., so very unique., so well casted & directed, etc., etc. It's already a classic. Why can't Hollywood make more movies like that?? So, while we wait on another \\"The Descent\\" to be made, I guess we have to suffer with B-level stuff like \\"The Echo.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"A good horror movie!","review":"I really enjoyed this! The acting was good. The special effects was good. The story was good! There was no obviously fake blood squirting. No really terrible lines.The story follows a man just released from prison (he was convicted of murder.) He moves into his late mother apartment and ghost-y things start happening.Let's face it.

This movie is very slow, and if you ask me, it's not even scary. 30 minutes into the movie, I just kept asking when the movie would be over because it was so bad. It never got better either. I hope everybody will take my advice and save their money for something more important than for a piece of junk movie like this, or if you really want to see it, rent it first because I am almost positive you TRUE horror movie fans won't like it.

THE ECHO is another example. While I haven't seen the original, THE ECHO doesn't inspire me to do so.The movie's basic premise is revenge and the consequences of non-responsiveness to people in peril. This is confusing because some of the victims don't truly deserve to be punished. THE ECHO is also very slow in its pacing and I've grown weary of all Asian remakes having little girl spooks. Jesse Bradford's performance has its moments but eventually fizzles. Amelia Warner is effective as Bradford's supportive girl friend and Kevin Durand is chilling as the abusive cop who abuses his wife and daughter.THE ECHO is to be commended for its atmospheric setting and its moral message, muddled though it is. Its abrupt ending is also a drawback. Ultimately, it's an average entry in a tired genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"SOOO boring","review":"The Amazon reviews on this movie were pretty good so I bought a used copy.I was excited to watch it..Sooo dissapointed.It was boring and too drawn out,not scary at all and nothing exciting happens until the last 20 minutes of the movie,and the ending was dumb.So you have to suffer for over an hour of watching the main character do household chores and making dumb faces when he hears a noise.Terrible movie and a real waste of time and money.Pass this one up!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Great movie worth seeing.

Their motto \\"Buy it for the way it's made\\" is a joke\\", and when I called to tell them about the problem, they said that there's nothing they can do b/c it was after the warranty. I spoke to several reps., even those higher up, but they refused to do anything about it. I even wrote an email, and they basically said, \\"Sorry\\". This is unacceptable, and you know that it's just a faulty little spring mechanism that is cheaply made. For an item this simple, yet pricey, Kitchen Aid is completely unreputable in the way that they handled this problem (for many, it seems). They have permanently lost my business. I'm sure that they were aware of the problem but just rely on people buying the next model up. In any case, the next time I see a one-year warranty for a pricey item like this one, then I will be warned to stay away, as it is a red flag."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works for a few months...then you're missing the money you paid for it","review":"This toaster worked fine for about a year, and then, like other reviewers have noted, it completely failed. It failed, of course, right after the one-year warranty was up. My husband and I used the toaster a moderate amount, so perhaps if you have a larger family, it would stop working during that first year of the warranty and you could get a new one. First the left side stopped working, and then the right side was not heating evenly. And now the right side has completely given up. We've had it a little over a year and a half now. My advice is to buy a cheap toaster; I would not buy a KitchenAid product again. It was a waste of money on something that should have lasted much, much longer.

I accidentally pulled out my Cuisinart manual (for our old 2-slice toaster) and was reading there was a 3-year warranty and was hopeful... until I realized I was looking at the wrong toaster information ... and see that Kitchen Aid is ridiculous and only offers one year. : So I guess we'll be using the old Cuisinart until we find another 4-slice toaster... really really ridiculous, and verrrrrry disappointing Kitchen Aid!!! :("},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice, but short-lived","review":"This seemed to be a good toaster, for a while.

Loved it! That was over 20 years ago. When it died, someone gave me a Proctor Silex 4 slice as a gift. It was terrible!

It's big, yes, but not much bigger than the PS we had before. It's great to look at for sure. But the toast! The toast is amazing. It actually toasts on both sides (something the PS didn't do) and is perfect. My favorite number is 5. Took me a while to get used to not having to flip it halfway through to toast on both sides. The warming feature is great too. I haven't used the bagel feature yet, but I'm sure that is great too.This is an excellent toaster and well worth the price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Toaster","review":"We're very pleased with this toaster, have been using it for bread and frozen pancakes so far.

I bought here at Amazon and it really is an awesome toaster. It is well worth the money. It's very decorative and makes even toast FAST. The otaster is self centering, so you don't have to worry about uneven toast. AND It's fast so you don't have to lets your eggs get cold while you wait for an extra piece of bread to toast up.

I have always been a fan of the Final Fantasy series and looked forward to getting my hands on an RPG that had the graphics capabilities of the Xbox. I was quickly impressed by the looks of Sudeki, smooth textures, great colors, very nice. I was just as quickly disappointed by the rest of the game. The voices are terrible, and the music is even worse. I play most of the game without the volume up. The absolute worst feature of the game, though, is it's simplicity. As I said, I'm a Final Fantasy fan, long games with quests that are at least challenging. This game lacks both of those features. It is extremely short for an RPG and there is no such thing as a challenging quest. Also, they max out your experience at level 30, there is a pretty short list of special skills that you can learn, and a very small assortment of weapons.

The graphics, espescially those of the environment were great. I also do like where the combat system went. Firstly the voice acting. It's horrible. Thats about it on that...its just horrible. The music was most likely bad. Or at least forgettable as I can't remember there being music. Mayve some techno sounds in the background I guess. Then the story. The story is a rushed peice of crap not fit for a shallow action game involving half-vampire unicorn babies. Or something equally stupid. Not to mention it jumps along from learning of the great evil you must face to facing it five minutes later in one of the many crummy single person boss fights. All of which have an easily discernable pattern. Boring and not very creative. Just like the rest of the game. Save you money and wait for fable."},{"rating":"2","title":"What can I say?

I know Canon makes great products and the reviews here made me decide to purchase this MF. It's a great product when it works. But my experience going through 2 defective units makes me wonder about the workmanship of this product. BTW Canon Support is one of the best in the industry.

We use it in our business and scan about 10 pages a day. The scanning and copying \\"window\\" is protected by a small piece of thin, soft, clear plastic. Every document from the ADF passes over this thing. It scratches and scuffs easily, and then you start seeing lines on your scans or copies. We have to replace the plastic piece about once every month. I recently called Canon and ordered 10 of them at $2.60 apiece. This is a design flaw."},{"rating":"2","title":"how great is this?","review":"I love the quality of photo prints that i get out of this amazing multifunction printer. I had an very old multi-pass printer and loved it, but went lazer for black and white and missed being able to print in color and scan things into my computer. Happily all of those functions have returned in this easy to use, small but powerful multi-function printer. My husband teases me that I have a photo lab in our house and as an amateur photographer that's really fun. When you print photos on canon paper, they are divine!!! An added goodie for my husband who is a school teacher is that he can make overhead projector pages on this bad boy, too and doesn't have to wait in line at the school copy center! the only prob I have is that I can't figure out how to receive a fax, but I'm working on it!great buy for the money and amazon has great prices-believe me I shop around before I buy. Get this and enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"USB problems","review":"I, like several others, have had problems with this machine recognizing the printer. It seems that the MP730 has a conflict with the USB port for several people, including myself. I called Canon and they gave me the runaround about how this wasn't an issue. Well, do a Google search and you will find this actually is a known problem. After following the installation instructions, to an exact T several times with different USB cables, it still would not recognize the printer. My story is not the only one like this. Other reviewers problems with this KNOWN problem read identical to mine. If you are one of the lucky ones to have no USB problems, then you have a great multi-functional machine. I wish I was so lucky!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Erroe & Alarm Issues","review":"I have had my MP730 for 4 days now and so far have talked with Canon tech once. When we try to print from our computers we keep getting an error 5C00 and the alram goes off. Tech said to turn off, on again, reset the print head and cartridges. It should not keep happening!!! I have to do a few more things: get a different USB cable to see if that's the issue, see if Canon will send me a new print head, try a different network cable (no info on network issues in the manual). I went to a Canon product because I have had issues with HP all in ones. Now I am not sure there are any good one's out there!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Does it all, easily","review":"Everything works well - b/w copy, color copy, fax, scan, etc. The photo quality is excellent, but be aware factory settings may be wacky. It took me three printhead alignments to get the vertical spacing corrected - the first pictures I printed had horrible lines through them, now everything looks outstanding. I really like being able to replace the color inks individually, a feature standard on very high end printing equipment (like my office's $5000 poster printer) but not on most home equipment. The photo printing software included with the MP730 is very easy to use. I use Canon's Matte Photo Paper - very affordable and pictures look great."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the very excellent buys that I have made...","review":"There are a few things that I would look when going for an MFP..1.

It reminds me of her Maybeck Recital series. Her heavy use of chords rather than runs has always appealled to me. In that regard she is pretty much the opposite of Art Tatum. If you enjoy Brubeck, you will probably like this. The inclusion of a bass line on alternate tracks adds variety. If you listen in the car, the bass solos get lost a little bit. They are better enjoyed in a quieter environment. I would have liked more uptempo tracks, but that is a personal preference.

A good composite of interesting survival stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"An ultimate \\"What if\\" book","review":"It is amazing the situations that men and women have been in over the centuries. These are not simple situations either, they are life and death episodes where it is certain that the smartest, fittest and luckiest come out alive.The book is a rich resource of stories going back to the 1500's to the present. Some of the earlier accounts were more difficult to assimilate due to the language dialect. Each of them portray significant human courage and vulnerability. For personal reasons, the reader may be more drawn to one that another. It is certain that a significant effort was made to render the historic presentation accurate. Some of the more astounding survival encounters are revealed generating the awesomeness of what the human being will go through to hold on to the fragile life line of their tomorrows."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool! It's back in print!","review":"I read this back in the 80's, quite an antidote and/or complement to depression and/or rainy days. Not your typical summertime beach read. Gives one a feel for what extreme conditions many of our human ancestors have had to handle during our million plus years of evolution. Though someone mentioned 'Into Thin Air' as a possible antithesis of this book, try the same author's (Jon Krakauer) 'Into the Wild', that might actually inspire you with an alternative view of the human predicament and potential, in the same way this book does."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Sound Effect Creator Didn't Like Parents","review":"Jack and Jill is beautifully illustrated with the main characters being cats. That's not my problem with the book.The problem is that the sounds to play (about 6) that come with this book are in one word: obnoxious. More words? Ok, they're tinny, loud, and extremely annoying.As the mother of a 16 month old, we have many toys that make noises and none sound like this. These noise-making toys are geared towards children so they're not to my taste, but some are even enjoyable to listen to. Not so Jack & Jill's sounds to play.I would give this book one star, but I have to admit my daughter likes the book with the sounds. No, she loves it. Fortunately, a mother's love comes with no strings attached."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what it seemed","review":"While it did arrive in very good condition when played the songs are what they say they are on the cover but...the computer signature lists a whole different album.

The book uses word phrases and plays on words to try and attempt its humor. It fails in every respect.

Don't buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent sheets, but softness varied between color sets...","review":"First of all, I've noticed that the majority of the rave reviews for Pinzon products are from Seattle, which is where Amazon (parent company of Pinzon) is located. Probably just coincidence, but funny nonetheless. Keep an eye out on that, though. Now back to the sheets. I bought them in both the Mink and the White, and noticed a huge difference between the two colors. The White is very soft and washed beautifully, while the Mink (aka brown) felt much more scratchy. The subtle design is very nice on both, and I can definitely \\"stand\\" sleeping with the Mink ones, but I'm also not too picky with sheets. I would say that if you have a difficult time with mildly scratchy sheets, these may be less than ideal for you... that is, depending on your color selection. This, of course, was my experience. I just ordered one set of the Supima ones and hope to find that \\"really soft\\" set. Happy sheet shopping!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Feel Like Sandpaper","review":"I got these sheets for $35 but was really disappointed anyway. I washed them and placed them on the bed.

The bag I receive came with a zipper and indicate that the sheets are made in China, for what its worth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice sheets","review":"I really like these sheets. Good solid construction, well sized, nice design. Elastic on the fitted sheet goes all the way around, not just the ends or side, and nicely accommodates a pillow-top mattress. The top sheet is nicely finished at the top, and the sides and bottom have nice hems. They only lost one star because they look a little rumpled after washing them, and I'm not about to spend time ironing sheets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Sateen","review":"I have bought many sets of sateen sheets before- these felt nothing like that.

After washing them and the using them, they started to pill where my skin is rough (I have eczema). No other \\"sateen\\" sheets I have ever bought have done this, and this is extremely disappointing. I think it's attributed to the herringbone pattern, nevertheless, very disappointing. I would be wary of the actual quality of these sheets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scratchy, not sateen at all.","review":"I've purchased sateen sheets of 400+ thread count before and all were softer than the set I just purchased. These were rougher than even my cheap percale 200 thread count sheets. I purchased them in hopes of providing soft, luxury sheets for house guests and instead, I was embarrassed to use them, opting for my older but softer sheets. The stars are for the dark platinum color and herringbone, which is pretty.But wow, everything from the fitted sheet to the pillow cases is rough like sandpaper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for Winter","review":"Don't misunderstand, these sheets are great and the pockets on the fitted sheet are deep but they are pretty cold when you first crawl into bed, should be terrific in the summer time."},{"rating":"1","title":"7 inch run in sheet.","review":"Fitted sheet had a 7 in. run in it.

The elastic is strong and stays on my mattress. I like the feel of the fabric. I agree that it's not as silky as other sateens, however I happen to like the texture of these sheets on my skin. I'm not a fan of satin type sheets. The color of the sheets are a rich chocolaty brown. For the money ($31), I think they are a very good value.I recently purchased the same sheets in Sable ($29.99). Very nice sheets and didn't notice much difference between the Mink and Sable colors...other than the color. :) Sable is a nice light brown/tan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like sleeping in a burlap bag","review":"I had success ordering Pinzon sheets from Amazon in the past and was in the market for a new sheet set. I found these sheets and thought, because of the product description, that they would be like the other sheets I previously ordered. I was wrong. These sheets feel like you are sleeping in a burlap bag. They are awful! Unfortunately with sheets, you really don't know until they are washed and on your bed, how you will like them. I would advise anyone looking for sheets to stay away from this set unless you want your body exfoliated while you sleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!","review":"This book is absolutely terrible.

The book is composed literally of photographs and illustrations, and tables of OBD II codes. Well, you need the OBD II codes, right? WRONG! ... Plus you get all the other information in those books, such as how to fix your brakes or repair the engine.This book is a joke...

Hardly the sort of detail relating to OBD automotive info.I sense that, as with other technical authors, he is reluctant to disclose any REAL MEANINGFUL INFORMATION. He did not, in my opinion, disclose anything meaningful by way of 'trade secrets, or really useful tips'.i suppose it is to be expected. Keep all the good stuff to ones self!The book looks good.

It contains very little information--only brief and superficial explanations. Half the book is filled with lists of diagnostic codes easily available from the web. The lists of generic, GM specific and Chrysler specific codes only contain titles and do NOT contain explanations. The Ford codes have very brief explanations. To top it all off, there is an entire chapter of KITCHEN RECIPES! Yes, kitchen recipes in an OBD book! I could not believe my eyes. No words can adequately explain how bad this book is. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't deliver the goods","review":"This book doesn't reveal any secrets,or for that matter much information. It is rather long on OBD II theory and has a fairly good chapter on scan tool selection but falls far short in the diagnostic department. I had hoped this book would have information on acceptable sensor values, troubleshooting / diagnostic charts, etc. As far as diagnosis goes, this book is just one small step ahead of a trouble code chart. Since most of the newer scan tools incorporate this information in the tool itself I would recommend that you save the price of this book and apply it to a better tool."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor","review":"This book is only good for a reference guide for Ford andGM trouble codes.

Yep, just like you learned in 8th grade. Nobody running OBD-II diagnostics needs to cover that material. Chapter 3 appears to be cribbed from the CARB Web site (http://www.arb.ca.gov/html/brochure/history.htm). There's a chapter full of recipes -- and while I'm sure they're delicious, that's not why I bought an OBD-II book.This leaves around 170 pages of actual material, and that is filled with dozens of typographical and content errors that range from distracting to confusing.The information that remains is somewhat useful, but not worth the cover price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I needed","review":"I was looking for hardcore material on OBD. I too was fooled by the preview. You can find the same info on the Internet. The book publishers have done a fantastic job of packaging and making an ordinary book with common information look exceptional. What people want to know is how to use the information in the powertrain control module to solve problems. This book simply tells you what's available in OBD 2 not what to do with the info. Pages are devoted to OBD 2 codes that can be found on the Internet. If you need a glossy intro to OBD 2 this is it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I expected more from a 'Bible'","review":"Purporting to be the \\"OBD II Bible\\", I find that this book falls short of the mark.

I was able to read through most of the book in an evening (except for the recipe chapter, which I was somewhat annoyed to find- feeling that if I wanted a recipe book, I would have *bought* a recipe book!).I will say that the book does present clear, concise and well laid out text and graphics for the content it does have. But I was expecting a far more in-depth treatise on the subject going into possible symptoms/solutions for each type of main OBD II code.In the author's defense, I probably am not the target audience as I am a computer engineer who's playing around with designing an OBD II scan tool as a hobby."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Childhood favorite","review":"A very simple tale - a fiddler has a \\"very special cat\\" that dances when he fiddles.

Waugh handles the weighty topic with the same dexterity with which he treats all of his subjects, never bogging down and keeping the reader laughing. The story also provides interesting historical material on both WWII and the disappearance of the English aristocracy.

No, this is not intended as a how-to guide and if that's all you're looking for, I'd go for a basic gardening book and look to this resource only if you're really interested in the science behind the art. THIS IS AN ACADEMIC PIECE OF LITERATURE! And an excellent piece of it at that. Since I had no background in the study of ecology or of agriculture or soils when I read this I had a hard time following it which is why I had to go back and do a lot of background research before digging into it again.

His stories are like reading Cliffs Notes. If you don't believe me pick up the old paperback of \\"The Five Doctors\\". It's alot like reading a TV Guide (or Radio Times) blurb of the episode."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eight Doctors, and 284 pages of fluff!!!","review":"Remember when Terrance Dicks wrote wonderful stories for the BBC television series \\"Dr Who\\". Good!!! Don't spoil that memory by reading this piece of rubblish. The characters that we fans love so much are depicted with all the depth of a thimble. The meaty descriptions of alien beings and worlds are given just enough substance to fill the bottom of an ash tray, while still not touching the sides. The only justification for this novel, would have to be if poor Terrance was heavily medicated, after a series of severe blows to the head, during the time that he was writing this. Hopefully his prozac perscription will run out before he puts pen to paper again. I know that you will more than likely buy this book too, just based on the fact that it is a multi-Doctor story...but you have been warned."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD BOOK??? LOVE IT OR LIKE IT.","review":"After a lot of negative feedback I was thinking that this book was going to be bad. But as it's DR WHO I knew I had to read it and must say that i enjoyed it. The idea of the TARDIS taking the now amnesiatic (that a word?) Doctor to meet his other selves was pretty cool. His meetings with the 1st, 3rd and 4th Docs impressing me the most. It got a bit confusing when meeting his 6th self and trying to tie up continuity within this period (which is virtually a nightmare to do) and downright disappointing with his 7th Doc meeting. There's also the introduction of new companion, Sam. Obviously, Terrances purpose was to introduce her but not to develop her character that much. This wouldn't be labled as a 'thinker' or 'groundbreaking' novel like some of the others, but for a no-brainer read, tis good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this one","review":"This should more properly be called \\"Eight Doctors, One at a Time\\" because unlike the televised episodes with the titles \\"The N Doctors,\\" the Eighth Doctor spends the book visiting one incarnation at a time in order.

You get a much better picture of Sam's character in \\"Vampire Science.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"It's FUN to read all Eight Doctors!","review":"It is not easy bringing the many voices of a Time Lord, known as THE DOCTOR, together. However, Terrance Dicks is one of the writers in the DOCTOR WHO UNIVERSE that seems up to the task. There are those in DOCTOR WHO FANDOM who feel that multi-DOCTOR stories are trite, and too cute. I believe that if this particular native of Galifrey is to be viewed as a renegade on the run from his own people, then criss-crossing the time-stream and meeting himself seems like a natural occurrence. Dick's story allows one to go into one's own memory matrix and conjure up the prior doctors, while maintaining the EIGHTH's own persona. This is also the first meeting with the EIGHT's newest companion, SAM JONES. It also helps clear up some of the incontinuities of the 1996 tele-film."},{"rating":"2","title":"This was the best start to a new series of excellent books","review":"This was a great way to start the new series. Taking new andold readers to see the doctor teaming up with his past selves is awonderful idea. This is better than all the televised multi-Doctor teamups execept The Two Doctors!

He presents Pliny as some sort of modern day \\"touchy-feely\\" metrosexual and this spoils what could have been a good historical mystery. Pliny's attitudes toward slavery, Roman justice and his falling for a slave girl are an excellent example of the worst sort of writing error - giving a first century Roman character a 21th century mentality and ethos. Honest to goodness, by the time I was halfway through the book I expected Pliny to be spouting theories of modern forensic science, DNA testing and possible slavery \\"reparations.\\" This book doesn't even begin to compare favorably with the writings of Davis and Saylor."},{"rating":"1","title":"This road goes nowhere","review":"Of all the novels I have read, this may be the worst.

So far, I'm over half way through the book, it is more of a history of New York and early America than a story of Fanny Crosby. Instead of learning about her, I'm reading about how the Irish and the catholics didn't get along and other political problems of the day. it's ok to put the person in the setting, but the setting is the focus. The writer even questions the character of Crosby by always being skeptical of her positive outlook on life.

I've been very unimpressed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A valuable resource for the beginning designer","review":"I wish that I had discovered this book before I had graduated from design school.

The book is divided into different sections on different types of design along with an interview of sorts with a person in that industry. What I found to be most informative was that at the beginning of each section there are recommendations on the types (as well as number) of pieces your portfolio should contain if you are interested in going for a job in that particular part of the industry.

Looks more like showga","review":"Bought several of Yee's DVDs hoping they would be another great set of power yoga. After trying the workouts, must say I am disappointed.Yee's approach to yoga is more like Showga - lots of graceful acrobatic moves without a focus on yoga's core principals. In stretchy, show-all shorts that could only be meant to get dates, Yee blazes through ~20 poses per minute. Breathing - an foundational yogic element - is not mentioned in some of his videos. A couple of the poses, particularly the twisting back stretch, are so poorly instructed, I question whether they are safe for beginners. While Yee's form is good he fails to mention how to perform the stretches safely.Yee appears to be an excellent practitioner and is undeniably a yoga rockstar. But his videos ignore core yoga techniques essential for a beginner."},{"rating":"2","title":"a decent yoga video","review":"Rodney Yee is definitely easy on the eyes and this workout is a good one..It has some hard parts,but not TOO many..(The backbends are brutal)The tape covers all bases and i would reccomend it as part of a collection.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too challenging for me","review":"I am relatively new to yoga (about 9 months or so of consistent practice) and I found this dvd WAY TOO CHALLENGING.

I haven't seen anyone mention this, but Rodney Yee has a serious lisp that is distracting, in addition to a few grammar problems (\\"groin\\" does not take a plural). Also, I feel that Yee might not have the greatest understanding of yoga, as he switches from referring to bhujangasana as cobra AND upward dog, when they are THE SAME POSE. So in short, I feel like he's a \\"celebrity\\" instructor made famous by Gaiam and their pervasive marketing, but it could be worse. Although I practice yoga for flexibility and not for a spiritual purpose of any kind, Shiva Rea, Yoga Shakti is the only DVD I've seen that's truly worth owning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!","review":"I'm not a yoga buff, but I have the AM Yoga by Yee and like it, so I thought I'd try this one. I made it half way through and cut off the DVD, not because the poses were too challenging (and some of them were) but because I was so bored. I don't mind having to modify poses to suit my ability; that's part of what yoga is about. I'm sure that the moves would do what they should if I could have stuck it out. An hour of this is just too much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too fast and repetitive.","review":"I bought this yoga DVD to get an advanced yoga workout. Instead Rodney Yee gives a repetitive, dull and fast-forward yoga sequence. I don't really want to use it as a workout because I don't feel that it does what yoga is supposed to do... make your body and mind feel better and balanced. This workout just has you jumping in and out of mountain pose-down dog-plank-up dog and back to mountain pose. There is no time to find your balance in the pose, breathe and transition to the next... I kept falling behind until I finally just ended up doing my own yoga poses. The music and the scenery is nice, but Yee's fast-forward yoga is not for everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great workout!","review":"The yoga routine builds on itself. Rodney Yee starts with really basic moves that anyone can do, then progresses to more and more challenging poses. This allows the user to do more of the DVD as he or she gradually builds up strength and flexibility. This definitely is a cardio workout and not just a stretching yoga routine. I was sweating about fifteen minutes into the routine and I've been doing yoga for several months before I tried this workout. I highly recommend this to anyone who already is somewhat familiar with yoga."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good step up...","review":"I had been doing beginner level yoga for about 6 months and just wasn't feeling overly challenged anymore so I decided to try to find a workout that was a step up. This was definitely a good fit for me. It isn't so hard that someone new to yoga cant do it, but it is fairly challenging. Rodney Yee does a great job of making the workout flow and increase in difficulty without you realizing it. It is a great addition to my workout regimen."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great power-yoga session","review":"For those who want an \\"exercising\\" yoga session, this dvd is perfect. It does not cover a broad range of positions, nor was it intended to probably: instead, it is a yoga \\"workout\\" to get ready for a more intense session, or simply as a yoga training session for more advanced yoga, or for other sports or activities."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great workout!","review":"I enjoy working out with Rodney's videos. I find them solid and well balanced. Lots of variety of postures and good flow overall. I mix this workout with Mark Blanchard's Progressive Power Yoga series throughout the month. While my wife and I prefer Mark Blanchard's instruction more than Rodney, we both agree that Rodney is a great instructor and make sure to use his workouts for variety. Lots of downward dogs and flowing postures. Not for the weak of heart. We heartily endorse this dvd and believe that everyone can benefit from power yoga...you just need to unroll the mat and give it a try.... then you are hooked."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite yoga DVD by far","review":"I have been using this DVD regularly for 4 months or so. I do it 1st thing in the morning so the 1st 10 minute warm up session is perfect to wake you up and get you going. Rodney then escalates to a more demanding yet gentle and relaxing series that get you sweating and make your muscles both stretch and work out. When you are tired enough, by minute 30 or so, he then takes you to the floor in a series of back bends that are still quite demanding but allow your heart rate to drop.Finally there are about 20 minutes of stretching that will leave you feeling calmed, relaxed, energized and full of peace.After doing this for a month or so your legs and arms are lean and defined, your waist is smaller and you find it easier to sleep at night and cope with every day's problems.Haven't got this from any other yoga DVD and I own about 6 of them. I recommend this for anybody with some yoga experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it","review":"This is a great power yoga DVD. I tried some (not all, for sure) with Bryan Kest, Baptiste, MTV, and none compare to Yee. The practice is very challenging (for me, that is) and the pace is perfect. I found others to be either too fast - where you're not in the pose yet and the change it - or too slow - which bores me. Yee holds difficult poses for long enough to be challenging, but doesn't go too slow otherwise. Plus, his voice is very calming and encouraging. He's my fave so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yoga Challenge","review":"This is a great yoga video if you've been doing yoga for some time and you're familiar with the moves. I loved it. He moves from pose to pose fluidly and you hold each pose for just the right amount of time. If you're looking for a challenge, this is the DVD for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good overall workout","review":"I will never give a yoga dvd 5 stars because I was too spoiled with an amazing teacher before I moved away, but this dvd is pretty good. Rodney has a soothing, non-abrasive voice and takes you through a pretty good workout. You might not think it's so intense until you realize how sore you are the next day. I think it is a better buy for those who are more experienced with yoga, so they can either complete the intermediate poses, or so they can be familiar with the less advanced versions of each pose if they aren't ready to tackel the real bendy stuff. Rodney doesn't give multiple options for each pose, which is nice if you want to accomodate the various levels of each student."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this DVD!","review":"I normally practice Vinyasa yoga at a studio but my current schedule doesn't allow me to attend classes regularly. Supplementing my practice has been a challenge until I came across this DVD. Rodney is a superb instructor. The flow of movement and clear instructions allows you to do the whole routine basically with your eyes closed.This DVD is probably best for someone with some experience under their belt. I am a former dancer who has been practicing yoga for 3 years. I found this DVD to be a perfect fit for my level of fitness and experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice work out","review":"I had never done or seen yoga performed in my life and I got this tape to\\"introduce\\" yoga into my workouts.I am incredibly inflexible and needed help. The first time through the tape was difficult because I could not perform the moves and watch how to do them at the same time. He goes through the poses rather quickly. The second time through was better and the third time I knew what to do though performed \\"modified\\" positions on many positions.This tape is certainly doable for beginners with a little patience.I can not compare it to others since I have never seen another one. There is not much focus on breathing and seems fast paced which I liked."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Yoga DVD for your home collection!","review":"I absolutely love this DVD and it made a great addition to my home collection. I have started off slow and add more and more of the DVD as I am able to handle it. It is a good work out and quite challenging, but it definitely produces a difference in your body and your ability to do certain poses. I bought this after buying his beginners dvd and absolutely love both of them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great basic routine","review":"I have had this yoga DVD for longer than I can remember and I still come back to it from time to time. It's that strong. I have been practicing on and off for about 10 years, and on days I can't make it to a class I like to stay in practice with this video. It never fails to make me break a sweat!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good but a little boring","review":"I like Rodney Yee's style, and have a few of his DVDs already. Power Yoga is great for a home practice, however since I got used to him it became somewhat boring. I recently started to alternate this dvd with the one I just got calledYoga for Power and Flexibility. The instructor's style is similar to Rodney Yee's, but it has more variety and overall seems more alive.I like to alternate those workouts on different days, and it works well for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great full body practice!","review":"I bought this Rodney Yee 'Power Yoga' video on recommendation from my yoga instructor for when I travel. It is great! Rodney communicates the poses and movements well, so you don't have to keep looking at the T.V. to follow. Very happy overall."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice progression of workout","review":"Rodney Yee and gorgeous Hawaiian scenery in the background make this a visual treat as the workout itself takes you from gentle warmup stretches and breathing to more and more complex and challenging moves. Everything flows very well and allows for beginners to start out with ten or fifteen minutes and then as you become stronger and more flexible you can add more and more time onto your routine until eventually you can go from start to finish at one time. The narrative blends well with the demonstrations although if you are completely unfamiliar with yoga terminology there will be somewhat of a learning curve until you remember the positions that go with each name, but it shouldn't be hard if you are paying attention and there is plenty of instruction, both spoken and visual, on how to do each pose the first time it is used; also plenty of practice given to each new pose as it repeats throughout the remainder of the routine."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite of all Yoga DVDs I own!","review":"This was my first \\"Rodney Yee\\" yoga DVD that I purchased, and definitely my favorite yoga DVD that I own.I would rate this DVD intermediate, or at least \\"almost\\" intermediate. Yee doesn't explain the poses and goes pretty fast through the vinyasas, so you should know at least yoga basics. He also takes you through some more advanced poses, like Wheel (I think he calls it upward bow). This DVD is a great workout and really is a full hour (short svasana/relaxation, though).I highly recommend this one!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"hate this tape","review":"3 words, bad for you. this tape is bad for you. the postures are very strenuous on the knees and back for those who are not practiced, and anyone with irreperable knee damage. the way he sits and on bent knees and rolls around on his spine is only acceptable for someone in the best condition has supreme control out over their muscles and breathing. it is a dangerous tape for anyone else"},{"rating":"1","title":"teribly disappointed","review":"I PLAYED THE TAPE ONCE AND IT WAS FINE.

I was using recorded David Ross Inhale episodes on Oxygen tv) - which i really liked, but thought I'd try something new. Bought this and 2 others by D Yee, and I'm not quite as impressed as I thought I would be based on the reviews. I am by no means a yoga expert, but I feel like he goes way too fast and doesn't allow much time for sufficient strength and stretching...especially if this is supposed to be for beginners (which I thought I was, but i found this workout to be fairly easy, so maybe I'm a bit more advanced than I thought). All in all, I suppose if you've never done yoga, this might be fine as a first step, but you'd have to really pay attention - or keep your remote handy to pause! - to be able to keep up. More advanced people - look for something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"just ok","review":"did not enjoy this dvd. i have his \\"am yoga\\" dvd and enjoy that so much better. this one is just \\"blah\\" and some of the poses don't seem to flow. this dvd, like his flexibility, cd is too rushed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Try another tape","review":"I generally like power yoga, but I agree that this tape is too repetitive and overall boring. There are so many other poses that could have been incorporated into the workout to keep it from becoming monotonous.

A much better workout is Bryan Kest's Power Yoga DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Know What You're Doing First","review":"As a beginning practioner of yoga, I would have appriciated more guidelines as to the proper poses.

I went into the workout slightly sore from the previous day's Jillian Michaels: Banish Fat and Boost Metabolism video workout... I completed the entire 63 minutes and did not feel much different than I felt going in to the the workout.

I have practiced yoga intermittently for several years. I do not have much experience with flow style power yoga. For me, the poses were not held long enough.

If you have been doing yoga for several years and want a challenge, this is a great DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Challenging","review":"Having done a Beginners video with Rodney Yee for years, I stepped it up with this new DVD.

The other I used was a prenatal yoga dvd during my 4th pregnancy. Now that I am 5 months post-partum, I was looking for something more challenging that I could incorporate into my weekly exercise routine of running and weight training. I find this dvd somewhat challenging. He moves through the poses rather quickly and I would prefer to hold them a bit longer. However, he gives you a decent yoga workout in an hour which is nice for a busy mom of 4!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for beginners","review":"Poses: This is not for beginners. Assumes you have knowledge on the poses. That being said, it has good flow from one pose to another and it does get more challenging as it progresses. In the video, Rodney Yee advised to just work at our own pace / strength and stop when it gets too difficult. I can only do up till minute 25 before I tire out or the poses get too hard. This just means that I'll keep coming back to this video until I can finish the whole thing.DVD and camera work: Good quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"The DVD kicked my butt!","review":"Now that I'm in my 40's I've moved away from jumping up and down in step class to yoga and pilates. I have the AM & PM yoga DVD, which I find refreshing, but no raise in heart rate.So I purchased the Power Yoga dvd and .. man, Rodney Yee kicked my butt! Wow, this was challenging. If you're an accomplished yoga student, you may find it boring, but I only do yoga occasionally and really loved the difficulty of the poses. I had to giggle when I was going through the poses, that I cannot sit in lotus position to save my life .. my legs simply do not bend in that position .. lol.Good DVD .. get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome DVD, great challenges","review":"This DVD is great. It pushes you and yet allows you to make modifications were necessary. It is an hour long and really makes you sweat if you push yourself deep into the poses. Clear visuals and great instruction.

WONDERFUL!~andrea"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kicked my rear","review":"No matter how fit I thought I am, this DVD kicked my rear. I just recently pulled away from my normal routine to do something completely different and new to me, and that is Yoga. I chose this DVD due to reviews, and how it focuses on strength. Well I can make about 15 minutes into it before my body is telling me to stop. So for right now I am going to something a bit easier, but planning to come back to this soon. Still regardless of my results does not change the fact this DVD is worth every penny."},{"rating":"2","title":"tuff","review":"Ever since I took that rocking yoga class in south florida, I've been in search of a video that remotely strenghtens and works me as tough-ly as my teacher used to. This video is not for beginners, but Mr. Yee is so convincing, that I did a back bend for the first time, something I didn't even do when I took that class many moons ago. Not for the faint of heart, it will make you sweat. It will also make you sore, but it is a total workout, in the best possible way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Straigtforward Yoga for the serious Yogi","review":"I purchased this video to do at home when my schedule does not allow for group classes. Although in my opinion nothing takes the place of a great teacher at a yoga studio; this video certainly provides your fix along with a vigorous workout. This is definitely for the experienced yogi since Rodney goes directly into many of the poses with very little instruction. This is fine with me since other videos seem to harp on intruction waisting time. I was a little intimidated starting the video and only anticipated completing a quarter or so of it but ended up completing the whole thing. I really enjoyed and will add this to my yoga strength training routine.

Down, up, down, up, the same motions repeated forty-fold over at a time, then going to two other motions... repeat 40 times there as well. End with a few really bizarre and painful back bends. This was bad enough, but at least I was sweating. Finally, though, I had to give up on this after playing it 3 times because I couldn't stand Rodney's bodalicious surfer-dude voice. That and the fact that he uses the word \\"pubis\\" CONSTANTLY. I mean, pick another word for it. Any word.

I was doing yoga for two years but then stopped for two years. So, when I read the reviews about this tape, I was expecting more. The workout did put a lot more pressure on my wrists from not doing yoga in the past two years but it was not really a vigorous workout that burned 500 calories. I would rate it as burning 120-150 calories. But it does help build strength if you are not already used to working out. And, my back did feel the ache of having not really used it in this fashion for a few years."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE THIS DVD!","review":"This did it for me!

Yay!

If the add had been correct in letting you know the correct area that a mat covers approx 3 1/2 sq foot (not 4 sq foot) one could order the corrrect amount to cover an area needed.

It's early in our road to healing, therefore I cannot confirm whether the methods suggested in this book will ultimately result in a reduction in the perceived noise and associated distress, but most of it makes good sense and can be applied with minimal financial investment.

I doubt they even read the book, and instead just gave it good reviews based on their experiences with him. I'm sure he is a pioneer in his field and does indeed know a great deal about tinnitus, and can/has helped people. However, this book IMO falls very short. The 200 plus pages could have easily been condensed to 20 or so. Many chapters cover the same topics as other chapters, and he rambles on and on about things that will not help you \\"Turn down the volume\\". In closing, the book does offer a handful of tactics that may help; some of those will seem like common sense to most folks. Just be prepared to read through a lot of crap just to get the information that could have been printed on AT LEAST 1/4 this books size."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not helpful","review":"More like a pep talk than anything. All the info in this book is available free by doing an internet search. Waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"SAME OLD LINE","review":"Had high hopes when ordering this book that it would help me cope with or even correct my tinnitus. All it did was tell me the same old thing, \\"It's in your head and you need to stop thinking about it and live with it.\\" By the time I finished reading it, I was more pessimistic and hopeless concerning my condition.I have recently ordered another book from Amazon, \\"Tinnitus Retraining Therapy\\" by Dr. Pawel Jastreboff, and hope this will help me. I'll review it after reading it. This doctor supposedly helped William Shatner (according to W.Shatner's book) in his battle with tinnitus."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Help For Me","review":"This book had nothing to do with my tinnitus.

Then I find others have already noted there is very little of actual worth in the book and that much is just rehashing and inducement to buy further products. I should have read the existing reviews before I bought the book !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Drug recommendation","review":"I read enough of this book to come to believe that the main recommendation is to be put on psych medications to lessen the problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Writer!","review":"I will be 60 years old this year and love to read good books. These are good books. Philip Pullman has a great imagination. I am almost finished with the last one and will cut this review short so that I can get back to it. Can't wait to go see the first movie. By the way, some of his ideas aren't fantastical."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Story, But Falls Short","review":"The first book of this trilogy was compelling and made me want to immediately read the next two books. Unfortunately, the next two did not live up to the dramatic build the first book started. The second book read like a book-long introduction. The third book was heavy handed, preachy, and almost patronizing in its explanation of events. The ending was a bit anticlimatic.While the message of these books is a good one: the continual strive for knowledge vs. denial of knowledge, I thought the delivery could have been a bit better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same old mistakes","review":"After I finished the last book I was annoyed at best. What a waste of time, both Pullman's writing of them and my reading them. How was I to know that the whole series would be based on the same old mistake that uninformed people have been making for nearly 2000 years. They think that Catholics are Christians. Sorry to disturb your atheist fantasies, but Catholicism has ALWAYS been anti-Christian. Pullman is right about Catholicism. He doesn't know anything about the Truth contained in the Bible.Oh yeah, neither do Catholics.As for comparisons to Tolkien...get serious!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bargain Basement Bound","review":"I just read the Golden Compass from the trilogy and must say this is the worst book I've ever read. I don't even want to read the others. It lacks creativity and character. It really just leaves you wondering what the point of the story was. I can see this one heading straight for the bargain rack. Don't waste your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dark and Immaterial","review":"The first book was a great adventure, but in the next two books, Pullman digresses into blatant church and Christianity bashing. He fully endorses eastern mysticism in his story and explains how the God of the Bible is an evil and spiteful being. Pullman's moral compass is way off as he clumsily closes his trilogy with loose ends, contrivances, and actually saves all of creation with some creepy prepubescent sexuality.It is unbelievable to me that these books got so much accliam and support as children's literature. I was looking for good fantasy and what I got was a disappointing blend of other great works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgusted","review":"I am growing tired of authors who think that their religious beliefs are so important to rebuff the Christian culture. There was a time when we all agreed that we would get along and respect each other regardless of our personal beliefs. We do have a Constitution that promotes freedom of speech and I have to support this author's right to express it. I find with deep sorrow that I will never choose to read this novel because I would find the underlying premise disgusting and unfathomable (that God is killed). What ever happended to reading literature to be entertained?"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not for children or young adults","review":"Children are impressionable and in my opinion shouldn't read stories in which the plot revolves around the supreme blasphemy, namely, that God is a liar and a mortal. I believe it is not appropriate for children to read books in which the heroine is the product of adultery and murder priests act as professional hit men, torturers and authorize occult experimentation on young children an ex-nun engages in occult practices and promiscuous behavior, and speaks of it openly with a 12-year-old couple and the angels who rebel against God are good, while those who fight on God's side are evil. This is wrong. And while it's been softened in the movie -- or at least that's what Hollywood is telling us -- it's still there in the books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Fantasy","review":"The Golden Compass is a wonderful fantasy story. It takes place in England when Lyra's uncle (father) returns from an expedition from the north. She then is brought to her mother's residence and learns what is happening in the north. Homeless children are being taken and seperated from their daemons (somewhat like a lifelong companion). With these experiments they are trying and bring the dimensions of the worlds together. Which are being seperated by the dust in the northern lights. She goes off on a dangerous adventure with gypses and armored bears to try and stop her parents who are the leaders of the experiments. Along the way they restore the rightful armored bears leader, which was their companion. They reach the northern lights and her Father (Uncle in the beginning) and her mother which was the leader of these experiments, go through the lights and they follow them through which leads on to the next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why is this trilogy being marketed to kids?","review":"** Parents beware!**This saga is beautiful, magical, mind expanding. Pullman's creation of multiple fully-faceted worlds is spellbinding. Just beautiful writing, I'd recommend it for any adult/young adult.That said: the central premise behind this fantastic chronicle is not something I would want my pre-teen child to be exposed to. It's nihilistic and heavily into materialist philosophy: exactly what kids today DON'T need.For older teens and adults, highly recommended. For anyone younger (even tho the cover says this is recommended for anyone 8 to 80), definitely NOT recommended.If you're thinking about giving this to a child (-14 or so), please read it first. Consider keeping your young ones' innocence for a few years. Teach them values, hope, and faith in something. Then the imaginative springboard that is Pullman's saga will be a good thing.I loved this whole book. It's just not something I would ever, ever recommend for younger kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"struggling to finish","review":"There are SO many other good books out there to read...I started this due to all the \\"wonderful\\" reviews and now I am struggling to finish the series.

Could Not put it down!","review":"This book is FANTASTIC! Very imaginative and creative! Finished all 3 books in a week! Once you read the Golden Compass-->you gotta read the following books after."},{"rating":"1","title":"SO disappointing","review":"I absolutely love fantasy (usually) but was incredibly let down by this series. The first book was wonderful. I immediately bought the next two- and hated them. I love reading about other worlds, and the daemon idea is great, but I didn't like that some characters died (main ones) and others crossed over in my world (drinking coke, riding in cars, etc.) And the first book paid a lot of attention to character development, while the next two were incredibly rushed and hurried feeling, with confusing, badly-laid out, not-well-described worlds and religious theories. Plus, after the first one, the humor just disappears. Just goes away entirely. I read this series, and the reviews of it, with great excitement, but I was completely uninspired by it. If you like fantasy, other worlds, young children going toward their destinies, and, for god's sake, good character development and humor, buy something by David Eddings. (...)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for those that love the CS Lewis books.","review":"These books are really not for children as young as 9 or 10. If you want a longer fantasy book, try Redwall. It's great and doesn't have all the darkness that Pullman books have. Also, it bothers me that the new film trailers for The Golden Compass leave you feeling like this book/movie is a follow up to The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe. Not so. Pullman didn't even care for CS Lewis and certainly not for Lewis' beliefs. Personally, I don't want to expose my children to such a dark tale at a preteen age. They can make their own decision when they are older. There are so many great fantasy tales out there. Why read this one when there are better age appropriate ones? Try M. L'Engle as well. Amazon has great reference guides to help choose better books. Good luck! I have a 10 year old reader sitting behind me as I type this and I would never encourage her to read Pullman books at her age."},{"rating":"1","title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"A fun read. Not as intricate or engrossing as Lord of the Rings,but enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"His Dark Materials /Trilogy","review":"As a new reader of Philip Pullman ( and now most likely his greatest fan ) , I had a hard time over the first 100 pages , but was completely involved in the story and bonded to the characters after.I never had so much fun and pain reading books like in this case, especially because Pullman here deals with the major features of life - faith, religion, deception and most important love ! I was completely overwhelmed by the power and depth of The Amber Spy Glass as I never expected a children's book being so dark and serious without being heavy .I will miss Lyra and Pantalaimon very much , in fact while reading the books I caught myself more than once hoping and wishing I could ( or would ) have a Daemon !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Review of The Golden Compass","review":"Philip Pullman's Trilogy was highly touted as the last great fantasy work of the 20th Century alongside C. S. Lewis' Chronicles of Narnia and J. R. R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings. I began to read The Golden Compass after having seen the movie, which was well produced. I found the literary quality of Pullman's work poor and would in no way classify this good or great literature. In terms of theme, the fantasy seeks to develop and explore an atheistic worldview. Thus, for example, one of the positive characteristics of Lyra Belacqua, the protagonist, is courage. But in an atheistic framework, this only amounts to self-assertion against all odds and authority. The value of such a work for our children is questionable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hugely disappointing","review":"I reviewed all the books individually, going from five sta5rs for book one, then plummeting to one star for book three. I would give the overall series a 2. I have no axe to grind with Mr. Pullman's opinion of religion, but I do resent his letting it get in the way of competently completing his story. (And how anyone can think that religion, particularly roman Catholicism, is not the main focus of the story is beyond me.) The Amber Spyglass is a muddle from start to finish, with so many different ideas tossed together yet never developed that it was an exercise in frustration to force myself through to the ending. He has a great imagination, but he is as zealous and self-righteous in his own opinions as the Chruch that he is railing against. While that may be good fodder for a story, it is not in itself a good story. Hugely disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"His Dark Materials: The next Harry Potter","review":"If you LOVE Harry Potter, than pick up His Dark Materials. These books are about a twelve year old girl named Lyra Silvertonuge, (my favorite charater) and her adventures with her deamon Pantaliamon, her friends Serafina Pekkala, the queen of her witch clan, Iorek Byrnison, the bear king, the Aletheometer, the truth instrument that Lyra learns to read, and her new friend Will Parry, who becomes more than a friend...This book is the best after Harry Potter. It is something worth picking up and reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutly Brilliant!","review":"This is an excellent series that must be read. It does no more harm then any Bible Story or Narnia does, all of which are based on pure fantasy. Those insecure with their own belief system will of course find the series disturbing; after all they are stuck in a mind set that any questioning or blantant opposition to their religion is to not exist. However, that is not the case now days and HIS DARK MATERIALS could not have been made into a film series at a better time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most Political Book I've Ever Read","review":"When \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy was complete, I told my daughters that I wished they would make a movie of this trilogy. Each book gets better, and the last one in the series brought tears on more than one occasion. It is an absolutely wonderful read -- read all three books to my daughters, starting with the Golden Compass when they were 8 and 11. Some parents may think too much violence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read These Immediately","review":"This series is incredibly well done. It is much darker than Harry Potter, but it satisfies on the same level. The goodies and the baddies aren't always easy to label, and there are surprising and sad twists and turns of the plot. There are also some interesting theological questions to think about without putting forth a religious ideology of any kind, and all this is tied up in a rip-snorting good story about people we'd love to know.Orson Scott Card's \\"Ender's Game\\" and \\"Ender's Shadow\\" are good in this way also. Happy reading!"},{"rating":"2","title":"what a great story","review":"first off to all the people crying about the church being the the antagonist get over it....

I love the story. At first, i'll admit I didn't quite get what the fuss was all about. After a little more reading, I found the story so captivating!It's a story about magic and fantasy with religious undertones. Be warned: Christians may find these books offensive, but not necessarily.Overall, wonderfully written, fun and beautiful that keeps you going page by page. If you like the books... this set is also great. I like that the spines, when held together, form the words 'his dark materials.'

So I bought the first book (The gold compass) and read it. It was good, but I was out of cash...so I borrowed the second one from him.

Just be warned!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a blasphemous series!","review":"I picked these books up at a used book sale. The first half of the first book didn't even make sense with all the new terms mixed in a parallel universe. The second book was better at explaining things, but had some questionable material. The third book was downright sacriligious. The \\"good\\" guys are out to challenge the \\"Authority\\" who is just a really really old angel, and to replace society and religion. The church is seen as nothing but a mindless enemy. I destroyed my copies, and I hope with this review, some parents will think twice about allowing their children to be exposed to such filth. It's amazing that this offensive stuff even gets printed."},{"rating":"1","title":"A definite read for all callus anti-Christian bigots.","review":"A definite read for only the most callused anti-Christian bigot. It is unfortunate that this author's adequate skill at story telling is lost on such a blatant bigot. His intolerant views are forced into this story unnecessarily. The bigotry adds nothing needful to the plot. Even at the point when he kills God it is so anticlimactic you barely noticed that it has occured. The story could easily have been told without his trite narrow-minded views clouding an otherwise good story."},{"rating":"1","title":"ABOUT THE DEATH OF GOD","review":"I didn't know these books were about the death of God. I loved Harry Potter. They were creative and good vs. evil with good winning. It was pure fantasy and fun to read. These are NOT like those fantasy books. The books end with the DEATH OF GOD. Google more info on these books before you buy them and decide for yourselves. They should come with a warning that subject matter is controversial."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty boring","review":"I tried getting past the first half and simply lost interest. I don't think Pullman is a very good writer. So I didn't finish and don't plan to. If this is the best of the 3 books then don't bother. With so much out there to read, I decided not to waste time on this one. Now that I see that the end has to do with battling armored polar bears, I am glad I jumped ship."},{"rating":"1","title":"GOD IS EVIL","review":"If you are a christian, or at least believe that there is a God and God is good , then you may not want your childern reading these books, or if you let them I advise that you read the series first before allowing them to. the premis of these books, in a nut shell is, God is an evil tyrant, the rebel angels kicked out of heaven are good, and gave humans consousness(spelling?) so we would not just be slaves. In the end the humans who have realized that God is bad, along with the rebel angels, storm heaven and kill God. pullman uses the missuse of realigon through out history to give creedence to his view that God is evil. This is a very short sighted and naieve view, however children reading this may not understand this and be influenced to believe that religons always act in the way that their god wishes them to, so if a religion acts in a evil way then it is god who is telling them to."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best of Philp Pullman","review":"These three books are wonderful. Now that they come in one book you'll be able to read the whole Magical series. This book is adventure,humore,action and is heart breaking. This wonderful story will make you want to see what else Philp Pullman has written. You will be dissapointed that there are only three books in this series, but that makes your imagination explode with ideas! This book is wroth reading over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Box Set","review":"Enclosed in a colorful box - the cover of the book, The Golden Compass - this is an excellent way to purchase the complete His Dark Materials Trilogy.The slightly-oversized paperbacks provide ample room for a highly-readable font. With the focus on the release of the movie - The Golden Compass - it is a bit surprising that the book only has one movie photo, but that does not detract from an attractive box-set of three classic fantasy novels from Philip Pullman."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Wonderful!","review":"I'm a devout Catholic, and found these books to be absolutely a joy to read...People really need to be secure enough in their faith to not allow such abhorrent and fascist proposals as the banning of books, to even enter their minds let alone our society. Shame on those who even entertain those ideas!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pullman Trilogy","review":"Mr. Pullman's trilogy is well-crafted, although his inventions fade rapidly after reading (unlike Lewis's Narnia, which remains mint-bright in the mind). The trilogy is also teeming with religious hatred, specifically of Christianity and Christians. As a parent, a college professor, and someone who respects all religions, I find this incomprehensible and unacceptable. I would strongly recommend that parents avoid buying these books for their children; if a child does read this trilogy, parents and educators should make every effort to point out to the child Mr. Pullman's bigotry, and perhaps discuss the dangers of all prejudice: religious, racial, ethnic, national, and so on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blasphemy at its best","review":"I agree that Pullman pulled this series off with intricate plot and interesting creatures / characters. However, I cannot continue to finish book three when the story enfolds the so called dark side of God and the explicit condemnation of the name of God. The fabrication of events in heaven and the creation of man are misleading to young readers. I strongly recommend parents not to buy these books for their kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is a little TOO dark for kids","review":"This book does appear to offer an enchanting world to read about, but be warned. The world is a lot darker than what readers of Harry Potter are accustomed to. In fact, the feeling I get from the writing is that the author is a disturbed and creepy man. I can't bear the thought of this writer \\"speaking\\" to children through his writing.I loved Harry Potter, but this book is not in the same area. Readers beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't like it.","review":"I loved Harry Potter, The Hobbit, and Lord of the Rings. I hated The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe and the other Narnia stories. I hated the Golden Compass, and I would have thought that I would have liked it. Personally, I don't think His Dark Materials are children's books. The story lines are too adult. I didn't mind the dig at religion. I just thought the story was stupid, and didn't make sense. There isn't an ending. I won't be reading the other two books in the series. I jumped ahead and read a few bits out of the next two books, but the story just didn't grab me. Like the first, each of the other two books doesn't have an ending. Very unsatisfying."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"The Christian religion is just one big mistake?\\"","review":"This is what the heros believe in The Amber Spyglass. This and much, much more.

It's much darker and more complex. If you're looking for more Potter, which are truly children's books, push on. Nor is it anything like the crudely sanctimonious, morally corrupt Narnia books. Secondly, artistic vision is so rare and precious that it is unreasonable and a great loss to insist that it must also toe the line of Christian indoctrination."},{"rating":"2","title":"simply gorgeous.....","review":"Not only has Phillip Pullman created a world of dark fantasy filled with things that pull at the depths of your imagination, his writing uses enough reality to make the events seem almost possible, but elusive, like a flash of movement that just catches in the corner of your eye.They could be a little bit hard to follow at times, so I wouldn't recommend them to anyone with a short attention span. The violence wasn't nearly as bad as it could have been; most twelve-year-olds could probably stomach it.These are definitely books to buy and read over and over. I'm loathe to compare them to \\"Harry Potter,\\" but both series share an aspect of adventure and mystery that keeps you enthralled right until the very end. A must-read if I've ever found one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Starts out Great, ends...","review":"When I first read this series, I absolutely loved it. It had a unique storyline and the characters were interesting enough to stick with it. Unfortunately, when I read the trilogy again a couple of years later, it was kind of disappointing. The first book was great, the second one was good, but the last one was kind of mediocre and the end in my opinion was terrible. I'd recommend this trilogy to anyone, but it isn't one of my favorites."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting...in a bad way","review":"Mr. Pullman weaves a great story, and it is clear he is a brilliant writer.But the only way you could read these books and not find offense is that you don't believe in god. He specifically writes that the Christian/Jewish god is evil, and that is a bit of a disturbing message to be putting into a children's book. He intentionally frames himself as the anti-C.S. Lewis, who he considers \\"evil.\\"The problem with this book is not that he criticizes the church, its that he specifically and directly criticizes god. I don' think that has any redeeming qualities, and isn't a healthy outlook no matter who you are or what you believe.Frankly, if you read these books carefully, its impossible to miss. So if you are an atheist, go for it, you'll probably really enjoy his tremendous skill. But if you believe in god, or your children do, find a book that has a more adjusted criticism of the church or one that is more friendly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Each book is better than the last","review":"Have just finished the third book in the trilogy. The first was pretty good, but I was wondering what all the fuss was about. By the time I got halfway through the third it was clear!

The characters are well developed and sharp, and then incidental plots are always supportive and never intrusive. Basically a great read..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Average series","review":"The series was slow, difficult to get into and at times hard to follow.

If truth be told, I double majored in college, and one of my major was English, with my concentration in British Lit., romantic era.However, when I got into the third chapter or so, I couldn't put the book down! On the surface it's such a page turner, with such imagination, unique characters, and witty lines.Divulge deeper, and there is so much there that in order to absorb it all, you would have to re-read it again...and again...and again in order to hope to grasph all the meanings, a sign of a great book.I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants an easy read, with deep meaning, and to people of all ages."},{"rating":"2","title":"3rd time I've bought this book","review":"Bought this book for my girlfriend's birthday.

I was too young to understand the adult themes, sub-text (I was really naive and didn't realize how anti-Christian Philip Pullman was aside from feeling there was something odd about how the Church was the bad guy, and actually thought,\\"Well, they're only bad guys in the other universe so that doesn't mean anything.\\") but I knew one thing: It was very compelling, interesting, and I still wanted to read it even though it was a bit advanced for me. I still think the book is fascinating and re-readable and I recommend it.As for the anti-Christian themes, I don't really care about them but then again I'm not Christian. But anyone that is young enough to be easily affected by what they read is too young to realize it's Anti-Christian anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"His Dark Materials: The next Harry Potter","review":"If you LOVE Harry Potter, than pick up His Dark Materials.

I would recommend this book to anyone who loves to read and to be entertained."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gnostic-like fantasy underlines the evils of personal Godhood independent of His existence.","review":"The authors theistic fantasy reminds me of some of form of Gnosticism, in which the immediate God, who has the dominion over earth, is evil, and less powerful than the original creator, a Super-God. Of course in this case the \\"Super-God\\" has a pantheistic, impersonal nature, it is the dust who created the tyrannical angel who called himself \\"God\\"The author injects a lot of supernatural in his story like \\"witches\\", \\"demons\\", \\"angels\\", \\"spirits\\". By doing that he suggests that the evil of the personal Godhood stems on the ethical, rather than just epistemological grounds. Thus even if Personal God, existed ,and every word written in the Bible were true, it wouldn't deserved to be worshiped more than any other tyrant. In fact the whole process of worshiping, that denotes a process of slave-like submission, it is unethical in its nature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seductive Satanism","review":"I wish I could give this zero stars. My daughter gave me this book to read. I started reading it and was instantly sucked in. It's very well written and the character is very likeable. Then I started reading reviews and interviews with the author, who says \\"My book is about killing God\\". The enemy in these books is God, the premise that in the war for Heaven the wrong side won....that God is a power hungry senile jerk....I will not finish this series. I think I'll go re-read the Narnia books now."},{"rating":"1","title":"awful","review":"I don't even know where to begin. Just keep your children away from these books.

Research this author and his beliefs before buying this. This book may be fine for adults to read, but impressionable young people should not read it without adult supervision. Thankfully, I was warned ahead of time and researched this author before my children had a chance to read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A \\"Paradise Lost\\", for the wee ones","review":"I actually read this trilogy THE same semester I took a course Milton. An acquaintance made the recommendation in a completely unrelated encounter. I even assumed the title and opening quotes were a matter of pretense or homage or something silly. Well, how wrong I was! Such a scatterbrain, I! There is method in Pullman's... okay, wrong bard.Any rate...Quite a bit going on here. I have some issues (naphtha? give me a break Pullman, could you USE a more Edenic word for \\"oil\\"? pearls before swine...) but on the whole a captivating read. If you happen to be an easily-scandalized, fundamentalist Christian, DON'T BOTHER, as you'll wet yourself reading and then tell your pastor about it. Milton, as Puritanical as he was, would be sick with your lot (yeah, read \\"Areopagitica\\" and tell ME about censorship). Otherwise, whatever age you might be, you'll come away with more than you left with......Like thinking Lyra every time you read of \\"immortal Eve.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Inappropriate for children","review":"Although this book targets children as its audience, it is not appropriate for kids.

Seriously, these books were a scandal, and they have caused me pain that I never want to feel again. I will admit that I wanted Will and Lyra to fall in love, but not 50 pages too soon. Such a struggle to read through... such agony... By the end of this saga, I didn't care. I had trouble remembering why I loved The Golden Compass. I have forgotten the mastery of The Subtle Knife. Indifference. pure horrible indifference. The worst pain of all!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah Blah Blah","review":"Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah. Oh, did I mention blah? If I'd wanted to read Phillip Pullmans dumb musings about his perceptions on God and religion then I would have looked them up. I thought that I was buying a fantasy novel and was very disapointed when I found out it was just his little outlet for his mental constipation he was having. I am annoyed that Mr. Pullman managed to waste so much of my time. In addition, all pathetic athiest dogma aside, this is NOT a book for children. Even if it had no alterior motives, there is some sexuality and violence in these books that is not for kids. Nor adults for that matter. Anyway. Waste of time, waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Series, but I would have changed the ending.","review":"I recieved these books for Christmas and I read them all in less than a week...The first two books were great and the Third was even better except for the last few chapters.

At the end of book two Lyra and Will get separated, and before Will can go to Lord Asriel and help him in his fight to save the worlds from destruction, he must save Lyra from the hands of her evil mother. When they finally come together they are given another task, to free the dead from the hell they live in.

I have only finished the first book and am anticipating the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad writing ruins a book","review":"Why is so much fiction in print full of bad writing? At some point, plot, characters, and imagination cease to be important. The glaring fault of this book is the writing itself - dull, flat, colorless. Philip Pullman, like so many other big authors of today, has absolutely no grasp of the power and beauty of the English language. His style lacks flow, ease, and grace. My opinion? Skip this series. The story isn't worth the poor writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"SLOW!","review":"These books were torture to read. I got through the first one and hoped that the second might pick up and be better. Wrong! I don't even want to read the third because I'd rather spend my time doing something else like sorting my sock drawer.On the same level as Harry Potter? I think not!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a great read, certainly not for children","review":"I did enjoy the first book of the trilogy but as I read the other books I bacame more and more upset that this series should be found in the children's section of a bookstore. Most fantasy books for children do not directly denounce, or promote a god found in modern religions. This series did and did so blatantly.For children from religions where there is a belief in a good and loving god, this series can be very troubling and frightening. I would not recommend this series to anyone under high-school age and even then I would be hesitant.I have seen this series compared to C.S. Lewis. As far a children's literature goes, His Dark Materials trilogy does not hold a candle to the Lion, Witch and The Wardrobe series.If you are looking for good children's fantasy literature, look elsewhere. This series is sure to trouble and disappoint young readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just plain hated it, through and through. And NOT for kids!!","review":"SOOOO not for kids. There may be deeper meaning and all that, but children will read what is written: a story about kids' and parents' worst nightmares - children being kidnapped, tortured and murdered. This book is being compared to books that are read by kids in junior high or high school for its controversial undertones and even openly stated iconoclast ideas. Promote it for that audience and purpose, and I am OK with that. I don't care about the religious aspects, but don't want my child reading about castration in a \\"children's\\" book. I also didn't like the writing (sorry everyone) and the ending didn't follow through on the storyline. This book is OK to read along other philosophical works and would probably be great for such discussions about religion, life/death, politics, etc., but is not an outright fantasy as it has been publicized to be - on the surface it is just plain creepy. Blech!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Marvellous books, but apart from that...","review":"Finally you poor Americans get to see PP's lovely illustrations (and the quotes he chose for TAS).

That's rubbish.I quite envy you these covers actually, they're really nice..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Magnificent Read","review":"THE BEST BOOK EVER!A magical atmosphere, a whirlwind adventure, and a heart-wrenching, evocative conclusion to a wonderful series.Strong characterisation, vivid description and imaginative entities make this series, this journey, definitely a favourite read of mine.The only thing that could slightly blemish this series' impact would be the emphasis on anti-Christianity. Yet, this series is only fictitious. The anti-Christian approach is only disturbing because Pullman's talent and effort has made the books seem ultimately real.An EXCELLENT READ!I'm twelve years old, and I would say that most people from my age up would be able to read this book and gain maximum satisfaction. However, keep in mind that although being magical like Harry Potter, just as vivid in character and setting, this series is decidedly darker, with more depth in concepts and emotions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Bought them for my children for Christmas. They have already read all of them, and were well pleased with the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent indeed","review":"I would echo all the praise that others have lavished on these books - they're magical.But the person who says they are not an attack on religion is just plain wrong - Pullman has publicly said, on many occasions, that (and I paraphrase) he believes that religion is superstitious nonsense, and is very clear that the books are, indeed, partly intended to show just how ludicrous many religious beliefs are. These are complex allegories, and religion is right there in the middle of his allegorical gunsight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning Keep Your Kids Away","review":"DO NOT LET YOUR CHILDREN READ THESE BOOKS!!!

He is AGAINST any Christian whether Catholic or non-Catholic. This is NOT a set of books that you want your kids to read. And I really believe that no adult should read these books either. This man Pullman does not like C.S. Lewis or any Christian for that matter. I don't see why any Christian would buy and read these books.The author is going to use the movie to pull your children in to read these anti-Christian books. I've read that the movie is not as bad as the first book is. This is to lure you in and then to buy the books and then to see the other movies if this man gets that far with the other two movies. We Christians have to stand together and boycott these books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anti-religion Brainwashing At It's Worst","review":"This strange series follows the journey of a new age Adam and Eve on a quest to kill God and destroy religion.

I can't believe such themes could even be considered for a children's book."},{"rating":"1","title":"His Dark Materials","review":"We are asked to rate this book. There is no option for a negative to the infinity.I think this triolgy should be retitled \\"satan's instuction manuel\\" These books are clearly the work of someone who is extremely EVIL. No matter how the reviews water down these books, the end results are evident. Pullman wants GOD dead in the eyes of children. I read the books with my eyes open and can't believe what he espouses. I am deeply saddened that Nicole Kidman has appeared in the movie since I heard that she is a devout Catholic.

If you think you're mature enough to handle death, dying, kidnapping, cruelty, and anti-Christian wisely, then you can read these absolutly great books.Harry Potter? Too messed up.Hardy Boys?

DEFINETLY!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprised and Saddened","review":"I've just finished the GOLDEN COMPASS and the SUBTLE KNIFE. The new movie, is being promoted as a Narnia type story, but the books certainly are not. They are sort of the anti Narnia. I'm usually very liberal about what I read and watch. However, I would not recommend these books for kids without careful parental supervision. These books are very well written, and have an engaging adventure story. It's probably some of the best writing I've read since the Narnia books. The first book on it's own isn't overwhelmingly offensive because being the first in a series, you aren't sure what is up or down. Or, at least I wasn't sure if their quest would be the true quest of the whole story. I don't want to give away any spoilers, so I'll just conclude that it draws you into a story that seems innocent enough at first glance, but is not. I would not recommend them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sticks With You","review":"It has been almost 5 months since I have read this trilogy and since I have read 10 or more books, but when I think of what I've read these books always stick out. I find myself thinking about them almost everyday and this absolutely wonderful tale of a pair of adolescents adventure through different worlds. These books are truly wonderful and I'd reccomend them to anyone. They kept me guessing throughout and had me jumping in bed at the twists. The Amber Spyglass was and still is the only book that has ever made me cry. These books are truly magnificent."},{"rating":"1","title":"second rate and hateful","review":"Don't start reading these books. They will leave a sour taste with their anti-God screed. I read this with an open mind, thinking that much of the controversy was going to be along the lines of people thinking that the Harry Potter series was anti-Christian. While the Golden Compass does not get into this tedentious anti-God philosophy, that grows through the rest of the book, poisoning what would otherwise have been a reasonable story. Nothing to compare to Harry Potter or Narnia or Tolkien -- clearly second rate. I have no objection to stories which involve church based conspiracy theories -- one need only read a biography of Galileo to expose some of the bad things done by the Church -- but this trilogy turns into a 2-D screed against the concept of God.

Despite a great start with The Golden Compass and The Subtle Knife, the third book is a failure. The plot winds everywhere. The fantasy world Pullman creates makes less and less sense, as characters in what appeared to be a Victorian age in the first books are suddenly dealing with references to \\"atomic bombs.\\" Armies try to war against high tech weapons with gas filled zepplins. The \\"solution\\" to freeing the ghosts from the world of the dead is totally unsatisfying. The story just doesn't work, despite Pullman's tremendous imagination, beautiful writing style and flair for characterization.For those who feel as I do, I recommend novels such as James Stoddard's \\"The High House,\\" which hasn't received as much publicity, but is a far better read."},{"rating":"2","title":"His Dark Materials","review":"If you want a review on the content of these books, don't look here. You can find reviews on the content of this series all over the place if you look else where on this site.I just want to say that this is a nice edition of the His Dark Materials series (there is no way to make that sound anymore awkward).

I was very disappointed. Although he plainly has a creative mind, his presentation of his plot is difficult and annoying to read. His characters are suprisingly one-dimensional and hard to care about. Fans of the Harry Potter series would do better to look to up and coming authors like Garth Nix and Tamora Pierce, or to fantasy classics such as The Chronicles of Narnia (C.S.

How much can a page and a little extra ink cost? Twenty cents? I don't buy any books that are tiny print and returned them as soon as I opened it.Note to publishers: We'd buy a lot more books and read a lot more if we could actually read the words. 90% of all books are tiny type and I'm just not buying books or even attempting to read them when they're so tiny.

I didn't like it as much as the first, but I still enjoyed it and eagerly went on to the third. I started it and never finished. I geuss that was lazy of me, but it never really got me hooked. It just had way too many sub plots that kept on switching after every page and you had trouble keeping up with it all. Also, the story drifted away from Lyra on to Will, and placed Lyra as a character on the side. And that kind of annoyed me. Maybe, since it has been a while, I would enjoy it all if I read them over again.

The characters are rich, complicated, and incredibly unpredictable. The trilogy is an epic masterpiece, a true classic for the ages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blasphemy, I think not.","review":"This series has been ridiculed by the ridiculous right, lauded by the loony left and, as usual, ignored by the lukewarm middle. These books are well written, have a strong moral and ethical message, and encourage free thought. And let us not also forget, they are a work of pure FANTASY! Whether or not the author had some hidden agenda is not important. The fact that the trilogy relates a fun and original story is what is important.

This is a S-T-O-R-Y not suggestions in life paths.... but I digress, this is about the book, not current events.All in all, the story was very engaging and a real page turner from the beginning of the Golden Compass - to the end of the Amber Spy Glass!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Golden Compass Trilogy","review":"I did enjoy reading these three books and they kept my interest thruout. I read them one after the other in a span of about two weeks. The first book was really involved and had a complete feeling to it as did the second.

I was looking for something to read at lunch and this sounded quite interesting. Too bad once i finished Golden Compass I had no desire to read Subtle Knife. Nothing really happens in the story to draw you in and make a connection with the characters. Everything that happens is either over explained or not explained at all.

I just picked up the book one day and before long I couldn't stop reading! I rushed through The Golden Compass, The Subtle Knife, and the Amber Spyglass in a month, and I was heartbroken to see the last page. These characters (especially Lyra and Will) are very realistic and you wish (and feel) that you are there with them.One thing that concerns a lot of people is religion. Pullman is NOT anti Christian in any way, shape, or form and you are just crazy if you think so. I have one more thing to say: stop what you are reading now and pick up a copy of The Golden Compass and start reading!"},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST!","review":"These books, all 3, are really captivating.

You have to be totally focussed on the reading, because the plot twists and the developments can confuse you otherwise.Favorite series for life!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing Short of Amazing","review":"It has surprised me that this book can even be compared to Harry Potter. I have been a huge fan of His Dark Materials series since i first laid my hands on the Golden Compass. This has everything a reader could want, magic, suspense, cunning, love and leaves the reader basking in wonder. What can possibly happen to the characters next? The aggravation I went through waiting for the Amber Spyglass, imagine waiting for years for this amazing novel to finally arrive. These three books are at the very top of my list and i recommend them to anyone who does not mind spending sleepless nights completely glued to them. Philip Pullman is an amazing storyteller and you will never know what to expect next. Consider yourself lucky to have the full collection all at once."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Book Ever","review":"This is one of the best books i have ever read, it is better than Harry Potter and anyone who compares the two is mad, Pullman creates an exiting new world and shows it through the eyes of caracters so amazing you will fall in love with them, Lyra, Will, Iorek, and the rest of the gang will blow your mind, it was funny, exiting, and even heartbreaking, i do recomend that this book be considerd for teens mostly because at some point it may be confusing, but it has nothing to do with the opinion of others who say it is '' questioning gods existence'' , that is not true after all its only fiction, i recomend this book to anyone it is a great pice of literature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed. Why does anyone think this is good?","review":"I read this book because of the movie publicity and out of curiosity due to all the hype about it being anti-religious. Not only was it not really anti-religious, it was also not good. It is really poor writing. Nothing really makes any sense, the characters kind of come and go with no closure, the ending - well there is no real ending. When religion is mentioned, it isn't negative, it just makes no sense. The book is a waste of time. It's almost a decent adventure story but because it has no point and no ending it just left me mad that I had wasted my time reading it. I won't be reading any of the others."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of time","review":"Read The Golden Compass and if you really like it, then read The Subtle Knife. But don't bother with The Amber Spyglass. It does not supply a satisfying conclusion to the series and doesn't hold together as a story, but hops from one character and universe to another with no apparent point to several of the plot lines."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good.","review":"The first book was the best of the 3, but you definitely need to read them all in order to get the full picture. The story is a bit confusing at times because of its complexity (in a good way)."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING","review":"This is a very confusing book that does not keep a reader entertained. I have to read this book for school, and i am making myself read this. I usually don't have to do that with books. The book throws names at you and doesn't even explain what it is one bit. I would not reccomend this book for anyone, except a kid with alot of time on his hands."},{"rating":"1","title":"Random Missions and Annoying Prophecy","review":"Not very good. Poor characterization, for one thing.

I ordered and read the books with an open mind. They are very well written and the author has obvious writing talent. My concern is the subtle way that he attempts to put down the church by making it into a big brother image, the changing of scripture which appears to be quoted from the Bible, and the connection of deamons attached to people to the real life use of Spirit Guides (a demonic practice). As an educator, I do not often take a stand that children should not read different types of literature with different values and view points. In the case of the Dark Materials Trilogy, however, I think it is not a set of books that children should read. The title \\"Dark Materials\\" pretty much explains what I mean."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Book for Fifth Graders?","review":"How could this be a book for fifth graders? I have worked with fifth graders and after reading this book, I would have to say that it is NOT for fifth graders. For instance, the book seems to attack authority and especially religion. It also suggests some homosexuality in the book and that it is fine, like a normal way of life, especailly between the two angels, Balthamos and Baurch. In the Bible, homosexuality is not welcomed and is considered a sin. Besides, would you want your child to be homosexual? Then, it suggests that Will and Lyra are more than friends and had a sexual relationship. But Will and Lyra are just children! Would you like your child to have a sexual relationship with another child? I know if I had a child, I would not. I think overall, that it is ok for a child to read this book as far as the fantasy is concerned, but with the issues I mentioned above, if I had a child, I would not let them read this book and I would find it a disgrace if they did."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of time","review":"Yuck.

I didn't see how he was going to wrap it up in one more book.Neither did he I guess. The Amber Spyglass was a mess. Hairbombs? Eve's temptation turning out to be an adolescent crush? (My mom and dad don't get it, but that Will is pretty kewl after all.) And maybe Mrs. Coulter wasn't really so bad. He didn't know WHERE to take it.I'm really disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad, but not great either","review":"While the book definitely had some enjoyable elements, I didn't feel it was as \\"epic\\" or \\"grand\\" as it was built up to be. I felt the author does beat you over the head a little with his distaste for organized religion and a couple of the characters aren't consistently written through each of the books.It was enjoyable enough, but definitely not a \\"desert island\\" book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really enjoyable, but pity the editors think americans are stupid","review":"To start with, I thoroughly enjoyed this series. It was imaginative, interesting and hard to put down. I do however resent how the publishers in the United states think that people are so stupid as to not publish the book as it was originally written. At the time I purchased the book I was not aware of this, next time I would try and find a proper version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Science or Religion?","review":"We read these books to learn for ourselves why they stirred up so much conflict. Never people to just accept what others are saying about the Church, or to believe everything that's taught, we are thinking and reasoning believers in God. These stories, while definately fiction, have great moral lessons. In the end, you're left to decide for yourself who's the good guy and who's the bad. And if you are like us in questioning those who expect unreasoning obedience, these will pique your intellect. These stories definately demonstrate that absolute power corrupts absolutely, even when \\"they\\" believe they're doing the right thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"His Dark Materials Omnibus","review":"I enjoyed the move of the first book so much that I bought the book series.

Knowing that I would not see a 2nd or 3rd movie made in this series, I had to read the book. It's quite good. Interesting source of fantasy and thought that has not been explored in this fashion. While I did find some holes towards the end of the Golden Compass book that left me wanting, I look forward to continued reading and finding those gaps filled by the next two books. Great book for teenagers and young adults (of all ages), but a little harsh for young children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Happy","review":"I checked out this series from the public library and wanted a set for myself, but I decided instead to buy the set for my daughter for Christmas.

The first book caught me up in Lyra's world immediately, she is a great character. And ultimately, that's became my problem with these books. Some of the other characters are not as well drawn, especially Lyra's parents. I never felt her parents were completely believable parts of Lyra's story. They seemed to belong to some place other than Lyra's world, and maybe the writer should have left them there.Pullman has created a very special world(s), and for that i thank him for the introduction."},{"rating":"1","title":"ShoeshineBoy","review":"I thought this series was wonderful...until I got to the end and was so thoroughly disappointed I would not recommend it to anyone.

I would definitely recommend it to adults who are willing to look at traditional religious stories from a new perspective."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great series","review":"Pullman's books really pull you head first into the story and get you wanting more.

While it is well written it is inappropriate for anyone under 16. Would you let your 9 year old read Stephen King's Salem Lot? If the answer is no, then don't let them read this. The book is about a girl investigating the disappearance of some friends. She discovers that her parents are involved in the kidnap, torture and murder of school age children."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've tried repeatedly to read this book","review":"Until tonight, I was insulated completely from the whole debate on religion, so that hasn't been a factor (I'm woefully deficient in reading Hollywood gossip and watching sensationalist news programs, it seems). I bought the first book at least 4 years ago and have made at least 3 attempts at reading it, most recently after moving and finding the thing in a box. It's just no good--I can't manage to hack through it. The prose is thick and the plot so well-hidden I haven't managed yet to discern what the book is supposed to be about or which direction it's heading. I'm 40-some, childless, and a big fan of Tolkien, Asimov, Clarke, CJ Cherryh, Frank Herbert, Anne McCaffrey, Ursula K. LeGuin, Piers Anthony, Poul Anderson, etc. etc. so I've read a fair few SF/Fantasy works.

The message of this series is so odd and dark I felt like I wasted not only my money buying the books, but more importantly, my time reading them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wanders and not meant for children","review":"These three books start out well, the writing is interesting and the characters well developed. Then it gets thicker, and as I read into the third book, I was sure these books are not something I would recommend for children at all. in fact the minimum age for these is probably the teen years. There is a lot of frankly anti-religious boilerplate going on here. Whole portions of the third book I felt were rants about religion and the authors personal take on it. Not any religion in particular. God is old, useless and has been supplanted by another being who has only the worst in mind, and this is the resolution. I would want my children to read something that won't capitulate them into the hopelessness that permeates the outlook here. There is so much excellent literature, \\"Harry Potter\\" included, that is so much fresher, better written and lacking venomous screeds."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fantasy Thriler With a LIfe Lesson Twist","review":"When I first started this triology I was blown away with the authors ability to trasfer us to a world so much like ours and yet in some ways entirely different. As the triloy progressed and I learned more about the characters and the twisted lives they live it started to make me think how someone can overcome an obstical with such completeness that she can save the world; or in fact all the worlds. Throughout the books you not only see the plot unfold between your very eyes but you also have the chance to see the two main characters, Lyra and Will, grow up. The way the author presents the theroy of different worlds not only makes you think that we may not be alone but it also leaves you with a sense that we are all connecteted. I recomend this trilogy to anyone who likes fantasy and who isn't afraid of something new, and different."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought Provoking Fantasy Adventure","review":"After buying and loving the Golden Compass DVD we heard from a friend there were a trilogy of books, so we went to Amazon and found this nice set.

This would have been a MUCH better book if wasent so anti-religous. I'm copletely fine with Mr. Pullman belifes, but you don't see me criticizing his belifes, so why is he criticizing christains! In september I will have a nice or nephew, I Will do all that's in my power to keep them from reading these books.

So many people had written rave reviews; I thought I'd really enjoy the series. Instead, I got a rambling mess, with overtones of Piers Anthony's Incarnations of Immortality series, Richard Adams' Shardik, Lord of the Flies, folklore, Stephen Jay Gould, Stephen Hawking, and every sub-par parallel worlds episode that Star Trek ever made. The characters aren't consistent from one book to the next. Plotlines are abandoned without a trace. And the writing is dull and unevocative. I'll give it two stars for a few interesting ideas and the fact that I managed to get through it, but I certainbly wouldn't recommend this to anyone.

The second book isn't great, but the middle book of a trilogy never is. The third book, however, made me so angry at the time I wasted reading the others. It was not some \\"anti-religious\\" aspect that made me angry- it was poor writing, creating a whole useless world in the last book and then making the major conflict resolution at the end weak and pointless. The \\"anti-religious\\" controversy was probably trumped up to boost sales; it barely figures into the meandering conclusion.

God, spirit, soul, matter. He's got some nice ideas and makes a decent effort to explore and develop them, but in the end it's lacking in credibility. I mean, a story's got to posess an inner credibility, an inner logic. Here, Pullman's story has too many flaws. Reading the pages, I give up trying to believe in his universe(s) and the last book became purely a \\"make it through\\"-run. But OK - apart from serious faults in fundamentals, Mr. Pullman has a good command over language and scenery. He writes well, and has a nice imagination. I'll give him that. Some reflecting on the art of storytelling, and Pullman will be a winner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great start to the trilogy but poor finish","review":"I won't place any spoilers here but I was greatly disappointed by the trilogy. While I found \\"The Golden Compass\\" endearing and intriguing, I was let down by \\"The Subtle Knife\\" and \\"The Amber Spyglass.\\" Especially \\"The Amber Spyglass.\\" I felt like Pullman was neglecting the story in order to put forth his own religous and political views. Many times the characters and/or story is contrived in order to further Pullman's agenda. I also was disappointed in the many issues left unresolved. It's unfortunate because it's an interesting premise and the characters (especially initially) are well drawn and captivating. I found myself really caring about them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less than the sum of its parts","review":"I was intrigued by His Dark Materials, which I'd heard touted as something of an anti-Narnia.

I prefer Narnia."},{"rating":"1","title":"unconvincing","review":"This trilogy starts off very well. The problem is the completely unconvincing ending. For one thing, the most interesting character suddenly has a change of heart with little motivation.

I was looking forward to reading The Golden Compass, only to be completely disapointed within a few pages of starting it. I found it to be almost disturbing in its weirdness, and I honestly do not know a child, even an older well-read child, that would be able to read these books without confusion and with a genuine interest in finishing the trilogy. I managed to finish the first book, but had no interest in pursuing the trilogy further, and I was honestly left with a bad vibe from having read The Golden Compass. After reading the comments from the author about his purpose for writing the book, I can understand why I do not like it.

However the second book, seemed to muddle the difference between good vs. evil, and left me feeling disappointed and uneasy. I was unable to complete the third book. It became clear that Mr. Pullman was expressing extremely anti-religious beliefs. The book simply contained too much blasphemy for me to continue. This book is definitly not appropriate for children.

The worst mistake a fantasy author can make is to insult millions of people by using terms from real-world faiths."},{"rating":"1","title":"Narnia preferable","review":"Phillip Pullman has unfortunately expressed a bias against the Christianity of Lewis' Narnia works, believing the Christian message is somehow inferior and bigoted, compared presumably with his works. Pullman's efforts lack the depth of meaning found within the Narnia works deprived of such resplendent base, leading to unfortunate ramblings without similar quality of meaning. Less inspired than Narnia, that lack in the Pullman works leaves them unfortunately wanting."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT FOR CHILDREN","review":"When my children were younger, I would pre-read books before giving them. I was entranced by the golden compass - and then I read the next book and was horrified. These books are not for children! I don't mind if people want to air their anti-Christian, anti-any religion views in adult books but THEY SHOULD NOT BE TRYING TO SELL THEIR VIEWS TO CHILDREN. That is just sick. Besides, the second book stunk. Hopefully, the movie sanitized the anti-Christian views."},{"rating":"1","title":"Travesty","review":"This book is a travesty. I had to throw it in the trash it was so offensive. It is about two children who are to begin the world and the Garden of Eden all over again, led by fallen angels and intent on killing \\"god\\" as he is depicted as a tyrant in the book. The Golden Compass, which is now a movie, is about the church being an evil bureaucracy and tearing the souls away from children. This book is marketed as a children's book, but is much too dark, and should not be ready by children. Actually, it should not be read by anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Atheist Propaganda","review":"Phillip Pullman is a proud athiest who hates C. S. Lewis' Chronicles of Narnia and has wrtten this trilogy to show the other side. The first is the least offensive of the three books and is the basis for the movie coming out in December. These books are an attempt to indoctrinate children into anti-Christian beliefs. The movie removes the offensive material from the first book so that the Christian community will blindly take their children to see it, and later let the children start reading the series. However, each book gets worse regarding Pullman's hatred of God. Knowing this, read the book is this interests you. I posted this to counter Pullman's deceptive tactics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not For Anyne but Especially Not For Children","review":"The sexual content in this book is too heavy for the age group it is advertised for, also the atheistic pull is appalling.

I don't believe that reading this story will yank any \\"faithful believers\\" away from their roots. I don't believe it will cause anyone to question their faith as a result of reading it, either. I would not recommend a child younger than 13 attempt the series- because there are some mature situations involving adultery, graphic violence, and subtle reference to sexuality.

I will say though that I don't think it would necessarily be traumatic for a younger child to read this series, I have heard of a number of children in the 8 yr old age group that love having this trilogy read to them.For my husband and I, as we are avid fantasy/sci readers, it was a fantastic read that we both enjoyed enormously. Children and adults alike would love these books. Very well written, exciting, original, and - as if the first three weren't enough - it manages to effortlessly, in the most non-contrived, non preachy way, offer up a world of philosophical ideas to grapple with.A truly wonderful read, definitely part of our relatively recent \\"Golden Age\\" of fantasy/sci fi literature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent Book 1 and 2 and bad Book 3","review":"Book 1 and 2 are very good read but the writer loses focus and his confidence by the time he reaches the 3rd. A timid end and a climax that takes place long before you reach the last page. Most seriously he is not able to maintain his reader's suspension of disbelief - which I think is a major infraction on the writer's ability particularly those who're treading on this genre. The only character(s) that stands out and in fact leaps from the pages of the book is Mrs. Coulter and her daemon the Golden Monkey. The heroine Lyra pales in comparison to her Mommy and her daemon.But overall, this series cannot be missed; you can't do without it if you are a fan of this genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining and suspenseful","review":"A rare gem in the science fiction/fantasy genre, this series has a female heroine, Lyra. We follow Lyra throughout the series as she encounters intense mysteries and drama. Although this is a fantasy book series, it is superbly written and is excellent in making the reader become so engrossed that they nearly forget where they are.I would use these books with high school, reluctant reader girls, since it's an excellent story about a girl who saves the world. They would learn from this book that girls are also craft, witty, and brilliant. Another group that I would recommend this series to are advanced high school readers as I believe these books have direct references to Paradise Lost and also make general remarks on religion. In fact by the final book, your idea of religion is completely obscured. I think it would be interesting for them to do a compare/contrast with Paradise lost of perhaps how the series develops a theme of religion."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Raves are Justified","review":"This trilogy ranks right up there with Dune and Lord of the Rings.

It just went too far for me and I wish I'd know that this is what the trilogy was about before I started it.

When you finish the series, you will probably imagine what it would be if you had a daemon. The plot is amazing, and the words are very emotional at the end.

I've already wasted enough time READING this drivel. The books, (far too densely written for the target audience), actually begin with much promise and a host of very original fantasy ideas and settings. Unfortunately, Mr. Pullman than quickly decends into an over-populated, over-complicated, over-preachy philosophical rant that continues through most of the second and ALL of the third book and which utterly consumes what little remains of a coherent plot. I have nothing against the author's personal opinions, but they get in the way of what really could have been a great series. His characters change personalities on a whim, act with no clear motivation, pursue nonsensical goals, and die meaningless deaths, only to arrive at a disappointing and anti-climatic ending that left me wishing I'd never picked up the first book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waver in the wrong direction!","review":"I read through the first book without a worry!

A modern fantasy in the best of those words, not with the almost childish fantasies of the normal Disney-esque children fantasies, nor with the spank-you-over-the-head moral teachings of dogmatic institutions, this is humanity at its best. There's a reason this trilogy is so wildly popular in dozens of countries, and it's a tragic shame that the U.S.A. is so behind and repellant to its message. Say no to kingdoms everywhere.

I myself am a Christian and bought the omnibus of this series not knowing what it was about. *SPOILER ALERT* it's about trying to kill GOD, get this, GOD with a knife. Not only is this blasphemous and offensive but it's the entire premise is ludicrous. I do not throw away literature by virtue for the most part, and I mean hardly ever, but I threw this book away.

I thought it would be a nice collection of connected short stories, but it is so much more than that. The stories work more like a novel than a collection and Cronin has done marvelous things with these stories. They follow two people, O'Neil, who is nineteen when we first meet him, and Mary, the woman he eventually marries. Each story us about an emotionally pivotal experience that has ramifications for the rest of their lives, ramifications which surface in each of the following stories. The stories are wonderfully written and affecting. Each story could have been the springboard for a fully developed novel. Cronin fits so much in these stories in a terrifically effortless and smooth manner. I highly recommend this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth every cent in hardback","review":"I bought this book based Washington Post book review (something I've never done before) and it was worth every penny--even in hardback!You will recognize the characters in this book--they are Every-people. The first three stories are especially good, especially if you like a writer who shows rather than tells. He has captured the fine details of living with such precision; I admire his skill. As a critique, the middle story and the last story seemed like a bit of missed opportunity but don't let that scare you away. If nothing else buy it to see how this man captures the essence of childbirth--WOW!

The first book of his I read, \\"The Summer Guest,\\" moved me deeply. He writes in prose that dances across the page, offering luminous and often breathtaking sentences. His understanding of the human heart seems well beyond his years. Now I've read this work and know he's a writer who seems to write for me. His epiphanies come in surprisingly subtle ways, like jewels just discovered. I am not going to summarize any of the book because others have done it better than I can. All I can say is get any of his books and settle in for a journey that's full of life as we live it, and full of what makes life meaningful. He stands beside some of the wonderful discoveries I've made in my reading life, the ones who still awe me with their writing and understanding: Herman Hesse, J.D. Salinger, Kurt Vonnegut, Saul Bellow, Tolkien, and John Updike's short stories. Yes, I think he's that good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I wasn't able to finish this book.

Just look at the juxtaposition of Rachel Ashwell of Shabby Chic alongside Beth Siqueland-Gresch owner of a floral design shop. Ashwell started her business by repainting garage sale finds and is now a millionairess, and Gresch does a modest business and her words are, \\"This kind of business will never make me wealthy.

The tone is sort of a high pitched 'bluaang bluanng' and the tone occuring after the beater hits sounds similar to the sound of a basketball after it bounces up from the court. Maybe this drum is supposed to sound this way, it is my first shaman drum, but even so, I get no enjoyment or other benefit from the sound of this drum. It has an airish high tone to it, not anything like a more deeper strong tone. I own other drums (Udu, Bongos, Tabla, Djembe) and I like those, it's just this one I don't like. My advice is spend a little extra to a buy a 16\\" or 22\\" Remo buffalo drum, which by the way, I dont own that so I have not tried it, but a bigger drum will have a deeper tone I would find more appealing for the shaman drum sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous drum!","review":"It's little, it's cute, it's easy to carry and it is full of great sound and good energy.

While some of Tim's 80's work while great now feels somewhat dated by some of the instrumentation of the time I think that this release captures the feel of the time without the cheese.

I wanted to make sure that MyBooks (and the entire company, for that matter) will still exist in a year.There is nothing worse than investing time and money into learning a program only to find that it is no longer supported.

We, the viewers, hardly get to see Jack in action and when we do, he manifests himself as a poorly-done computer-generated snowman. I must admit, the paper mache costume in Jack Frost was infinitely better than this digital creation. I also wasn't a fan of the medium used in the filming of Jack Frost 2. Whereas Jack Frost 1 used real film as a medium, the use of video cameras in the sequel gave more of a feel of a soap opera than a horror movie. I also missed Jack's sharp-tongued one-liners that were so wonderfully prevalent in the first movie. All in all, Jack Frost 2: Revenge of the Mutant Killer snowman was one of the biggest cinematic disappointments I have seen. It had such potential. My advice, immediately buy the original Jack Frost and pray that if there is a 3rd edition to the Jack Frost series, it will stay true to the form of the original."},{"rating":"1","title":"so bad it's just bad","review":"No one loves horrible horror movies more than me , but this wasnt even one of those..it was terrible.

Well, that is speculative with globalism. Those jobs may be outsourced. Most are low paying. Many of my highly qualified friends are unable to find jobs despite retraining. Yes, there may be Wal-Mart jobs but is this your retirement dream? The work chapter sounds a lot like most \\"Do what you love\\" books.

About 5 minutes later when I reached my house I thought to myself \\"maybe it was just the first CD, the second one has to be better\\" but it wasn't. I love most of Sasha's work, don't get me wrong, but these CDs were nothing but repetition over and over with the slightest changes cutting in and out bass lines and mid tones and of course digital samples thrown in every once in a while. I'll give you some advice, listen to the 30 second samples on Amazon and imagine them repeating for 6 minutes and you will have each song in its entirity."},{"rating":"1","title":"whatever...","review":"Geez... I got suckered into this one.Relatively inexpensive way to make the mistake thou.Not what I had hoped... maybe my idea of unbelievable trance sets must be different to the others here. Not a patch on Gatecrasher Black -The Late set.

A friend of mine knows how much I love d.j.'s Phil B. and Neil Lewis and thought I might like this. Well, I should have that friend reimburse me the money that I paid for this boring trance disc. This disc is good if you have lost your pulse. I expect a d.j. compilation to take me on a little journey, not put me to sleep. I will stick to my \\"Music For The Clubs\\" disc by Phil B. and \\"Circuit Grooves, vol. 9.1\\" by Matt Consola for real, fun, trancey dance music."},{"rating":"2","title":"That Sasha CD Sound","review":"I have noticed what seems to be a trend in Sasha's newer CDs. That is, most of the original tracks have faster tempos than he records them at. But, they dont sound pitched way down - I assume they are put thru a pitch-shifting alg like I have in my sampler. It's not bad most of the time, but it can be bad - compare the original on the Light 'Expand the Room' on Expeditions. In any event all these newer CDs - Expeditions, SF, Ibiza, have a distinct pitch-shifted sound. I dont want to mess with anybodys trip, but it is a different sound. When Renaissance/NE first came out the tracks were around 124/128 (bpm) and the CDs were recorded around that tempo. Why are Sash's new CDs stuck at 130 when the rest of the trance world (his track selection) is @ 135? When I saw him at Twilo last it didn't sound funny. People would still buy these CDs, they just wouldn't be quite so palatable for newbies. His stuff is so subtle anyway. Anyone else?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as San Francisco","review":"Yet its still original mixes from none other than the lord of trance SASHA. Cd1 is very slow, I didn't like it much. But Cd2 is where Sasha does his magic. I was about to give it 3 stars if he hadn't included a nearly 10 minute version of Xpander which is I think the number 1 music track from Sasha. Go pick this one up if you already got the San Francisco one. I can't wait for the next Global Underground Series from Sasha"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best CD ever","review":"I've never heard anything so good! I didnt know music could be so enjoyable. A lot of the time I'll just lay there for an afternoon off just listening."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliance","review":"This CD compilation is remarkable in its ability to capture so many moods at once. Everyone here has already said it all, if you don't own this CD then there is no excuse for not buying it as soon as possible. Check especially the transition Sasha makes mid-way through CD1. He's spent the first five tracks layering up some beautifully ethereal trance, culminating in Sander's \\"My Lexicon\\". Every time I hear this track the only thing I can think of is running around in summer rain, one of those timelessly happy moments. Yet once Sasha hints at the fade into Orbital's \\"Nothing Left\\", you quickly get a picture of the brooding storm on the horizon. The two tracks work so perfectly next to each other that it's scary how seamlessly your mood will transition, only and always for the better as Sasha rides the storm out for the rest of this great compilation mix."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surviving The Test of Time","review":"The release date of this popular Global Underground release was 1999. This is right around the time when progressive house and progressive trance genres really started to come into their own. Very fitting that this compilation was modeled after a set performed in the Meca of all electronica venues...Ibiza. It was very \\"cutting-edge\\" for the release date and includes Sasha's very own Xpander on disc 2.Due to electronica's ever-evolving sound, it is hard to find compilations that don't get tiresome after a few years. In my opinion, Global Underground 013:Ibiza is one of these gems. Disc 1 is one of my personal favorites under the Global Underground label. Eight years later and I never tire of it.Disc 2 is a little more outdated. I don't like the track selection as much, and have a hard time listening to the whole disc in one sitting. Still enjoyable though.Disc 1 get 5/5 stars and disc 2 4/5 stars.This compilation is worth possessing for disc 1 alone."},{"rating":"2","title":"once upon a time...","review":"there were this cd I was keeping playing all the time..so much I had to discover the rest of the catalogue and sice then, my life (and my hifi stereo) is much better! a MUST have for easy emotional techno lovers...like me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Come and get It !","review":"It contains some great power flowing beats & tunes.

Disc 1 is deep, dark, moody and sexy - Disc 2 is a little harder and trippier. Both discs showcase Sasha's prodigious mixing skills and spot-on track selections. If you liked Sasha's GU in San Fran disc, or any of the Northern Exposure stuff, you should buy this CD. I bought this as an import during December and haven't stopped listening to it since. Yummy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"bullseye","review":"what else can i say but AMAZING! i had such high hope for this set after drooling over sasha's global underground san fran set for the last year, and this ibiza set definitely lives up to the hype. proving once again why he's been voted the #1 dj in the world, sasha shifts gears from his northern exposure style and takes you on a voyage of twists and turns that range from dark house (mre's \\"the deep edge\\") to big beat (bt's \\"fibonacci sequence\\") to heavy trance (orbital's \\"nothing left\\" - breeder remix). this set may disappoint those expecting another huge set of epic trance from the master, but it's great to hear sasha mixing it up and keeping his style fresh. other highlights include space manouevers' \\"stage one\\" (pariah remix) and cass & slide's \\"perception\\". a must for anyone wanting to keep pace with the future of trance, and fans of dave ralph's \\"tranceport II\\" should definitely check this one out."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best GU albums","review":"Sasha is smooth, tight, and consistently high quality. This is one of the best of the GU albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply brilliant","review":"This album putting it lightly is simply brilliant. It contains deep proggessive mixes that are those moving kindof songs. These songs are songs you can chill out to or dance or drive to. It's so good because it hardly lets you down at all, and it seems like it's on a much more mature level of trance than Oakenfold or even Digweed. It's smart classy and yes intellegent. I highly suggest that you get this album. I bought it about 4 days ago and it was well worth the 17 pounds that i bought it for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous recipes, friends, and fun!","review":"I love the recipes!

I kept at it and then it picked up or to be trite \\"the plot thickened.\\" Reading a bit more, the author started throwing in mini \\"sermons.\\" I did not realize this was a \\"christian\\" book when I bought it. The \\"sermonizing\\" detracts from the story quite a bit. Basically, the story has the potential to be a great mystery/adventure/romance story if the author would clean up the \\"sermonizing\\" and fine-tune the editing. I was surprised that when a plane was flying from Hawaii to the mainland, the author referred to it as \\"transatlantic.\\" My geography may be a bit rusty but if part of the trip was transatlantic that plane went way out of the way! If you like christian fiction, mystery and romantic literature then this might be a good read for you. For me, I'll read the reviews a bit closer before I buy books in the future and I won't buy any more by this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazon needs to create a special catagory called \\"Christian Books\\"","review":"OK.....let's start....if I wanted to read a book that mentions God and Jesus on almost every page, I would have gone to a Christian Book Store.

I skipped from the first third to the second third and then to the end....while the plot is an interesting concept, again the Christian references ruined the story for me. Lone person out....one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good dialogue, but protracted","review":"I pretty much enjoyed this book all the way through. The relationship between the two main characters is well-done, and their conversation is often fairly witty. I was going to give this three stars because, as another reviewer said, it did need editing, It would tell one story (amnesia, being forced onto a plane at gunpoint) and then slack off to describe the emptiness of the Hollywood life, etc. Then the plot would pick up again. It didn't really seem tied together. She did a slapdash job of making the villian seem human, so much so that it might have been better if he was just fully evil. But it held my attention.Then, somewhere in the last half of the book, they misspelled Jane Austen's name. (That's right. I-N.) I paid for this book and I expected a professional job. Especially from Bethany House. It not only took me out of the story, it made me think that if a (paid) copy editor couldn't be bothered to read this thoroughly, why should I?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow at first, but then hooks you with a bang!","review":"When I first began to read this book, the chapters seemed to drag on. However, when I got to about chapter 7 or so, it really started to pick up! I could NOT put it down. Jade/Gentry is an admirable character because of how she cares for everyone (excluding Cameron, because it takes a while for her to fully develop her trust/relationship with him). She is an in-depth character and I admired her faithfulness in God throughout the novel. It's suspenseful, entertaining, and a page turner once you hit the middle. Pay for it! I promise that you won't be sorry :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"great","review":"Great book and story line. Love the author!

Unfortunately, the reader had to plod through various points of view while the multitude of protagonists and antagonists rationalized every decision and action. If you enjoy soap operas, this book is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worldly book for believers","review":"I have to wonder who this book was written for. I doubt that a secular audience would tolerate the focus on the spiritual development of the characters. And I would hope that many Christians would have a problem with the moral standards of the book. The attraction between the main characters is mostly animal, from beginning to end. The plot, while twisty and well executed, is pure soap opera with all the ugliness of daytime TV. So, if you are not a devoted believer in Christ, you might be warned: some of the resolution in this book involves repentance and characters coming to trust God more fully. Believers, if you want wholehearted purity, you will not find it here. I guess if you are used to TV standards it probably seems tame. But I would sure hate for my teens to think that it is okay to spend the night with the person you are dating, or tell them you want to have sex with them, etc. I am sorry to have read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cartersville Girl Does Awesome!!","review":"Carolyn Evans is awesome!

The writing is extremely constricted and factual, but that in itself is an incredible glimpse into the mindset that anorexia can create (and that can cause someone to become anorexic). I'd definitely recommend this book to someone interested in the topic. The negatives: it's a very short read and it's quite depressing. Although I don't think it's very insightful, it does make a unique contribution to the literature because it deals with anorexia in men."},{"rating":"2","title":"Straight Facts, Few Answers","review":"I intend absolutely no criticism of the author when I say that this book provides the reader with few if any answers as to the source of male anorexia or effective treatment. Krasnow presents the basic facts with a clear, straightforward delivery that asks no pity and promises no redemption. Indeed, as other reviewers have noted, we mourn Krasnow as one of anorexia's ultimate victims. Still, although family, friends, or the men who are struggling with anorexia or bulimia will sympathize with this account, they will have to pose any questions elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of Complaining--Little Insight","review":"This book, although a rare example of a man with an eating disorder, is very disappointing. I was hoping for some unique perspective on eating disorders, but instead found little more than a daily food log.

It uses a uniques approach that I have been trying to find for years. You'll find it unique, and wonder why no one knows about it. You may even want to start with the author's \\"Remembering the Hiragan\\" [ISBN# 0-87040-765-1] companion for the text. I've got both. Buy the Hiragana first because the Katana relies on the Hiragana text for its explanations. Both texts are done very well, small books that get straight to the point of helping you learn what you need, and not just memorizing tables of alphabets. Actually, you won't need to memorize any table for either of the books. It's simple, short, straight forward, and actually fun to use these two books"},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent way to master katakana","review":"Actually, it is Heisig who deserves more of the praise for this book since he was the one who wrote Remembering the Hiragana, which this book is based on. In University, I had used that book, but this book was not available yet. I breezed through learning the hiragana, and stumbled with the katakana until this book was released.

I have read all three of Dr. Maier's historical fiction (one being an historical fiction / mystery) and can say that few authors have such a command of subject matter -historical, religion, science, etc. - to write works of such quality. One can say, without qualification, that the research is not superficial. His writing style is magnificent. This book, and the others, are truly \\"hard to put down.\\" I read all three within two weeks and only regret that there are not more available.

It was one of those stories, that I couldn't put down. Once again, Jim had to cook dinner! I found it to be a great read and I will be reading more of his work.I would recommend this novel to anyone who likes to read about biblical history and the Roman civilization.

His work is essentially a character sketch of Pontius Pilate that paints a clear picture of the time of Christ from a Roman point of view. His detailing of the politics of Rome and their relationship to Judea as well as the politics of Judea and their relationship to Rome was outstanding. Maier's writing still sounds a little much like a professor rather than a novelist (hence the 4 stars instead of 5), but for me the engrossing way in which the events unfold more than made up for the lack of powerful writing. Ultimately, this was a book I just couldn't put down--even though I was essentially learning world history from cover to cover."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book - Great Guide to Avoiding Scams","review":"This book should be required reading for anyone who has responsibility for elderly people, children or vulnerable adults.The authors could have put this book forward as a general guide to fraud prevention; most of the schemes listed are used against other groups as well as the elderly (e.g. Nigerian Advance Payment frauds - this fraud relies on greed).The chapter on Internet dating is as applicable to teenagers as it is to the elderly.Two negatives; the book does not explain how to convey the information without inducing excessive fear (if you have someone who is vulnerable you may want to think how you convey the message); and, as with any book of this type, the information could be misused.Great book - forewarned is forearmed.

Conflicting instructions on the CD, Manual and web-site (that's 3 sets of instructions) make it worse. After installing, it caused a shut-down error (two times) that required a system restore to fix. The IP address may or may not have to be entered manually at which point it overrides the wired network IP address which then has to be \\"repaired\\" in order to connect again.

They tried to sell me a more expensive router at an inflated price, and several calls only taught me they are clueless about their own products.

Walker Tom Monteith is like a wild animal -- beautiful, but dangerous.

The characters and plot line kept me reading long past bedtime."},{"rating":"1","title":"Intermittent reception","review":"I have not been impressed with the reception of this radio. As another reviewer stated, the antenna seems to be the wire of the earbuds. For me, this causes radio stations to have a rythmic swish of loud static as the cord swings while I run. I've tried putting the cord under my shirt, which stops the rhythm of the static, however, there is still a lot of static at times. It seems to be related to which cardinal direction I am facing and how the radio is oriented on my shorts. Last, the radio will sometimes just seem to lose a station... not matter how finely I turn the little dial, I simply can't get it to come in clearly. And for me, reception indoors is simply awful. All in all, it's highly annoying and I would gladly pay triple what this radio costs for one that could lock onto a station clearly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Schaum's misses boat","review":"Wow!!!

By the way, I strongly urge you to use the Authorized King James Version. Though some words are old, the use of a dictionary can bring new meaning to the words. Additionally, some of the newer translations leave out important words, i.e. \\"Blood\\" in Col. 1:14. In the Manuscripts, the word Blood (haima) is there but for whatever reason the translators conveniently chose to leave that out.

Simon Boswell combines the hunt for a spiralling out of control serial killer with the gradual unvieling of the musical life of the great Finnish composer, Sibelius.The plot is a cleverly intertwined production with escalating violence and a frantic pace.

I really enjoyed the entirely plausible \\"red herrings\\" the author tossed in and the way he anticipated the reader's (my) confusion in the persons of his inspectors. And he kept my in suspense about the identity of the murderer to the end. What piqued my interested initially and what kept me going was my passion for the music of Sibelius. The many references to the composer and his life, as well as the series of lectures being given throughout the mystery by the inspector's father, is a brilliant plot device. And, may I say, not too much for the casual reader or too little for the music lover.

It seems 30+ years later that they all needed each other to suceed.Considering they only do about 30 shows a year Robby & Ray are not cashing in on the legacy, no one can replace Jim, but Ian has been around for about 20 yrs & hold up everything well, without ripping off Jim too much but what do you expect from anyone who steps into Jim Morrison's shoes??"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great songs","review":"Fantastic songs .What's wrong with a tribute band ?I saw Randy Hansen playing Hendrix , The Machine playing Pink Floyd,The Muffin Man doing Zappa , and had a fantastic time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Astbury was a wise choice","review":"Okay, I'm coming at this DVD as a Cult fan. Although the Doors are, without a doubt, a seminal hard rock band; not really a big fan. I think, though, that if they had gone with Scott Stapp instead of Astbury, this performance wouldn't have been as strong. Ian brings the credibility of an undeniable front man to the band. He probably shouldn't have done his hair like Morrison. No doubt, some exec. suggested he do so. Even so, like previous reviewers noted, he doesn't try to be Morrison. Final song of the DVD is a blast to watch. Fans come on stage and dance and strip with the band. If you are a Ian Astbury fan, pick up a copy!

The story line lacks the originality and insight into character of her other work, especially The Deep End of the Ocean and The Most Wanted, and to that extent, it didn't live up to expectations. It's pretty much a standard love the second time round story, except that the protagonist is a good bit older than the new love, resulting in too predictable rocky steps on the relationship pathway. Its strengths if it has any, are more in the secondary character cameos than in the main cast, especially in some members of the lover's Southern family and how they are perceived by the Cape Cod Northerners. Not nearly as engaging of the reader as Mitchard's earlier books, not quite formula driven but at times perilously close. A pleasant but forgettable read is probably a reasonable assessment.

Almost every line of French has a mistake in it (She can't even spell simple phrases like \\"Comment vas-tu?\\" correctly), almost every ballet step is misspelled (\\"chine\\" turns for \\"chaine\\" turns), and, perhaps worst of all for a novel supposedly set in Massachusetts, she uses the phrase \\"in Cape Cod,\\" which a Cape Codder would never use; it's \\"on Cape Cod\\"!Aside from the mistakes, the book is slow going and descends midway to the level of soap opera. Don't waste your time on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"This book is one step above pulp fiction. I finished it but only to find out what happened, not because the characters were emotionally compelling. They are a bore and really immature tedious adults. There are endless conversations in which nothing very important or interesting is said. The plot is similar to a Harlequin romance: rich woman meets sexy man, they marry, they have some arguments, the \\"villain\\" prevents them sorting out their differences and misunderstandings, they find out about the villain's part in keeping them apart, they make up and live happily ever after...."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe I read the whole thing!!!","review":"A major disappointment from a favorite author. I am not going to repeat what other reviewers have said already. I was very surprised and disturbed at the ethnic slur in the post 9/11 discussion. Slow moving, irritating characters. It was hard to believe that True was a highly successful businesswoman judging by the way she handled her personal life. Borrow it if you must read it----not worth buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"crude and disappointing","review":"Disappointing, and I'm being kind. And long, good lord is this book long. FIVE HUNDRED PAGES. Which wouldn't be a problem if it were a better story. No, correct that, if this was a story worth reading. For starters, I wanted to slap the so-called heroine. The reader is supposed to connect with the heroine, not cheer for her to get knocked off. Essentially this s a story about overbearing and unlikable people with obnoxious habits. It is also crude in a working class sort of way where sex is treated as something filthy, children body parts are described in painstaking order and urination is given more than its due."},{"rating":"1","title":"A whole bunch of self-absorbed, exhausting characters","review":"I plowed through this book. Several times I wondered if these characters EVER just stopped talking-mostly the women. The self-absorption and over-analysis of everything was exhausting. Was there even one likeable or believable woman in this story? I wanted to tell Hank to run!"},{"rating":"1","title":"2.5 stars","review":"really wanted to like this book: on her 43rd birthday, True is out celebrating with friends when she meets a younger man and falls in love.It was a good idea, but it failed for several reasons: these two (True & Hank) don't say what they mean and don't mean what they say. Most of the book was them fighting and not getting along because of their darn pride! Frustrating.The other big issue I had with this book is the overly long chapters and overall length of the book, 500 pages, about 200 pages too long. There are a lot of little side stories that are unimportant and serve no purpose, just wasting the reader's time.So between the wordiness and overall negative tone of the book, I can't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Quite Blessed","review":"Better than The Most Wanted, not as good as Deep End or A Theory of Relativity. I so want her books to be good, but am again disappointed. Way too many characters (reflective of the author's personal life, I presume) and way too many swear words.I'm not a prude, but I can't share this book with my mother!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm glad its not just me","review":"This had the potential to be a good book, but it took me forever to finish it; I had to actually force myself! It just seemed to go on and on...and on. So much of the manuscript could have been taken out..probably 200 pages. I'm glad it wasn't just me who thoguht this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some parts are quite clever, but it gets old quickly","review":"I bought this book on a whim, having seen an interview with the author on the Today Show when I was on vacation and on the lookout for a light read. There were some nice segments, but on the whole, it seemed somewhat self-indulgent on the author's part. My favorite part was the feeling in the beginning of the book that you were \\"inside their heads\\", but these explanations appeared to grow longer as we became more familiar with the characters rather than the reverse. It was like being with someone who loves the sound of their own voice--you may keep listening, but part of you tunes out.Having labored through the second half, with little additional (or unexpected) development, I wish I had skipped the last 200 pages and just read the last chapter. I didn't even give this one to the resale shop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Book!","review":"My title says it all. This book is awful. The writing is sloppy and too wordy, the characters go from one strange quirk to the next, and the story isn't consistent at all. The minor characters are just that, when they could really add to the story in a meaningful way. I'm nearly finished with the book, I don't care how it ends, and I've quit reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still waiting for the story....","review":"About 170 pages into this book, I still had no idea where the author was attempting to go with the story as she was jumping all over the place and never really laid down a set story line to keep the reader glued. I figured out pretty quickly that is was a story of love, or whatever, between a younger guy/older woman but other then that, I'm not quite sure what to think. Luckily for me, my job allows for passing the time away, and that's really what this book did....so save it for a desperate, rainy day when you really have nothing else you could be doing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Deadly dull","review":"What a horrible book. I am an avid reader and have met very few books I could not finish. I forced myself to give this book 100 pages and I wish I had not. True is the biggest whiner and idiot I've ever had the displeasure to meet in the pages of a book. The book moves at the pace of a snail and is filled with idiotic, half formed characters. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Turned me off...","review":"I am an avid romance reader and found myself \\"tru\\"ly disappointed in this text for many of the reasons already named...in addition to the death blow. As the main character's love interest is a man of color, I was utterly turned off when the love play included the reference to \\"Mandingo\\" and the white slave owner. I wish I could have returned the book for a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mitchard is off-track","review":"The Deep End of the Ocean and The Most Wanted were two of the most creative, and well-written \\"popular\\" books, I have read. The creative process was flowing, and I had the feeling that these characters were so real, that Mitchard, herself, didn't know how the book would end until it was done. I think she was a pioneer in (once more, I'm using quotaion marks) \\"popular\\" literary fiction. A Theory of Relativity was disappointing. All writers, I suspect, have a book that is out-of-sync. However, with Twelve Times Blessed, this indicates a pattern. The characters were uninteresting; the plot pedestrian. Mitchard's narrative is excellent, and she can do this for $$$... All I can add, is I hope Mitchard regains her voice, and does not serve us any more pap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for a summer saga","review":"Don't take this book seriously, just enjoy the ride.The main character is egotistic and the drama is predictable, but admit it, its a beach book.I wish the author had hired an editor - I would have been glad to trim it up a bit, and there are some serious inconsistencies that should have been caught.But really, if you want a fat juicy novel to take to the pool, this is fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Twelve Times Cursed","review":"This book is what you'd get if you inserted a thesaurus into a Mills & Boon novel - an overly long, excessively wordy, sappy romance.The characters are horribly underdeveloped; we know very little about them aside from their romantic foibles and sexual adventures. (And then there were several cases of Too Much Information.)A more positive review quotes \\"'Once again, we readers are blessed with J.M.'s sensuous eye for detail\\". Cursed, would seem more apt.Descriptions of young boys genitalia, the burgeoning of an erection, and several other unnecessary observations mentioned throughout this self-indulgent saga were disappointing.This is not Mitchard's best piece of work. The Deep End of The Ocean and The Most Wanted are exceptional novels; Twelve Times Blessed does not come close."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mitchard Disappoints","review":"I agree with the reader from North Franklin, CT--this book is painful to read. I struggled through the first two chapters only because I was loyal to her book the \\"The Deep End of the Ocean\\". Finally, I couldn't subject myself to any more of \\"Twelve Times Blessed\\" lame \\"movie of the week\\" plot and poorly drawn characters. I was also disappointed in the \\"Theory of Relativity\\", two strikes after Mitchard hit a home-run with \\"The Deep End of the Ocean\\". I discovered \\"Ocean\\" before it became an Oprah read and found the plot to be capitivating and the characters beautifuly written. I hope that Mitchard get out of this \\"slump\\" and rediscovers her true writing roots."},{"rating":"1","title":"good idea that went awry","review":"Nobody -- or no editor -- put the brakes on this thing. Basically, there's too much of everything. Too much repetitive dialogue, too many pages, too much domestic life under a microscope and not enough plot, not enough motivation for characters, and while we're at it, a bit too much cutesy. Mitchard has personally been there done that (marrying a younger man), and it seems the reader is mostly just privvy to 500-plus pages of what that experience is like."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snore","review":"This book was a complete & total waste of my time. I kept reading it hoping that something would happen. It was too long and drawn out and had no action or movement of story whatsoever.I am very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Badly written and poorly edited.","review":"Was this terrible novel written by an imposter? It reads like a very rough draft that was rushed into print with no editing whatsoever. The main character is sharp-tongued and thoroughly unlikable; the plot is melodramatic and predictable. BUT...the editing, or lack of it! In the first few pages there are uncorrected typos and mistakes in subject/verb agreement. Amazingly, there is even a scene in which a few characters are mentioned, then within a few sentences one of the characters mysteriously disappears and morphs into a DIFFERENT character, who was not present in the scene! This book is an insult to the reader's intelligence."},{"rating":"1","title":"No stars really","review":"A huge disappointment. Just about the only thing consistent in this book was the \\"cutesy\\" descriptions of merchandise at the onset of each chapter. The character Hank said it best, things failed when True the woman started behaving like True a girl. To us forty-somethings out here, this character was insulting, and in the real world, could use a swift kick in the . . ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poorly written","review":"The plot isn't worth going into and the writing is poor--clearly no editor took much of a look at it. Some sentences simply don't make sense or adjectives are used to describe something in ways that don't seem to fit. Other times, the storyline isn't coherent--details suddenly change, almost like describing a character wearing a red coat and then two paragraphs later saying the person took off their blue coat. It reads like a book very hastily put together. Glad I got it out of the library-had I paid for it, I would want my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"A True Stinker","review":"I agree with all of the above reviewers; I can't believe I stuck with this book to the end. The characters are shallow and annoying; again, its impossible to see why True is adored by her friends. She is so impossibly stupid, its hard to believe she made it to 43. How did this book get published? I have never read any other books by Mitchard, but I thought her reputation as a writer was good. I would be hard-pressed to ever read another with her name on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A book that will waste your time","review":"Jacquelyn Mitchard's book \\"Twelve Times Blessed\\" had to be by far one of the worst books I have ever read in my life. It had no real plot to it, it jumped around and talked about nothign but sex scenes, which if it doesn't interest you, dont read this book. I thought it was really weird how she slept with a guy she didn't even know, while her son was out in the car, it's kind of gross if you think about it. I did kind of like how i could relate to her and her roomate, as they were best friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"Jacquelyn Mitchard's books are usually excellent. This one is terrible. I agree with most of what the other reviewers who panned this book wrote and will not bother to repeat their on-the-mark comments. One thing that has not been mentioned about this book, however, is Mitchard's incredible hostility toward Christians. Her Christian, homeschooling mother character, Genevra, is truly appalling, telling small children that they are headed to hell, something no Christian I know would dream of doing. She makes other anti-Christian statements in the book, including a paragraph where she accuses God of mistreating Jesus. Has it not occured to Ms. Mitchard that people of many faiths read her books and that quite a few of them would be offended by comments like these? I don't know if I will ever read another of her books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad book goes down the drain","review":"Jacquelyn Mitchard's, Twelve Times Blessed, has to be the book with the most sex involved. It wasnt very interesting and exciting, infact there was sometimes when i had to put the book down out of disgust. The begining did catch my eye, but then it turns into this big sex novel. I would not suggest for anyone to read this book, it would be a waste of your time"},{"rating":"1","title":"A very Disappointing Book","review":"I found this book to be very disappointing. The main characters are too much. Too effortlessly beautiful, rich, sexy, blah, blah, blah. As a reader, I didn't even care for them, much less what happened to them.I am an avid fan of Ms. Mitchard's past work and the weekly newspaper column she writes. She could do much better.I would not recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Twelve Times Blessed","review":"BORING!!! Its hard to believe that this book made the NY Times bestseller list! I kept reading hoping it would get more interesting and it just got worse! Don't waste your money on this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't even bother","review":"I am relieved to see so many negative reviews here, because I hated this book and thought maybe I was missing something or just being unkind. Twelve Times Blessed (love that title!) can only be described as dreadful. An unlikeable, immature, self-sabotaging heroine is paired with an unlikeable, immature, self-sabotaging love interest and surrounded by one-dimensional secondary characters who leave you wondering why on earth they put up with her. I've loved a number of Mitchard's other books; I can't believe this one came from the same pen. If you loved Deep End of the Ocean and want more Mitchard, choose any of her other titles, but leave this one on the shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Twelve Times Blessed","review":"This novel by Jacquelyn Mitchard is very drawn out, boring and has way too many useless details. In \\"Twelve Times Blessed\\" True Dickenson (the main character) is a very succesful business woman,who marries a younger resturant owner. The story is about their lives as they learn to live with each others faults. Theybecome aware of many things they do not know about each otheras they became involved before they knew anything about theirprior lives or families. This book sometimes loses your interestby involving you in the details of people that are not the maininterest of the story. The story needed more detail on True andHank,less on small trivial details of other peoples lives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment from favorite author","review":"I have loved Mitchard's other books-Deep End of the Ocean, Most Wanted and Theory of Relativity. I anxiously awaited this book and was so disappointed. I couldn't get beyond 75 pages, and that was difficult. I gave to my mother as she likes \\"romantic fluff\\" and she got through 100 pages, but couldn't go any further. It seemed like Mitchard was trying to write like a, let's say Marion Keyes-funny, but with a serious topic. I hope Ms. Mitchard goes back to her wonderful dramatic writing as this is not a path for her to go. It was almost a spoof of romance-type books, but not even good enough at that. I found myself rolling my eyes at some of the writing. Then I just couldn't take it anymore. I had the same thought as another reviewer--I can't imagine an editor, friend or anyone reading this book and not being truthful. Let alone a publisher publishing it!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I have enjoyed Mitchard's previous books, and was surprised to find this book did not continue with her earlier promise as an author. I thought the characters were not believable, which makes it difficult to care what happens to them. There simply is no depth to this book. I never quite understood the reasons why True and Hank separated. Their self absorption was wearying at best and the plot was too thin to hold a reader's interest. It was an effort to keep reading it. I do not recommend this book and hope that Ms. Mitchard gets back on track."},{"rating":"2","title":"Historic","review":"An artifact of the exact moment when Maggie Smith grafted her comic personality off of Kenneth Williams' bush, tree - whatever it is. Dated, but witty and enjoyable, particularly for Anglophiles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding introduction","review":"I've read dozens of books on the history of architecture, and this is the best introduction to the subject I've ever encountered, despite the fact that it is now over half a century old. I used this book intensively on a three-month trip to western and eastern Europe some years ago, and it was a great help in appreciating all the many important buildings we encountered, especially the Gothic cathedrals and early Renaissance Italian architecture. As the back cover says, Sir Nicholas is reckoned one of the most stimulating writers on architecture alive, and I would have to agree with that. His great enthusiasm for his subject is contagious, and his descriptions of important buildings are often nothing short of inspired. This is truly a great book by a great scholar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plastic Arm Rests Break","review":"Agree 100% with CitizenOne. Everything about this chair is wonderful except for the arm rests. First the right broke about a year ago. HumanScale customer service was excellent and sent out a pair of arm rests (not just the right). I guess they knew that the left one would break, too. It did tonight. Fortunately I kept the left arm rest of the pair that HumanScale sent me originally, so I replaced it. At least I was not banging my arm against a sharp object."},{"rating":"2","title":"Risky Business!!!","review":"-I found this CD always interesting and often the music and the vocal work was very innovative.

It sounds like it came out about four or five years ago! Rockell's vocals are fine, and the beats are ok, but I cannot look at this song any differently than a track by La Bouche or Haddaway from 1995. The cd single's choices for remixes are pretty bad as well. The Radio Version, two remixes and their radio edits?

Factors that can cause disabilities, current methods of treatment, commonly used medications, and guidelines for intervention are addressed.This comprehensive reference book will be invaluable tool to access when teaching children with disabilities and parents. Appendixes provide a through list of resources, and glossary of terms so non-experts, like myself, can avoid getting lost in a morass of acronyms.

Giuseppe Sinopoli turns in a breathtaking performance. The pacing is perfect and the Staatkapelle Dresden plays with all the passion and mystery this symphony commands. The Finale with its beautiful chorale sections are played with the grandeur they deserve. The reviews I read were absolutely glowing and this recording is considered, quite rightly, the best available of this symphony. It is a wonderful tribute to the late conductor.This is a must have recording for anyone interested in Bruckner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Revelation of a great symphony","review":"I had never considered the 5th to be one of the \\"great\\" Bruckner symphonies, but here, Sinopoli gives a performance that reveals of real greatness. The music shines with a clariety of voicing, with great emotion and architecture, that I found spell-binding. It was as if I heard this music for the first time. My biggest concern when purchasing this, was that Sinopoli would insert some mannerism, or too broad a tempo, but there is nothing to complain about in any aspect of the interpretation. We may never hear a better performance. If you love any Bruckner, then this will be a cherished recording for your collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse phone I've ever owned","review":"At random times the base station goes insane and all the handsets say \\"out of range\\" and stop working. The only thing that fixes it is unplugging the base station and taking out its batteries, putting it all back together (the battery compartment is poorly designed and the batteries don't want to stay in), and reprogramming the current date/time (which is also tedious). Then the handsets all work again... for a while... maybe a day, and then it happens all over again.I'm extremely disappointed in this product and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. We've wasted hundreds of dollars on this, stupidly buying a lot of handsets for it.Motorola, you should be ashamed of yourselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible voice quality and range","review":"I really liked this phone before I purchased it and during setup. The only minor complain is that the screen doesn't light up when you have a call coming in on call waiting, so you can't see who is calling when it is dark. Now for the major complaints. First, the voice clarity is horrible. There is some static, but worse is the garbling or interference which causes missed syllables. It sounds like the connection is cutting in and out while you're talking. I tried moving the phone around the house but nothing improves this. Second major problem is the range. My old 900mhz and 2.4mhz phones I had allowed me to walk halfway down my block and get reception. I can't even make it to the end of my yard with this phone. This phone is definitely lacking in the two most important areas. It is definitely going back to the store."},{"rating":"1","title":"Many great features and the worst sound quality","review":"I purchased this phone with two additional handsets. The unit is expandable to more handsets, and it has many great features. However, the sound quality is the worst of any portable or cell phone I have ever used. All callers tell me that I sound as if I was in a tunnel. They all say that either my voice is breaking up or that I'm not clear. Apparently, it goes both ways for I have to strain to hear them, and often I can no understand what they are saying. All three handsets sound equally bad.

Lamps? \\"I thought the 5.8 GHz was meant to resist interference.\\" \\"No sir, these phones are very sensitive.\\" So I found a corner of my house away from everything, even lamps. Same problem.

Both phones were replaced on warranty, but Motorola has a policy that they won't send you a replacement until you send the old one back to them. This means that you won't have a phone for about 10 days. They give you one other choice---they'll send you a replacement but you have to pay shipping both ways.

The set-up is inordinantly complicated, and needs to be repeated whenever the base gets unplugged.3. The battery life stinks. I've only had the phone for six months, and I can't even get 30 minutes out of the handset before it needs to be recharged.4. The casing around the battery is poorly made, and keeps falling out.5. The 'hand feel' of the handset is weird, and doesn't comform well to the head and hand.The only real 'pro' to this phone is that it looks really cool. Otherwise, it's not worth the money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money on this","review":"This is the worst phone I've ever bought. The audio quality is terrible, verging on inaudible. The phone book software is mind-bogglingly bad: the manual says you can sort entries alphabetically but you can't (at least not the \\"shared\\" phonebook); the manual says you can copy entries between the shared phonebook and the per-handset entries, and you can't; getting to a single entry requires 3 or 4 keystrokes at least, one of which is to get past the \\"add new entry\\" step. The manual simply does not match the feature set and appears to have been written for a different piece of gear, although the pictures in the manual match the gear.What happened to Motorola?

Such a universal story of people moored by the faith, but beset by the pityful human sinfulness of the institutional Church. Elie shows us how Merton, Flannery O'Connor,Dorothy Day and Walker Percy, renegades all, pursued their art and intellectual/spiritual quests in such different ways. Though I have read almost all of Merton and O'Connor and much of Day and Percy, it was with particular joy that I learned how much these figures overlapped in time and space, knew each other and were often correspondents.

There's no in between, hence they see nothing exciting or don't know how, I'm not sure, to write morally conflictive scenes, where there's a spiritual and temporal threat to the characters. Hence, they write dialogue-heavy, overbearing and certainly unrealistic \\"religiousy\\" dialogue, as though that were all that's needed to resolve every crisis, however dramatically interesting.

Once again, we Christians are accepting a movie that we would NEVER like if we didn't know it was a \\"Christian\\" film.If you want to see a movie made by Christians that actually has quality, check out Hometown Legend. I was skeptical of that movie because it was executive produced by Jerry Jenkins, author of the Left Behind series, but it proved why he did not support the Left Behind movies. It has fantastic acting, music, cinematography, and has actually been taken seriously by the mainstream and released by Warner Brothers, not just a Christian company. Hometown Legend was the first film made by Christians that actually excited me.I really hope that films made by Christians can improve, but as of now, we're still way behind the curve, and we should demand better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Left Behind II should stay left behind!","review":"I saw Left Behind and Left Behind II.

It was by far inferior to the first, and I'm not saying the first was any good. I watched the first one because Mike Severs directed it, however, he only played the lead in the second. If the books are anything like the films than they must be incredibly boring. I remember being leant the first Left Behind book. I think I read maybe two pages, when I shortly discovered that this is a horribly written book whose success feeds itself on the fears of other christians. It has the feel of a third grade research paper of the bible. Man, just read Revelations, don't support Mike's obvious attempt to bring himself into the limelight by pushing his way into the lead character, of a poorly written script, that he certainly cannot pull off. With all that in mind I'll still rent the third one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Sequal to a Great Message!","review":"Cloud Ten Productions has outdone themselves on this movie.

Kirk Cameron has come a long way since playing Mike Seaver in \\"Growing Pains\\" on TV. Also, I have long admired Brad Johnson, who is also a very fine (but very underused) actor.

Club 69 themselves appreciate the song Tainted Love, and they understand the fixation of popularity of this song, orginally recorded by Gloria Jones in 1964 and written by former Four Prep member Edward C. Cobb. Tainted Love refuses to die. The Gloria Jones single ended up in a Leeds club in the late '70's, and was heard by Dave Ball. He presented the song to Marc Almond in early 1981, and the rest is history. Ed Cobb is a rich man thanks to Marc Almond and Dave Ball.

Club 69 really didn't rise to the occasion on this remix series, and turned the song into a throbbing dancefloor noise-fest. There is zero synergy between the lyrics and the music. The beats are formulaic and more repetitive than a skipping Armand Van Helden record. Only the most sadistic House DJ would play this more than once a week if he wished to keep his job.It's very simple: If you liked the original, don't buy this.

The same thing has occurred with Soft Cell's \\"Tainted Love.\\" Not only are the beats monotonous, but become boring and tiresome to the ears. I must admit, as a DJ, I like to make mix tapes where two songs mix nicely with similar beats. I was able to mix a remix included in this CD with Depeche Mode's \\"Personal Jesus\\", as they both sound alike due to the drum background. For this, I give this production one star. Maybe If I had the remix equipment, I could've have done a better job. But for now, for get anything remixed by Club 69. By listening to it, you'll be wasting away your haircells that can be used to hear something more delightful, such as the original release."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING","review":"This would have to rate as one of the most boring songs of the 80's.

I'm happy to report that the movie had been totally faithful to the book. Joseph Mitchell's writing style is eminently readable and pulls one along effortlessly. Joseph Gould likely suffered from a mental illness, which would have gone undiagnosed in the 1920s-1940s.

Low prices are not necessarily a good thing!The problem with this product is simple: it doesn't really work. I needed something to use on the subway, to help cut down the ambient noise, but the cv190 doesn't do the job. Worst thing is, the sound quality is, how should I put it, totally lacking: flat, no bass, no clarity, the worst kind you can imagine. Even a cheaper Koss or Aiwa would sound infinitely better. Luckily, I got a refund. You can avoid the hassle by staying away from this.As for the CD player I got: it eats Energizer batteries like kimchee, and the \\"anti-skip\\" circuitry turns Celine Dion into a high-pitched witch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality .. not even worth $15/-","review":"Barely cancels any noise.

In fact this is the chief message of the book: doctors tend to be overconfident of our skill, and health care law is a complex field in which even general practice attorneys often stumble. Just as we should not operate on ourselves, we should not assume expertise in corporate organization, asset protection, labor or contracting.I found this book to be an excellent reference.

His 80's work was also excellent with Wax.This album is practically devoid of all the melodic ballads that he is so well known for. I was stunned as the tuneless 'ain't it just' came on. And 'big fat daddy' is even worse. An awful start to the album.The only songs I like were 'hannah'. The one and only exceptional ballad on the album, which reminds of his earlier style. This would have been one ballad amongst many, but here it is really a stand alone. 'Don't talk about forever' is also nice enough. The other tracks of note are 'the night show'. A good melody shines through this one. Also the cover 'I think I love you' is quite catchy. And 'A little mercy' is an ok sounding ballad.But the rest is tuneless space filling pap.Oh, and I HATE 'Drama queen' it is cringe worthy and just plain awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed at all","review":"Did not like the taste of the tea.

Wolpoff and Caspari's book is NOT one of these. The authors take pains to explain what multiregional evolution is NOT, namely, the multiple origin of humanity. Like just about everyone else, they contend that humans originated in Africa. However, they build a persuasive case that (a) there is no such species as Homo erectus, and (b) that the earliest Homo sapiens left Africa some two million years ago. Whether or not one agrees with this scenario, it makes interesting and informative reading, and I believe is a must for anyone interested in the evolution of humanity, for it provides an alternative to the now-popular view that \\"modern\\" humans, whatever that may mean, originated late, in Africa and \\"replaced\\" everyone else.à"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste time - money","review":"This book is a rehash of previous statements and out-dated concepts. As one reviewer has already noted, the molecular data and its interpretation (both mtDNA and RNA) makes this book redundant. Also the discussion of the fossil evidence fails to examine issues of function and developmental processes, which can have a significant impact on morphological form. As such, their implied 'evolutionary trends' within and between hominin groups are just as likley the result of convergence - anatomical analogies (i.e., homoplasies)The dedication says it all:\\"To Franz Weidenreich.

If their 44 song debut CD \\"Motivation and Watertower Grammar\\" was a sprawling buffet of delectable lo-fi tunes, \\"Flats\\" is a refined, more sophisticated full course (16 song) meal. The enigmatic song titles and lyrics, the irresistable hooks, and lingering melodies are still there, but this time the sound is decidedly hi-fi. \\"Fierce, He Said\\" reminds me of David Lowery's songs with Camper Van Beethoven and Cracker. The chirping crickets between tracks six and seven, and the quirky chord changes are reminiscent of XTC. \\"Weapons\\", \\"I've Got Guns\\", and \\"The Weather is Herod's Arm\\" are pop masterpieces, pure and simple.

It is extremely easy to use, is a real digital phone (DSS), has a great range, is loaded with features (that are easy to access), does not conflict with my wireless network, has a good battery life and acceptable sound. I have some slight criticisms that should not discourage you from your purchase: I don't find the sound quality to be as clear as I would hope (this has a very faint hiss), but there is no denying that it is still FAR better than all other cordless models I've purchased. Also, I find the handsets a bit small for my taste (others will disagree, to be sure), but again, a small price to pay for finally getting a cordless phone that does everything it should do - every time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful cordless phones!","review":"I recently replaced my old cordless phone with the Uniden TRU8860 5.8 Ghz cordless phones.

I think it's worth it to spend a little extra and buy a good quality 5.8 GHz phone...even if you don't have a wireless network now, you may at some point buy a new computer, keep your old computer and network them (that's what we did).Just be sure to keep one corded phone at home, in case of power outages - the cordless phones don't work in those situations and sometimes the cell phone towers are not working and you won't be able to call the power company."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst cordless phone I have ever seen","review":"Can't head calling party voice most of the time.

The earpiece sound is excellent and the range is quite good for a 5.8 GHz phone. So why only two stars? The microphone makes your voice sound as if you're speaking through a couple of sheets of wax paper.I heard complaints like this against Uniden a couple of years ago, but thought that the obviously capable Uniden R&D; folks must have addressed this relatively simple problem by now. No such luck. If the mic sound was halfway decent, this would be the best buy on the market for an expandable system, but the crummy outgoing audio makes it a sound like a $2.99 special from the local drugstore.This is a good system only if you don't care whether or not others can easily understand you.

It seems like everyone has jumped on the stupid higher-frequency-is-better bandwagon and all you can buy these days is trailing-end 2.4 GHz stuff that's guaranteed to interfere with your wireless network, and the new, improved 5.8 GHz. Well save your money. Somewhere just above 2.4 GHz these phones lose their ability to penetrate walls. I used to be able to take my old 900 MHz phone halfway down the block (outside) before it even started cutting out. This phone starts losing signal the moment you're in the room, and even in the room with the base unit it frequently cuts into your conversation with random nasty white noise. It's an embarrassment to me when I'm on a business call. Save your money and look for a 900 MHz phone.

In fact, even 2.4 GHz phones get \\"some\\" static/signal loss around wireless internet connections.Apparently, after calling Uniden customer support I found out that if you want to use a wireless phone around a wireless internet connection you MUST use a \\"less advanced\\" 900 MHz phone.I returned this phone and bought a 900 MHz phone that works perfect.

If I didn't ask the salesperson what was playing, I would have never have heard of Hawtin or this impressive mix CD. It's nearly an hour's worth of tracks that are stripped down to drum beats and a few synth touches. Most of the reviewers call it techno, but I personally think it's sometimes closer to house, as the beats per minute could easily pass for the latter genre. But regardless of what you may call it, this CD is tight! It's great for the gym, working on the computer, or even chilling around the house.

Not only are the characters somewhat unbelievable (the acting isn't exactly terrible, the writing just seems a bit dodgy), but it turned one of my favorite \\"Yes! Life is to be lived!\\" stories into something utterly depressing.The plot only roughly keeps to Forster's original, the characters are far from being similar and the ending was absolutely terrible.It's an ok movie if you're out for entertainment, but if you're looking for a good adaptation of a great book, stick with the James Ivory version with Helena Bonham Carter instead.

Trust me: you don't want to sit through this boring, stuff, bourgie work and not get its famous reward at the end. It's one thing to airbrus something on public TV, but why do it on a DVD that's going to be watched in one's private residence?

I enjoyed the performances of Elaine Cassidy, Rafe Spall and Timothy Spall. I usually love Sophie Thompson, but nobody but Maggie Smith will ever be Charlotte Bartlett for me. Rafe Spall is an improvement over Julian Sands, so I was very disappointed by Andrew Davies' tacked on and very unnecessary \\"twist\\" at the end. Since the book was written in 1908, there certainly was never anything about WWI. The less-than-90-minute time frame is just too short to really do justice to these classics that PBS is redoing.

And as for the huge ending change (that's not in the book)... I didnt really mind it, and it was tragically romantic...but I just don't like adapters taking huge liberties with novels, and it wasnt necessary, and if you are going to take liberties, I just think they should be a little less obvious and easy.Anyway, all that said....I love PBS and \\"Masterpiece\\" (though the name change was silly), keep the adaptations coming"},{"rating":"1","title":"Shocked","review":"I love the novel by Forster, and although I know movies have to leave out parts, nothing disappoints me more than when a screenwriter ADDS parts that were not in the book.

I don't want to trivialize a wonderful piece of literature, but it is a feel good book.This adaptation took most of the joy out of the story. The filming was good, the scenery was beautiful, and the acting wasn't bad, but it lacked anything that made me happy to be watching it. I won't give away the ending, but it killed the whole thing for me. I just left feeling sad. It isn't just that it was not part of the book. I understand when things get changed a little bit because it is a movie and not a book. This however, added nothing to it. It revealed nothing more about the characters or the main themes of the story. It just sapped all of the joy out of the film. Watch the Merchant Ivory production, it was so much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't mess with the classics!!","review":"My biggest beef with this adaptation was the new ending. It added nothing and put a mournful note on what was a clever, romantic, and uplifting novel. But that mournful note is felt throughout the movie as the tragic music keeps playing in the background, which was awkward when immediately following the funny scenes. Equally out of place was the altered timeline, with the values and dress belonging to a different decade. The acting was also disappointingly lackluster, and the production was so wrapped up in being a new \\"Room\\" that the spirit and cleverness of Forster were sadly missing. Watch the '80s version starring Helena Bonham Carter and Julian Sands instead, if it doesn't already hold a special place in your heart. There the acting dazzles and the punch lines are delivered brilliantly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well, it wasn't that bad...","review":"While I too thouroughly enjoyed the 1985 adaptation (probably in my top 10 movies of all time) I really didn't think this one was half bad. The only actor that did not seem to fit the character was the one playing Cecil Vyse.

Many other books do not show enough pictures in sequence for a particular move to fully understand it, but the drawing in this book are very easy for me to follow. Although some reader have apparently found the author's remarks regarding those in the stagecombat and reenactment camps, I found them to mirror my experiences of them exactly. It is high time someone put forth a scholarly work to refute those people who think THEIR way is the \\"only way\\". Mr. Clements shows us the basics and then allows us to take what he gives us and create our own personal way of using this most ancient and revered weapon.

In some respects, it is good that Clements wrote this book; he made mistakes that other writers in the Western Martial Arts community learned from.

I really like the idea of a martial art based on medeival sword fighting, but Mr. Clements does waste a lot of time knocking other people. I think he is just so into what he's doing that he thinks everyone else is trying to do the same thing and getting it wrong. However, fantasy game players are not trying to do martial arts, they are just having fun! Evereyone knows that movie actors aren't really fighting, they are just acting! Parts of this book do came across like advertising for HACA, but that's fair enough. The pictures are good and there is a lot of information in this book that was new to me.

Both ignore certain obvious facts regarding the weapons in use during the Dark Ages through the Renaissance.

The challenge is wading through the arrogant, condescending writing style. Yes, SCA fighters don't practice a \\"real\\" fighting art. For that matter, neither do Olympic fencers, boxers, or anyone else who competes in a rule-based tournament. After all, the law frowns on killing your opponent in a sporting competition. The historical references are quite good and the topic is interesting, even insightful, but I just can't handle the writing style.

Just wanted to comment on the wonderful lingering effect this film had on me.The movie follows a husband and wife (with her elderly mother) along with their crew back in 1910 as they venture out into the Brazilian deserts to settle at a spot in which the husband believes to be a sort of paradise. After the crew escapes and the husband becomes vicious and insane, the pregnant wife and her mother find themselves alone in the desert as the husband dies in a mishap.The story then follows the three generations of women who struggle to escape the sands. The film spans about 50 years and features tons of foreshadowing and existential musings along with some excellent performances.

I would definitely recommend this video to a friend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Power","review":"Brings you along with some routines that really help develop strength with nice attention to the proper way to do them at a speed that is comfortable to work with so you can really feel the pose and development. Three levels which work no matter how much you know/practice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow and Excellent","review":"If you are looking for a faster paced workout this is not for you. However, if you want to move slowly from position to position this is an excellent workout DVD. Several of the poses I had never seen before and found them to be very beneficial for balance and strength. The slowness of the workout improves the experience of yoga. Barbara Benagh's voice is soothing and her instructions are complete. Some videos require you to constantly look at the screen to figure out what to do next or allow you to become complacent in the practice, in this workout she reminds you gently to keep the pose pure and not become sloppy. The background music is perfect for a calming yogini experience. You will leave the routine refreshed and ready for life's next challenge."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoughtful Power","review":"This is the second yoga DVD that I have that approaches building strength from yoga with a mindful approach focusing on the poses, and not necessarily speed, in defining power and working through the poses. Like Yoga Burn, you do develop strength and tone.It is a good DVD in that it covers all levels and the poses are modified for the easier levels.You definately feel it even if it is not fast."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard for beginners","review":"I take a yoga class once a week, so don't consider myself the greenest beginner, but this DVD made me feel otherwise. In the beginner's section, they have side plank on extended arm for a long time, and CRANE! That's right, no feet on the ground, balancing on hands-only, as a beginner. I think not. On the plus side, the instruction for properly executing each pose feels explicit. As always, it's challenging getting into the pose just right, which is why it's called a yoga practice.Good luck and namaste."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Little Too Slow For Me","review":"I am an at-home yoga practitioner without formal instruction. However, considering other yoga instructional videos (which include a few from Giam) this one is definitely not my favorite. There are many choices in workouts, which I commend them for, but the environment is sterile (like hospital yoga) and the music is a little aggravating. The video does not have flow between segments. Overall, a bit boring, sterile environment and choppy delivery. I guess my favorite part is savasana, but, of course, that is always the best part."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite Yoga workout","review":"Of all the yoga DVDs I have tried, this one is my favorite. Although slow paced, by going slower, your workout is actually more intense - yet more relaxing at the same time. There are excellent pointers throughout to polish your technique. But the number one reason this is my favorite? The many choices of workouts ie duration or intensity, invigorating vs relaxing. And there are over 20 of them. By far beats the silly competitors who have only 2 or 3 workouts on them. This is one DVD you will always use. Oh, and the veiw of the sculpted man while working out is definitely a bonus ;)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasn't what I had hoped for","review":"I purchased this dvd based on the reviews here. While it looked very promising with an accessible menu and many programs like my favorite entry level dvd by JJ Gormley, I quickly realized how repetitive and boring this dvd really is. I bought this because I was ready to move to more challenging exercises. There seems to be a concentration on the same movements and poses and they drraaaagggg ever so slowly through each and every program. This dvd would best be suited for entry level newbies to yoga. I feel my money was wasted and I cringe at the same poses over and over to the point where I probably won't be using this dvd much."},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect!","review":"This video has everything I was looking for in a home practice...options of duration of 15 mins up to 2 hours yikes!... beginning intermediate and advanced routines with several segments within each. The pace is slower than the typical vinyasa and ashtanga classes, so this isn't for you if you're looking for a power workout. But the poses are held awhile to build heat and strength (can get sweaty), focus the breath and calm. They give great instruction about form and technique and remind often about breath. The leaders voice is pretty soothing. Oh and I just love the savasana in each segment...perfect!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!!","review":"I tried the evening track and about fell asleep. I thought I would try the morning one, hoping for more energetic version...it was the same thing!! I'd return it if I could! HMMM, maybe I will try."},{"rating":"1","title":"going to half-price books","review":"I hated this DVD. It was such a disappointment. They call it \\"flow\\" yoga, but it was flowing in and out of one pose, then a quick, not flowing transition to a completely different pose. Not relaxing, not a good stretch, not challenging either. Skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"power yoga for everybody","review":"Power Yoga for Every Body (With Over 20 Workouts for All Levels of Students)It was way toooo slow!!! I expected faster flow. I mean when they call it power: I thought, when does it begin to be power?!!The instruction was very percise for beginners,(great)When I see power in a title, I want power! I couldn't even watch all the way through the programs. I watch first, so I can preview before I do the dvd. Maybe title should say \\"slow power yoga.\\"(no power added)I will applaude the instruction part of it. Not a bad dvd, but definately not my fave, or what I expected."},{"rating":"1","title":"One BIG flaw!","review":"This DVD has one BIG (so to speak) flaw. The man demonstrating the routine is wearing shorts which leave NOTHING to the imagination. Don't get me wrong; I congratulate him for being so well endowed, but I don't want to look at that while I'm trying to clear my mind and follow a yoga (or any workout) routine. Otherwise, it's a good routine, so you may want to pick this DVD up if you're into that sort of thing. I personally can't watch it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good selection","review":"This video has varying skill levels sessions and practice sessions of varying lengths, which makes it easy to incorporate into daily life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninspiring","review":"I was hoping to have another great yoga video with this one but it really disappointed me. These are some of the things that bothered me:1. The practice is done in a studio with a really ugly green wall and carpet. Maybe that is not so important for some but it was visually distracting to me with its ugliness!2. Although this video boasts on having 25 routines but in actuality most of them contain the same sequences in different order or in different combinations.3. Beginner and Intermediate practices are way too easy even for beginner yoga practitioners. In my opinion, the advance practice is the only level remotely challenging.4. The practice doesn't flow nicely as sequences are very much segmented.I have used this DVD once and it's been just sitting around. I totally regret of getting this DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"i guess i'm just a bigger fan of a little more upbeat yoga practice, although i understand its supposed to be for serenity more than working up a sweat. Good for those who are looking to slowing enhance their skills, but monotonous for those who just want to stretch and relieve tension.The man doing the poses bones stick out to kind of a disgusting level. It made me feel uncomfortable."},{"rating":"1","title":"didn't like this video","review":"I didn't care for this video at all. Boring and it moves too slowly for my taste. I have other videos i like alot better ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Controlled Power","review":"I am enjoying this DVD. It is great Power Yoga without quick movements. Instead you move into each pose and really get into each pose and what it is doing. Although it is not quick, you still feel the workout and power of the pose. I have taken some of the quicker moving power yoga courses, but had found them too fast moving when I started and really like the slower controlled power on this DVD.It has helped improve my yoga practice, including being able to work into some of the faster power yoga practices I previouosly could not do, and if you are looking for something that is powerful but not quick, this is a good option. The instructor's really provides great guidance and I am now working through the Intermediate section, which is a very good workout so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love It","review":"Really good DVD which let me develop at my own rate by good groundwork and basics on the easiest level.After a few months of practicing I started feeling alot stronger and started adding some more of the harder things."},{"rating":"1","title":"Product failed after only a few wearings","review":"I ordered this blue shirt (small) for my 3 yr old, and it failed within a few wearings.

When he opened the CD for his birthday, he was so excited. He said it was one of the best gifts I have ever given him. That made it worth 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very enlightening.","review":"I picked up this book for the history-of-marriage value instead of the same-sex-marriage-propaganda value, and found the history and debated \\"reasons why people have historically married\\" to be rather uninformative. A lot of what was said seemed common knowledge about basic history of society. Marriage concepts are talked about generally more often than not. I would have liked to see more hard core facts rather than musings and contemplations. I was hoping for statistics to be sprinkled liberally, and perhaps many tales of certain marriages in the past that stood out either as especially abnormal for a time period, or exceedingly typical."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missed the basics","review":"While E. J. Graff gives a broad social history of marriage, she does not delve deeply enough into the religious history of marriage which leads to errors in her arguments. From her book, one could conclude that the Catholic Church did not consider marriage to be a sacrament until the 13th century. However, Terullian in the 2nd century wrote, \\"Whence are we to find (words) enough fully to tell the happiness of that marriage which the Church cements, and the oblation confirms, and the benediction signs and seals; (which) angels carry back the news of (to heaven), (which) the Father holds for ratified.\\" Lacking this foundation of the essence of marriage in the Christian Church which so heavily influenced our society, she cannot argue for what marriage is for because she does not know what marriage really is."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT read!","review":"I expected this book to be kind of dry and boring, but it turned out to be absolutely fabulous. It is funny and eye-opening. I never knew just how much the family structure has changed over the course of human history. It was a bit shocking at times to see just how different \\"family values\\" used to be. (And how fortunate I am that marriage continues to evolve!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful, well-researched read","review":"This is a great book. It is not only well-researched, but also witty, insightful, and a very engaging read. It's impressive how accessible Graff has made this material; there's a lot of very detailed information packed into a small book, but it's never dry or difficult to read. Her arguments in favor of same-sex marriage are thoughtful and very well-reasoned -- I now feel much better prepared for discussing same-sex marriage with family and friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nirvana","review":"Ordered this for my significant other and it was a great gift.

This heats up much faster (probably all plug-ins do). It has a built in stand that works, and the trigger seems fine. I have had it over a year, and used it occasionally without problems. It is dual temperature, though I can't see why one wouldn't always use the highest temperature setting. I can't make a more nuanced review because I don't know about glue guns, but I always find it reassuring to have at least one review. I didn't give it 5 stars because it doesn't instantly melt the glue - I'd say it is about 10 seconds to get going, and a minute till easy flow - and I don't know enough to assert any glue gun is 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't wait for my stanley glue gun to arrive","review":"This thing didn't work out of the box. no way to get glue in or out. a few websites suggest putting the metal bit in the oven or heating with a hair dryer. but come on! not working as intended? that is bogus. having had glue guns before, this was a major let down"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hi-Low Switch Broke in Less Than One Month","review":"This is a pretty standard dual temp glue gun. Initially worked fine, then after about 4 weeks of use the switch to change between high and low temp broke and fell off the glue gun.

There has to be something sturdier out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not take standard/craft size glue sticks","review":"I bought this as a replacement for my girlfriend's glue gun that broke. It doesn't say in the product description, but you can not use standard size or craft size glue sticks in this gun. It takes only the fatter size ones. I asked why she couldn't just buy larger craft glue sticks? I didn't get it, but she said it just wouldn't work for why she needed it. Just wanted to warn anyone that wanted a glue gun for smaller projects that this is not the right choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the orig cast from 1935. Not what I was hoping for!","review":"The music features Ethel Waters Mabel Mercer, Todd Duncan ... from the broadway cast in the 30'.

Boards of Canada goes beyond conventional classifications in every way shape or form , which takes many in Geogaddi. BOC's Geogaddi is an album to listen to when the world seems to pause in order to catch up to itself. When I listen to this cd I always get that tingle down my spine as if my brain blew a fuse. Maybe its the mathematical formulaes they use maybe its the spirituality of being cut off from the rest of world but they're sound is unique and pure. I recommend this cd to anyone who likes to reflect on life and its unanswered questions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique sound. Very nice.","review":"Beautiful and moving. You also get your money's worth with numerous tracks and no filler.Ignore the goofball reviews suggesting satanic elements to this release and go with the overall star rating."},{"rating":"2","title":"hhhmmmmmmmmm................","review":"After 3 listens this album still hasn't really sunk in. The more straightforward tracks - such as 1969 and the devil is in the details - immediately stand out, but this is dreamy ambient work that paradoxically requires concentration. I love BOC's sound, so I have no argument with the quality of the music; texture is everything here. I wish the record company was not offering the limited edition at a higher price, though, because it's really not justified: it comes in a hardback format with only a few insert photos and no extras on the cd. Traditionally, a limited edition is usually a limited first run that retails for normal price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reentering a Garden of Eden","review":"Remember those \\"ancient\\" documentaries made in the 1970s with the warbly and nearly dated soundtrack of drones and soft melodies? Well I've never heard of a group that takes those ideas and make it part of their sonic character.Boards of Canada and their latest release Geogaddi continues on the same vein as Music Has the Right to Children with its light melodies, ancient drones and hints of documentaries. The thing that's different is that there's a bit more room for some melancholy. It's not to say that's totally dark but it's not completely sunny either. It's relaxing yet not totally sleepy either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull","review":"I guess I don't understand all the buzz around this album. Musically it doesn't present much, and the songs aren't anything you'll be likely to remember and catch yourself humming at work. Overall I'd say the album sounds clunky and chaotic. Save your money for something more musical."},{"rating":"2","title":"It takes time","review":"Don't expect to put on this album and be blown away. Reading the reviews and high marks, expectations are high.Everyone who awards this CD rave reviews has been listening to it for a while - and let it sink in. At first I thought it was repetitive and uninteresting, but I found myself playing it more and more.It's like this: the first listen is overhearing a child humming to himself while he plays. Repeated listenings is stepping into the child's head and experiencing the concocted symphonies from the inside."},{"rating":"2","title":"An emotional counterpart to MHTRTC.","review":"A lot of the reviews here are negative because the CD is unnerving and almost creepy where the group's other most famous CD was more quirky. That's the point. BoC writes music to play with your emotions, and this does that really well. Most people listening to it will have heared MHTRTC first, and that CD makes you almost feel as if BoC is your best friend. Then you hear this, and you feel betrayed, and even a little scared. It also could be interpreted as a description of the Christian Apocolypse. Peace, to chaos, to desolation.Great stuff. Just gotta think about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but it's no MHARTC","review":"I'm not going to elaborate on this CD since so many here have already done that, but I would like to say that it does have a way of seeping into your subconciousness. The only drawback when comparing this album to earlier releases is that it seems to be lacking in a way, too much filler and not enough \\"fleshed out\\" compositions I suppose. If you are new to Boards of Canada, I would highly recommend the previous release, \\"Music Has a Right to Children.\\" This new album doesn't quite hold up to that one when you compare the two. Wear out your CD player with that one first, then move on to \\"Geogaddi.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterpiece","review":"This is an excellent record.Something between Coil- Aphex twin and some kind of ambient stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoughtful.","review":"I bought the vinyl edition, and first I thought: Oh No! Not another \\"triple-vinyl-set-won't fit my-record-case\\". But then I realized something; the F-side didn't have any tracks, but a well carved outline of a family! Like a little luminous candlelight sitting in the distance, on an otherwise unlit melancholy record. And yes, the album is great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"New Fan of Boards of Canada","review":"I came at Geogaddi a little differently, I got it when it came on Billboard's top 10 Electronic albums, never having heard of Boards of Canada before. Then, I ran and got MHTRTC. So, I had no preconcieved notion of what it should be.Now, I'm not one of these sophistocates who can put styled phrases together to make you see how utterly brilliant their viewpoint is, I just know what I like in music. I LOVE this cd and think it deserves the Five Stars that I only give those CDs that move me and make me want to listen over and over. (And I know I'll get some angst over this, but I like it better than MHTRTC - which within the limits of a 5-star system I would still give 5 stars).If you love the genre, I don't see how you can miss with Geogaddi!"},{"rating":"2","title":"very unconventional","review":"When I was younger I used to discuss with my friends who was the best guitarrist or the best drummer or the best pianist. Things have changed these days with electronic music. Can you really rate a musician for how skillfully he presses the keys of his computer's keyboard? What I mean is that rating electronic music doesn't go any further than applying the scale of really good to really bad or simple quality comments such as danceable, hip, boring, etc. So how can you criticize this CD? You can criticize it by simply saying: \\"I really like it, it's awesome\\" or \\"this is not music, it's freaking weird\\". I am in the middle of these two opinions. I like it and find it innovating but it doesn't really convince me 100% and sometimes the beats and the monotony get on my nerves and I hate having to skip tracks on a CD. But try it, I recommend it if you like adventuring into the world of electronic music. If you are looking for dance music don't even get close!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Geeohgoody","review":"From the opening melody of the first real song, it is apparent BOC aimed to carve a haunting, personalized mark onto the demanding IDM scene. It was even obvious one album before this, but with Geogaddi, what once veered towards childlike joy now opts for darker, denser qualities, complimenting the electronic duo's unique mystique all the more. Overworked with interludes, the album as a whole still remains a mesmerizing experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Their debut ... all over again.","review":"This album is so much like their first release that it can only be called a disappointment. The sound is much the same: that 70s organ mixed with choppy, hip-hop beats. The structure of the album is almost identical. By that I mean that long tracks are interspersed with short ones just like their debut. The trippy vocal samples are added in much the same way as well. Heck it's as if they set out to make an updated version of their debut.Musically and creatively a disappointing effort.Those familiar with the back catalog are likely to be disappointed. Those new to Boards will likely love it, but that's because lack the context necessary to see the album in this light."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beep-Beep-Boop-Boop...Thanks but No Thanks","review":"I like off-beat music, but this \\"music\\" is too much!

One can not escape the similarity in these statements. In many ways, religions throughout human history have taught that men either were or would become deities themselves, contradicting God. The Mormon view of God is perhaps the most direct expression of this concept in modern times. It is in contradiction, however, to the clear expressions of God in the Scriptures. How one man may fare in a debate, as in this work, is irrelevant to how a religion fares when compared to the clear statements of the God they claim to worship. It is the avoidance of addressing these issues that is the ultimate failing of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT THE VIDEO I THOUGHT I WAS BUYING","review":"There was no picture with this tape and not much description.

As usual with Who novels, I felt the ending was just thrown togetheras an after thought, but I have come to expect that.

This book is not about food, in fact I feel I was lured into it by the promise of details of fine meals and I was very dissapointed to get something like a looooong Cosmo article about Ms. Greene's sexual exploits! She's a really talented writer, why doesn't she just write the real book! As one other reviewer commented, this oeuvre don't hold a candle to, for instance, the recent posthumous work by MFK Fisher, My Life in France, which was a total delight. And would somebody please tell Ms. Greene that she wasn't making conquests??? Most guys will sleep with anybody, especially if that anybody is famous and has money!

She embellishes herself in it and is proud. Kind of like Satan himself. Yes, she knows about food, but while reading her book (which I actually burned in finding it so disgusting), she has whored herself into her position and is quite proud of it. I truly feel sorry for her and her inherent feeling that she is such an expert in any thing other than food. She truly embarasses me as a woman and it is probably good that she had no children who would remain tremendously embarassed to have her as a mother.The few recipes she provides are worthless and other than providing her some income, this book is totally trash, as is she."},{"rating":"1","title":"You disgust me","review":"Greene should have titled this The Repugnant Personality. Vapid idolatrous reverence for celebrities, intensely self-disgracing sexual indiscretions and pretentious food gibberish all rolled into one person!

It was like passing through a time warp reading Greene's account of the decade. It was a bit of a wicked pleasure recalling the excesses of the time but ultimately Greene's memoir leads to satiety and revulsion and reminds me so clearly why the 70's has been called \\"the nostalgia-proof decade.\\"For goodness sake: Your opening volley is sleeping with Elvis? Where can you go from there?Really self absorbed, ridiculous, superficial."},{"rating":"1","title":"Edit Me Please- An Excess of Ego","review":"Will I ever finnish this tedious tome? An excess of ego and pointless information. Ruth Reichel's exsquiste \\"Comfort Me with Apples\\" benefitted from a genius of editing, I longed for more. With Insatiable I want less. Ms. Greene sometimes writes about food as if it were ad copy.I had to laugh when she wonders after her second one night stand with Clint Eastwood \\"I wondered if there could have been something more beyond the hotel room that night\\"....I would urge anyone interested in food writing and personalities worth spending time with to read all three of Ruth Reichel's memiors, any of MFK Fisher, and Amanda Hesser's \\"Cooking for Mr. Latte\\". A rewarding read awaits you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Appetites","review":"Whoa, this badly written, unsexy epic could have used some serious editing. I'm surprised, since I've enjoyed GG's witty reviews, but there's hardly an amusing line in this tome, which mostly chronicles Greene's narcissistic pursuit of celebs to wine, dine, and bed her. Talk about TMI! You'll come away from these pages feeling like you've eaten mediocre swill at an overrated restaurant; Greene evidently had all the depth of a finger bowl.

The book takes place in the 1960s (NOT the 70s, as many reviewers have stated)...it actually ends on New Year's Day, 1970. This is an important detail because Theresa's behavior was considered far more socially and morally unacceptable in the 1960s, than it would have been in the 1970s. She was not part of the counter-culture movement, so her promiscuity has nothing to do with \\"free love\\" in that sense. She is searching for something, some kind of escape from the feeling of abandonment she had in childhood. In short, Theresa has issues. The book does a good job of detailing her childhood sadness and showing how those experiences permeate her adult life, thereby affecting the decisions she makes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling...","review":"This book was lent to me by a friend in March 2003 and I didn't get around to reading it until June 2003.

No problem.Later, when I saw these shoes marked down at Amazon.com, I ordered them again (the price was so low, how could I not?), this time a half size larger. STILL too small - a bit short for my big toe, a bit snug for the ball of my left foot, the Velcro straps still too short - and all very stiff, awkward, and clunky.

They are really comfortable and have good toe room but do order wide size if you need the extra width. I ordered some New Balance sneakers at same time I ordered these and they were double the price but I like these much better and the New Balance which were also ordered in wide was just a little too tight in toes.

The owner of Golden Sovereign refuses Roy's request, but amazingly Lady and Sovereign run off together. Roy is accused of shooting the stallion. Months later, Roy returns with the unregistered foal of the Golden Sovereign as a token of sympathy to the owner. Golden Sovereign's owner sneers and tosses the foal off as a \\"half-breed\\".

He is, at times, an arrogant law-breaker.Definitely recommended for at least one viewing.A qualification... If Amazon had a proper rating system, I'd give this film 2.5 out of 4 stars.

I found the book to feel oversimplified and sort of biased - in the sense that in many cases the author implies that he knows something that your doctor does not (whereas there was not any \\"news\\" in here for the average North American MD). In my opinion, much of the information presented, while perhaps interesting, so far underrepresents the currently-known \\"whole truth\\" that it may mislead the layperson into believing that exercise and nutrition can solve all of one's ails.I am also not a fan of the \\"Dummies\\"-like style and layout.The communication level seems appropriate for a teenager.Certainly, this is a reasonable primer but I do not recommend this book as a loner on one's home medical bookshelf since it omits so much explanation and truth (and conflicting evidence in some cases!) to further the author's dramatically simple agenda."},{"rating":"1","title":"poopy","review":"This book was completely unfabricalble.

They have written me with instructions to repair it myself and I will try and let you know if it works when I have the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather Useless Scale","review":"I purchased this in a moment of hopefulness--it seemed ideal.

I was very disappointed and will never purchase this product again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Artifical Tasting","review":"Yeah it's made with artifical sweetner, so I don't expect it to taste like real barbeque sauce, but this isn't very good. It's especially terrible as a dipping sauce. It's not completely terrible if you use it to cook with though."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible","review":"The taste was nasty and it came broken the first time.

I should have known to put it back on the shelf when I read one of the ingredients was Red Cabbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ick","review":"I normally love Walden Farms foods, but this sauce is not at all what I expected. It has a very bitter, acidic taste to it. If you're looking for a substitute for sweet barbeque sauce, this is not it."},{"rating":"1","title":"yuck!","review":"This sauce is gross! I bought it knowing that it was a \\"diet\\" food, but didn't expect it to be that bad. It didn't taste anything like BBQ sauce. I can't even describe how awful it tasted or what it tastes like. Luckily I bought it at a local store, and didn't pay the higher rate on here or shipping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good on calories, bad on taste","review":"Not recommended for those with taste buds.The only reason I'm giving it 2 stars is because it's 0 calorie - so it has every right to taste awful.Would never buy again. Please god don't ever let me buy again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this stuff!","review":"I haven't purchased this item here, I get it at my local grocery, however, I love the stuff. I do not use it as BBQ sauce though. I agree with some of the comments stating that it is a bit thin, and not really BBQ flavored. However, I do use this more as a condiment, instead of catchup or 57 sauce - for THAT purpose, with zero cal,carbs, etc...it is an awesome product! :D I also really enjoy the flavor. But taste is completely individual. It is def. worth a try if you are watching carbs or looking for easy places to cut a few calories from your diet. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Yum!

And I never got a refund so I am out the money and I have no clue what it taste like. Very sad would have loved to try it. I can not get a hold of anyone to get this resolved. Do not order this you might get your money stolen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"Yup it's calorie free and carb free and boy can you tell!! I tried this twice, wanted to really like it but it was horrible. I threw it out. I guess if you want BBQ sauce that's really going to taste good, you'll have to take the calories and carbs. It's too bad, but this stuff was awful. Wasted my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chemical aftertaste","review":"Give Walden Farms credit for making a no-carb sauce. It's just a shame it doesn't taste better. Still, I do buy it on occasion and mix it with other tastier sauces to lower the over all carb content. However, the smoke taste is so overwhelming that more than a proportion of 1:4 leaves only the taste of this product in your mouth. This product cannot begin to compare with the taste of the now-defunct Kraft's low-carb barbecue sauce. Mostly, I make my own low-carb sauce from scratch and then just add a bit of this to get the smoke taste, but too much and even the best batch of homemade sauce is ruined. However, if you are on an extreme low-carb diet (such as Dr. Bernstein's) this may be the only product that fits."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible...And Not Cheap","review":"I took one sampling of this barbecue sauce after opening the bottle and immediately threw it away. The taste is really disgusting, nor is the consistency anywhere close to \\"thick.\\" Using this product with any type of meat (pork, chicken, beef, etc.) will absolutely ruin what you're eating. I should have done a better job of reading the other reviews, since they are dead-on. You can find a number of low-carb barbecue sauce recipes on the web - I'd try that instead of this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really very good!","review":"You know, when they say it's sugar free, carb free, you tend to think it'll be taste free. Being a diabetic, I was desparetly wanting some flavor on my chicken wings, and I thought I'd give this a try. I was pleasantly surprised. It tastes pretty good! My only negative would be that its a little runny, but I can live with that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Need a bleach mouthwash after eating!","review":"It's not just THIS Walden Farms product, but every one I've tried. Syrups, marshmallow dip, Ketchup, Cocktail sauce.....!! You'd think after wasting so much money on them (not to mention the taste that leaves your mouth feeling like a chemical sewer!) I'd learn but kept hoping ONE item would be salvageable. No. They are so bad I almost considered gargling with bleach to erase the taste. There are no words for what these Walden products taste like: not any that can be printed on Amazon, at any rate.

However, this product was not appetizing to me after the tasting it and it has a very unpleasant, lingering aftertaste. I tried to doctor it up a bit so that the aftertaste wasn't so undesirable. Nothing really worked. Additionally, the smell is unappealing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sugar Free Part is Okay, But the Recipe Isn't","review":"I buy sugar free products a lot, and it is hard to find sugar free barbecue sauce. I held out hope for this, and indeed did use the whole bottle. I hate to waste things, and I am generally very easy to please. I won't buy another though because the stuff just doesn't taste like barbecue sauce. In my opinion, it has nothing to do with the artificial sweeteners either. Whatever they are doing with the rest of the recipe just isn't getting the job done.If you have NO other choices, maybe you could give it a try yourself. I do see some others love it, so maybe you would, too. However, if you have a choice, choose the other brand(s) first before bothering with this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chemical taste","review":"At first I thought it tasted ok. But after a few bites, it began to taste chemically. My husband doesn't like it either."},{"rating":"2","title":"...Little thin but tastes great!","review":"Yum! I love this stuff. Gives steak a sweet tangy kick without the carbs. It's not as thick as real BBQ sauce but it tastes just the same to me:)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Smokey Maple Flavor","review":"I just bought this at Wal-Mart today. I put it on some nice pork I had cooked in my crock pot looking for that \\"shredded pork with bbq sauce\\" effect. It is thinner than your typical sugary sauce but that's nice because a little goes a long way. The flavor is smokey with an unexpected but nice maple flavor. I think I am going to try to add a little hot sauce next time. It's not exactly like a thick gloppy sugar laden sauce, but it does help the craving. I plan to buy it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"special audiences only","review":"Actually, I tried to watch it straight through twice and couldn't. The \\"plot\\" (if you call it that) and the shuffling of intimacies back and forth like a pendulum made the movie little more than \\"too weird\\" for me. But I sensed a lot of emotion in the movie but that emotion did not penetrate into me due to the strange style of this movie. I never liked pretencious movies and I felt the writer/director was trying to \\"make art\\" here, but someone else might really love it. I never felt something like this plot really happens....if it does, maybe I do not care enough to want to watch it happen."},{"rating":"1","title":"negative stars if i could","review":"i agree with the reviewers giving this movie 1 star. this is absolutely the worse most horrible movie. in hollywood, the white guy is portrayed as the hero and the asian is protrayed as some wife-beating person. so everyone is waiting for change. this movie protrays the asian guy as some innocent person who prefers love over sex and the asian girl as some slut. yeah great retarded protrayal. I think all these people especially the writer should be permanently banned from the film business. for once, write a film that is actually about asian people and don't try to make the guy an all innocent retard and the girl the bad guy. asian people is like all people white, black, yellow, green. sheesh. being asian, i rather watch a hollywood film, wife-beating asian is better than this crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD that don't play","review":"DVD would not play in PS3 or DVD player.

Badly written and directed by Estevez, this was the worst movie of 1990. Maybe if I watched it again now, I might like it some more, but I have no desire to. One of the funny moments involves two policemen clad only in their underwear being tied to a merry-go-round, but even that joke gets played out quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Get Any Worse Than This","review":"This is undoutadly the worst movie ever made... and I do not award that prize flippantly. This movie has no redeeming value. The script is weak. The humor is nonexistent.

Now, I can't remember, but I'm pretty sure DVD's weren't made like that unless they were \\"bootlegged\\" in some sort of way....but I could be wrong and I very well may be. The paper in the case (outside) seems authentic and all, but the case is REALLY cheap and flimsy.

Well, buy this toaster! It looks cool (unlike some of the other weirdly-shaped, overly-techie versions out there); it is easy to de-crumb (without it divesting itself of the crumbs all over the counter); and, *most importantly* it toasts: any thickness of bread product, to any degree of darkness, evenly across the surfaces--and without charring the outside and leaving your frozen stuff icy in the centre, and without making PopTarts Flambe!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't fall for the nostalgia","review":"For a 75th anniversary production piece, Toastmaster ought to find another line of work than producing toasters. Haven't thought much of this company for a number of years, but fell for the retro look, thinking it might also mean retro quality. Nice exterior. Too bad nice styling was married to lousy performance. Never tasted doughy toast before this experience--essentially browned on the outside and raw on the inside. Too, today, it's an easy matter for all toasters to include a \\"lift\\" feature that raises toast an extra fraction of an inch for those smaller than normal slices that don't extend beyond the top of the toaster when done. There's no reason to have to dig into the toaster to bring up the slices. Most toasters today don't hold a candle to their forerunners of the the pre-cheesy eras of the 50s and before. This model from Toastmaster looks beautiful, but if you're interested in more than decoration, buy another product."},{"rating":"2","title":"SO helpful!","review":"I'm beginning to share dance with my congregation by leading (college) students in movement worship sessions- each week, I'm finding great activities and resources to add to our meetings!

It's got lots of great ideas, and addresses many related topics that enrich the movement-worship experience. Suitable for beginners or those who are already comfortable with moving for God :) Playful and very smart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unimpressive","review":"I tried to like this book but failed miserably - the last straw was the apparent equation of Buddhist meditation techniques to Christian prayer. As Buddhism is agnostic while Christianity believes in a personal God with whom one enters into a personal relationship. I can cite the influence of Nestorian Christianity on Chan Buddhism or the influence of monotheist Islam on Tibetan Buddhism and I still can't make the leap the author does.The overemphasis, from my perspective, of the individual prayer and minimized reference to corporate prayer also clashes with my view of Christians composing the Body of Christ.On the positive side, some of her examples drawn from her role as spiritual director and her interest in playful prayer speaks of a woman of spiritual depth. This volume make speak to you in a way it fails to speak to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Nice...","review":"I bought this for my niece for xmas..

Having rented it through NetFlix, I had to purchase it. More realistic than Miss Austen's novels, Olivia Williams, as Jane Austen paints a poignant even heart wrenching picture of a woman unmarried in her time. While Miss Austen's stories tell of the hazards of the unmarried \\"gentle\\" woman with little or fragile income and no means to earn a living, her heroines live \\"happily ever after\\", but In Jane Austen's life, according to this film, no such security was hers.

Spectacular cast, very believable and Heartwarming!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Bargain","review":"In addition to Sense and Sensibility, you get the absolutely outstanding Jane Austen regrets, which is the best biopic of Jane Austen I have ever seen. It makes you want to read all of her letters to Fanny, and her biography by her nephew all over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lovely adaptation","review":"Like most people, I had seen the Emma Thompson adaptation of Sense and Sensibility and quite liked it. It stays as true to the story as you can within motion picture time contraints. I was, therefore, a little skeptical of this new mini series adaptation of the book. What could it bring to the table? The answer, it turned out, was quite a lot. From the spectacular scenery to the lovely performances turned in my the young cast, I could not stop watching it. The bonus features are also great and range from the cast talking about how many times to trooped up and down a hill to film a scence, to the director talking about finding a period appropriate cheesy poof for John Dashwood's son to be eating on the carriage ride to Norland. All in all a great DVD, though I wish I had ordered it in combination with the Persuasion remake (sadly had already bought it on its own) rather than Miss Austen Regrets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Jane Austen's Sense and Sensibility+Miss Austen Regrets","review":"I loved this movie when it aired on MPTV and enjoyed it uninterrupted in my sitting room....the characters are perfect and the scenery wonderful.

This version is so much more true to the feelings of the book. The music is glorious, the photography lovely, and the acting is passionate and sensitive. This is now my favorite version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Interpretation Yet","review":"I have enjoyed many of Jane Austen's period pieces and novels; they are rich in history and in reminding us all of the beauty of the human relationship. This version of Sense and Sensibility is simply the best I've seen bar none. The acting is superb and it is quick to absorb oneself in the human drama. However, one other element makes this series superior: the music. It is moving and in a heartbeat sweeps you into Barton Cottage and each key moment of this drama and romance. This is a series worth owning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Great BBC Adaptation.","review":"Love to watch them. I especially appreciate that the actresses in Sense and Sensibility look more like their characters age in the books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliance of Jane","review":"The dual DVD of \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" and \\"Miss Austin Regrets\\" was a superb presentation\\"Sense and Sensibility\\" touched upon a familiar theme- a family almost impoverished by circumstances and needing to make wise matrimonial decisons in order to recoup both fortune and status.Hattie Morahan and Janet McTeer give sensitive and powerful performances as the Dashwood sisters and the Austen wit and gamut of emotions are exquisitely portrayed. \\"Miss Austen Regrets\\" offers the reader a rare view of Jane Austen and her misgivings on not responding to love and marriage when the opportunity was availed herand her exhorting of her niece not to make the same error. Again the presentation was insightful and moving. The viewer saw the private Jane Austen ,feeling she has the responsbility of being the sole family provider and being in conflict with her feelings, especially toward her status conscious mother. The viewer will be treated to a rare artistic feast in every respect."},{"rating":"2","title":"it can't get any better than this","review":"This is by far, the best sense and sensibility, ever. Yes better than the version with Hugh Grant. The acting, casting, visual aspects of the film are far superior.

I wasn't sure if I would like it as well as the one with Emma Thompson & Kate Winslet but Andrew Davies always does an amazing job with the screenplays to Jane Austen's novels. It was very good. This version of Persuasion has to be my favorite, the acting is great & the story is so touching. Miss Austen regrets was good, but very different from the idealistic stories that Jane Austen writes. In this movie Jane Austen was lively, quick witted, and tortured it does give you a glimpse of what she is really like."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit empty!","review":"I am a Jane Austin fan.

Neither verision is better then the other. I believe the film had more action and the characters were louder. I love the depth added to Edward Ferrars and the relationships between Marianne and her suitors, Colonel Brandon and Willoughby.Miss Austen Regrets, the second 2nd in this DVD set, is a beautifully done. It is a vivid portrait of Austen's disposition in her later years as well as members of her family. I believe this movie is an eye-opener for every Austen fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"DVD","review":"excellent condition and arrived promptly. I would definately order from this site again. thank you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Adaptation!!!","review":"I loved this adaptation of Sense and Sensibility and thought it was every bit as good as the Emma Thompson adaptation (which I also love). I enjoyed the fact that they included more of the characters from the book and added more details to the story. The characters were closer in age to the book and I thought it was cast very well. The only character who was a bit disappointing was Dominic Cooper as Willoughby. I had something more handsome and charming in mind (as in the 1995 version), but he does grow on you and is the type of character that you can really despise. Over all it is a wonderful movie and I am sure to watch it over and over!"},{"rating":"1","title":"my ears!!!","review":"I bought this scale to weigh food, with the added benefit that I could use it to weigh mail. unfortunately, I currently am not using it for either due to the fact that it emits an ear-percingly loud, high-pitched tone for several seconds after it is turned on. I think the tone is to tell you not to place anything on the scale while it calibrates, but what it actually does is prevent me from wanting to use the darned thing. I can find no reference to the tone in the very small instruction sheet and the only way I've been able to figure out to avoid the sound is to not use the scale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Manufacturer appears out of business","review":"The features and price are all good as a home-use postage scale.Unfortunately, the manufacturer appears out of business and I cannot get a new rate chart chip for the 2006 postage rate change.

Read it before you board an airplane - then pack it in your carry-on. This book can save your health, maybe even your life! There are more dangers in flying than you ever dreamed of. It's all in Jet Smarter. The book is hard-hitting, in depth, comprehensive, full of solutions, entertaining and often witty. It's a behind-the-scenes look from author Diana Fairechild, a savvy former flight attendant and now aviation health expert. Diana's advice on how to deal with flying is practical and useful. Her suggestions really work. It's obvious that she's been there, done that, and fixed that herself. Thanks to Jet Smarter, I can fly without being sick during and after the flight. I can think and work - or play - after a flying instead of going straight to bed to recuperate. Now, instead of dreading the trip, I actually look forward to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read This Before You Fly!","review":"I have been flying since 1963 so I did not think I could learn very much from this book. I was mistaken. I noticed quite a few years ago that evertime I flew I would become ill soon afterwards. It took me a week to recover from an Australia to UK Flight. I knew it was more than jet lag and I was sure it was something to do with a lack of fresh air.Read this book if you plan to get on a plane anytime soon. I especially appreciated her advice about the food and water, \\"the only way to get a nutritous meal on a plane is to bring it yourself\\". We saw flight crew taking their food on board a flight we took this year so I know she is telling the truth about the food. I will not be eating or drinking anything but bottled water on future flights."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Bit Let Down","review":"I had high hopes for this book but feel somewhat disappointed.

More and more, trance seems to be going vocal, to feed the appetite of those who cannot live without vocals in their songs. Its sad...seeing people depend so much on vocals in a song to make it a song. One of the reasons i got into trance is that there were no vocals...it was different, not distracting, and even at 140-160 BPM, it was relaxing. Now, with all the vocal releases coming into the scene, artists are concentrating less on melodies, and more on just banging out another track. I will not fault Ferry for this...it's just the scene. Look at the old classics we used to have (Binary Finary - 1998, Armin - Communication, System F (ferry) - Out of the Blue..) compared to whats \\"hot\\" now (Kosheen - Hide U, Tukan - Light a Rainbow, Gouryella (ferry) - Ligaya...)

The \\"inexpensive\\" turned out to be plain ol' [not good]. Motor is very weak, and tends to shuts off after few minutes of regular use (when I got it, the motor housing seemed so small that I had my doubts). Another major problem is the thickness adjuster. It does not matter what setting you choose, it does not hold it. It just moves with applied pressure. A third problem is the safety button, I found out that it really needs two hands to press and hold down the two buttons (the On and the safety buttons).Simply, after the first use, I decided to no longer own this product.

I found the book to be very well writen and aruguably the best in the series. Reading the other books in the series does help in understanding what's going on in this book, but other than that, it makes for a very good read. This conclusion to the RoboTech series has a completely unexpected ending which involves what happened to the SDF-1's fold drives, the future of RoboTechnology, the mysterious Haydon, and why Haydon IV is what it is.

The photos are wonderful; one can really see the details on the outfits. Instructions are easy to follow and some are accompanied by photos. Patterns? There are many and varied patterns. Granted, one has to copy the patterns and enlarge them; however, I do not find this to be a detriment; this allows one to tweek the size of the patterns, for all dolls are not created equal, some are more endowed than others.The text is very interesting and informative.

I was so happy when I first opened the shipping box and saw that it was indeed just as beautiful as it looked in the picture. However, when I turned it over I saw a small warning sticker on the bottom of the box. It warned me that the jewelry box contained lead and should not be eaten or chewed. Fine, my daughter is past the age where she would chew on it. However, the warning continued, saying that it may generate dust containing lead. Unacceptable. I am promptly returning this jewelry box as I do not want my daughter exposed to any levels of lead knowing that lead can cause so many problems especially with learning development.

But there is also an understanding and appreciation for the natives. The essays on Maltese people, their vehicles, the architecture, and superstitions are good.

Very clear instructions as long as you don't take them too literally as one reviewer has saying something like \\"what am I supposed to do come home at my lunch break and weigh?\\" No.. the instructions state that you weigh in bare feet AT LEAST 3 hours after a large meal.

My husband and trainer both say I'm getting toner and to just stop looking at the scale.So I got this scale and darnit wouldn't you know, it was right. My muscle tone has improved and while reading the manual it said not to get frustrated over a lack of losing weight while your muscle mass gets firmer (something like that). Anyway, I love this thing. It's great. So even when my weight fluctuates, I can keep track of my body fat, which I'm happy to say is well within the healthy range.So, yes.

If more than two people will use the scale, it has a guest setting that allows the user to enter age, sex, and height.The interface is not intuitive.

It is much better than my original 65W incandescent.The lamp is dimmable, but I could only get it to about 70% on both my 600W Lutron linear slider and 1000W Lutron rotary dimmer, which is unacceptable. I did not notice any buzzing or flickering when dimming, though at its lowest setting, the CFL tube on the inside had a plasma ball look with the gasses swirling around and a slight purplish tint.The real deal killer was that it is 1/2\\" longer than the existing bulb and even with my Halo recessed can on the largest bulb setting, it stuck out beyond the baffle trim and looked awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get Regular rather Dimmable Compact Florescent Bulbs","review":"Dimmable CFLs only dim about 20% (Sylvania 10%, Philips 20%, GE20%) so don't buy expecting them to dim like incandescent bulbs. Also the way they dim is by producing harmonic distortion (changing the waveform to one where less light is produced) which can cause flickering and even without noticable flickering possibly even headaches or eye strain in some people. So go with the nondimmable CFLs instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dimmable CFL but it doesn't really, uhhh.... dim...","review":"I'm a major fan of CFLs. I have them all over my house. I finally installed a dimmer with my newly installed recessed lights in my living room and looked all over the place to find these hard-to-find dimmable CFLs. I bought them and tried them along side my soft white incandescents. At full brightness, it is clearly whiter and brighter hands down. Unfortunately when I started dimming, these GEs barely dimmed at all. I would be generous to say that they dim to 50% brightness. What good is a light that's advertised to be dimmable but doesn't really dim? I'm going to return them in hopes that GE or some other company will develop one that actually dims as well as incandescents."},{"rating":"1","title":"hey don't dim! Back to the drawing board, GE","review":"I have dimmable recessed lighting in three main rooms facing north and west that are almost always light, even during daytime. So CFLs could make a major dent in our electricity bill, and ease the need to change bulbs in hard-to-reach locations. Dimming is critical in all locations.Tested on _all_ dimmers in our home - including two new ones - this bulb did not dim whatsoever. I tried leaving it on for a while, but the bulb ran a apparent full capacity even when all the incandescent R30s are barely lit. Moving the dimmer has a binary effect on this bulb - just on or off.One slight pro with this bulb is that unlike other CFLs, I've noticed that this one is at full brightness right away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hardly Dimmable, Short Life","review":"Hoping to save some money on electricity, I bought a couple of these GE Dimmable CFL bulbs for our kitchen.When the light comes on, it isn't as bright as regular flood light bulbs, and with our dimmer, it doesn't dim and brighten properly either. I figured I could deal with it, since we have a dimmer, and the regular CFL flood bulbs aren't for use with dimmers. Unfortunately, my bulb lasted LESS THAN ONE MONTH. Are you kidding me? I have never had a bulb die that quickly! And, at more than ten dollars a bulb? Not saving any money there.I have contacted GE Lighting to report this problem, but I certainly can't recommend investing your money in these bulbs at this time."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT Dimmable","review":"Avoid this product! These bulbs are advertised as \\"Dimmable\\" but they do not dim compared to the incandescent bulbs. The lowest setting on our dimmer and the bulb is still very bright.

Everyone seems to say they do not dim and I agree! I was hoping for a little more dimming, but there is very little dimming.

This is a magnificently sequenced and played performance, with a powerful and fully unified group presence. This lineup may actually be equal to the original. The concert includes four songs from the Bunnymen's then-new SIBERIA album, which ought to have been properly hailed as equal to their finest work. From the opening \\"Going Up\\" through a riveting melding of \\"The Disease\\" and \\"Scissors in the Sand\\" to a sublime closing performance of \\"Ocean Rain,\\" this represents yet another Bunnymen \\"comeback\\" of the first order.

Cadfael is an excellently drawn character, irreverent and witty and sharp. Peters spends a good amount of time in the book setting up the situation, but he does such a good job of drawing the rival characters, the landscapes, and issues of saints and religion that the book grips you all the way through. Once the mystery element does arrive, the tension heightens exponentially. Peters does an excellent job of providing the reader with many viable murderers, thereby always keeping you guessing. That builds to a truly masterful climax where Peters uses elements we've been seeing throughout the book to reveal the killer in a totally unique way.To sum up, great book that held me all the way through and is making me look forward to reading the next."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great start to a very interesting character in any century","review":"This first book in the Brother Cadfael Chronicles is interesting for its history, fascinating for its characters and consuming for its mystery. The clues are all there and in the end it is a nice, neat story. Brother Cadfael thinks the conclusion is very good and so will the reader!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very enjoyable.","review":"I like the character of Cadfael, who has come to the order later in life with a full history of experience behind him. There are interesting secondary characters and subplots that don't overshadow the primary mystery, and a clever the twist at the end.

Such an incongruitybetween the atmosphere and the main characterbecame a constant distraction and irritation.I do not recommend this book,nor am I moved to read herother works in this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"AVERAGE STORY slow pace","review":"I only listen to audio cds I have listened to many mysteries and enjoy some historical mysteries.

Maybe his later books are a bit more up beat I hope so for his sake. Please so try this story and see what you think."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perfect for insomniacs... will put you to sleep.","review":"This story starts out pretty successfully. We are shown the life of the brothers in the abbey and their daily routines. This seems to set the tone for a dull plot. Then, the reader experiences the sickness of a brother of the abbey and the mood of the story changes from the placidity of the abbey life to the chaos of trying to help the brother. This livens the book up some, but not enough. Very few exciting events happen between that point until the death of Rhisiart. After Rhsisiart's death, we are thrown back into that state of low-action; only this time, with the added commotion of trying to figure out the murderer's identity. The ending wasn't a huge shocker. It was almost too predictable from the beginning. So, all in all, I would not recommend this book unless you wanted to be easily put to sleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book required more patience than I had","review":"Having seen a number of good recommendations for this novel, I looked forward to reading it, but alas I couldn't get into the story. I say this regretfully since I don't easily give up on books. It doesn't help that the narrative takes its time to get going, with this Brother talking to that Prior using a stilted, high language. Even the words themselves feel slow.Not necessarily a bad book, just not for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Of Mystery, Monks and Miracles","review":"In this first chronicle of Brother Cadfael, the medieval monk and amateur sleuth, Peters takes us along as the Benedictine brothers travel to a small Welsh village in order to claim the relics of a neglected saint as their own. But when the community's most outspoken opponent of the relocation is murdered, Cadfael sets out to discover the killer and ends up becoming involved in the miracles attendant upon the saint. A wonderful, short mystery that has become a classic in the genre. The television adaptation starring Derek Jacobi is also highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Start of a Wonderful Series","review":"This, the original Brother Cadfael novel is great fun to read.

Most of them were dreadful, or only had one good recipe. I really like this book. The recipes appeal to me, they are easy to prepare with a limited number of ingredients, cook in the time indicated by recipe, and are very tasty. My only complaint is that some of the sauces are a bit too thin, but nothing a bit of flour or cornstarch won't cure.

So far I have made two recipes from it...German potato soup and herbed chicken with mushrooms and both came out really well. This is no gourmet fancy-schmancy slow cooker book either...while there is some prep involved with a lot of the recipes, there isn't a lot of stovetop cooking involved before you hit the on button on the slow cooker either.

They seem satisfying and are done in enough of a gourmet style that you'll be proud of yourself at the next dinner party, but the recipes are not intimidating or difficult to make because of ingredients that seem impossible to find. I like that very much. I also like the bonus section which gives wonderful recipes (many quick and easy) for more traditional cooking (stovetop and oven). My concern is that I have a 3 quart slow cooker. The recipes list the size of slow cooker needed for each recipe (that's very clever) and the smallest listed is always 3 1/2 quart. Most recipes in this book are meant for much bigger slow cookers. So now I'll have to take my chances with my cooker, or scale down the recipes. Readers should just be aware that the authors had families in mind, not single people with small slow cookers. That's a bit irritating, I must say."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have for crock pot lovers","review":"I received this cookbook for Christmas last year after perusing my mothers and almost stealing it. Since then, I must have used this cookbook a hundred times for a hundred different recipes. It has everything from simple soups, delicious appetizers all the way to full course meals to feed a whole family.My favorite chapter is the five ingredient recipes. This portion is perfect for those with very little in the refrigerator and not much time to boot.I enjoyed this culinary directorial because it has alterations on usual recipes such as \\"Spicy Bean Soup\\", \\"Oriental Pork Sandwiches\\" and \\"Country Style Ribs & Sauce\\" as well as new things I have never heard of such as \\"Poached Pears in cran-amaretto Sauce\\". I think this book is perfect for anyone with a crock pot.One thing I did notice was some of the ingredients are a bit hard to find, not in all the recipes but in some. That is the only reason I gave this book four stars instead of five."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for vegetarians!","review":"As a vegetarian, I have had a horrible time finding slow cooker cookbooks with interesting recipes. This one is a winner! I have made four recipes and we have really enjoyed each one. Many of the recipes that call for meat products can be converted to non-meat. For example, I made the Cheesy Enchilada Chowder and substituted cream of celery soup for the cream of chicken and it was fantastic! (I also usually substitute vegetable broth if chicken broth is called for with excellent results.) If you are a lacto or ovo lacto vegetarian, or you're just trying to make one meal for a family that includes omnivores and veggies, try this book. It goes way beyond the regular anemic \\"Meatless Main Dishes\\" chapters in most slow cooker books with easy, delicious recipes that incorporate flavors from Indian, Italian, German and Mexican cuisines."},{"rating":"1","title":"Biggest Book of Disappointing Slow Cooker Recipes!","review":"I am like the last reviewer - I wanted easy, chop it/dump it in and forget about it type of recipes. At first glance in the bookstore it looked good and bought it.

A pity this is the exception to the rule.All the elements that made the original Arthur great, especially the one-liners, the cinematic flow and feel of the movie, Arthur's irrepressible personality, and the naturalness of the absurdity, are all disposed.The replacement is a series of hackneyed scenes, strung together in a formulaic and unbelievable setting. It suggests a film held hostage to its executive producer - the same Moore that was genius in the first movie - attempting to shoehorn a reality play and forced character development into an environment that was so charming due to its lack of either.Three thumbs down if that is possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frank","review":"I was very disappointed in this film.

I can see why some may say they didn't like this movie. But I'll have to disagree with them. I thought Arthur: On The Rocks was actually very good, especially that scene on the stairs with the incredibly old apartment super and the slow-moving, electric chair. Very funny! The comedy in Arthur 2 reminds me a lot of the classic movies from the 30s and 40s that I like so much. If it had been made back in the 30s or 40s, I would think David Niven and Ginger Rogers would've been perfect for the lead roles and probably would've won Oscars for them. So to the sequel-phobic people out there, I say give Arthur 2 one more chance. Not only will you find out what I.O.L. is but you might like it the second time around."},{"rating":"1","title":"A sorry followup to a screen classic","review":"This is a truly unfunny followup to the classic Arthur. Arthur and Linda are married, unfortunately not happily married. They want to adopt a baby but first Arthur must sober up. Even a visit by Hobson's ghost (Gielguld) cannot bring life into this uninspired sequel.The original writer and director Steve Gordon died shortly after the original was released and it is obvious that it is missing his touch.Don't waste your time or money on this one.

It is not at all funny and touching at all. The only appearance that was worthwhile in this film was of John Gielgud as Arthur's butler, as an angel. This was not even worth it. They should just have left it where it was at the end of the first movie. Let's face it. That Gordon guy could have made a lot of good films, had he been alive. I could see a lot of excellent films just like Arthur. But when Gordon died, Arthur did too. It seems that the only reason this film was made was to try to reap the profits that the first one made. This film is not worth it in any way (Except for John Gielgud).

One is the British title, the other the title used in the States. Don't buy both."},{"rating":"2","title":"Period mystery mit schlag","review":"\\"A Death in Vienna\\" is as much a tour around the Ringstrasse of Vienna circa 1900 as it is a mystery. The story---told by author Frank Tallis in short episodes--has its characters and plot revolve around the city's landmarks like the Prater, Graben and Cafe Central while discussing the social and cultural events of the moment. The book's protagonist is a young pyschiatrist/psychoalnalyst, Max Liebermann, who is called upon by a police inspector friend to help solve the \\"locked room\\" murder of a beautiful clairvoyant, which seems to involve the occult.The plot is intricate with not a few red herrings strewn in the protagonist's (and the reader's) path.This a particularly enjoyable book for anyone with an interest in the cultural life Vienna of the early 20th Century, psychiatry, the cultural/social dynamic between Austrian Jews and Gentiles, the Secessionist Movement, pastries, or just a well-told mystery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too slow paced","review":"The book could be exciting if they cut it down by 100 pages since not a lot of action or introspection is reflected in the size of the book.

The author can sometimes be a little too 'instructional' with his aha! factoid moments (ala Dan Brown) which can be annoying but fortunately he doesn't overdo it. AND... as a bonus there is a story arc with the characters' lives (outside of the crime solving) that carries through the narrative in each book. I thoroughly enjoyed this and all the subsequent books in the series and I am eagerly awaiting the next!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I am captivated","review":"I loved this book and found myself captivated by the story and the characters. Frank Tallis, through his writing was able to transport me to another time and place which is exactly why I love to read.

They sound similar but are very distinct but i really think Modest Mouse one ups Built just in sheer amount of experimentation and how much they can sound different from one song to the next.

BTS is growing up, just like Doug is growing up. This isn't early 20's treepeople any more. There are songs that meander in and out of consciousness, like \\"You Are\\", only to be followed up by an upbeat tempo changing POP number, \\"fly around my pretty litle Miss\\". It's very creative, like what we expect from BTS, and has a lot of Soul. I just can't believe I waited this long to pick it up."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a shame...","review":"... that people review this after 1 or 2 listens. The melodies on this album are great - very distilled from normal BTS - but great. The flying guitars are not present here, and as such, it lacks what I used to think was that essential BTS-ness. But the songs do make you want to hum along. Treat it like a B-sides album. A very good one."},{"rating":"1","title":"after awhile it hurts to smile...","review":"After a great run AMOTF comes as a big disappointment. Since I bought this when it was released it hardly ever hits my CD player. It lacks the complicated lush style of Perfect From Now On, the simple sharp pop melodies of Secret, the honest simplicity of Love and the aggresive sharp edge of Wavers or the Normal Years.That's not to say it's without merit, but when the only track I can remember the name of (and the only song I play frequently and the only melody I remember) is the excellent uptempo \\"Fly Around My Pretty Little Miss\\" you know you're in trouble.I would comment on the music, lyrics, vocals and guitar acrobatics of Doug Martsch but to be honest I can't really remember them. Which sadly, is the disappointing truth and which sums up the album. it's just too easily forgettable."},{"rating":"2","title":"My 2 cents","review":"This is album is much better than most of the stuff that's out there, but I guess after four perfect albums, we really just expect perfection from Built to Spill these days. Ancient Melodies of the Future is not their best album, but it does have many moments of brilliance. \\"In Your Mind,\\" \\"Happiness,\\" \\"You Are\\" and \\"The Weather\\" I think rank among their best songs.They sound like their are going for more pop and less \\"giant\\" sound, similar to their earlier stuff, as several people have mentioned. This is not at all a bad thing; some of the best bands working today are playing pop music. And the quirky guitar work and odd rhythms are still very much there. But there seems to be less of a driving passion behind this album as there is on Keep It Like a Secret or Perfect From Now On. Or maybe I just gotta listen to it more and figure it out for myself. You should too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"How do they keep doing this?","review":"Wow. I don't understand how Doug and the rest of Built to Spill can keep putting out such amazing albums. All of them have a distinctly different feel from one another, yet somehow sound comfortable and alike. This album is no different. The song structures seem much simpler and straightforward, but not in a bad way. It seems to me that ol' Doug must have been listening to a lot of southern rock or blues since the last album, as there is a lot more slide guitar rock and straight riff-style guitar playing. Again, different from the rest of their albums, as always, but the same in that it's amazing. PS Doug, in case you're reading this, I bumped into you in an EZ-Mart in Austin after your last show there, and couldn't think of anything of substance to say. I still really can't, I guess, so I'll just say what I'm sure everyone does, and that's that you are great, and your music means a lot to us all."},{"rating":"1","title":"More of the same but less of the ROCK!","review":"On this release we see more of the same Built To Spill but with less of what we have come to love...quirky song writing and rad guitar work. Don't get me wrong this is a decent album, but it is not up to par with past releases. The album is saved, by STELLAR guest appearances by Quasi's San Coomes."},{"rating":"1","title":"no.","review":"Sorry, but... no. Built to Spill have put out several fantastic CD's... in fact, up till now, all their CD's have been pretty much fantastic. However, listening to this, you'd never know. I'm at a loss as to exactly what to say- it's just plain bad. Boring, even. Please don't buy it. Please? It'll only encourage them to create more of the same. Someone needs to tell them this is just not the quality they're capable of- NOWHERE NEAR the quality of this band, this band that might just be the best band in the world in their finer moments."},{"rating":"2","title":"New BTS!","review":"Ancient Melodies of the Future is definitely Built To Spill. Doug's voice and guitar stylings are still the same. AMOTF didn't reach out and grab me like some of their past albums, but BTS fans definitely need to complete their BTS collection with this release.I'd say Ancient Melodies of the Future is a cross between Perfect From Now On and some of their B sides from The Normal Years. They don't seem to take too many chances on this one, but then again, I haven't been able to spend much time with it yet.If you already dig Built To Spill, you'll enjoy Ancient Melodies of the Future. If you don't know much about them, I recommend you buy all of their albums in order of their releases."},{"rating":"2","title":"7 years later, and still amazing","review":"I've never considered myself a big Built to Spill fan, but this record...WOW. I bought it 7 years ago, and today (July of 2008) I find myself listening to it several times a week. It's one of those \\"onion\\" type albums, that every time you think you've gotten the hang of it, you'll peel back another layer and find yet more substance and beauty waiting for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simmering Melodies","review":"Allow this music to reveal itself to you and slowly it will become more and more amazing. What was originally marginal disappointment upon first listen has turned into something akin to staggering gratification. These songs are absolutely memerizing and hauntingly beautiful. \\"You Are\\" and \\"The Weather\\" rank among their best. Live with it, and you will reap the rewards of on one of the last truly great rock bands in America."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"I really like this new album. It is louder than their last few LP's and more distorted, but I think this is good. BTS has always been a hard rock outfit at heart, and here they really cut loose. Old fans will love it, and new fans will too."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Is A Very Good Album","review":"This is a very good album. I prefer Keep It Like A Secret more. However that is not to say that this album is not good as I have stated above it is a very good album. I enjoyed such tracks as 'Strange' 'The Weather', 'Alarmed', and the groove inducing 'You Are'.All in all this is a very good album, it is more of a return to the snappy short melodies of their 1994 album 'There's Nothing Wrong With Love' But it still has the production values of the last two albums giving it a spacey atmospheric feel. This is a very good album.cheers."},{"rating":"2","title":"sounds good to me","review":"i like this album. i enjoy built to spill's short and sweet pop songs more than their drawn-out guitar epics. favorite songs: the host, the weather, fly around my pretty little miss, strange. there's not much to say except, if you like built to spill, especially KILAS and TNWWL, then you'll like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Simple...","review":"Is this their best album?

For those who waste their money on this book: Brodie and her ilk are laughing all the way to the bank."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally biased and false","review":"This book was written, using anti-Mormon documents as sources for the propoganda. Ms. Brodie was not writing this book as a true informative study of the LDS church. She was writing this as a way to spread intolerance. This book may be a convenient way for people to disprove Joseph Smith and the LDS church, but it is completely ignorant of the facts.Honestly, would you want to trust someone who started writing a book convinced that she was going to find out that the church isn't true and that Joseph Smith was a liar? Why would she even want to \\"research\\"? She already knew what she wanted to find, so she was basically wasting her time.This book is definitely one to AVOID!"},{"rating":"1","title":"True But Yet False","review":"This book clearly shows who Mr. Smith was. Mr. Smith was merely a con artist and like a good con artist he was able to convince others to follow him. Unlike, as other have point out in the reviews; he is nothing close to a profit or a preacher. Yes, he was human, but he chose to manipulate others in his \\"quest\\" to be perfect. The fact that he was human clearly says that he was never perfect and now that he has died shows that he will never be perfect in any stretch of the imagination. I have read book upon books about the Mormon cult (both for and against) and this is not a book that I would recommend to someone. I would especially not recommend this book to someone who would like to be apart of the cult as it is more one sided. A great book to read would be The Kingdom of the Cults By Walter Martin. Not only does this book tell the complete store of Smith but it also tells the changing history of the Mormons."},{"rating":"1","title":"Discredited and disreputable","review":"When reviewing a critical biography, it helps to know who the author is. Ms. Brodie is a disgruntled niece of former Mormon Church president David O. McKay. What better way to attempt to tarnish the family name than to smear the name of the prophet that founded the Church your uncle led?Well, Ms. Brodie's book has been discredited by far more knowledgable scholars like Hugh Nibley, among others.

I was surprised to find that it wasn't. Obviously Brodie doesn't believe that Smith was a prophet, so this book is written from that perspective.

I came out respecting Smith for who he was and what he accomplished, regardless of whether I believed his claim or not."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book you'll find about Joseph Smith","review":"I'm not a Mormon, but I am fascinated by Joseph Smith, Jr. And if you want to know more about the man there is no better book than Fawn Brodie's outstanding biography. Filled with relevant and damaging facts, interesting quotes, and information the Mormon church would probably like to keep hidden, it's the book you need to read if you want to know more about the Mormon prophet. Even though it can get bogged down in detail it's still a great read. She has certainly done her research on the man and it shows on every page."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spellbinding and Beautifully Researched","review":"Mrs. Brodie, a highly respected historian, has written what must still be the definitive book on this charismatic and controversial American figure. Since she was raised a Mormon and had access to documents that the Church normally forbids to outsiders, she is able to separate out aspects of the \\"official\\" biographies of Smith from the realities of his life and times. I was struck by how admiring, in many ways, she is of him: unlike the Church's view, which paints him as completely unlearned (thereby strengthening the argument that the Book of Mormon had to be the word of God), she celebrates his energetic inventiveness, the facility with words and ideas that might have made him a novelist had he had a more conventional education. She also has meticulously researched the trends and climate of the times which inform practically every word of the Book of Mormon. A fair and admirable piece of history writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Before L.

Her sources are firmly documented and she provides excellent footnotes, which allow the reader the opportunity to conduct further research. As is so often the case, when one lifts the veil on the early history of the Church of Latter Day Saints, one cannot avoid a convoluted, confused, and sordid picture. Like many other impartial scholars before and after her, her sincerity earned her excommunication from the church, which does not feel historic truth should be pronounced unless it is \\"faith-promoting.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book for students!","review":"When it comes to the life of Joseph Smith no one does it better then Frawn Brodie.This is the perfect book for students researching Joseph Smith and the Mormon Church.

This is just another person trying to jump on the band wagon of anti-mormon books who likes to use lies to prove there point.

How do I know this - I have spent the last two years in extensive research of Joseph Smith, Jr. I read dozens of books, diaries, letters and journals. Fawn Brodie's was by far, the worst one I read because she took a personal agenda and applied it to an historic subject.

This cannot be accomplished and Fawn Brodie failes. This is not the history of Joseph Smith the man or the prophet.

Most, if not all, of the reviews by Mormons were scathing reviews of both the book and Ms. Brodie's personal character. This is no doubt because the author writes of Joseph Smith's life, the gold-mongering, the rampant polygamy (justified by a revelation-of course), and the other very human desires and actions of Joseph Smith factually and without bias. If an unbiased look into the life of Joseph Smith is what you're looking for, then this book is for you. If you wish to believe that the character of Joseph Smith is unmarred by greed, power-mongering, murder and adultery, then you should stick to LDS-sanctioned biographies; since this bio will leave the honest reader seeing Joseph Smith as, very much, just a man; who, although full of charisma, charm and vision, certainly lacked in honor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comprehensive book to date","review":"This is the most comprehensive, factual book about Joseph Smith's life to date.

Although she did discredited some of the stories sensational stories about Joseph Smith, her book suffers from two major flaws.1. She tends to ignore information and resources that don't support her preconceived ideas.2. The book reads more like a novel than a true history. She knows more about what Joseph is thinking than any biographer can know. This criticism was dismissed by her supporters, but when she used the same technique on a biography of Thomas Jefferson, then those who knew better were strong in their denunciation of her work"},{"rating":"1","title":"Who is the real author?","review":"Is the real author Peter Dimock or Fawn Brodie?

If you have read other non prejudiced books then you will be able to see the distortions here. If anybody REALLY wants to know facts, get The Encyclopedia of Mormonism by McMillian, it is only four volumes and was not put out by the LDS (they took a year to review it before they endorsed it!) though many LDS were asked to submit articles (only makes sense if it is about them) there is even a whole subject on Anti-LDS of over several pages which gi ves titles of Anti-LDS books and authors!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Can one give less than one star?","review":"How tiresome.

Brodie has been able to dig up some little known and little talked about events to be sure, but she places primary importance on these facts and pieces them together in a fashion that exposes a pretty strong personal agenda. Brodie is a master at brushing by events that do not support her agena. Much more than her poor presentation of facts, I am concerned that Brodie seems to \\"know\\" what Smith and others were thinking when the events unfolded. Most of her conclusions could be argued if not absolutely proven false. If you are looking for the truth about Mormonism, there are much better books out from both Mormon and Non-Mormon sources."},{"rating":"1","title":"No M'am that's not history","review":"I am amazed that this book is still being sold and getting positive reviews. I spent two years researching the claims of this books and discovered that the woman is just a bald faced liar. She quotes out of context, to give a totally opposite meaning, and just plain makes up stuff. Brodie was a disaffected Mormon with a grudge. She also did some hatchet jobs on some of our nations' founding fathers. She presumes to read Joseph Smith's mind, omits important information, distorts and abuses the facts. A couple of little books written in rebuttle have been No Ma'am That's Not History, by Hugh Nibley, and Exploding the Myth about Joseph Smith, the Mormon Prophet, by F.L.Stewart. A fair book about Joseph Smith I would reccommend is Joseph Smith, an American Prophet by John Henry Evans (a non-Mormon) or the The History of Joseph Smith by his mother, Lucy Mack Smith.

I have had to rig them up in various ways to make them hold the strings in - thus string changes are frustrating, which are enough to worry about with a 12 string. And to beat the band I restrung my new guitar and now the string action has become high as the neck has begun to bend outward. I'm using light gauge strings - not heavy.

It was much more than a 'wonderful plan for our life\\". I purchased four copies after reading this book, to give to people who may not understand healing.Really take a look at the scripture texts and the solid biblical thesis for his case. Do not allow those who have distorted his teachings after affect your view of what he taught.

I read this book, the more I read the angrier I got, how any one dare put this illness as my fault. I am a very strong Christian and total believe, that if it be God's will, you will be healed. I have prayed for a miracle healing, but God chose to heal me through the doctors and not through denial of this illness. I refuse to believe it is my fault that God did not make this illness just disappear, like it was never there. I feel God allows things to happen to strength your faith, not to accuse you of lack of faith. I have grown even closer to him because of this illness and if you received this book because you have an illness just keep praying to God to keep you strong. God knows we have weakness but he still loves you and is there for you. Just keep your eyes on him and do not feel guilty for an illness that is satan's fault not yours."},{"rating":"1","title":"I have not read it yet.

Bob, Spud, Lofty, & Mr. Bentley all had different voices than the original series and movies. Bob & Spud were especially difficult to listen to. This movie did not hold my children's attention the way the other Bob the Builder movies have. I'm sure it's because of the voices. The environmental message was a bit overdone, but we could even tolerate that if the voices weren't so different! I would NOT rebuy this movie knowing what I know now. We should have borrowed it from the library instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bob's Plan is to go PC in a big way","review":"First off, the voices of Bob and most/all the rest are different. Spud is British-- Farmer Pickles imports scarecrows?Bob is an anti-development, tie-dye wearing environmentalist. Instead of showing the positive and negatives of large developments in Sunflower Valley, developers are shown as bad guys. Bob has a nightmare, complete with menacing music, as big buildings grow from the ground everywhere, obliterating the idyllic valley.I love nature, and am for careful planning, but this is way over the top. And while reclycling is good, chanting \\"Reduce Recycle Reuse\\" cultishly is a bit too much for me.

I have shared my copy with all my friends so they would be able to experience one the best all around movies I have seen. The script is very well written and delivered, the cinematography is excellent (the fireworks battle with the allusion to vietnam is superb), and the musical score can give you goosebumps. On a trip through west Texas on I-10 I happened to glance off the highway, saw a dilapidated building about 100 yards from the road and immediately recognized it Chato Ortegas, the bar which was one of the road trip goals. How many times do you have to watch a movie to recognize a building like that with just a glimpse? Several. And as far as this movie goes, everytime is a rewarding experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok but a bit tedious at times","review":"I don't get the love for this little known pic. I thought it got off to a woefully slow start - in fact, I fell asleep - but then picked up a bit for the big parachute sequence. The hippy dippy pilot is repulsive, but entertaining. Then it bogged down again for the wedding sequence. I saw little to nothing that was comic here. The soundtrack is ok, but the Pat Metheny jazz fusion under the wedding sequence did not fit with the rest of the music which was period rock, and incorrect at that. Actually, Elton John's \\"Saturday Night's Alright for Fighting\\" came out long after 1971 when this picture is set. Otherwise, there is little to nothing to signify that this was 1971 in the picture. I was disappointed about that."},{"rating":"2","title":"talked to judd nelson about \\"fandango\\"","review":"i have left a review previously but since then i had a quick chat with judd nelson on the set of \\"big beat heat\\"(the alan freed story-nelson). i am a photographer and was doing some portraits of judd. and i relayed to him one of my favorite scenes in the film. the scene in which he is bathing in a car wash hair still full of soap, quarters run out. while dorman is rinsing phil's hair gardner tries to explain the importance of a being a teenager and having fun.(\\"it's a privilage of youth....you know phillip when your old...\\" all the while phil shots down the arguement with \\"our youth is over, we are responsible adults now\\". judd nelson upon hearing this he cracked a warm smile and said he had fun doing the film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fandango","review":"I have loved watching this movie through out the years on TV when offered.

The DVD out now captures all of the original movie. To me, the soundtrack of this movie is half of its appeal. Like \\"Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?\\", \\"Phenomenon\\", and \\"In the Heat of the Night\\", the music makes this movie. Whoever picked the Soundtrack knew exactly what they were doing. Any movie that can take Elton John, Steppenwolf, Pat Metheny and Blind Faith and make all those songs work together knows what they are doing. I agree with many of the other reviewers that this was one of Kevin Costner's best roles. He nailed it in this one. For those of us inspired by the \\"frat boy\\" atmosphere of Animal House - this was a great movie. The incident with the train and the front end of the Cadillac and the \\"Pecos Parachute School\\" were priceless (in addition to the Soundtrack; the guy running the parachute school made the whole movie)."},{"rating":"2","title":"life is based on choices","review":"What can I say this one hell of a movie.

I've also tried 12 different refills, and more than half of them stopped working after a few days or don't work at all. I've had the best luck with black (3/4 are good), but the other colors are all very sketchy. Purple doesn't work at all, oranges and reds and green might work if you write slow enough. On the other hand, Cross will replace the refills for free, but it's still a hassle and you'll likely get non-working refills as a replacement too."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY","review":"As with all the previous reviews, I too have had absolutely no luck with these gel refils. They have lasted 2 days to 2 weeks, with the ink flow suddenly stopping. I have NEVER emptied a cartridge yet, of any color! This has be absolutely frustrating when I have wanted to take notes or make a quick note for someone. Stay away from this product and anything that uses it. It is an absolute waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic ballpoint experience as long as the ink flows...","review":"The Cross Ion ballpoint pen is a clever sexy pen that is normally a joy to write with - the ink is deep black, the line strong and oddly malleable, with a smooth flow over paper in any direction. Unfortunately, the ink cartridges suffer from a major flaw - they occasionally stop writing, with lots of ink still in them. So, within one pack of five, one cartidge might write until it is empty and another dry up after two days with no difference in use. That is why one should always buy a five cartridge pack."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor quality refills","review":"My Cross Ion pen worked great but every refill I have purchased so far has failed within a few days to a couple of months (of light use).

I was able to carry the pen in my pant's pocket and it wrote smoothly. Unfortunately, although the refills have been rather expensive, the last four or five that I have bought have not been dependable at all--they hardly write! So I like the pen, but I hate the refills. I am now looking for a new pen, because the pen is obviously worthless without dependable refills being available."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustration","review":"When these pens work they are amazing, however, the refills are very bad. They may write beautifully for up to a month, but, although it looks like there is still plenty of ink in the cartridge, the pen will no longer write. It has come to the point where I test them before I buy them at the store and if they fail to deliver, I return them. This is a real problem buying through mail order, but I do love the Ion when it works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Finally! Someone's made a cure for insomnia!","review":"A deadly virus kills 5 billion people in the year 2010, and everyone depends on a drug called Absolon to survive.The production design leaves a lot to the imagination. I don't care how low their budget was...they could have made it look better. It looks like they spent half their budget on a special effects shotin the beginning and a 3-D biohazard symbol in the opening credits. They would have been better off spending their money on better sets.The dialogue is full of wimpy clichés, and all of the acting is dry. Sadly, though, the dialogue is slightly less boring than the action scenes.This is the worst movie Christopher Lambert has been in since Highlander 2: The Quickening.I guess if you want to watch a stupid movie just to laugh at, you could go with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great door, good fit!","review":"This is a great door and fits really well into my patio door.

The door sweep and the foam strip really help the fit."},{"rating":"1","title":"doggie door falls short of perfect, but still a nice luxury","review":"The fit isn't ideal as our sliding door is wider than the pet door so the locks couldn't align. When I called customer service hoping they'd have some spacers for what should be a common issue for them, they told me to use a stick in the patio door for security instead. Additionally, the weather stripping for the door just fell off from it's own weight, leaving the glue goop all over the sliding glass door in addition to the wind gushing in through the gaping gap. They are sending new weather stripping so I hope that proves better. Nice company service, but you'd think all these tweaks would be figured out by now. Nonetheless, we have jerry-rigged the doggie door and it offers great luxury for us.

Unfortunately, these cookies remain cookies, though if you can limit yourself to one pack, you could be doing yourself, and your diet, a favor.These cookies taste reasonably good. They have a satisfying crunch and a mild flavor. Perhaps the only problem with them is that it is easy to be tempted into a second package; and then a third. Stop at one package and at least your calorie intake will be reasonable for a snack.If you must have a cookie and you can limit yourself to a single package, by which I do not mean the entire box, then these cookies are a good choice.

When I ordered this item, I was under them impression that when it said pack of 6, it meant that I would get six boxes with six bags of cookies in each. Nope.

It cuts smoothly every time. Because of the clear plastic edges, there's no guesswork involved in setting up the cutting line for small pieces. There is a grid on the bed of the trimmer, marked for setting up bigger pieces without having to examine the path of the cutting blade. Amazing amongst trimmers, this one is actually true to the right angle between horizontal and vertical. The trimmer weighs more than plastic ones, but I still use it on my lap for last minute adjustments in card-making.

Eventually the utility knife will damage the plastic ruler which at that point I will need to throw away the cutter.I didn't give the cutter 1 star because the concept is very good, they just need to prevent the blade from moving to make it a 5 star product."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK, but not Fantastic","review":"Ok, it does what its supposed to do, but with extreme focus and effort. To \\"lock\\" your paper into place, you have to push on a piece of flimsy plastic that does not stay down evenly along the paper edge. So, with one hand, you push down in the front, and with the other hand at back with cutter in hand, you push the cutter down to cut and slide forward until your hands meet. It takes a LOT of pressure on the cutter for it to cleanly cut through 1 sheet of photo paper. Also, there are no printed directions on how to use it, except on the item itself. They are pretty minimal.In the end, I find it hard to use, and hard to get accurate straight cuts every time. Accuracy is probably 75%. So, I have to redo 1 of every 4 cuts.

Has held up well over the years.CONs:- Cutting bulk quantities 10 at a time is a little tedious.- After lots of bulk cutting, the cutting mat gets deeply etched, causing cuts to be ragged.Tip: I ran a red permanent marker along the right edge of the clear plastic hold-down bar...makes it easier to see when you are lining up precise cuts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not help","review":"This book is like all of the other books.

From the power-pop to the experimental stuff, it's all here.Yes, as others have mentioned the sound is not great in places - but don't be deceived by the start, as the sound does improve after a few songs. The picture quality is what you would expect of a 23-year old video tape transfer, but I didn't notice any interference lines or screwed up colors on my copy, my DVD player is just over a year old.

So I wound up skimming over some parts like that. But there were some details here and there of interest.

Well I purchased the full length Cd and then experimented with other ones. The Peel Sessions track is mind blowing. It is a lenghty remix yet it moves about. It does not bore you but rather takes you on a journey. The Hartnoll brothers (Orbital) were influenced by the John Peel sessions at during their young teenage years. They made the right call having this song remixed by Peel on BBC. Get it and enjoy the sound. It is hard to find the cd single but well worth it if you find it.

Also, every track on it had never been previousily released, which is a big plus. What I'm saying is that this single offers NOTHING that you wouldn't already have if you'd purchaced earlier releases.

You can keep track of breakfast,lunch,dinner plus snacks and how much you exercised and what you did. Its also got great tips on every page and sections to keep track of your thoughts, progress and goals. I lost a total of 35 lbs in like 6 months using this religously and eating right and exercising.

As this was a Christmas gift, I don't know if it will be honoured for return & replacement, as I am not in posession of the receipt.In short, this is a piece of garbage, brand new but doesn't work. We have recently retired a (two-slice) Toastmaster patented in 1953, which functioned very well for some 50 years, until one of the elements quit functioning. I guess the name Toastmaster does not appear to stand for quality any longer, as it had in past decades. That's too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Not recommended, boring.

I am not sure why I bought this- and I will get a little fun out of it, but I will be passing it on as it is not a keeper.

The program is easy to install and use, however, I found it to be at least 2 years out of date, if not more, and with old GDI's.

The number of synonyms it offers for many words is pitifully small--just a few in many cases.

Astrid Proll's short 1998 narrative and musings on her experiences makes somewhat interesting reading, but this is not a history or work of analysis, and readers who are seeking such will be disappointed. _Pictures on the Run_ serves as a unique and invaluable accompaniment to Stefan Aust's volume, and should be seen as such. If the reader isn't already familiar with the photo subjects, s/he will only be perplexed by the single line captions. If like me, however, you are intrigued by the RAF and the Deutsche Herbst, you will keep this book beside you as you read Aust, Becker, Vague, and Baumann.

The crimes committed by the group were hideous and, how better to squeeze a little more out of the publicity by justifying them?The photographs in this book are bad, taken by an amateur and tell no story. They're of minimal interest and do nothing to help explain anything of what really went on behind these scenes. I do not understand how the reviewer from the New York times can describe the pictures as \\"daunting\\" ad \\"carefully selected\\". They're a haphazardly thrown together group of nothing. If these were the best of the bunch, the bad ones must have been terrible.I think I might be a little less hostile if this book were a lot cheaper, but I was expecting a lot more substance and pictures of more than marginal interest.

Most of the game result comes down to pure luck and good timing in the use of wildcards. The reason this is the case is that the game requires a 5 in a row to win, but the rows you can play are bingo style to cards you are drawing... So it ends up being mostly pure chance.I do like that the game is extremely easy to learn, so from that perspective its a plus, but there are a lot of card games and board games that are just as easy to learn, but significantly more interesting from a strategy perspective.While this is likely to be a fun family game, it's pretty terrible for adults who play board games in general"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun times!!","review":"I first played this game when I and my 20yr old son were invited to a friend's house for dinner and we had a blast.

It is a little confusing at first, but once you get the hang of it it's fun. There is quite a bit of strategy involved in playing and winning. You and your partner try to get rows of 5 cards in a row, matching the cards in your hand to those on a board. Jacks are the wild cards and help in removing your opponents pieces from the board or to block their attempt to get a row of 5. Some games are quick while others are long and challenging, requiring rethinking your plan of attack.

I really like the removable liner, but the adjustable baking racks are very difficult to move from one position to another."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful, any way you slice it!","review":"I purchased this toaster oven for two main reasons: the Toastmaster name and the removable oven liner for easy cleaning. I give good marks to the oven-liner concept, but that is the only positive feature of this appliance. Since new, it has been sorely inconsistent as a toaster. Set the control to one setting, and your toast will come out differently each time. It commonly burns toast at the lightest setting. Now the door handle has fallen off. It's going in the recycling bin, where I should have put it long before now. Do yourself a favor and buy something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous product","review":"I owned this toaster oven for 6 months.

It was rather bland and the topic just annoying. I was hoping it would spend more time making fun of Washingtong fashion and less time talking about reality makeovers.

Sure, in any armchair detective mystery there is the whole \`this person just happens to stumble into trouble pretty often' factor, but the stress this novel put on it was grating.

Definitely overrated!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This series didn't start out great, but now it's gotten just terrible.The author seems to be trying to go for \\"snappy\\" and \\"witty\\" with her dialogue and she's falling far short. It comes across as awkward, juvenile and cliched. And the italicized asides are very annoying -- if there wasn't so much drivel, the asides could be worked into the actual conversations, rather than distracting the reader by appearing after Lacey speaks.Rose and Cherise were like a couple of cartoon characters. There was nothing believable or enjoyable about them at all. And it made no sense that an independent adult like Lacey would drag them around with her and put them in danger, catering to their idea that crime solving is fun, rather than putting her foot down that she had to work and they couldn't come tag along with her.On top of all this, the ending was very predictable. You could figure out the murderer almost as soon as he appeared in the story.I gave this series enough chances. I'm done with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great cure for insomnia","review":"If you need something to read before bed, that isn't fast paced or mind bending, this is book is for you. It's also a great read if you suffer from insomnia. I think the Lifetime movie was better and that's saying a lot since it was pretty awful in its own right. The dialogue is clipped, unfunny, and the lead character is annoying.

Its not brain surgery or world peace, but its clever and entertaining and a lot of fun. Not the run-of-the-mill female detective type of book, nor is it a woman's romance novel.

This process has made me extrememly leary of DVD purchases."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The great comics that appeared for years on the Tonight Show, such as Don Rickles and Rodney Dangerfield, are largely ignored. All the great band music isn't here. Only one singer is featured, Bette Midler, crooning to Johnny on the final show. Only traces of the opening monologues appear. The best feature is a Steve Martin bit on the second disc: The Great Flydini. Now that's funny!

For example, the disc starts out with a very lame Buddy Hacket routine. It does have the wonderful segment with George Gobel, but then even that one was disappointing because they did not show the last of that segment, the part where Hope flicks ashes into Martin's drink. I saw that show when it aired, and it is among the top 5 best. But it could have been better.Disc two has a few great skits, but the second half covers a large part of the next to last show, and that show is shown in its entirety on Disc Three.I enjoyed this set of DVSs, but it wasn't worth the $30 we paid, and that's $20 less than the price here. I have to give this set at this price only a single star."},{"rating":"2","title":"Share a good laugh!","review":"I bought these CDs for my husband. He has really enjoyed them as I have as well.

That was a mixed blessing. I like the clarity and the extras on the DVDs. However, motion is blurred much more than the original broadcast presentation. It looks as though there was a synchronization problem when transferring to a digital format; or they transferred it to a hi-resolution film stock. It was very distracting...and very disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not enough material, but still very enjoyable","review":"While I agree with many of the reviewers that there are far too few clips in this set, and they are often too short, there is still enough good material to be able to sit back and remember what Johnny Carson's Tonight Show was all about.Surprisingly, I found one of my favorite parts of the set to be \\"Johnny Goes Home\\", the 1982 documentary about Johnny's visit to his hometown. It's not a \\"laugh-a-minute\\" show, and obviously wasn't meant to be. It's a very warm, nostalgic trip back in time. It's not the least bit boring, as some reviewers have said.Let's hope the Carson family will decide to release more clips from the Tonight Show on DVD, perhaps even entire shows, so that those of us who fondly remember when Johnny was King of Late Night can see many more of our favorite moments."},{"rating":"1","title":"Carson was great, but was there an editor on this?","review":"There is some good stuff on both discs two and three, but both are just so-so. There is way too much on the last JC show that was aired and the second to last show aired. An overemphasis on these programs takes away from the look at a great career.To me, the only exceptional disc is the first. Some of the black and white excerpts are simply wonderful. The best of these is when Pearl Baily drags Johnny onstage for a command performance as part of a duet.Other great segments include Dean Martin stealing the show without a word as George Goebel ( sic? ) is being interviewed.And a cleancut George Carlin in 1966.Strongly agree with another's comment that it was a mistake to show the Buddy Hackett interview. Hackett was a no-talent dimwit who wasn't funny then, and he sure ain't funny now.It would have been easy to create a magical three discs of Johnny Carson moments.
