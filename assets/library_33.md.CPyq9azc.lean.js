DeNiro not only gavethe best performace of the year (1976), arguably the best performance in all of cinema. This film introduced Martin Scorsese (Goodfellas, Casino) and one of the best actors the world will ever see, Robert DeNiro. The only reason this DVD does not achive the 5-star rating is because of the extras. Very good in their own right, but this movie deserved better.

'Taxi Driver' is a dark, intense portrait of a man sliding over the edge in a city bigger and fouler than it's inhabitants. Our protagonist is both predisposed and gently pushed towards the inevitable climax but ironically, is not judged in the end. Rather than having a strong story, the movie presents itself in a 'day-in-the-life' format. Simply brilliant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dame Cleo at her best.","review":"Actually, she has never given anything BUT her best, but this album showcases her amazing vocal range and ability to sing ANY kind of song.

It's a thoroughly enjoyable product and social concensus shouldn't even factor in the decision.The material feels great and is extremely easy to clean and maintain. There isn't a comparable product for the price besides the Tenga line, which I have no experience with but their non-disposable product is twice the price. However if you're expecting an experience comparable to intercourse, you simply can't find it in a sex toy. That being said, it's a fun distraction with only a few problems. The price may be a little too high for something you basically have to buy blind, and the original insert simply lacks the stimulation of later company entries. If you really want to try one of these grab one of the tight or super-tight(or better yet pornstar)inserts instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Feels great","review":"The Fleshlight is amazing for how it feels, especially if you warm it up on hot water before using it.

There are no samples to listen to! That should have stopped me right there. I was looking for east-west fusion music I could play for massage sessions, real music not schmaltz. I believed the reviews that said this music was soothing yet uplifting, great for meditation or yoga. I should have paid more attention to the one (Hamilton) who said it was a little too upbeat for meditation. The opening track sounds like the Army of the People's Republic of China is about to march. The rest? Uptempo to the point of being bouncy. Not my idea of calm. Who is doing yoga to this?!

This movie is classic Jean Harlow all the way. Anita Loos provided the snappy dialogue to keep the story moving, and Jean added the comic touch. \\"Red-Headed Woman\\" is the story of Lil Andrews, a girl from the wrong side of the tracks, who works her way up from the office to the country club. Jean, without her platinum blonde hair, is absolutely perfect in the role of Lil. Una Merkel is a winner in a supporting role as Lil's best friend. This definately is Jean Harlow at her finest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jean's Red-Headed Pre-code","review":"This is a strange, but humorous movie about an ambitious red-head who sleeps her way into high society.

An absolute must for Harlow fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Depression Era Story","review":"I am in total agreement with reviewer ixta coyotl, about Leila Hyams. I asked myself how Chester Morris's character could prefer Harlow over her. I often find the less remembered actresses of the studio days to have more sex appeal for me than do the super stars of that era. Hyams is one of them. Another who comes to mind is Madge Evans.

Don't waste your money here. Lemonaid Guide to Used Cars is a far superior choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"I love a good chic book, but these are awful. I should have checked the copyright dates I guess, these are both recycled from the early '80s. And I guess I won't believe Nora Roberts' recommendations again, either. In short, these two novels are simply silly. The writing reads like something from an overwrought high school girl. If you have an IQ above 80 you will be bored silly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eating in Montreal","review":"This book is wonderful for finding \\"out of the way\\" spots to eat in Montreal. I borrowed a copy some years ago and found it excellent. Therefore, when I saw it offered, I ordered it, assuming that it would be updated -- the description did not give a date of refision. When I got the book, I was dismayed to see that it is in fact a 2006 edition -- a lot will change in restaurants in 6 years!.However, our planned trip to Montreal has been postponed from New Years to March so I'll be interested to find out which of these places are still operating but it would be really nice to have recent reviews."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read How I Made 2 MIllion First","review":"This book is no way near as good as the first. It is mostly the same material told in a less engaging way. He uses the metaphor of Wall Street as Roulette Game in a Casino which cheats it's clients. If you like Darvas's first book it is certainly worth reading to gain little insights on his method which youdon't get in the first. There a few new anecdotes and a chapter which explains his method but on the whole the book is not as amusing a read and lacks the freshness of the first, nor do I think it takes his story much farther than where the last ends. I would love to know what happened to Darvas in the late sixties and early seventies but not in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lay me back and drill my teeth... please!","review":"I have always been a fan of Maureen's since I heard her sing in person 25, or so, years ago. Unfortunately, that time period seems to be exactly where these unimaginitive, Karoke-styled arrangements have been lifted from. Her voice is still there; untouched yet more disappointingly, unchallanged. This album lacked imagination, and strong presentation necessary to make it at best, interesting. Bottom line, poor arrangements, weak vocals and looser music direction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Big Band Jazz","review":"If you like big band jazz, and especially Basie jazz, this is the recording for you.

This is a live recording form 8/76 made at a Los Angelas jazz nightclub.What a group! Trumpeters Blue Mitchell, Bobby Shew, Bill Berry; Sax section:Plas Johnson, Richie Kamuca, Marshal Royal; Ernie Andrews, vocals.

It felt a little sketchy for the scope of the narrative, which involves slave rebellions, voodoo, the extravagances of colonialism, all set in the tropical heat of Haiti. Perhaps its charm lies in hinting at possibilities, and yet I expected more from a writer who is often considered the father of magic realism. I found myself wondering how I would have reacted to the book if I had read it 20 or 30 years ago. Maybe with more intensity, more awe. Ultimately I was glad I read it as an historical perspective, and as a way of understanding the seeds of inspiration he undoubtedly provided other writers, who delved more deeply into the implications of a form of fiction that was not yet fully realized."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT SURREALIST TAKE ON THE HORRORS OF ENSLAVEMENT","review":"THIS NOVEL IS A FRESH AND UNIQUE APPROACH TO ILLUMINATING THE TERROR OF CULTURAL AND PHYSICAL DESTRUCTION OF A PEOPLE BY COLONIALIST ENSLAVEMENT.

Of course, they all have to do with dragons, but several fall in the Hero goes to slay Dragon formula. The Orson Scott Card does not seem to fit in the traditional dragon formula and is the outstanding story. The Anne MaCaffrey is good but overwritten at points. I expected more from the Zelazny. It was very good, but Zelazny has done such mind-blowing work that this seems to be a bit trite. The Friesner is hillarious and the best of the funny stories in this book. The Martin and Tilton are quite good, but not estradordinary.

However, just like everyone else, their satisfaction & happiness rely on their sense of completeness (to be depended upon & needed once again) & yes, to be loved. This book takes a look at what the elders (have to)do to cover those long barren hours in their twilight years..often drowning in senile depression should they fail to find something worthy of their time & attention. However, it was presented in a funny way --- what with Mrs. Washington playing an over-aged 'Cupid' to two elder lovey-dovies, & later on becoming a victim of 'granny romance' in the end.

It is a very different account of the war in that it does not review battles or troop movements. It does give an insight into the common Southern attitudes concerning the North, slavery, the War and Sherman. If you \\"read between the lines\\", you gain an understanding of prevailing attitudes from many things she does not say. An example of this is her brother whom she writes extensively and very affectionately. What she never plainly states or even casually refers, is that he is a half-brother. Family is extremely important to her and the fact that she does not share the same father with her siblings has no bearing on her affection towards them. Miss Gay was in her mid-thirties during the war. This is an adult civilian perspective of the war between the States."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring mystery, more boring discourse on ethics","review":"This was my first exposure to Smith's work and I was excited: he has such a big following. I lasted 50 pages. Except for a visit to the symphony and a walk to her duaghter's corner deli, the main chatacter could have been a brain in a vat. She seems to live 90% of her life inside her head. I learned from my fellow reviewers that this is a book on applied ethics. Smith tells us that it is unethical for a reporter to visit the parents of a dead boy the night after his surprise demise. Go figure. He also tells us that a mother doesn't know how much to meddle in her daughter's love life. Again, go figure."},{"rating":"2","title":"The different style shows McCall Smith's genius","review":"The different style of this wonderful mystery shows McCall Smith's true genius - he is able to write different series (this one, the Irregular Verbs and the Botswana novels) in completely different voices. I love all his many books, but I know some, for example, who LOVE this book but find the other 2 series slightly lightweight. Clearly from the reviews, some people are, alas, feeling the other way around. But why can't a writer as good and funny as McCall Smith write novels in different literary genres? I think he can, and this wonderful, thoughtful, evocative and reflective novel is proof positive of just that. Read this book and find out for yourself!

However, I did not find the main character, Isabel, to be likeable at all. She came across as judgmental, stuffy and pretentious. The story took way too long to get moving and, even then, it left me feeling empty. The ending was a tremendous letdown that frustrated me and had me wondering why I bothered to finish reading this book in the first place. I really hurried through this book so that I could read something more interesting and satisfying. The main character's internal dialog was excessive and long-winded. There was too much philosophizing and too many references (obscure to me) to music, books and art."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Sunday Philosophy Club","review":"This was a soft book - - no violence!

An excellent beginning and an interesting cast of characters kept me reading about Isabel and her world. However, the book suddenly took a turn and ended with a most disappointing 3 or so chapters.

The book's ending did not work - at all - and I am not sure I would read another in this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not his best","review":"Oh my this book was so boring and slow compared with his other novels which I own and love.

The 'mystery' thread of the book was both weak and unsatisfying. One scary scene doesn't make up for the overall failure. The \\"philosophical\\" approach taken at the end was disappointing and not at all realistic. Unless there is massive improvement this deserves to be a series of one.That being said, the characterization of Isabel, Grace, Cat, and the rest and their relationships are superbly done and this makes the book worth at least one read. There is a polish and a sensitivity that one does not often encounter. It is largely for this that two stars are given. Pity the author hadn't managed to actually make this a part of the mystery novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I loved Precious and was delighted to meet another McCall Smith character. Although Isabel Dalhousie is an interesting and likeable character, the book was overall a big disappointment. It appears the author simply tired of the story and in order to meet the deadline for publication, ended the story abruptly, leaving the reader feeling quite cheated.

I don't think I will continue at this rate.I met McCall-Smith on his tour of Phila, and I thought he was charming. But in this book I feel like he is trying to almost show off his extensive knowledge of philosophy etc...rather than weave an intriguing and arresting story.

There is little or no character development, barely discernable story progression, and strange, unexplained references that are just plain annoying.People who have read this describe it as \\"pleasant\\" or \\"gentle\\". That's code-speak for boring and dull. If you liked \\"At Home in Mitford\\", the worst book I have ever read, you might like this. Both books have much the same feel and are similarly badly writtten.I would give it zero stars if this form would let me. Save your money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"First Isabel Dalhousie Mystery","review":"This is the first book I have read in this series. Isabel goes to the theatre for a concert and sees a young man fall to his death from the high seats. She asks gestions which leads her to believe he was most likely murdered. She begins an investigation into the death with the help of her niece's ex-boyfriend, Jamie. As with all Alexander McCall Smith it is rich in language. I like reading about other countries and ways of lif in his books.I have purchased the other books in this series and I look forward to them as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cozy reading","review":"I am a big fan of Alexander McCall Smith, having read books from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency series and 44 Scotland Street series. I enjoy his pleasant, optimistic views on people and relationships. This book is an introduction to the character Isabel Dalhousie, a philosopher, who is curious about life. Most of the book is her internal musings about all sorts of issues, which I found fascinating. This book and subsequent ones in the series taught me more about how to view life in an optimistic, wise way than entertain me with a traditional plot and storyline. This book is not a traditional mystery. I would categorize it more as a slice-of-life book, focusing on Edinburgh. For those of us in other parts of the world, this book is interesting to read more for its nuggets of philosophy and transporting us to Edinburgh than for a mystery."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT the Number One Ladies Detective Agency!","review":"I couldn't finish this book. Totally different than the charming Number One Ladies Detective Agency series which I just love. I was very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculously amatuerish","review":"I read this at the urging of a friend admiittedly biased against everything I knew about it, and I wasn't let down. It is the most ridiculously bland attempt at combining humor and mystery I have ever read. Dalhousie is not at all funny and is a cliched amatuer snoop who has little to recommend her as a sympathetic character. I confess I'm not into detective series (well, maybe the original Sherlock Holmes), but this book is an example of how publishers manipulate the market with hype and advertisng. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mainstream Literature for Intellectuals","review":"I don't know how he does it - but like Agatha Christie, A. M. Smith manages to churn out book after book of mainstream, crowd-pleasing prose that has just that touch of intelligence that makes even \\"intellectual types\\" want to read the next book. Make no mistake - this is \\"lite reading\\" - but it does not make you feel cheap or stupid for having read it. It isn't chick lit or brainless lit. It goes quickly, but there is artistry in it. The problem is he does it so well that he will be sick of writing more books in the same series long before we tire of reading them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let down at the end","review":"I enjoyed the book until the lst three pages. The end was such a let down it ruined the entire book for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Mma Ramotswe, that's for sure","review":"If you expect this to be as good as the No 1 Ladies Detective Agency books, you will be sadly disappointed as was I.

I will try another series."},{"rating":"1","title":"LIke Waiting for Water to Boil","review":"Be warned: Isabel isn't wonderful Precious.

I was hoping against hope that there were more books, and I was very glad to find there are 7, in addition to the first one."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Sunday Philosophy Club","review":"This book is slow, slow, slow. AM Smith spends a lot of space and energy on name dropping obscure and not so obscure authors and philosophers. Is this meant to be amusing? I wasn't amused. He is in love with his own words. His vocabulary is unnecessarily foggy!It took forever to tell the \\"story\\" such as it was. And the problems got solved too quickly, too easily and in unrealistic ways."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm sorry, but this was awful","review":"I absolutely love the Ladies Detective Club series, and was really excited to find that Mr. Smith was starting another series, quite different from the first. This book was, in a word, awful. I only finished it because I was trying to find some redeeming quality, but none surfaced. I normally share my books with a number of friends; this one was dumped in the Good Will box (and I apoligize to them). The plot was non-existent, the charater development was poor, and the ending was one of the most disapointing I have encountered in years. I have no doubt that there will be another in this series--there were so many plot lines left hanging, and questions asked, but not answered. Bottom line--do not waste your time or money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not one for fast action!!","review":"If you are expecting an action-packed murder thriller, you will be greatly disappointed. If you enjoy gentle-paced stories with some mystery, you will like this book. If you know anything about Edinburgh, and if you know even a little about philosophy, you will love this story, even if the \\"heroine\\" can be self-reflective to the point of paralysis.McCall Smith has written an urban, Western version of Mma Ramotswe in many ways. Isabel Dalhousie tries to use her knowledge of, and commitment to, applied ethics in everything she does, and it is fun to \\"watch\\" her struggle with the issues that she faces in her personal life every day.I really enjoyed this book, and the later ones in the series. I know a bit about Edinburgh and the Scottish people, and this book brought back some wonderful memories of my short time there.I hope that the author keeps this series going - and quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull and disappointing","review":"I tried to like this book. I like all the \\"No 1 Ladies Detective Agency\\" books and hoped this would be equally enjoyable. Unfortunately, the protagonist is not nearly as charming. She is a highly educated woman and we must sit through every single nuance of a thought that she has before she arrives at a sensible conclusion. This is intended to be \\"philisophical\\" but it is tedious and overwrought. Furthermore the story and conclusion are disappointing. I expected better.I give 1-star ratings to books I can't finish or are so dull I have to speed-read through them to get to the end (I hate to leave any book unread once I've started it). Unfortunately, this book falls into this category."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big disappointment!","review":"I bought this book because I loved the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency series of books by this author. Unfortunately, this book lacks the charm of those books, and the main character (Isabel Dalhousie) isn't nearly as interesting as Mma Ramotswe. In fact, I found her to be rather boring, bordering on unlikeable. The supposed \\"Sunday Philosophy Club\\" is only mentioned once or twice, and the members (if there are any- maybe it's a figment of her imagination) are never even introduced! The ending was extremely anti-climatic, and to get there, you have to wade through boring philosophical musings that rarely have anything much to do with the subject matter or plot (what little there is of it). I really wanted to like this book, and I tried, but McCall Smith missed the mark on this one. I hope he goes back to writing the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I too, am a fan of the Precious Remotswe series with it's gentle writing, soft discriptions, and endearing characters. Not so with this book.Boring, cold fish characters, and a pace so slow I continually fell asleep trying to work my way through this drivel.Forget this one, and just stick to The No 1 Ladies Detective Agency."},{"rating":"1","title":"Precious, where are you when we need you!","review":"I have wasted three evenings on this book, hoping that it would eventually show some of the sparkle and grace of the Botswana sextet. But no. It was a pure bomb, and I will not waste my time on another of his books until he gets back to Africa. I find it hard to believe that the NY Times said that readers of the Precious Series would love this one. It is the exact opposite, as reader comments have confirmed."},{"rating":"1","title":"A tiresome read.","review":"Compares poorly with the Ladies Detective series. The charm is all gone - what's left is a lot of heavy-handed moral philosophising. The protagonist is certainly no prig, but hardly a page goes by without her speculating or gossiping in excruciating detail about the correct or incorrect way to behave in some situation. Apparently the author thinks these tedious meanderings lend some depth and weight to the paltry storyline. I just want my Mma back."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Big Letdown","review":"I really, really wanted to like this book, I enjoy Mr. Smith's other series so much. I have to admit I couldn't even get through the book. I thought the main character pretentious and kept waiting for something to happen, to form a connection with her. Never happened. Boring, slow and just not for me. Sorry Mr. Smith, I don't normally like to write bad reviews, but I just couldn't let this one go by without a word of warning to everyone who likes the other series."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Sunday Pholosophy Club","review":"As with all his novels, I LOVE the story lines, but, in my opinion, there's too much extraneous material that's not interesting to me. I tend to skip it. In this book, it almost seemed as though the author just wanted to show the reader the extent of his knowledge."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the philosophy? And the club?","review":"Although this was a slightly pleasant cozy mystery read, I was disappointed that, not only did the Philosophy Club never meet in the book, the philosophy concepts discussed were: 1)simplistic; and 2) droning and intrusive to the story. In fact, I found most of Isabel's thoughts to herself to be far too instrusive to the plot. The ending was also abrupt and failed to tie up some loose ends and unbelievable plot elements.As most fans of Smith have noted, this is not one of his better books. Though I will probably not read another in the Dalhousie series, I may try another of his books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lazy writing, boring story...","review":"If you're looking for a page-turner mystery, this is NOT the book. In this first installment of a series I got to the end of the book and still have no idea what the main character looks like, or much on her background. The author weaves all of these erroneous details into the book that have zilch to do with the actual story. I got to the end of the book and wondered why we were even introduced to the character Toby. BORING, BORING, BORING!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm so insulted . . .","review":". . .that Alexander Mccall Smith would think readers would actually enjoy this book. It was the worst book I've ever read in my life. All attempts at jokes were flat and unfunny. There was no plot, or any relevant information to the story and the ending was pathetic. What the hell is the Sunday Philosophy Club?This so-called murder \\"mystery\\" was about as suspenseful as watching a turtle sleeping. Did his publisher even bother to read the manuscript? What boring crap!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"After reading Alexander McCall Smith's delightful \\"#1 Ladies Detective Agency\\" series, I was really looking forward to the \\"Sunday Philosophy Club\\". I was very disappointed in it, the style is quite different, rambling and tedious. It goes so far off on uninteresting tangents that I found myself skipping whole pages trying to get back to the plot. For those who loved the simplicity of the stories about Botswana's #1 detective, I would recommend avoiding Scotland's stuffy old lady sleuth...she's not Miss Marple."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Mystery with a Heart","review":"I like McCall Smith's heroines. When I read a book, there are certain things that will keep me in it until the end. A good story. A not-to-disagreeable philosophy. And sympathetic characters. AMS's mysteries contain all three of these qualities. I am not going to give away the plot, but there's a decision that Isabel Dalhousie, the erstwhile detective, makes at the end of this story that reminds me of a similar decision by Dorothy Sayer's Lord Peter Wimsey. And both decisions came out of the goodness of their hearts. This is a good mystery story, too. It keeps your attention. But I give it four stars because Isabel's ruminations get a little long-winded at times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much of a mystery!","review":"I truly wanted to like The Sunday Philosophy Club. There were, however, too many loose ends and forks in the road that didn't amount to anything suspenseful or satisfying. I kept with it to the end thinking that just maybe it would have some redeeming fabulous ending. It didn't. I don't want the author to give up though, because his Precious Ramatswe adventures were wonderful. This was disappointing knowing what wonderful stories he is capable of creating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"McCall Smith showed a great insight into character and culture with his Precious Ramotswe series. The heroine of this series reflects the decline in character and values which is found in all peoples. Unlike Mma Ramotswe, shedoes not typify the best of her people and her culture, but rather some of its decadence."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring, pretentious and disappointing","review":"What a pity. The author's books about the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency are so wonderful. One of the attractive things about those books is that no word is wasted, which is actually difficult to accomplish. In The Sunday Philosophy Club, plenty of words are wasted. It's boring, pretentious and disappointing.In this book, the main character is a snob and an interfering busybody, and the plot is thin. The most interesting character is the housekeeper, Grace.If you were charmed by No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency, skip this book. It just isn't as good."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Smugly Pretentious Clubbed","review":"Well, one can but wish...Having read & loathed this some years previously, I found myself bored, snowed into a cave in the Antarctic with nothing else to read, and, of course, suffering from a philiosophical guilt that perhaps I had not been appropriately appreciative of the literary and intellectual offerings of this book.Wrong.So I built a mini-Edinburgh out of ice and snow & then had a lovely time jumping on it & smashing the whole thing up."},{"rating":"1","title":"unlikable and rather dull heroine","review":"I picked up the first and second book in this series, but after reading the The Sunday Philosophy Club (the first entry) I think I'll stop there. The main character is rather dull and dimwitted -- especially to be a self-proclaimed \\"philosopher.\\" She bumbles her way through this \\"mystery\\" and it ends rather flatly. Disappointing work from McCall Smith. I think that if he hadn't already been an established author this would never have been picked up by a publisher."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious","review":"I have enjoyed the McCall Smith #1 detective novels, but this book was a huge disappointment. It began slowly, as did his other books, but never picked up the pace or got any better. The characters were dull and the storyline iffy at best. The ending was anti-climatic and ridiculous. No satisfaction whatsoever. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charming & Delightful","review":"I've yet to read The Number 1 Ladies' Detective Agency, or any books in that series. This is the starting novel of a different mystery series by Alexander McCall Smith.The protagonist, Isabel Dalhousie, is the editor of The Review of Applied Ethics. In spite of some fascinating philosophical and ethical tangents, this book is a light-hearted mystery with a wonderful array of characters against the backdrop of Edinburgh, Scotland. As with most popular fiction, don't expect much by way of substance. This book is pure brain-candy, but it was nonetheless a delightful read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull & Disappointing","review":"Dull and disappointing, especially after the delightful \\"Ladies No. 1 Detective Agency\\" series. It was hard to get into the story, and difficult to finish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the same spark as Ladies Detective Agency....","review":"I ran out and got this book because I had thoroughly enjoyed the Ladies Detective Agency series by A McCall Smith.I find that the main character is not likeable. In Ladies No. 1 Detective Agency Mma Ramotswe is a likeable character despite her imposition of morals onto others. There is a certain charm that generates reader interest. I don't find that to be the case in this book at all.I am not even finished the book yet but I don't know if I will be able to get through it."},{"rating":"1","title":"not #1 Ladies, and not even Portuguese Irregular Verbs","review":"I'm sorry, but the verbose ramblings of the mind of Isabel Dalhousie are not very interesting, and this murder mystery is not terribly engaging. I wanted to like this book much more than I did. Like many other Amazon reviewers, I like the simple life and the precious wisdom (pun intended) in Africa so much better. The final turn of events uncovering the mystery were disappointing too, making me wonder why I endured the book. One of the latter scenes in the story made little sense and was not explained (the \\"intruder\\"). Hmmmmmm... I really expected better from Alexander McCall-Smith."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well written but character and story a bore.","review":"I know this is not the continuation of the Botswana series, but still... and I LOVE Edinburgh, Scotland, but that still wasn't enough to redeem this bore. Parts read like a philosophy doctoral theses, cramming in as many citations and name-dropping Philosophers like mad. And the final blow after I made it all the way to the end? A total cop-out of an solution."},{"rating":"1","title":"dry, dry, dry, boring boring boring","review":"I will stick with the #1 Ladies detective series, which are very good, amusing, well written. The Dalhousie books to me are so stilted, so arid, so sterile I could not finish the first one. How can an author be so different and uninteresting in his alternative writing? I found the Dalhousie impossible to get interested in. Very disappointing. I would rate it minus 5 if it was possible."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Rainy Day Read","review":"I read the entire book on a cold rainy day sipping hot tea and nursing a cold. It was a joy to meet Isabel, her niece Cat, her housekeeper Grace and her friend Jamie and to follow Isabel in her quest to discover why a beautiful young man came falling from the balcony right past her while she was attending a concert. This young man's \\"fall from the gods\\" leads Isabel into a world she knows nothing about; the world of insider trading and shady financial dealings. Her moral compass compells her to find answers for this tragedy and she becomes a reluctant sleuth. McCall Smith writes simply and elegantly. He lets us hear the internal musings of Isabel, the criptic no nonsence advice of Grace, and lets us into the hearts and minds of the other characters. An added plus is the wonderful description of the city of Edinburgh and another highlight is the chapter when Isabel attends a concert given by the RTO, The Really Terrible Orchestra. A must read for fans of McCall Smith."},{"rating":"1","title":"A crashing disappointment","review":"While I did not expect the likes of Mma Ramotswe to be \\"transported\\" to Scotland, I did expect the author to present us with a new series marked by his easy charm and wisdom. The plot begins with the witnessing of a death, and then veers off course at great length. The constant weighing of the ethics by Isabel in every aspect of her very uninteresting existence (whether or not to pursue the events of the death; whether or not to confront her niece about a boyfriend's suspected infidelty; whether or not to publish a terribly dry and uninteresting article in an ethics journal; whether or not to take the bus or walk to the shops) drags the book down. The only bright spot is the opinionated housekeeper. Perhaps the author could build a series around her!Luckily, the title \\"club\\" never appears. If it did, I fear the police would be called in - I would have been bored to death!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Catherwood is right - McCall Smith is a genius","review":"Catherwood is right! McCall Smith IS a genius. The fact that this amazingly versatile author is able to write in so many different literary genres is living proof of a brilliant original literary mind at work. Like Catherwood I enjoyed both the Ramotswe novels, the Von Igenfeld entertainments and now this splendid mystery novel all alike. Go with Catherwood's critique and buy all McCall Smith's oeuvre, from Botswana to Edinburgh!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, painful novel - unlikeable main character","review":"I kept waiting for this book to improve, but as the number of pages left to read became fewer and fewer, I realized it never would improve. In fact, it got worse :(The overall plot went nowhere, and took quite a while to get there.The main character, Isabel, prized philosophy and living morally very highly, but was quite a hypocrite when it came to actual deeds versus words. She often bent her philosophy to justify whatever course of action she wanted to take (following Cat's boyfriend, telling Cat about her boyfriend, etc). She lives a privileged life - she doesn't seem to work very often and she has a housekeeper that comes for several hours each day despite the fact the Isabel is the only one who lives in the house. I find her completely uninteresting and extremely unlikeable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful","review":"I love the No 1 Ladies Detective series and was sure this would be the beginning of another great series. Sadly this is not the case. This book is a complete slog to get through. The characters are uninteresting, the mystery is mundane and the writing style is like a chain around your neck. The author drops name after name of Scottish painters and philosophers/writers. I felt like I was in a classroom lead by a pompous instructor who wanted to show off how well cultured and read he was. I found myself reading the same paragraphs over and over because my mind would wander from the book to more interesting things...like my grocery list."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Precious here","review":"I'm through the book and still waiting for the first charming moment. I loved the first few books in his earlier series; I wanted to like this as well. It was tough going."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I had to force myself to finish this book. The only reason I did was it was a gift and I didn't want to admit I hadn't read all of it.There just seemed to be no point to Isabel's \\"investigation\\" of the young man's death. Going to see his flatmates, she just came off as a nosy spinster looking for gossip."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Bought this because I love the Alexander McCall Smith's books in the Ladies Detective Agency series. What a tedious disappointment. I hope Smith rethinks his new heroine and her interest in Philosophy. The Scottish setting was great. Advise fans to wait for book two."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I liked it!","review":"Characters are flat. I don't really care about the Art and Music. Murder mystery was so boring I found out that I didn't care who killed him. Read 3/4 of the book and shut the pages!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!!","review":"I was completely bored by this book and had to force myself to finish it. The plot was thin, and the philosophical ramblings only slowed the pace and added nothing to the story. I can forgive a weak plot if the characters are compelling and the storytelling is interesting, neither of which were the case. This book lacks the charm of the series set in Botswana, which I have thoroughly enjoyed."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Leap into Disappointment","review":"This book hooked me with its opening scene, but then, like the young man seen on page one, it went downhill rapidly. Although I enjoyed the plots in the No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency series, its charming leading lady, and its beautifully described setting in Botswana, none of these qualities is present here. This book is thin on plot and thick on pretense, chatter, and philosophical and moral ponderings that are sometimes downright fatuous and boring. I skipped much of those passages and jumped to the dialog and plot, which meant I read this pretty quickly without missing much. I was sorry to be disappointed with this work but I don't think I'll be reading book 2 of the series any time soon. The leading lady here is just a bore."},{"rating":"1","title":"A real disappointment","review":"What a letdown! I kept reading this book hoping it would get better, but it never did. There is a real lack of charm in both characters and place, and a real overburdening of the reader with uninteresting philosophical musings. The Mma Ramotswe series is so much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Such a disapppointment!","review":"I absolutely loved the No. 1 Detective Agency series, fun engaging characters, plot that moves fairly rapidly. The Sunday Philosophy Club has none of the above. Boring characters leading a boring life. Really no interesting details about Scotland either. Unless you are in the mood for a snoozer, steer clear of this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work","review":"I bought this so I could siphon some automatic transmission fluid out of the dipstick entry under my hood.

The instuctions are confusing, have too many cross references, and assume a certain amount of skill. This is definitely not what I would call straight forward.

I assumed that a book on window treatments would cover draperies. Wrong. Nothing on draperies, not even an index entry. So draperies are not a window treatment? This is especially bad, because there is a section in the beginning where they discuss the pros and cons of different types of window treatments; without an explanation of the pros and cons of draperies, how can you decide that the curtains explained in the book are the right thing for you?

I'm a happy customer, I even counted the tests & they were all there. Use these tests as directed & it helps. Yes the 2nd line on the LH test has to be DARKER or EQUAL to the control line, it will happen, just sometimes it is hard to catch so some people test twice a day. Great product, great company, and fast shipping....totally worth it, 2nd baby due in October because of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to read - you get what you pay for.","review":"The ovulation tests are extremely confusing and hard to read. There is a line that appears that is so close to a positive line, but they say it is negative. It is nearly impossible to tell the difference between positive and negative. Can't speak for the pregnancy tests yet, as the ovulation tests have not worked well. Sure, you get a lot of tests for your money, buy spend a little more money for a better test and you'll be glad you saved yourself the aggravation.Also, even though it is shown, there is no such pink \\"baby time\\" booklet. The free booklet - \\"Vital Information You Must Know if You Want to Maximize Your Chances of Getting Pregnant Faster\\" consists of a couple of photocopied pages, very poorly written. So if you're leaning towards this one for the extra booklet, don't bother.

He is so talented and his voice is unlike any other rapper out there-dead or alive. His subject matter is honesty but mixed in a comedic way. Unlike Eminem, his subject matter changes and his voice isnt annoying to listen to after awhile. There will never be anther rapper like him. As for the cd, I will purchase it. I have a couple of mixtapes of ODB and he doesnt disappoint..his voice is so unique and unmatched. ODB to me is the greatest rapper to ever walk earth and I really miss him...I may never met him or known him, but he has a huge impact that no other artist can claim.

I'm sure Louise Post and the rest of Veruca Salt will deliver a much better album seeing as the 2001 album and 2005 EP of Veruca Salt top anything that Gordon has put out in recent years.In all a retread of 2003 Liz Phair."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drained of life","review":"I have to 'fess I only listened to the samples, but what am I hearing - a lounge act?

Unfortunately, I just couldn't find one single song that I liked, even after repeated listenings. I appreciate the entire album, as she seems to have matured in her songwriting and production values. She's finally moved past being an Aimee Mann clone (on her first album) and gotten over being a former riot grrl (her career with Veruca Salt). However, she seems to have lost the sparkling pop sensibilities that were so in evidence in her past work."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Wanted to Like it Better...............Honest","review":"This was the first full album I purchased from iTunes. And I did it w/out sampling one track. Shame on me. I liked 'Tonight and the Rest of My Life' so much, I figured, what the heck. Let's just say this: lesson learned.I thought 'TatRoML' was so good, that this review will almost seem hypocritical. What is the difference between her first solo disk and 'Bleeding Heart Graffiti'? They are seemingly so close in writing, production and execution that it's unnerving.That is not to say I don't enjoy Nina Gordon. \\"Christmas Lights\\", \\"Kiss Me Til It Bleeds\\" and \\"Suffragette\\" are pretty good songs. But they aren't radically different from anything else. Nor is the rest of the disk.I'm not sure who marginalized the music - Gordon, Bob Rock's production or the label. Personally, I would much rather hear the Ethan Johns produced disk that Gordon scrapped.Six years is a long time to wait for a disk that she essentially already released in 2000."},{"rating":"1","title":"I agree with reviewer Ettinger","review":"I also waited for this CD to release with baited breath because I LOVED her first solo CD, and so did my husband. It is always one of the disks we listen to on a road trip. BUT...this CD sounds exactly the same! Horse songs, etc. Maybe just different lyrics, but I also was shocked at my first listen. I heard nothing different from the first CD.

Some films stand the test of time, even if filmed in the 1970's, they can still be viewed enjoyably today. An example would be The Exorcist or One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest. This film, Rabid, just screams 1970's and does not stand the test of time. The music, clothes, hair, even the film used just does not date well...therefore making it a cringe worthy viewing today.The movie is more gross than scary. Marilyn Chambers develops some kind of drill in her armpit that sucks people's blood...the victims then exhibit rabie like symptoms..it isn't really explained what is going on, or why she gets this mutant thing under her arm...I'm not going to destroy this film in my review, I am just saying it doesn't date well.."},{"rating":"1","title":"A CURIOSITY PIECE","review":"Not one of Cronberg's best, the film has curiosity value if only for starring a young Marylin Chambers, the world's most well know and perhaps best porn star.

The FX are naff and it all seems like an excuse for ex-porn star Marilyn Chambers to get her kit off every few minutes. Whats with the virus/mutant thing coming from out the armpit, wouldn't it have been more creative to have it coming out of other, more visible parts, like the mouth or something? This could have been a good film, but to me it's one of the... movies ever made.

This is the best of the Bunny Berigan compilations, containing both versions of \\"I Can't Get Started,\\" which was one of the first ten songs inducted into the Jazz Hall of Fame.

So many films have treated punks as clowns who spit on everything in sight and idolized Sid Vicious.

The story in this film (and there is a story, no matter what anyone else says) could have worked for lots of American kids in the eighties. There are epiphanies, but they're not the same old tired stuff we've been tortured with in movies about Baby Boomers. For example, the protagonist says he really expected the world to end, but when it didn't, he had to figure out something to do.And the soundtrack is fun - not exactly what punks liked back then, but still good because punks won't be sick of the songs on it (I wasn't)."},{"rating":"2","title":"great movie","review":"i don't care what you say, it's a great movie. it's not suburbia (but no other punk film is) but it has some good performances on behalf of many of the main characters. some scenes are over-acted (mainly Bob and Steve-o talking about how you gotta have a home). so teeny-bopper to hardcore punk, you can enjoy this film.

Near the end of the movie, everything just got bizarre and it lost me. On another note, the acting was actually better-than-good.

Or, for that matter, if it isn't! All of these reviewers who bother to whine and moan about how \\"not punk\\" the movie is... why? Didn't the characters and the film itself seem to mock the ever-present \\"punk/not punk\\" war? SLC Punk doesn't try to be hardcore. It doesn't really appear to TRY to be anything, aside from a lovely look at the confused nature of any radical philosophy: the blind rush for money and prestige as well as aimless rebellion.For that matter, who cares if it's an \\"accurate portrayal\\" of the punk scene of the time?

This movie could apply to any similar clique (not just punk). And I simply see it as statment of the inevitable reality, that most people come to when they decide to \\"Grow Up\\".

I was 9 in 1985, when this movie is supposed to have happened. For me at that time, \\"Punk\\" just meant that you had a weird haircut and strange clothes. Certainly I now have a better understanding of what that was all about -- but really, that has very little to do with this film. SLC Punk is less about blue mohawks, safety pins and shock value than you might think. This movie makes social and political statements that transcend \\"Punk.\\"I was honestly moved by this film -- even though I was born about a decade later than the generation depicted in it. Having had a mohawk is not a pre-requisite to seeing this movie. I recommend it without reservation to anyone who wont get hung up on the fact that Stevo and Heroin Bob don't look like everyone else.

I'm not typically a big fan of Lillard but I thought his performance in this movie was magnificent. I enjoyed his monologues, like the one in the mall.

SLC Punk is a steaming pile of ... Its a very outsider look at punk culture, regardless of what the director would have you believe on the commentary. My criticism isn't even so much that I disagree with the film's message (I'm not THAT unfair). What we have here, quite simply, is a very poorly made film. Everywhere you look there are lights and microphones in the shot, the characters are very poorly drawn, there is no shortage of pretentious dialogue that sounds like it was written by some depressed kid in high school, and the acting is UNBELIEVABLY bad(excepting a few bit parts). I realize that the film is done with a \\"punk\\" ideology in mind, but if that were the case, the director/writer obviously knows nothing about the punk scene, other than the fact that its vapid and lame. SLC Punk is a poor excuse for a movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"'True to the SLC punk-rock spirit of 85'-","review":"This movie is true. Look at SLC now-and then, this movie beautifully orchestrated the actual lifestyle of punkers- my friends and I follwed the ethic- back then, and still do today.

The movie is definatly comming of age , Set in 1985 in Salt Lake City and it definatly shows us punks our roots. The movie is very shocking in each scene never letting on to what is happening next not expecting the content and the depth. The Movie shows that you should always expect life to throw you a \\"curve\\" and in turn you should Throw one right back at it....For anyone out there I recommend SLC Punk and trust me you will not regret it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Film","review":"This is a great film , with a great soundtrack , with fine acting , and insight into the punk lifestyle. At first I didn't buy it. I was disgusted with the characters just sitting around , doing as many drugs as possible , and fighting ( sterotypes ) right down to the fashions. But at the end of the film it i realized it was all planned. And i am glad that we have a movie like this. Only complaint: I wish they could have gotten somebody besides Matt Lillard because that guy ..... me off."},{"rating":"2","title":"don't judge a movie by its trailer","review":"This is a great movie, but its trailer doesn't even come close to doing it justice, so don't bother watching that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly beautiful... , and funny as hell !","review":"I have been wandering through my life for the last couple of years and over about the last eight months I've really gotten into punk. This movie spoke to me. And after I saw it I felt indescribably better. Some people say that this movie has no plot. Fine, maybe they're right, but I don't think so. If you see this you'll see what I'm saying. But ,if you see this movie and still don't get it at least you'll be laughing. Three scenes in particular made me laugh: 1.) Bob at the doctor's office after he cuts his hand. 2.) Stevo talking to his parents about college. AND 3.) Stevo, Bob and Eddie making a beer run to Wyoming. No matter what you look for in a film this movie has something for everyone that will make them love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"No story","review":"I rented this film thinking it would be great. I love Matthew Lillard and it sounded interesting. About an hour into the movie I realized that so far, it had no story, no plot, no anything. I didn't know where the movie was going.

Was this the teenage angst everybody was raving about?This movie isn't about punk rock. It's just another movie trying to cash up on the popularity of the punk subculture.After about an hour into this, I was annoyed by this whole thing, I had to turn it off.

This movie really offended me for some reason, but now that I'm no longer 15 and I listen to other kinds of music, I realize the true message behind this film. It wasn't meant as a rallying cry for punks everywhere, it was the writer and director's vision to point out the fallacies in the so-called \\"anarchist punk\\" lifestyle. Stevo (played by Matthew Lillard) is the loud-mouthed interpreter of the scene in SLC, but as the film progresses he becomes unsure of himself and what he's doing.I abosutely love this movie and I think most of the so-called \\"punks\\" of this day and age could learn something about their \\"lifestyle\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"OK guys..listen","review":"This is NOT 100% fiction movieThey didn't just say \\"hey, SLC didn't have a punk scene in the 80's, let's make one up and make a film about it ! \\"No, no no. There WAS a punk scene in '85 in the streets of SLC and it's fairly accurately portrayed here in SLC Punk. I'm not going to tell you about the movie since every other review already does. I\\"m just going to say, don't buy the movie if you're a Blink fan and think owning it is going to make you punk. it isn't. It's a fairly deep movie about Drugs / Sex / Love / Friends / and the punk scene sort of takes a backseat depending on how you view it.

That was when it was stylish to show off just how much \\"noise\\" could be removed with CEDAR or Sonic Solutions' NO NOISE programs. The trouble is, a lot of the freshness of the music is in the same range as the \\"noise\\", and if too much is removed, the songs sound dull and lifeless. This entire CD is very difficult for me to listen to for that reason. I have scratchy 78s of many of these, and even with the scratch, they sound SOOOOO much better than this early attempt at digital restoration. Sorry, my copy will be on ebay next week."},{"rating":"1","title":"not the right product","review":"I received a generic spiderman ps2 controller. It was NOT a Minicon.

He was disappointed that it didn't light up, but the controller functions properly so it wasnt a total loss."},{"rating":"2","title":"Angst driven, high energy Oi!","review":"The Cockney Rejects lead the CD with \\"Oi Oi Oi,\\" an upbeat anthem with an us-against-them attitude. Altogether a brilliant song. Later in the album, they return with \\"Here We Go Again,\\" a tale of the prejudiced attitudes they suffer. Peter and the Test Tube Babies' two contributions are pretty good, but nothing special. The gravelly vocals are almost comprehensible, but the music more than compensates. The Exploited display two high quality punk-oi! tracks, very political and very good.They are sort of an \\"appeals to all\\" band. The Angelic Upstarts' two war-politics oriented songs are very well done, some of the best on the CD. However, I feel this album would have been better off without the Postmen; the lyrics are funny, but don't make any sense, though, the vocals are completely unintelligible, and their music is just plain bad. Other than that, the CD's music is well executed and the album should be required listening to all who like this area of the underground."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work for me","review":"I generally like twisted movies and this one certainly had an interesting concept.

Peut-etre a cours d'inspiration, il a meme cru bon de reprendre \\"Pas assez de toi\\" du groupe \\"La Mano Negra\\". Plate reprise a mon avis, loin de la rage sincere de la version originale.

Down side is it could have been a little longer, especially for those who are looking to lose back handles or baby flaps from c-sections otherwise, you'll need to adjust it up and down.

I only wore for about 2 hours, before I moved it from the first zipper to the second, which really seems to have made the difference. Even simple yard works, or vehicle maintenance seems to increase the calroic burn. I can't wait more time to pass so I can see a real difference. The back support is also nice.

This book brings up some interesting methods in which a baby is able to self-calm (for example, he writes of placing baby on it's side, facing a white or blank wall). I also remember reading some grossly outdated information such as breast-feeding does not provide immunity, etc... This book may have been \\"the answer\\" when it was first published (in the mid-80s I believe), but today there are many more current writings which are far more helpful. Some of those titles are \\"The Happiest Baby on the Block\\" By Harvey Karp, MD, \\"The Secrets of the Baby Whisperer\\" By Tracy Hogg, \\"Healthy Sleep Habits, Happy Child\\" By Marc Weissbluth.

Unfortunately, this book just doesn't accomplish what it set out to do. The big problem is that it lacks tight logical connections. There is no clear unifying thread of reasoning that would allow the lay reader to make sense of it all. I'm a physicist, so I can see what he's getting at, but I don't think I would have been able to make much sense out of the book if I hadn't already been familiar with the subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reasonable contents","review":"The book covers most of current modern physics knowledge. However, the explanations for some of the most complex issues (specially the last two chapters)are a bit weak. I also found the whole description of Noerther's theorem disappointing, in spite of apparently being one of the \\"main\\" points the authors want to get through. In the end the reader is left wondering WHY some of the conservation laws actually come from space/time symmetries. The last two chapters are really hard to follow. I understand the intend of the authors to reach a wide audience, but sometimes, a bit of simple math instead of lengthy explanation with dubious value might have been better."},{"rating":"2","title":"quantum","review":"Clearly one of the best books on quantum mechanics and relativity I've ever read.

Although it is a winner of the World Fantasy Award, as long as one hasn't given up hope in the living, I believe this timeless fable should appeal to anyone who may or may not usually read fantasy. This book is dreamy, yet feels very contemporary, as the emotional/moral issues encountered by the characters apply even to our realtime everyday world. It reminded me somewhat of The Little Prince by Saint-Exupery or The Alchemist by Coelho, but to me, The Forgotten Beasts of Eld is less disturbing, yet more gripping.

Even packed with as much coffee as you can squeeze in it, you can almost see the bottom of your cup through the brew. I even thought if you can use 2 pods at a time, why not 2 Ecopads? Not recommended, have paper towels handy if you try it.So I just started using the regular 12 cup filters and my usual brand coffee. The trick is to fold the top of the filter closed without compressing the coffee. Leave it loose enough so the coffee will completely fill the bottom of the basket without letting water go around or under it. Hence the larger 12 cup filter instead of the smaller ones.

A reviewer named \\"Miles\\" said he had tried a bunch of things to get it to work, but nothing did. That's because it was designed badly. (I'm an engineer, so I can say that with a little bit of authority.)The Eco-Pad is made from hard plastic and is not the same exact shape as the recess in a Senseo 2-pod holder. It's a little too small, so the water just goes around it rather than through it, where the coffee grounds are held. Path of least resistance, you know?

The advertising makes it look like you get a full cup of coffee with one pod. When you read the instructions you find that you only get a 4 ounce cup of coffee-good for Europeans but not for those of us in the USA where a cup of coffee is more like 8 ounces. It takes two pods to make a real cup of coffee on the machine and at over $6.00 for 18 pods in most Supermarkets this is very expensive-about $18 to $22 a pound although WalMart sells Senseo pods for $3.84 for 18 pods.Is it worth trying EcoPods?"},{"rating":"2","title":"I want to purchase this, but one question....","review":"I think this is the best idea since sliced bread, and it will force the price down on the outrageously costly \\"gourmet\\" pods.Will this work in a Melitta One:One?

I have tried finer grind, coarser grind, less coffee, more coffee but with no luck. They basically look the same and are the same size as the original blue ones, so I am not sure what the problem might be. I only have one of the original blue ones left and now use it most of the time while the other 6 new and improved rarely get used.

When I found these reusable pods for the Senseo, I was cautious in my optimism, but figured it would be worth a try at only $10/2 pods.Well, NOW we have endless possibilities for new coffee flavors and the quality is much improved from the pre-packaged Senseo pods. We still keep some of those on hand in case one of the EcoPods tears (as I've heard about in other reviews), but really, they are a snap to clean and seem to be really well made (use common sense and be gentle, and I don't think tearing will be a problem).A great buy that I would suggest for any Senseo owner!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Opinion","review":"Ecopad, the Refillable Coffee Filter for the Classic SenseoThis filter works but if you are someone who likes stronger coffee you can not put enough in the pod.

First, you have to fill them by hand... which is pretty easy once you get the hang of it. Second, you can only brew a single cup at a time -- which could take you twice the time if you normally brew a double cup.That being said, they make a nice cup of coffee and I love that I now have an infinite selection of java to choose from.

After that, it works as advertised, and it makes a decent cup of coffee. However, I'm not so sure it is worth the 25-30 cents per serving that you save by not buying prepackaged coffee pods. First you have to grind the coffee beans. Even pre-ground coffee is often too coarse and will need to be ground again. Then there is the messy job of transferring the finely ground coffee into the filter, a task that can seldom be accomplished without spilling some. Afterwards there is the messy cleanup where you need to use a lot of running water to clean grounds out of the filter. All in all, it's a time-consuming process. To me, the main purpose of getting a single serve coffee maker was as a time saver."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good coffee","review":"We can now make our own coffee pods for our Senseo coffee maker using our terrific freshly roasted, freshly ground coffee.

If you decrease the volume of grounds enough to allow the machine to properly operate it makes a weak see through cup of coffee. Either way, working with the grounds is a mess and needs to be done over the sink. The mess,effort and time required to make a decent serving is just not worth it.

To me - the pods were too much coffee for one small cup - and not enough for the two cups. SO you would have to use two pods and that was too much and too expensive.Instead, I used these, filled with coffee. Again, when full, it is too much for one cup - not enough for two - but 1 1/2 is just perfect.

This gives you actual full bodied coffee. Its very easy to use; just make sure there are no grinds on the edges before you close the lid.

My suggestion is to remove the tabs from the Ecopad's lid. I believe this minor surgery will eliminate a fatal flaw and produce a \\"perfect\\" substitute for the Senseo pod. The flaw that I have experienced, that has continued to get worse, is that the Senseo machine loses pressure, so I get less coffee and water leakage. I know the problem was caused by the Ecopad because it disappeared when I reverted back to the Senseo pod. I realized that the three little tabs on the cover of the pad were not allowing the rubber seal on the Senseo machine to fully close, causing the loss of pressure and water. I simply removed the tabs, sanding them off, and they now function perfectly!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes a weak brew unless you want to spend all day on it","review":"I'm really unimpressed with these. They simply require too much work to get an even moderately strong cup of coffee from. If you don't grind to a super-fine coal-dust level, then pack it in, you get brown water. So, you spend so much time prepping, it'd just be easier to either 1)Brew a big pot of coffee in the morning and put it in a thermos or 2)just stick to the pods.

While perhaps not as well known (at least in America) as Brian Eno, or Kraftwerk, or Cluster, Rother's grounded musical sensibilities keep me interested in the tunes rather than intimidated by them, something inherent in too many experimental efforts.

And then there is \\"Say, Old Friend.\\" Every cut is beautifully sung and orchestrated. If you don't count yourself among Rosemary Clooney's fans, this CD will change your mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"The significant reason for purchasing the Philadelphia Phillies Designated Hitter Shorts was for the Phillies logo. However, the logo was only stickered on with some sort of glue. After the second time in the dryer, it fell off! So now, I just have \\"Hitter Shorts\\". I have a preschool son that I routinely take to the park and I pitch him baseballs to hit. He is dressed up in his favorite Phillies uniform. My purchase of the logo shorts was just a fun touch to add to the comradarie of the event. This purchase did not fullfill my expectation."},{"rating":"2","title":"A First Rate Spiritual Classic","review":"In the 40 years I've passed immersed in the study of comparative religions, I have to say the Tripura Rahasya (\\"The Mystery of the Three Cities\\") is one of the greatest works on spirituality I've ever read. With brilliant philosophical clarity--illustrated with marvelously engaging stories--this classic work unveils the secrets of consciousness, matter, energy, and the human soul. Pandit Tigunait's superb English translation makes the Sanskrit text a pleasure to read. Anyone interested in yoga, consciousness studies, world religions, Hinduism, or the Goddess tradition should be familiar with this important scripture. You'll rarely find a spiritual text more enlightening."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hotel Costes Keeps the Beat.","review":"This a good continouation of the previous albums from Hotel Costes. Songs like Lavish by Mark Rea, Heaven's Gonna Burn Your Eyes by Thievery Corporation Feat. Emiliana Torrini gave the cd the smooth lounge feeling and hits like Hip Hip Chin Chin (Yaziko Club Mix) by Club Des Belugas and Palumba by Watch TV is a good up beat to the overall cd. I gave it 4 stars as I found some tunes Clive the Runner and So Ma Guisee was not really to my liking.I would recommend it to all Costes lovers.Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Costes back on form","review":"I'd heard some pretty savage reviews of Costes 7 and hadn't planned on buying it. But as it turned out Santa brought it and much to my suprise i got it on christmas day. And what a pleasant suprise it turned out to be.This really is the best Costes I can remember since 4. The beats have a really bouncey, retro 80's, electronic vibe. all very trendy & now, but still classically cool.Theres an awful Simon and Garfunkel cover ('The sounds of silence') but otherwise this is a bold and consistent set.perfect for chilled parties and relaxing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"Too many unimaginative, unvarying beats, that go on forever, and the songs are often corny. Probably my least favorite from the HC series."},{"rating":"1","title":"the worst of the HC series","review":"To my opinion, this is the worst of the HC series. I have bought all the 1-6 HC compilations during the past two years, but this one is not as good as I expected. Perhaps, Pompougnac has pushed himself to release a HC compilation every year without doing his best for its preparation. Maybe 10 releases (HC 1-7, best of HC, Living on the edge, Saks Fifth Avenue) are too many for a period of 6 years (since the first HC). I believe that the HC series should stop now, in order to avoid any further denigration of the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"yuk!","review":"I have all of the other Costes CDs and this one is totally lame. 1-5 were great. 6 was semi-lame and with this one I feel like he's just coasting knowing that suckers like me will be an easy target.

By far, this has been the WORST filter I ever had. The constant filling and releasing of water in this filter is noisy to say the least. That is, if you can even position the cap inside the filter to get the thing working properly. It took me hours of fiddling to get this filter to work correctly.The additional heating source inside of the filter itself also turned into a nightmare. If you have frequent power shortages, or lose power from storms, or any other reason, this is not the filter for you. My heating component MELTED the plastic casing around it when our power failed, and the water stopped cycling through the tank. As no one was home at the time, we're lucky it didn't start a fire. Then by the time anyone noticed that the filter wasn't running, it have been a whole night. Not only was the tank water cloudy from going unfiltered, it was also cold.I don't reccomend this filter at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"I really like this system","review":"This is the second pf300 filter system i have bought- it has been very tough, easy to use, and cost effective to maintain. I do not recomend placing it on you NIGHTSTAND- because there is the noise of moving water (a good sign that the system works and moves a good amount of water.After a few years of being in continuous operation, my original system finally required a new impeller- and at the same time I broke the glass on the heater unit - So I am purchasing another complete pf300 system.My tank is brackish water for spotted puffers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure fun","review":"This is a great old mix of prarie league; I am not a hard-core fan of the band - just enjoy the music; kids like it too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Daily Walk","review":"This book is a clear winner for those that journey the Red Road.

A let down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I bought this book expecting it to be spiritual and some of the statements were, but they were not backed up with anything that relates to how the Indians incorporated those thoughts into THEIR daily lives. I just got an unrelated history lesson. For example, Feb. 10th-\\"To clothe a man falsley is to distress his spirit...\\" Then the next information on that page is about a Native Day in American History on \\"Feb 10th 1763 The French ceded the North Americans territory to England in the Treaty of Paris, ending the French and Indian War (1754-1763).\\" Now, what do the two have to do with each other? Or at least put something in about how Native Americans dress or something related to the spiritual quote of the day. The format bugged me. There is some good information, but very poorly organized."},{"rating":"1","title":"Title and Content do not match","review":"The title of this book and the information suggest that it's a daily devotional book about spiritual life.

This book is nothing more than a \\"quote a day book.\\" Purchase it if you're looking for a quick gift to bestow on someone, but not if you're serious about the ways of our native ancestors. In my opinion the product description is very misleading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Neat book. Lots of info.","review":"I really like this book. It's full of stuff I didnt know. Every day there is a quote that is positive or just plain interesting. Its like a daily history lesson.

Although the quotes and information are very wonderful, this is completely different then what I expected to read. Its more of an overload of info than it is a pleasant read. Some of the quotes even repeat itself. If you are really looking for a book to help you live on the red road, I would not recommend this. The title is misleading. If it was titled \\"Great Native American Wisdom\\" or \\"Native American Words to Live by\\" then the book would have been great. Needless to say I was disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"365 Days of Walking the red road","review":"This is a nice book for any year or every year.

Unfortunately, the writing is really bad. The book did not flow for me at all, plowing through the pages to get the story was a real chore. Such a shame too, because I really liked the story. A good editor could have saved this book for me.The metaphysical nature of space and time is discussed ad nauseam. This stuff may have been new and interesting back when the book was published, but it seemed old hat to me now. The story really bogs down in it at times.I probably would have been better off with the comic book version...Entertainment: 3 starsEnlightenment: 2 stars"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hack Writing At It's Best","review":"The book has a very intriguing plot and does move along at good speed. There is action on every page. Twitchell's occassional allusions to great spiritual truths appear like fluff to add credence to a piece of hack writing. Character development is extremely poor.

Mr Pope-Hennessey does a brilliant job bringing a huge cast of charachters to life, and Queen Mary herself is a fascinating study in early 20th century womanhood. I highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys reading about women in the royal family. All the elements are there, in great detail-but don't expect dirt digging. But you will not be dissappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Superlative Biography","review":"James Pope-Hennessy was chosen by Queen Elizabeth II to be the official biographer of the life of her grandmother, Queen Mary, Consort of King George V.Pope-Hennessy was given unlimited access to documents and letters in the archives at Windsor Castle, as well as entree' to many living members of the Royal Family, including Queen Mary's son, the Duke of Windsor.The result is an infallibly researched book. Pope-Hennessy's writing style, however, is hardly pedantic or stultifying. On the contrary, his almost effervescent accounts take the reader into the glittering balls, majestic ceremonies, and grand country house weekends that were the hallmark of Victorian and Edwardian England.This is, by far, the finest biography of Queen Mary ( I have read others ) And one of the finest written accounts of the Royal Family during that period."},{"rating":"2","title":"Byrd's choice of instrument disappoints","review":"I would likely give this album a higher rating, but Charlie Byrd usually plays a more full-bodied classical guitar. On many of the cuts on Blur Byrd, it sounds as if he is playing one of those very thin-body guitars meant exclusively for amplified performance. And, to my ears, it sounds too much like rubber bands twanging against a plastic box. Of course, this is hyperbole, but the timbre of the instrument is just plastic-y and unpleasant. Your mileage may vary. Frankly it ruins the listening experience for me on quite a few cuts on Blue Byrd. I'm far from an expert on the Byrd discography, but I don't recall hearing Charlie play this instrument on any other album.Word to the wise, and heads up. Hopefully it won't bother you as it did me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I would of known","review":"I wish I would of known I needed a microscope to see this book.

I haven't seen her in Caesar's Palace, but I did see her in 1996 at the Wolf Trap in Vienna, VA, and she was just as great then live as she is now! The DVD that accompanies this CD is really great too...showing us how Celine uses her time on and off the stage to do the things in life that most of us take for granted. It was nice to get a behind the scenes peek! The couple performances that were included are excellent too! Another good thing for this album: we weren't given the Chrysler emblem treatment!

The two new studio tracks are also superb. \\"You and I\\" is fun and light , a great summer hit with passionate vocals and lyrics. \\"Ain't Gonna Look The Other Way\\" is just perfect and Celine's style is all her own.

Once again you deliver above and beyond our expectations."},{"rating":"1","title":"My least favoruite live Celine album","review":"Of the 6 live Celine cds I own, this is by far and wide my least favoruite. On first listen I find something about them I like, not this time, and that is sad.1) The short version of 'It's All Coming Back To Me Now' is blasphemy.2) Far too much talking (for my taste) between songs, shut up and sing!3) Too short, the total cd time is Sixty one minutes EXACTLY.4) No live version of 'A New Day Has Come'Now for the good points (which were hard to find):1) Live versions of 'I'm Alive', 'At Last', and 'I Drove All Night'2) Her version of 'What A Wonderful World'3) The DVD is nice, but not enough to save this.While not all bad, not one of my favourite live cds. I'll stick with the import 'Live At Olympia' and 'Live In Paris' as well as the two other live cds I have, much better in my opinion. I realize that this is from Vegas and Vegas means big, but after listening to it I hope that when her stay is over she gets back to a real show."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your Money","review":"If you like listening to a live performance without the video than this one is for you... the DVD is just a teaser that has some interesting information about Celine, but doesn't have the live Las Vegas show I wanted to see.

However, the chapter in her career as relevant pop artist is now coming to a close. She can now focus on being a musical legend as SONY cleverly releases yet another set of her previous hits (this time as a live format) with the inclusion of only two new tracks to attract intense fans addicted to this artist. The CD is a worthwhile product for those dreaming of being amongst the priviledge fans assisting a live Dion concert. The two negative comments are that (1) SONY could have inserted even more additional new material to complement prior hits and (2) the rushed medley format of BECAUSE YOU LOVE ME and IT'S ALL COMING BACK TO ME NOW play back as cheezy when not visually placed in the context of the show.

Why would such a successful, talented woman go to Las Vegas, the elephant graveyard for untalented people???? Oh well, whatever the reason, Las Vegas definitely affected Celine Dion. This album is dreadful. I saw her Las Vegas show on TV and couldn't pick my jaw up off the floor. Showgirls and showboys in cheesy costumes dancing around while Celine sang Disco!

There is no lip-synching, no dubbed in background vocals.. she sings live and she sings beautifully every night.While some of the things she says to the audience come across a little strangely without being in the room with her, she truly tries to make each show feel like the first and last she's performing, and the audience eats it up. When the DVD is available, I'd recommend watching it so you can get an idea of what the overall show feels like, but for now, the audio CD is a great addition to her overall catalogue and one I'm glad she released.Note that there are also two new studio tracks - You and I is reminiscent of \\"That's The Way It Is\\" and is a great pop song.. hopefully radio will rediscover its relationship with Celine and her music and put it into rotation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Show","review":"I was very disappointed in this cd.

The central character, Nicholas, is the titular \\"divine\\" one, a paragon of fussy perfection.

There were times when I had to consult my husband's paper copy just to make sure I understood a sentence or phrase as it should have been written. Please understand that the comprehension difficulties had nothing to do with Mr. Stanley's argument or writing style, they were completely due to a horrible rendering of the text into the Kindle version.I enjoy my Kindle.

What I was mostly struck by was the amazing and vital Ronnie Gilbert. As another reviewer mentioned here, her duet with Holly Near will give you goosebumps -- her passion, joy and love for life, all through the video, will inspire you long after you see this amazing story.

Wasn't That a Time tells the story of how the Weavers gathered for their last concert in 1980 - for the first time in 17 years.

The dual chamber is perfect for a small roast with a side such as sour kraut if you want to keep the two separate.My only complaint is the keep warm feature.

As an example take the issue of the discrete noise covariance matrix i.e. Q. The author gives a simple recipe for constructing this matrix.

No one person is more likely to be sexually assaulted in their lives based on what day of the month they are born. It is the fault of the criminals who committ the assault. To say the birthday of the victim affects it at all is placing blame on the victim which is what counselors and doctors around the world are trying to prevent. It is reprehensible and disgusting that the author writes and believes the victim is at fault because the mother gave birth to them on a certain day in a certain astrological sign. Shame on the author for perpetuating the societal myth that the victim is somehow to blame for the assault.

You can give yourself or someone else a haircut in less time than it takes to drive to the Barber.It eliminates that chance of a catastrophic OOPS!! (as oposed to scissors and clippers).The best application for this prduct is for kids. If you have kids you know getting their hair cut can be an ordeal. This eliminates the hair down the neck and is fast.

The Flowbee cuts about 3 times faster than the Robocut. The Robocut slows down periodically from its already slow speed and there is no adapter for the vacuum hose. The Robocut seems to need a lot of vacuum compared to the Flowbee. Neither is perfect but I am retiring the Robocut and buying another Flowbee because it's much better and much quicker.

The single handle is easy to use and to control the water temp, and generally I am very happy with it.Except - after about a year the swivel function froze up like other reviewers have mentioned. You could still turn it from side to side but it was a major effort. DH called Kohler and they sent him some free parts, which of course didn't fix anything. We held off on buying a new faucet because we wanted to remodel the kitchen and wanted to wait to make sure the new faucet matched the rest of the kitchen. Luckily the pullout works fine, because it was often easier to pull that out than to try to swivel the faucet.We are in the remodeling process now and I am shopping for a new faucet.

We've had them for about a month now and so far they have been great (of course the reader should know that our previous faucets were over 20 years old and pretty much anything would have been an improvement). There is plenty of clearance underneath the faucet so you can put a big pan or plastic tub under it to fill up. Changing from spray to stream is very easy with the button at the top by the sprayhead. The one thing I would note is that the pullout sprayhead requires a fair amount of vertical clearance underneath the sink due to the design of the retraction (weighted ring around sprayhead hose). We have plenty of room so it has not been a problem and it's been working great. This is the faucet our plumber recommended and we have not been disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality and stylish","review":"This faucet set is a solid performer. After going through three faucets in five years, I installed this Kohler piece in the kitchen.

It replaces a similar style faucet bought at Costco that would not stay on, and before that an Italian fauct which broke the day before Thanksgiving spraying water everywhere.

This is the only Kohler product I am not happy with. When new it seemed to work great. With age (1year) the Pull Out faucet won't go all the way back in and the plastic seems to be holding it out leaving a 1/16 gap. I have checked and there is no build up or other obstruction other than the original poor design. Not going all the way back in means it may not seat pointed down causing water to stream in any direction the pull out happens to pointed. It is not family proof! I will be replacing it with something else, maybe not Kohler this time."},{"rating":"2","title":"The perfect kitchen faucet","review":"This was a replacement for another pull out faucet. We put in new granite countertops so the color had to harmonize. We like the color and the height. The pull out hose is smooth and returns to its place positively. Typical of the Kohler quality.The best feature and the one that sets this faucet apart from all the others is the solid push button for switching from spray to stream. It won't come apart in a few months like all the units with the rubber cover over the button. This is a real benefit if you plan on keeping your faucet functional for more than a few months. (notice how many with the rubber button are messed up in the showrooms!)Another nice feature is the ability to use it like a drinking fountain by rotating the head 45 deg. and aiming it toward your mouth.

I called them up and complained and they shipped me a replacement aerator for free. the faucet works much better. I'm really picky so I would say that I've seen better... but it works.in all other regards the faucet is great. the lever has good movement. you can tell you have good hardware and not some $60 costco faucet. I know this because i did have one. the magnet that holds the faucet head is acceptable. i'm not sure what a 'good' one feels like but again, it's better than my cheapo costco one. the spray function could be more powerful IMO but it works well enough.remember that stainless steel doesn't look too hot when dirty. you can see the spots but it's not too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"not pleased with flow rate","review":"I have had this faucet about a month.

At first I said to myself, \\"Self, this is a clever design\\" The hose and spray assembly was modular such that they could be replaced in a 'plug and play' fashion. I was stunned to find that the retail price to do so would have set me back $180.00!! Clever indeed!Research on the net has got the price down to $135. but that's still too high in my opinion. As an engineer, I am capable of rebuilding the unit and that's what I'll be doing (parts are about $40.00) but offer fair warning to those who are not as mechanically inclined. As such, I'll be purchasing something different next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Faucet hose deteriorates","review":"I really like the look, feel and finish of this faucet. However, I have had a problem with deterioration of the faucet hosing which leads to foaming and smell in the water when you first turn the water on. Based on the number of similar complaints on web blogs, this is not an uncommon problem with this faucet. To be fair, Kohler was quick to send me a replacement hose (the same type of hose as the original), but the problem recurred after just 2 months. This is a design or materials flaw that they have not yet fixed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kohler single lever faucet","review":"The Kohler 10433-CP faucet is an impressive performer.

If you need to direct water into a smaller opening (tea pot, etc.), you are likely to spill. On top of that, one of the little buttons that toggle the spray head between spray and stream broke. After reading another reviewer with the same problem, I think I'll buy a new faucet from another manufacturer--I'm not interested in buying a replacement $90 spray head every time a poorly-designed plastic button breaks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lasted four months","review":"I have used many Kohler products and generally like them very much. However, I was skeptical of this particular faucet because it seemed rather lightweight and flimsy, compared to a similar spray-head faucet I bought several years ago, now discontinued. Still, it is good-looking, had the features I wanted, and bears the Kohler name. Four months after installing it, something inside the spray head has come loose and wedged the converter button so it no longer works - the thing is firmly stuck on stream and won't spray.Kohler was nice enough to give me a store credit over the phone, so I will use this to buy a Kohler sink. I wish they made a decent kitchen faucet, because now I need one to replace this. My recommendation: don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't last poor quality","review":"The first year the button broke off and I managed to glue it back in place, second year, and the faucet no longer moves from side to side without extreme force. I tried adjusting the movement however I find broken pieces. I'm here looking for a hopefully better replacement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money.","review":"Yeah, it's a good looking faucet, with one BIG problem. After two years it will not swivel easily any more on it's base. The faucet can't move on it's base freely, it takes some real muscle to move it from one half sink to the other, and then most times the base moves with it so it's loosening it and I have to go under the sink and retighten it. I didn't have any of the other problems people reported, but that's a major problem, IMO."},{"rating":"1","title":"Home Depot and Kohler bad combo for warranty","review":"Warranty is a problem when purchased through Home DepotOur faucet started to malfunction. But hey we thought, no problem, we have a life time warranty. Apparently not. Home Depot will not cover over 90 days. So you may not want to purchase your faucets there. Then we called Kohler customer service and they are only open M-F 8-5PM and that did not help us. It was so inconvenient to deal with Kohler, who does not replace faucets, they try to troubleshoot them on the phone and send parts. Meanwhile the water in your home is shut-off. In the end both Home Depot and Kohler made it so painful and difficult we purhased the competitor product. Having been bitten by the awkward warranty conditions with Home Depot and Kohler we double checked the warranty on the new faucet and its a no hastle replacement via the store we purchased it in. So what was the new faucet? A Delta faucet through Totem."},{"rating":"1","title":"JUNK - Eventually won't turn","review":"Failed after two years. The faucet was binding and would not turn at all. I do not recommend buying this because it is not worth the cost. It is cheap junk and should be priced as such."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kitchen Faucet","review":"Good faucet. Not sure if its the new sink (deep cast iron) or the faucet, it seems to spray more outside of the sink. I think its the height of the faucet. This faucet sits high.

He measures everything he eats and keeps track of it daily. I like that this scale is easliy cleaned and it comes with very very many codes for different foods, even fast food. However, for us the ony thing we would have hoped for is that it tracked what you ate the whole day or remembered the information you put into it. The layout is another thing I think he would have preferred differently, instead of just pushing the cal button and the number pops up, i think he would have liked the information to show all at once on a nutrition table like the regular food packaging. But all in all, i like this scale and we use it everyday."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good compact scale, easy to use","review":"I purchased this as an upgrade from my current non-digital type kitchen scale and so I could calculate carbohydates on foods.

The directions are always clear and Maida introduces each recipe with some background information, telling the story of how she came upon the recipe, what the finished product looks like, serving and storing suggestions, etc. These descriptions help when trying to decide which chocolate dessert to make when choosing from such a wealth of choices.I love the orange chocolate loaf cake and since Maida says the recipe can easily be doubled I always do. This cake goes quickly and it pays to have a spare! A friend of mine gave one of these recipes to her caterer for her wedding cake -- people are still talking about that incredible cake!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb, standard book on chocolate desserts","review":"The greatest virtue of Heatter's cookbooks is that the recipes work flawlessly if the directions are followed.

There is not a better chocolate cookbook out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chocolate Cookbooks are all compared to this one","review":"How do you rate a cookbook that you use almost everytime you have company? This book has some of the best, most foolproof chocolate dessert recipes that I know. Heatter's brownies are outstanding as are many of her cookie recipes. Chocolate Souffle Alice is the chocolate souffle against which we compare all others! We have found a few blah recipes (chocolate oatmeal cookies didn't seem to make it with my family) but the many wonderful ones outweigh the few disappointing ones. Try the Mexican icebox cookies alone make this book worth the price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Chocolate Heaven!","review":"If you love chocolate and you love baking, this is the one book you MUST have. It is Biblical in the chocolate universe. Every recipe turns out perfectly. you could not overpraise this book so I will shut up now before I start. Buy it and be happy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Chocoholics Dream!!!!","review":"I received an original copy of this cookbook when I first got married. Baking has long been my passion. This cookbook does not disappoint. I have many good baking cookbooks, but this one is by far the best and most fail proof!Every recipe I have made has turned out well and the feedback I receive from people eating what I bake from this book is: When are you going to open your own bake shop? Truly, the recipes are that good. My favorites are her brownie recipes, but everything is great! If you buy this book, you will not be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite cookbook ever","review":"How marvelous to see this wonderful cookbook back in print. I have an original hardcover, stained and old and with a broken binding - but that shows the hard use it has seen over the years. I love desserts, and I love chocolate - but I have other chocolate cookbooks that almost never get opened. When I think \\"chocolate\\" this is always the first, and usually the only, cookbook to come out.I have never had a bad choice made from this cookbook. Some can be a bit complicated in the making, like the incredible Sept. 7th Cake, but are well worth it in the end.But probably the biggest part of the charm, to me, are all the wonderful anecdotes about each recipe. Just reading them makes we want to try the recipes out as a mere list of ingredients never would. I'm sorely tempted to buy myself a a new fresh copy of this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maida Heatter's Book of Great Desserts","review":"I have many years of cooking experience and to use Heatter's cookbooks is always a joy.

A perfume I loved but could not wear as it was too cloying for me. Tried this one out while I was shopping and for the first 10 min I was in love.

Same thing for the inside frame. I still love it though.

Perhaps if you're just trying to remember what the proper equation is, it'd work better.Tables of values are frequently missing minus signs here and there, which can make working out the problems and/or examples difficult. There are other random typos that make examples simply not work out. If you just want the equations, this is ok, but for learning, it's actually easier when the typos are in the equations (and not the numbers), since in that case there's a \\"thought trail\\" of sorts.The book claims to be the only reference, in which case you haven't got much choice, but that doesn't make it good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic \\"50's Sessions","review":"Good to have these on one CD and good to be reminded ofthe high sound quality of Capitol recordings."},{"rating":"2","title":"I may have to re-read this","review":"Much of this book is a sales pitch about the importance of making higher margins on sales. This I already knew and believed, and why I bought this book in the first place. After all of the good reviews, I will have to go back and re-read this, as I didn't get a clear answer as to how to compete in online business channels when competitors are slashing prices. My company has no issue with service, quality and delivery, returns, etc.. We ship next day, the highest quality products and answer customer service questions almost immediately. I wanted a book on HOW to make bigger profit margins not the importance of them. I will re-read this book again to see if there was something I missed..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good summary of sound techniques","review":"This book contains practical advice on how to write bug-free code. It covers a large number of guidelines which are generally applicable to all software development projects.My only caution is that these techniques, when applied by novice programmers, is no doubt the source of much of Microsoft's code bloat. Also, encouraging the programmer to rely heavily on the source-level debugger can prevent developers from getting a real sense of the program's performance on user-level hardware.Otherwise, a very good book and very useful advice, much of which I've been applying in my own projects."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book on how good software is developed","review":"This book is not a programmer's desk reference. Those looking for a how-to tome should look elsewhere. What this book contains is practical advice and lessons learned about software construction and projects. Maguire is a proponent of the theory that good software doesn't just happen - it is the result of good processes, and in this book he explains how to create these processes in your work environment, whether your job is that of a line programmer, a lead programmer, or a software project manager.It is essential that the reader be able to take specific lessons in the book - like the Macintosh Excel programming project refereneced by another reviewer - and relate them not literally, but in the context of their own problems and projects. This requires independent thought, and may account for some of the bad reviews. I seriously doubt that anyone who rated this book below three stars read and understood it.A great book and worth every penny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timeless advice on writing bug-free, maintainable software","review":"A classic that is dated in some respects (C language?) but still has much to offer. Should have a spot on every developer's and project manager's book shelf.Deserves an update."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Content","review":"The presentation of the content - as noted by other reviews - may not be 5 star, but the content definitely makes up for any failings of the book. The book consolidates practices and information that every programmer should know. Its one of the few books I'd recommend to any programmer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must read for all programmers","review":"I also decided to review this book after I saw many negative reviews about it on this site. I will recommend this book to anyone who does software programming for a living. The book is not about any particular programming language, it is about the attitude about programming that every software engineer should have.The fact that this book gives examples in C or it uses Hungarian notations is completely irrelevant. I think 80% of the software bugs can be avoided with the attitude described in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who are you kidding?","review":"Is Microsoft really the one to write a book on how to write solid code? Is this some kind of perverse oxymoron?"},{"rating":"1","title":"no no no no no no no no!!!","review":"Just think about the title!!! Microsoft - Bug free.... I don't think so!?!?!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought it was a joke","review":"I saw the title for this book floating around in a humor list. It even had an ISBN number which I figured would lead me to a subtle second joke. Microsoft writing bug free code??? THAT is humorous. This book might be usefull in figuring out what NOT to do, assuming Microsoft actually uses this system. If I turned out one tenth as many bugs and was as late on as many projects as Microsoft I would not have a job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Microsoft writes bug-free code?","review":"Well sorry to say it folks but this is just another way to get our users; money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heavy on Obfuscatory Text, Light on Content","review":"In the Preface of \\"Writing Solid Code,\\" Maguire comments that he had never written a book before. Unfortunately, his lack of experience with writing a good technical manual is readily apparent. Much of the text revolves around examples of finding and correcting a bugs in the Macintosh Excel division of Microsoft. The text is awkardly written and his explanations are often obscure, especially to a beginning \\"C\\" programmer. It doesn't help matters that there is no difficulty rating assigned to this book; Writing Solid Code is definiately not written for the amateur, and beginners are unlikely to get much of value out of this text.I suppose my biggest gripe is that this book is very light on content in comparison to other computer books that are available. A much better book on software engineering is Steve McConnell's \\"Code Complete,\\" which costs only ten dollars more, and is available from Microsoft Press."},{"rating":"1","title":"You'll learn a lot more on Usenet's comp.lang.c newsgroup.","review":"Maguire doubtlessly had the best of intentions when he authored this book. However, the book is filled with the Microsoft disease of Hungarian notation, obfuscating what might otherwise be acceptable examples. The book is also flawed by DOS-centricity...not surprising, considering the publisher. Also undermining the value of this work is Maguire's apparent desire to rewrite the Standard C language (see his getchar() wrapper). Get the FAQ-list from comp.lang.c. It's better, it's free and doesn't reek with the stench of Redmond"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just look at the publishing date.","review":"You are looking at a 10-year-old book with a bunch of green screens on the cover. What more can I say. I bought it in preparation for an interview with Microsoft. I did not find it helpful, except for a few pages that do help understand Microsoft culture (but you can learn much more about that on the net).So many new things have appeared (and/or became popular) since the book has been published. OOAD, C++, Java, RUP, XP, design patterns, to name a few. It puzzles me that Microsoft still recommends this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome, essential resource for serious Bible students!","review":"Wow! What a resource! Every major people group mentioned in the Old Testament is explored in this single volume!Categorized by geographic location and extensively indexed by Subject, Scripture reference and Author, this book is very easy to use . . . a handy refence for preparing to teach a Bible study.And for more serious scholars (or people like me who are just curious to know more) there are references at the bottom of each page telling where the authors found the information they're writing about.All of the information is up-to-date, giving details of recent archaeological finds which shed light on the Peoples of the Old Testament World. I love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good visuals and narration... interesting","review":"My 3 1/2 year old really loves this video. I have several littlemammoth videos (the publisher). They are well written, use children as narrators, and are very educational. The tape discusses the entire process of rebuilding a smaller home and modernizing it. It's begun with an architect drawing the plans, the demolition of the portions of the home that will no longer remain. Later aspects of framing, sheetrocking, following up by the architect and finish work. Damaged wood due to termites is discussed as well as an interesting visit to a university for a look at how termites follow smells. I have a deep respect for littlemammoth videos as they don't get \\"silly\\" and maintain children's attention throughout the movie. I refrained from a top rating primarily because of the ~5 minutes of advertisements in the beginning of the tape."},{"rating":"2","title":"A welcome reissue of a superb recording","review":"The only small group release on Concord by this superbly talented Ellington alumnus, Shortcake actually features TWO groups - a terrific quintet including Frank Capp, Dave Frishberg, Mundell Lowe and Monty Budwig, and a larger group including Bill Watrous, Nick Ceroli, Marshall Royal, and other great L.A. musicians of the 1980's. Everything is crisp yet relaxed, the solo work is inspired, and the arrangements for the larger group are creative without being constraining or fussy. This is fun, sophisticated, and swinging; in other words, outstanding jazz."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb.","review":"When Desmond and Mulligan first got together on record it resulted in the 1957 Verve album \\"Gerry Mulligan/Paul Desmond Quartet.\\" Worthy as that LP was, this 1962 album for RCA is better, a complete classic from start to finish.

It is completely different stylistically and the tone does not match that of any of her other works. The author does have a note stating that the stories were written early in her career and in the early 1980s but I do not believe that is the problem with the stories. Please be aware if you are a Joan Hohl reader these are very different from her other works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really an awful book","review":"This is the first Joan Hohl book I have read and will most likely be the last. It is the most inane narrative I have ever read. I have read the first two stories anddon't know if I can handle the third but will try.

It is beautifully written and photographed and conveys M. Ducasse's enjoyment of the abundance of the United States in it's many forms. To miss the inclusion of recipes is to miss the point. Of course the book is pointing out the bounty that is utilised at the restaurant, but it is there for all of us to enjoy and use. There are many, many farms across the U.S. similar to the ones profiled in the book, in every community. Many people just don't know that they are there. I would hope that this book is an inspiration to people to patronize their local food producers and to seek out farmers, fishermen, ranchers, cheesemakers et al who make it their life's work to produce something of quality for all to enjoy. Rarely has a chef written a book that is not entirely about themselves, to promote the work of others. And this chef is not even from this country."},{"rating":"1","title":"The newest from Ducasse, Inc.","review":"I have dined in all of Alain Ducasse's Paris establishments{including the just opened Plaza Athenee location}as well as his Monte Carlo establishment and consider him a genius however, with the overblown pretension of the New York restaurant and now this book, one has to ask can even a genius spread himself too thin. The two real cookbooks by Ducasse are treasures, this book is not worth the price or the trouble. It is basically the Master's musings about his sources and philosophy of freshness and source....nice filler in a real cookbook but,not worth or worthy of a whole book. Save your money for a real Ducasse cookbook."},{"rating":"1","title":"Elvis is the King but There's Room at the Inn for Remakes","review":"This is not really an Elvis tribute nor are these even the best remakes of songs that Elvis made famous - this is the sort of CD for completists and people who enjoy making mix Cd's with a odd track thrown in the mix. It's at best a whimsical collection and almost verging on novelty but to deny anybody (including William Shatner - surprisingly not in this collection :-) a chance to sing and presumably entertain us is wrong). Elvis sang plenty of remakes - and even though MY WAY is really Frank Sinatra's song, it's still appropriate for Elvis to give us another version. Just like we want to hear others try out versions of Elvis' best songs.They really should've called this a \\"fun\\" tribute to Elvis."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kate C","review":"Gaelic Storm is so much fun.

A few are instrumental pieces but most are songs and they are all a joy to hear.The instrumental pieces are the more \\"classical\\" in the sense that they could have been done at an earlier time. The songs, though, have a youthfulness about them that screams \\"modern\\" but does so without losing the cultural heritage or style. Most are fun songs.

Fine acting and production values. Then it turned into an S&M porno movie. The whippings with both the canes and the metal tipped whips caused me to fast forward through most of that scene. It was gratuitous and I could just see the S&M set buying this dvd just to pleasure themselves while watching it. The other thing that bothered me throughout was the fact that the score from Jesus Christ Superstar kept running through my head as I watched it. I would give the movie around 4-5 stars if the quality of the story telling had lived up the the first half for the entire film."},{"rating":"1","title":"bloody","review":"This is a disgusting movie, nothing of the love the Bible teaches.

This is simply a gore-fest of sadism. It shows the lowest to which humanity fell... the torture and murder of an innocent person.And yet, Jesus wasn't the only innocent person tortured and murdered. What of the millions of people tortured and murdered during the Inquisition and Crusades? What of the Holocaust victims? What of the attempted genocide of the Bahai's? These savagries were performed in the name of God and under the aegais of different belief structures.So, what is the message here? That God is love? If so, then why would that God demand that his son be tortured? Is the message that Christ suffered? Then ask how many other faiths have been persecuted at the hands of the ruling religions. The message of love and tolerance is obliterated by the sadistic images of pure torture and misery."},{"rating":"2","title":"An open prayer","review":"I'm sorry Lord.

Jesus's life wasn't supposed to be about violence, why focus on it so much? I'm not trying to be picky or anything but (with some non-notable exceptions) EVERYTHING was simply someone getting beat up. What is the lesson?

The suffering seemed kind of pointless to me, without the religious philosophy behind it. But the friend argued that the teachings of Jesus didn't matter at all, the only thing that mattered was the suffering Jesus endured while being crucified. Well, maybe that explains why Mel Gibson and American fundamentalists are lock-step on this story. It's a Passion Play without any passion, without any story and without any depth - it stays right at the surface, which is, I guess, where the director believes it belongs. This is literally a movie that is skin-deep - especially if you mean flayed skin, and HEEPS OF BLOOD. A bad movie not because it's shocking but because it's shallow and, despite the blood, it is terribly dull and terribly thin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anti Semitism","review":"I don't understand.

(jk) But really its sad that we have films convert people to christianity that contain such hatreds of jews. I don't understand why he can't have a disclaimer at the beginning of the film. I guess what I want to do is apologize to jewish people everywhere on behalf of this film. not every christian is as intolerant as mel gibson"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck!","review":"When I first saw this movie in the theater, I really thought it was horrible. But, I decided to give it a second chance on DVD...it was even WORSE! Here's the thing on this film, it's done based on the fact that we know who all of these characters are-NO CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT?? I'd expect a lack of character development in a porno, but not something that is supposed to be so \\"moving\\" and \\"important\\". So, yeah, I realize that most people know the story of Jesus and all that stuff...and I know the story, but this movie really didn't sell it for me. Oh, and let's talk about the \\"gore\\" in this film...oh please!!! The original Exorcist had better gore effects than this film! With such a huge budget, you would think they could afford something better. This movie sucked on so many levels, I can't believe I wasted four hours of my life on it! And, just like the kids from South Park, I think Mel Gibson owes me my money back!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sado-Jews and Masochist-Jesus","review":"The movie is a gore fest for violence loving Christians depicting their favorite Sadistic \\"Christ killing\\" Jews and anti-hero Jesus, who is supposed to be the Son of an omnipotent God and also that God himself, but is apparently so unimaginative that he can't think of another way to forgive his own creations by any other means than suicide. (Taking about running around the barn before going in.)If I were Jewish I would be really ticked off; good thing it's just the typical Christian propaganda and pure fiction.If you're a American sheeple or into blood and torture you'll love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE PASSION OF THE CRAP","review":"this movie is nothing more than two hours of the rodney king beatings except w/ jesus."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Crux of Christianity","review":"After viewing this film, I left with one, pervading thought: my deeds either add to Christ's suffering, or help relieve them. There is no middle ground for those who view this film.As the many reviews suggest, there is stark division between those who are deeply moved by the love Christ showed for mankind by enduring His Passion, and those who make a mockery of it: just like those who surrounded Jesus as He hung on the cross. Jesus prophecied that \\"When I be lifted up from the earth, I will draw all men unto myself.\\" This is certainly true: \\"all men,\\" those who seek to comfort Christ in His profound, redemptive suffering; and those who choose only to intensify it.I am deeply grateful for the honest, Roman Catholic witness of this film to the Passion, Death and Resurrection of the God-Man. We all, wittingly or unwittingly, take our side as the result of witnessing Christ's crucifixion. And we are each manifested, inescapably, as either benefactor or malefactor as the result."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uggh!","review":"I needed strong drink to wash my mouth out after sitting through POTC, the most distasteful film I've ever seen. The only benefit from watching it was the sense of duty to warn others off. Like incinerating an insect under a magnifying glass, Gibson accentuates a few verses in the story of the last week of Jesus into a gruesome, disgusting, gratuitous gorefest. Maybe it helps one's appreciation to believe that Jesus died for our sins (which I don't), but even in that case, I don't think that Gibson's relentless portrayal of violence adds much to the magic."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Very Hard Movie to Watch","review":"I went to see what all the hype was about. I came away with a mixed impression. It was hard to follow at times and very hard to watch the violence...but I can see how some might think it a great movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"wanted it to be good, but what a dissappointment...","review":"This film leaves so much to be desired by the time the closing credits roll, you wonder why you sat through it in the first place. It appears to have absolutely no purpose... just meanders along violently... never giving... and there are few stories whether true or fictional that are better more exciting fare for good film-making than this -- so the plot was thick and ripe for an amazing movie experience... but they just didnt pull it off unfortunately. If you love the Jesus story you will be sadly dissappointed by this strange twisted desultory mess of a film."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a boring snuff film","review":"Nothing more than an attempt to guilt trip people into believing a 2,000 year old fairy tale which is showing signs of decay.

I watched the movie for about an hour and walked out."},{"rating":"1","title":"GIVE ME A BREAK","review":"After all of the thousands of words, arguments and heated passions that this movie has inspired since long before its release, it is a real downer to find out, upon viewing it, that it is a crummy movie. The subject matter -- the final suffering and crucifixion of Jesus Christ -- could not be more compelling, even for non-believers. But somehow Mel Gibson has managed to squeeze so much slow-motion blood out of the proceedings, without giving us any context for the character of the actual man, that the story is oddly passionless. And talk about over the top! The beatings, mutilations, and general bloodletting are so graphic that they teeter on snuff -- match this with the ridiculous horror-movie images of a slithery he-she as Satan, and you've got what could best be described as a gore-fest. Yuck. The two stars are for Jim C., who suffers nobly in a very realistic prosthetic nose, and the cinematography, which is at times lovely."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Film Blowith","review":"I have to be honest with you, im not a religous person and that might be the reason that i dont like this film. Ive only been to church once (which was very boring i might add). The real problem with this film is that to me its just a guy getting whip and punched for 2 hours. And you know what that doesnt make for a good movie that makes for a movie that is really boring. The most fun i had watching this film was counting the times jesus got hit and cherring for the jews just so i could be on the winning side.Basiclly if your not a religous person i dont beleve that you will like this movie but if you are religous then you will love this movie (even though you have allready seen it).

A devout Catholic full of love, or an entertainer addicted to gore, blood, torture and violence, not only in this movie, but throughout his whole career?Well, it's up to you to decide. Unfortunately, he chose to display violence once more, this time centering his blood-lust around the Christ, to a point that, around the middle of the movie, some viewers were already num to the violence being shown on the screen, in such a way that whatever message this director was trying to pass was lost.It's a shame that such a budget by such a famous actor / director was wasted in telling one of the most important and beautiful stories of the world in this fashion..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jesus Christ.","review":"It should have been called the Blood of Christ, or Passion For The Almighty Dollar.

Yikes, the movie was bad. But then, I didn't go into it believing it was anything else but a MOVIE. Made by Actors, Screenwriters, etc., and a product of Gibson's bloody mind. As for a deep, religious experience, I'm not too lazy to open up my Bible and read the word of God. That's moving and uplifting for any soul. This MOVIE, let me say that again, this MOVIE, is so violent it's just sad. So the Pope endorsed an \\"R\\" rated movie.

It's blatant pandering to an unrealistic sense of events surrounding Jesus's crucification. Last Temptation of Christ was probably closer to truth."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST MOVIE I EVER SAW!","review":"Please DO NOT waste your time, money, or energy on this worthless film. It is filled with lies, and far too much violence. We must teach peace and love. Jesus is surely ashamed of this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst movie ever made!","review":"This movie is disgusting, vile and even worse factually inaccurate. It is sick that anyone made money on this film and someone spent money on this film! The JEWS had nothing to do with the death of JC, it was clearly the Romans. The Passion Plays this movie is based on, caused the murder of hundreds of thousands of innocent JEWS by inciting hatred over the last 2,000 years. Can we please get out of the Dark ages? Just if you were wondering, I am not Jewish."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best potrayals of Jesus.","review":"I went to see this twice at the movies, because it was very emotional, and heartbreaking. My heart went out to Jesus during the torture scenes, and the acting was absolutely excellent. Mel Gibson put everything he had into this movie, and he did a great job bringing the greatest story ever told to the big screen. I was mad when this movie only got 3 Oscar nominations, because I felt that it should've gotten more. This may not be as good as Jesus of Nazareth, but it comes pretty damn close."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mel Gibson's The Passion of Christ is relentlessly violent","review":"It took me till August of 2004 to watch The Passion Of Christ. I didn't think I could watch Christ so bruttaly tortuted. Then! I watched and just shook my head.I read this somewhere and could not have said it any better.\\"This movie expends so much energy portraying the wounds and innocent suffering of Jesus that the real climax of the Christian story -- the resurrection of Christ--all but evaporates from the screen. The movie drives so inexorably toward convincing us of the brutality of Jesus' death that nothing is left over when the resurrection comes. A deflated burial cloth, a new face, free from bloody bruises, a step out into the light.\\"The Only part of the movie that was even believable was parts of the actual Crucification. And what's up with the Devil being a woman?\\"Jesus Of Nazareth,\\" gets my vote for the BEST movie on the BIRTH, LIFE, DEATH & RESSURECTION OF JESUS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Sick for the Eyes","review":"One previous reviewer of this movie got it right. This is more like an MTV, \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\\" or a George A. Romero version of the crucifixion. Gibson tried to make a Biblical epic but instead he ended up with something that looks somewhat like a snuff film. Pretty soon, the long scenes of torture get so sick, you just can't stand watching anymore. Why is the Crucifixion suddenly turning into a 1970s horror movie with demons, baby devils, Satan, and gore. Sometimes the torture got sick, other times it just got silly.I can't even believe that church leaders let their congregants watch this movie. They even let kids watch it despite the fact that it was rated R. This film should be redone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointlessly grotesque and one-dimensional.","review":"Despite Mel Gibson's claims of good intention, this film did nothing to help me understand nor believe the story of Jesus other than a over-dramatized work of fiction. But it did reinforce my belief that governments and religion simply do not mix, even to this day."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Passion","review":"Bravo to Mel Gibson for standing up to the criticism of Hollywood, and all of the non-believers out there! This is honestly the BEST film I have ever seen. Taken right out of the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John this is a truly eye-opening visual for all of us who are familiar with the crucifixion according to the Bible. It allows you to use your visual sense to understand the pain and agony Jesus suffered for us hopefully impacting your walk with Him. Again, bravo Mel! I hope everyone gets the chance to see this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm sorry that I saw it and would NOT recommend it","review":"It is hard to fathom the idea that the story of the crucifixion could be made in a way in which the violence feels gratuitous, but Mel Gibson seems to have managed this difficult task. Instead of feeling inspired or touched or moved to compassion, I was left feeling numb. I was open to a more positive experience of the film, notwithstanding the inherent violence of the story.Whatever artistic or spiritual goals may have been intended by the writers and director, they were lost for me in the violence that appeared, as the film progressed, to be the the main objective."},{"rating":"1","title":"What would Jesus do?","review":"If Jesus were alive today, he would boycott this proposterous assertion of his final moments. As any good, devout, patriotic christian knows from reading the sacred dead sea scrolls, Jesus lived to be an old man with many children and his beloved Queen Mary magdaline. Mel Gibson, or Mad Gibson, has clearly visited his cocaine dealer one too many times lately to dream up this convoluted, blood-bath of Caligula-styled paranoia in an extreme attempt to banish everyone elese's money into to his wallet. By the way, people who have been whipped this many times generally don't still have skin on their backs. A much more accurate portrayal of Jesus and God in the lives of people in modern times would be the powerfully moving The Order. With crisp direction and cardinal slurring, it is sure to keep the congregation gasping."},{"rating":"1","title":"The truth about Jesus!","review":"Jesus was nothing more than a petty criminal (at least according to Roman law at that time) who was rightly executed under Roman law.

It is about some dude named yeshua who gets the crap beaten out of him. Also the actors don't even speak English, the whole film is shot in FRENCH or something!!! And it is COMPLETELY UNREALISTIC, here are some examples:1) When some soldiers come to arrest Yeshoe, his homies beat the tar out of them!! But then he tells his homies to BACK OFF and let him be arrested!!! WHY??????2) When Yeshoa is getting whipped badly, there are lots of his homies in the audience all sad and stuff!! So why don't the TEAM UP AND RUSH THE SOLDIERS?? They are WUSSES, if my friend was getting beat down I WOULD HELP HIM OUT!!3) (...)?In conclusion this movie STINKS and if you like it then you're dumb.

It was not in English, actually it was in Aramaic. I returned this item and was told if I replaced it instead of getting a refund, they could not assure me that the new one would be in Engllish. The language was not shown anywhere in the description. They said they usually come in English but if they are out of it in English, they send whatever they have. THIS SEEMS LIKE A TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE PRACTICE TO ME!

It is another matter when a wealthy Christian fundamentalist actor from action films chooses to do so and this is a film born of ignorance.The film is unnecessarily violent and bloody and is itself based on history remembered by those who were not witnesses.As a result, it is also strongly antisemitic at a time when the World does not need to fuel such hatred.I urge those who produced this travesty to read the American bestseller Constantine's Sword by James Carroll, who is himself a devout Catholic and if they have any intelligence - and of course, an open mind - they will be humbled by the experience and ashamed of the money they have wasted on this rubbish."},{"rating":"2","title":"what is this language these people are speaking","review":"Putting a side all the religion problems this movie creates.The biggest disrespect in this movie is this language these people are speaking. What is it? Is it Hebrew? I don't think so.I've been speaking Hebrew and English all of my life and never have I heard such nonsense. I did recognize some words but that's about it.Regarding the so called \\"Look of a Jew\\": well I've seen some wonderful paintings of christen religion leaders that look more like a Jew (if there is such a look)And why not thank dear Mel Gibson for adding some more mayhem to an already hatful world. Let's just find more reasons to hate each anotherIsn't it ironic that the Christian religious world blames Jews for killing one of there own while worshiping this Jew?Stop with this religious obsession. Believe in your self."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Greatest Movie Ever","review":"This is the greatest movie ever!!! I recommend everyone see it. I don't believe that people understand what Jesus did for us. He gave his life for us, who could never even come close to deserving it. The pain that he went through while people mocked him, spit on him, humiliated him and he didn't have to go through it, but he did because HE LOVES US!This movie gives as accurate portrayal of what Jesus did for us as you can get. James Cavaziel gave an amazing performace. I don't think anyone could have done any better.I believe that Mel Gibson was following GOD in this and I appreciate that someone will stand up for what he believes in and not be ashamed to say that he is a Christian and He loves GOD.As for me, I give it 5 stars, and recommend everyone to watch it. I believe that it will change your life. I am a Christian and had heard the story of Jesus all of my life, but seeing this movie really opened my eyes to what he went through for me, and everyone else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful","review":"This depiction of the last 12 hours in the life of Jesus Christ is certainly powerful. For many, myself included, the crucifixion of Christ had become little more than a part of the window dressing of Christianity. The familiar images of a Caucasian Christ on the cross had lost their power to horrify, and in turn had lost their power to communicate the suffering and sacrifice that lie at the heart of the central event of the Christian faith. Director Mel Gibson restores its terrible, gritty reality. This is a fully human Jesus that experiences unimaginable torment, not a primarily spiritual being existing above the mortal plane who is merely going through the motions for the benefit of mankind. I am not a Christian, but I feel that I have gained a greater appreciation and understanding of the Christian faith for having seen this film. This is not a film to \\"enjoy,\\" but it is a powerful experience that has something to offer to anyone with an open mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Questions....#1 biblical movie of all TIMES!","review":"Honestly to say the least i thought this movie was going to be an ok movie, something to watch when it comes out on dvd or cable. but my cousins had invited me to the movies, who were going to pay for me so i went. this movie was so emotional. anyone who doesnt feel any emotion to this movie, is absolutely heartless. i recommend seeing, but not constantly. maybe once in a long while, its not a movie to keep watching over and over but a good movie to own. I without a doubt give this movie 5 stars.

I for one will be honest and say I dont like to go to church, and im really not into anything spirtual, but I HAD to see this movie. This movie is one of the few movies that I was about ready to cry watching it. Mel Gibson did a very fine job showing what Jesus did for his people. This movie actuly scared me in some scenes which added to its value. This is one of the few films also that when I got up to leave the theater, I look around and half the audience is still sitting in there seats, looking blankly at the screen. Props to James Caviezel for his outstanding portral as Jesus. He did an unbeleavable job for that kind of demanding role. Well worth the price of admition and dvd."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best film on the crucifixion that I've ever seen","review":"This is the best film that I have seen on the crucifixion of Jesus Christ. I have a video titled \\"How Christ Died - The Final 18 Hours\\", of which I previously viewed as the best representation of what Christ suffered. Gibson's film not only accurately portrays what Christ suffered but it brings out the emotions of what the people closest to him must have felt. I believe that it is very important for people to understand what Christ did for us. We hear many stories of his teaching but we don't see or hear much about how much he suffered for his greatest creation...mankind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Watch this BEFORE you show the kids.","review":"The only reason this is rated 4 not 5 stars is the realism. The crucifiction was ugly and violent. No Jesus Christ movie before this including King of Kings and Jesus of Nazareth really showed just how badly our Lord suffered at the hands of the Romans. Mel Gibson's installment is different from any previous films on the crucifiction. One thing for sure people either loved this movie or hated it. Controversial, judge for yourself at a great price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best movies of all time","review":"One of the most realistic depictions about what happened about 2000 years ago.

It is the single most important film to have been made."},{"rating":"2","title":"A haunting, powerful film","review":"Though 'The Passion of the Christ' is not an easy film to watch, I would still rate it as one of my top films of all times. This is an eye-opener, one of the most realistic portrayals to the life of Christ. Though very violent, this is what really happened (if not exactly like the actual event, at least close to it), and therefore something we must be aware of, rather than having the facts sugar-coated.Additionally, Gibson put in greater depths to Christ's suffering by having flashbacks to Palm Sunday as well as his childhood, and this just made me weep all the more. If you haven't seen the movie, you must watch it to see how these events fit into the context of the last 12 hours.A haunting and powerful film, it made me weep up to the very end. I recently saw this again at a church viewing, and the entire church hall was filled with sniffing and weeping. Some people were even prepared with a huge box of tissues. It's a movie that has stayed with me for the rest of my life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth watching","review":"I held off watching this movie because I had heard so much about the blood and gore. But I knew that I would eventually see it. I embrace the story of Christ and the power of his teachings. Though this film contains only a few scenes of his life and ministry, the depiction of torture and the crucifixion aptly conveys a message of love - that is, what Christ was willing to suffer for all mankind. The imagery of the devil was well-placed. And, to me at least, the story moved at a good pace - not too fast, not too slow. Moreover, James Caviezel's performance was outstanding. However, I was not moved emotionally (or, spiritually) the way I had anticipated. Perhaps it was the hype. But I'm glad that it got so much (well-deserved) attention."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reality check","review":"I thought I knew the story of Jesus, having been raised very strictly in the Bible belt. After viewing this film, I find myself woefully ignorant (or at least without imagination for tortures used in the past). I was moved to tears (as well as nausea) throughout the film. Kudos to Mr Gibson. This is the film of our generation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie!!!","review":"I don't get it. Crucification was a brutal way to die. It was a method left for the lowest of the low of the criminals. Gibson simply took what was independently attested history and placed it on film. If you don't believe me, all you need to do is to simply research this issue starting with the first century Jewish historian Josephus. So, this is not a horror flick or the production of some type of extremist. It presents a historically accurate presentation of a type of Roman execution. And yes, it's not pretty.The beauty of The Passion (i.e. suffering)of The christ and this movie is that it tells a story of someone who chose to suffer and die for what he thought was the salvation of human kind. Long after we have died and our children's children have been forgotten in history, this amazing narrative will continue to be told. Gibson is simply one link in a 2,000 year chain of sharing this remarkable moment in time."},{"rating":"2","title":"absolutely thought provoking","review":"This movie has a lot of excellent features - cinematography, acting, musical score, graphic details and the direction of mel gibson is impeccable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mel's Masterpiece","review":"I thought the movie a MASTERPIECE!!!!Saw it with a Scripture expert who agreed totally....It reminded me that WE ARE ALL RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CRUCIFIXION...I shall doubtless see it again...and again...though it is most excruciating to watch..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not anti-semitic","review":"As a Christian, I watched this film with great interest and emotion. NEVER... NOT ONCE did I feel one bit of anger toward the Jewish people. (My Savior IS Jewish) As I watched this movie, I was only more keenly aware of my own sin in causing the death of Christ. Mel Gibson has presented an accurate, biblical portrayal of the final hours of Christ's life before the crucifixion.That is why the Isaiah passage is quoted at the beginning of this movie. Anyone who reads this scripture can clearly see \\"He was wounded FOR OUR transgressions, bruised FOR OUR iniquities...\\" Mel Gibson's point is clear: It is OUR sin that caused Christ to die. Anyone with any sense whatsoever will not blame the Jewish people because they were not to blame for Christ's death. Anyone who truly reads and listens to what Mel Gibson is saying in this movie will blame only ONE person for Christ's death: Themselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good depiction of how Christ actually died.","review":"Some people think that this movie was too gory and that christ actually didnt get beaten that bad. Well just so you know the Bible says that people couldnt even recognize him as a man which is saying that its possible he was beaten even worse which is a sad thought. In every 'Jesus' movie i have ever seen, it shows Jesus up on a cross with a little cut on his side. The reason i say that is because \\"The Passion\\" shows detail and shows how excrutiating his death really was, and what he went through for us. The only reason i can see someone not liking this movie is that they are too week hearted and cant take the violence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why?","review":"It's not a very subtle film is it? It's not a complete disaster and technically it's flawless as could be expected but why would one want to watch torture for the duration of a feature length film?

Propably, and there is a lot of them isn't there?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Moving Account of Jesus' final 12 hours.","review":"I just saw this movie with one of my younger sisters for Easter, and we were both very moved by it. It is definitely a realistic portrayl of what Jesus had to go through for us. Watching this movie, in a way, has brought me closer to Jesus, and it really left an impact on me. It's a very heavy movie, however, and very difficult to watch. I don't like to see people getting hurt, so seeing Jesus get hurt was especially hard for me. But it really shows you how much Jesus loves and cares for us all by taking the burden of sin for us. I think this is a movie everyone should see because it is a real reminder of the wonderful love Jesus has for all of us. The movie was all in Hebrew, too, with subtitles, so it was very realistic and quite faithful to the Gospels. Mel Geibson did a wonderful job sharing with us a very realistic glimpse of the last 12 hours of the life of Jesus."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Passion Of The Christ (VHS)","review":"I'm very pleased with the product I purchased.

Its just a movie for \\"Godsake\\". You are not giving grades to \\"God\\".The dipictions distracted from any message that Director hoped to get across. Isn't Godlyness about love and forgiveness? What purpose does it serve 2000 years later to fake up the violence in this manner. Is this really the message of Christianity? That we love to watch our Gods brutalized in this manner and consider it a holy experience. Is this Christianity's core?May be it is for certain people such as Mel Gibson and his clan, but I reject this portryal of Christianity. The whole violence thing was a crass trick to get people to see this movie.

It comes from a book written by a looney nun (Anne Catherine Emmerich) published in 1833: \\"The Dolorous Passion of Our Lord Jesus Christ.\\"Better to spend your money on \\"The Passion of the Jew,\\" a South Park episode which proves that Mel Gibson is crazy."},{"rating":"1","title":"a sick, pointless exercise in sadomasochism","review":"I can't understand how people can see this as a recruiting film for churches. Frankly, I worry about people who liked this having custody of children or pets. If anything, it made me want to avoid churchgoers as I avoid Nazis and Klansmen. If I were a Martian arriving on earth and this was shown to me to explain this major religion, I would recommend having the earth vaporized before this dangerous insanity spread. Jesus said some admirable things about mercy and forgiveness, but you won't find them in this sick piece of trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mel Gibson crucifies my Lord a second time","review":"Wow, such fervent devotion to a Hollywood picture. Of course Jesus spoke to Mel Gibson and gave his script writers enough material to fill a long movie. Hmmm. My Bible certainly doesn't have all those details. But I'm NOT Mel Gibson! I can't sucker hoards of people to worship at the alter of the big screen. Did you ever ask yourself the question, \\"What would Jesus do if he saw this?\\" Good question, since he was there and Mel Gibson wasn't. For those of us who really are devoted to Jesus and READ THE BIBLE, this movie is an atrocity. Oh well, go out and buy the DVD if you think it represents our Lord. And while you're at it, buy the \\"Passion Stationary Kit\\" too. It's being sold at Walmart. No rock has been left unturned for the profit mongers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost respect for Mel Gibson","review":"This is a film that I cannot even recommend to my elderly, born-again Christian grandparents. I have lost respect for Mel Gibson after being subjected to the abusive violence in this slasher film. But I suppose this is the product of a kooky director with too much time on his hands.I will give this movie 2 stars only becuase the cinematography is beautiful, the acting superb and the setting/costumes were perfect.The content of the film is horrible.

It is a silly movie. Nothing realistic about it. Pasolini's The Gospel According to Matthew (1964) is a far superior film. I think you have a hard time trying to make a popular entertainment and trying to tell the truth simultaneously, because people will prefer fantasy and cliche over truth and beauty. It's telling that most people who bought this DVD also bought the Star Wars DVD. Star Wars must be one of the biggest myths of our time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sick.","review":"The point of this horribly graphic exploration of masochism, it seems to me, is to show that 'The Christ' (the anointed one) suffered more than any human being has ever suffered or ever will suffer.What twaddle!And all because of YOU! -- Now aren't you ashamed of yourselves?!This film is, in a word:SICK."},{"rating":"1","title":"How Can This Be Rated on accuracy ? ? ?","review":"How can \\"The Passion Of The Christ\\" be rated on accuracy when it does not state in the Bible just how 'Tortuous' Jesus's Death was.

I mean not many people (religious or not) know most of the stories about Jesus. They should have explained what Jesus believed in more and also the back ground stories of the people shown in the film. I mean it should have had much more about the life of Jesus, instead my friends were asking me to explain who the characters were. He would have reached more people if he has done this. Also SO many other people though history have suffered because of Christianity. About 60,000 women were tortured to death in the \\"witch trials\\", for no reason! This movie has no perspective, its just over an hour of gore! The only good that can come out of this movie is if Mel spends some of his hundreds of millions on worth while causes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunate film reflects the film maker's values","review":"Perhaps it takes drunkenness to get Mel Gibson to admit the obvious: that they does not like Jews. Sadly, this film not only insults them, but Christians as well, with its brutal violence and its cartoon-like recreation of the greatest and most dramatic moments of Christ's time on earth. To make it worst, the bad guys in the movie sound as if they are speaking Klingon. Stick to goofy police & buddy films, as well as dopey love stories, Mel, as that is where your talents are to be found."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE SNUFF FILM AS HIGH ART","review":"Beautifully acted and filmed (by the son of noted Holocaust denier Hutton Gibson), obviously made with \\"passion\\" for the (literal and figurative) self-flagellation crowd. After the poor guy gets the lash for the 114th time (yeah, I know it's only 39; it just seemed like 114), with all that red-dyed corn syrup splattering all over the place, it just starts to get a little silly, kind of like the flying entrails in ANDY WARHOL'S FRANKENSTEIN. Capital punishment is, of course, not very funny, especially when the punishment is Death By Torture, so I did my best not to laugh.If Evangelicals, Opus Dei Catholics, sadists and other moonbats want to go all swooney over this sort of thing, they are most welcome to. To the curious, but more sqeamish, of my fellow nonbelievers, I would not suggest watching this after a heavy meal. If you must do so, keep a bucket handy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bewildered that many enjoyed this","review":"I don't see how this movie recieved so much praise other than for the fact that many people must've been blinded by their faith to the point that they would support anything pertaining to their god without viewing it first and foremost as art without a completely biased eye. This movie told no story and made no attempt to, it was simply an hours worth of beating the likes of which would've killed Jesus long before he made it to the cross. It seems as if this film was made for the sole purpose of evoking pity and guilt, rather than educating."},{"rating":"1","title":"The violence is over the top","review":"I'm not squeamish, and I love gory horror flicks. But, those type of films have a different target audience than the Passion does. As others have pointed out, it's virtually a snuff film. The violence done to Jesus was not the sacrifice he made to redeem humanity; many, many people have undergone such savage treatment. What elevates his pain and suffering over anyone elses?I hope the irony of the masses of Christians subjecting their children to this film while at the same time deploring violence in videogames isn't lost on the public."},{"rating":"1","title":"blood and Gore","review":"No plot, no story, just a lot of torture, blood and violence. Giving some background to the life of Jesus would have helped, but it starts with his arrest, and lets you watch for two hours as he is brutally tortured and killed.

I am a catholic and I saw this movie just last week and when The movie ended I could not Help but cry and feel depressed. Jesus's death is horrible but so are many other deaths of people around the world today. It's really pointless to see a person being tortured for an hour because that's sad and horrible. I dont recommend this movie to anyone, You already know how jesus died on the cross so there is no need to view this gory pointless and worthless movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"another bad movie","review":"I see 617 people have reviewed this film, so I'm kind of on the end. I know that over the years any controversy sells tickets. It took me two days to sit through this movie, and not because of the beatings etc. It was trying to watch and read at the same time. It is right up there with \\"The last temptation\\", which was also unwatchable. The last \\"good\\" movie about Christ was \\"The King of Kings\\", those many years ago. At least I could understand it. One reviewer said if you want the life of Christ read Fulton Sheen's \\"Life of Christ\\" I couldn't agree more. If the right wing christians and jews had not said anything about this film it would have died a natural death, as would have \\"temptation\\". There are better ways to spend two hours. I was not \\"moved\\", nor did I cry as I tryed to watch this one. All I kept thinking was \\"what's the point?\\" and speak English so maybe I could \\"enjoy\\" the picture."},{"rating":"1","title":"We get the point","review":"It doesn't take an hour and 1/2 of a movie of beating one person to get the point. I understand Jesus was whipped, beat, etc etc etc. But to sit for an hour and 1/2 of the movie to watch it, well is overkill.. Cut out an hour of the torture and the movie might now be so painfull(pun intended)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jesus getting his butt royally handed to him for 2 Hours.. That's it...","review":"A brutal portrayal of the death of Jesus. Very violent and graphic. There was not much to this except someone getting beaten, and beaten, and whipped, and whipped with razor-tipped whips, then beaten and whipped again. Then he musters up the energy to carry a cross and then gets nailed to it.The guy who played Jesus did a fantastic character portrayal. He was in another movie I watched and of course I did not recognize him as the same actor in Passion.My major complaint lies in the fact that most of this movie is based on beatings and torture.

Maybe show a bit of what else Jesus did in his life."},{"rating":"2","title":"An good introduction to Him","review":"Read the Bible if you want to know moreabout Jesus. And it is good for you ifyou do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Garbage","review":"As opinion maker, Hermann Goering wouldn't do better. Mr Gibson proved himself a very harmful filmmaker; he should definitely stick to Mad Max and Lethal Weapon's foolish but entertaining acting.As an action (!?) film it's BAD. All the torture and brutal spanking takes us back to \\"Mondo Cane\\" in the seventies (or sixties?).Seems like a free session of sadism and hate.As a religious film, is as valid as an Iraqui film showing their \\"martyrs\\" and children being slain savagely by occupation soldiers (that's what the Romans were, right?).Let's stay here.Once Orson Welles made innocent people kill themselves by radio and upon a joke.Imagine how easy is to manipulate today's masses through powerful images and good photography. Anyone who falls in this great commercial trap should reconsider his own perception.One point in favor - the language -aramaic,latin and hebrew - seems quite original and appropriate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unnecessarily violent, and was missing the whole point, that is LOVE","review":"This movie is more like a propaganda film. None of us will ever know for sure about the historical Jesus, since he lives more in myths and beliefs than in historical chronicle. How did Mr Gibson know about the level of cruelty shown? Moreover, Jesus was depicted more like the conventional iconography--caucasian male with a beard and long hair. How did a hard working carpenter look in 2000 yrs old Middle East? Certainly not like the one shown.However, this movie did one good thing for me: reminded me about the necessity to cultivate compassion for fellow human beings. On the other hand, for the simple-minded, literal believer, this movie will generate hate, vengeance, and totally undeserving surge of emotion.From that standpoint, I must say, this movie fell short as a visual art.Watch it, but please \\"watch out\\" about what you feel."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Bottom Line","review":"Opinions and understandings of the movie and its message have been somewhat mixed and very controversial. Instead of trying to argue what faith is right, who understands the gospel the best, and how accurate the movie is let's get to the bottom line. The movie has been an over all good thing for a country like ours that is increasingly tolerant of everything but discipline and Christian morality. The movie has inspired people to renew their commitment to God, read and re-read the gospel. It has burned disturbing images into our brains to remind us of his love, what was endured, and what was given for our salvation. Read and interpret the bible according to your understanding of our Lord. God bless Mel Gibson for helping so many move towards a first look, new look, or just another look at the good book and the message of love from Christ our Lord."},{"rating":"1","title":"another one","review":"with so many movies, books, and shows about \\"the greatest story ever told\\" do we really need another one? I suppose because this one sets a record for the biggest-budgeted \\"story\\"?There's too much violence, and the real villain Pontius Pilate is depicted as a sympathetic caring individual which is historically inaccurate. There was no way the Roman procurator would be told what to do by anyone, particularly by Jewish people, oppressed and brutalized by the Romans. In addition, this flick is completely devoid of real spirituality, but Hollywood sham abounds with ridiculous satan, slow-motion shots, and lots of blood. Then again, what can you expect from an B-movie shoot-em-up \\"star\\" who suddenly found his \\"true calling\\"?What's particularly appaling is the participation of a daugher of a Holocaust survivor in this film, given Gibson-pere's statement that the Holocaust never happened.This movie will appeal to right-wing Christian zealots and Nazis."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just plain boring","review":"It bored me so much that I couldn't even watch the whole thing, and I can handle some pretty boring stuff. Not much more to say about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The GREATEST LOVE STORY EVER SEEN ON FILM!","review":"Was it disturbing? YES!Was it brutal? YES! But the Truth often is.This is, by far, the most realistic version of the Passion and Death of Our Blessed Lord that has ever been depicted on TV/film.Applause goes out to each and every actor, as they brought out emotions which previous versions, depicting scenes of the suffering and death of Christ, haven't even come close to doing.To the critics, who complained that the movie was all \\"blood and gore\\": What did you expect from a flagellation and Crucifixion? You knew what this film was about before viewing it, yet you criticized it for showing what it was 'Supposed' to show: \\"The last 12 hours of the life of Jesus Christ\\".Suffice it to say; this was probably tame compared to the actual event.Definitely a film every Christian should own."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Passion of the Christ","review":"A waste of money as they is nothing other then violence and misinformation."},{"rating":"1","title":"A sick gorefest","review":"Christ's true message of love and redemption is completely lost in this bloody, torture-filled horror show.

This movie helped trigger a conversation that helped re-inforce my belief in Jesus Christ as our savior. It helped to make me realize that I can admit I am a sinner and that I need to be saved by Jesus to enter into heaven someday. I think this movie helped put emotion behind the story of Jesus. Hopefully it helps others believe more strongly in Jesus. Watch it and see. You never know how it might make you feel. Even if there's only a slight chance that Jesus really did go through this torture for us, it would help to try to believe, just in case! Hell for eternity would be awful. I want to go to heaven. It is also pretty graphic and edge of your seat."},{"rating":"2","title":"I don't know what to say about this movie","review":"Bluray is superb. Movie?Language is in Aramaic and the way they speak it is not believable (it's like saying 1 word at a time and stopping for 2 seconds between each word). They should have practiced more to make the dialog flow smoother. The whole movie is about his last moments, so don't expect much on character development. But still worth watching (once; it's not something you can watch every week)."},{"rating":"2","title":"HOLY GREAT","review":"The price was right, the movie definitely right!

When I saw this movie I was not only moved to tears but found my life changing in the most wonderful of ways! I prayed for forgiveness of my sins again because all of what Jesus endured, he endured for us. He didn't have to, ya know? And I now have the blessed assurance that I will go to Heaven! Amen!

The language, the cinematography, the music, the costuming, the acting, the visual effects... you are there.And Gethsemane and Calvary during the Passion were at once terrible and beautiful places to be.If you are a Christian, you owe it to yourself to experience this film. If you are not, you should see it anyway because filmmaking like this doesn't come along very often."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is there a sixth star?","review":"Oh wow. This movie is awesome. I could write for weeks and not make you think this movie is as good as it really is. Everything is depicted so well. I remember seeing it in the theaters and the only thing you can hear after the movie ends is the occasional person crying. It is amazing. It really really shows what Christ went through. Makes you realize the scourging wasn't just a couple of hits with a club. He had so little skin left on him by the end it was awful! And the real shocker is that they didn't show all the wounds either...not by a long shot. Like I already mentioned though I could write a 40 page interpretive essay on it and it wouldn't be good enough. So the best thing for you to do is just watch it yourself!"},{"rating":"2","title":"HAPPY EASTER!!!","review":"In honor of today being Easter, I thought I'd review this movie. This film chronicles that last few hours of Jesus Christ being tortured, whipped, and crucified on the cross for us! He's our Lord and saviour, and he died for our sins, that's how he rolls! I highly recommend THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Such pain.","review":"The VHS was wonderful. The DVD is wonderfully graphic.

I loved every minute of it. My problem, however, is with the special features on the DVD. I know that special features have become somewhat obligatory, but are bloopers really appropriate? It seems somehow sacrilegious to show an actor getting hit below the belt in the most sacred movie ever made. I'm as big a fan of guys getting hit in the jewels as the next guy, but save if for \\"Ernie Goes to Golgatha.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Missed The Point!!!","review":"After watching this movie I think Mel Gibson missed the point of Christ dying. His movie seemed to focus more on the beating and torture of Christ than the result of his death. It is important to understand that Christ died because of all of us. The Jews, Christians, Atheists, Agnostics, and everyone alike. It makes no difference who physically killed Christ the symbolism is that he dies for all of our sins. Most great people have focused on the return of Christ from the dead, this is the imporatant point. His return and the salvation of mankind. I think Gibson believes that we should all be reminded how brutal Christ's death was, but this is disrespectful to his image and completely disregards what this event meant for mankind. As for the film being anti-semetic, I think it is, but only for those who ignore the fact that Chrsit died because of our sins and we all sin. All of us are responisible and people should keep that in mind, at least all who believe in the Christian faith."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Passion of the Christ","review":"As everyone knows, Mel Gibson's film focuses on the last 12 hours of the life of Jesus. From the Garden of Gethsemenie to turture to crucifixion to resurrection, Mel Gibson's movie is a emotional journey through the heart of Christian belief. Is it bloody? Yes. Is it violent? Yes. Does that diminish its value? Not in the least. This movie is an unflinching view of Jesus' final hours that is powerful and moving. mes Caviezel, Maia Morgenstern, and Monica Bellucci give stunning performances as Jesus, Mary, and Mary Magdeline respectively. The emotions that they convey on their faces is heartbeaking. As for the anti-Semitism, I did not see any. I think that you will see what you want to see in this regard, although I do not believe contains any anti-Semitic views.

The crucifixion did not result in the beautiful Jesus hanging on the cross that graces many churches across this country. Was it violent? Yes. But, what was done to Jesus WAS violent. During the beating, the scourging, and during the crucifixion all I could think of was why were WE doing this to him? And, knowing he could have stopped it at any time, why didn't he? This was a lesson and a reminder of WHY we are Christians. I don't understand the anti-Semitic criticisms of this movie. There were (are) good and bad people of all sizes, shapes and creeds. We don't hate all Germans because we watched Schindler's List. We don't hate all Japanese because we watched Pearl Harbor. We don't hate Latinos because we watched the Alamo.

Also putting it all in dead languages is a nice touch. However the plot is quite bad. The movies is basically the brutal touchier of a man for hours on end. That is not entertainment it is a kind of punishment. One goes to a Hollywood Blockbuster to be entertained. To watch a fight or hear a joke, see special effects, watch a love story develops from hate to true love. While I could be argued that this movie does have a love story because of some peoples god love for all people. From a story stand point though it is predictable and uneventful even for one who has not read the bible. I know many people disagree with this and some may accuse me of religion bashing but this is how I feel and I do not want your pity or for you to pray just try to consider a view of this movie other then your own."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's about time!","review":"'Passion of the Christ' does justice finally to the life and character of Jesus Christ on film.

For one thing, all they focused on was the beating and crucifiction. They never focused on Jesus's life or his teachings, or accomplishments. I consider myself to be a Christian moderate and I don't believe in everything the church preaches but with all the hype around this film, I expected more. I frankly want to know what moved or inspired anyone here because this was nothing more but a two hour snuff film disguised as something with a spiritual message.

It was the cause for a lot of stir even before it was released. Most people fail to realize all of that doesn't matter because Jesus Christ never existed!! Jesus Christ is a mythological figure the church has exploited for hundreds of years and now the filmmaking industry has for almost a hundred years. There is absolutely no archeological or historical evidence that Jesus Christ existed. Even if he did exist, it would be highly unlikely he would have received that kind of punishment.It is a shame a con artist like Mel Gibson is using this mythological character to make millions of dollars. People have to start swaying away from the manipulations of the church and the filmmaking industry and start looking at the hard facts.

The \\"accuracy\\" of Aramaic and Latin languages scarcely disguises its actual instinct: a sadomaso picture which should be kept inside the X Rated sector. Convicts received at that time 39 lashes, for the Hebraic law forbade 40 lashes.Romans used to respect local standards. Thus, Pilate washed hands and gave Jesus to Jew High Priest. Gibson was right about Semitic incrimination, in case there is guilt indeed or somebody accused ,once Jehova has decided to sacrifice His own Son. Therefore,we should thank Judas for our redemption.

Then of course came the scene where Judas hangs himself. As he screams, you can see a filling in his mouth!!! These are but a few problems with this waste of film. The acting was horrible, pacing paralyzing and the beatings? Come on, NO ONE could survive, let alone walk, after that. This was not entertaining, thought provoking or moving.

Sure, the violence was probably in excess, and there are some extremely gruesome scenes that probably could have been edited out. But when I walked out of that theater, my eyes red from crying, I was really glad that I went to see it because it made me want to be a better and more religious person, and it made me want to kneel down and pray right then and there and thank the Lord for all the suffering and pain he has gone through so we could be here.

Yes the violence was extreme, but in this regard it did more to hinder the emotion that was trying to be conveyed. There comes a point when it is TOO much. We, the audience, become desensitized and detached from what the filmmaker is trying to get across. In other words, the point is gotten across so much that we feel hit over the head with it. Whether you believe this stuff really happened or not (personally I do not), speaking from a film-only critique, it did more damage than good.

There's scene after scene of Jews beating Jesus, laughing at his pain, mixed with a few characters that have sympathy for the dieing figure; that's basicly what you get. As in many Religous themed films there's an abundence of overacting. I understand it needed to be violent, but it just goes over the top. I will say the art direction and cinematography are admirable, and while the story is thin there are certainly scenes with impact. Still the film tired with me fast.

The truth is, we don't know the exact details of the man Jesus of Nazareth's execution- which by the way was one of many executions that took place during this time period. But scientifically speaking, we definitely know that the majority of the violence portrayed in this film does more to sell tickets than to actually show possible torture (a person would have went into shock or died from blood loss after the first few blows).This movie does nothing more to perpetuate a myth to gull thoughtless people into believing in a superstitious religion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ludicrous violence for the sake of violence","review":"There is nothing \\"real\\" or \\"realistic\\" about Gibson's portrayal of violence in this movie.

In many ways the violence in \\"Kill Bill\\" is more subtle than this. Regardless of its historical accuracy (who cares?), this piece of celluloid is nothing more than one opinionated director's desperate--and unintelligent--flagellation of the audience.

But for a movie that meant so much to Mel Gibson, it's almost certain they withheld all the features for a future version to be released during the Holidays. That includes footage and text that caused much of the controversy in the first place over the film which was cut.

The sermon on the mount is reduced to one line. And the most important point is missing -- CHRIST CHOSE THE CROSS. Here, he is portrayed as a victim, dragged around by the jew-mob (there isn't a character there, just a mass-mob) completely unable to do a thing.

Drop by drop, in slow motion. As a movie based on a book, it is a total failure, because if you didn't read the book, you will have no idea what's going on. Several of the characters aren't even named in the movie, it's just assumed we all know who they are. Well, hello, some of us were raised Jewish, some Muslim, some Buddhist, some Hindu, some Athiest.

I was correct.First and foremost, this movie was incredibly boring. A good majority of the movie is spent watching Jesus get beat, hit, cut, or stabbed. I see no reason why anyone would enjoy watching this unless he is a sadist.The movie would get much lower than a five if it weren't for the scenes where it shows flashbacks that Jesus has with him spending time with his apostles. These scenes are uplifting, interesting, and sometimes humorous. The rest of the movie is just a bloody mess that seems to focus more on making you cringe than making you feel sympathetic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunate distortions and insertions cloud the storyline","review":"One struggles to compare details of this plot with the various Gospels. So much is added in that it is difficult for someone with only a passing knowledge of the Gospels to know what is genuine and what is added in. The addition of a Satan figure in many places is odd; the flogging episode is portrayed as violently as possible, with Jesus virtually taunting the guards to punish him further; there are times when various people are shown interacting with Jesus while he is on his way to Golgotha. There are many more and these are just off the top of my head after seeing it 6 months ago.If one is a Christian, then there is a good possibility that you will come to either hold this video in low esteem, or question your beliefs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for people who want to think...","review":"Three words: money making machine.This movie is realy great for CNN and MTV generation: lot of action, very few thoughs.Don't get me wrong: movie is ok (especialy for gore movie lovers).

It was a very tearful experience for me. The acting was superb, as well as the script, scenery and cinematography. I wish that there was more time devoted to the ressurection, but Gibson obviously wanted to have the audience experience the brutality of the last twelve hours first and foremost. He gave us a extremely memorable experience that will remain with me for a long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh...Graphic, Silly and Stupid but Expertly Produced Technical Elements","review":"There's not much that hasn't already been said here, but basically this is a horror film (or Torture Porn for the \\"Saw\\"/\\"Hostel\\" crowd) that happens to be based on the Bible rather than any other book. If this film were based on historical evidence, no one would have even cared when this film came out and it would have just been a very violent Roman film similar to \\"300.\\"Instead, the film is based on one man's (Gibson) interpretation of the Bible, so it's allowed to throw facts out the window (the location of the wounds, nudity, etc. - it's all been said by hundreds of other people) and just show crazy amounts of carnage and brutality and disturbing visuals. It's fortunate the soundtrack is brilliant, the cinematography is masterful, and Jim Caviezel gives an amazing performance, otherwise this might come across as \\"Saw XIV: Mel Gibson Kills Jesus.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"A priestess' view on The Passion of the Christ...","review":"I am not a Christian. I am a priestess of the Great Mother, Isis, Aphrodite, Ishtar, Selene, whatever name you would call Her.And yet what I saw that night when I watched Passion of the Christ changed me forever. Never did the mass of Christianity make sense to me before. I could not understand it.Now, at least, I understand it a little better. This movie is about a man who changed millions of lives with his compassion, his mercy, his kindness. While Christianity is not a path I desire to walk, I deeply accept its appeal for so many others.Thank you, Mel Gibson and Jim Caveizel. You taught me about a faith I did not understand."},{"rating":"2","title":"So moving and real","review":"This movie depicts the sacrifice and love of our Savior in such a realistic manner.

So, here's my view which only means something to me. You can say what you want about Mel Gibson but he really nailed it here. This story, so simple in it's broad, cinematic release simply tells the tale of Jesus, a simple spiritual giant who came, taught, and was killed because of these teachings. More importantly, throughout the movie we are shown how to pray properly and the true battle of good and evil (which is really harmless if we know this). All through the movie, we see the demons, Satan, the snake taunting Jesus and the important aspect here is how Jesus handled this. He gave no thought to evil and gave it no power, hence giving it no life. In the end, the metaphysical message is clear, if only we open our eyes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wide screen version fantastic!","review":"Very powerful movie.

I totally disagree with the whole thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A spiritually moving movie!","review":"The Passion of the Christ is a wonderful movie. Mel Gibson had a lot of guts to make a movie about Jesus told in such a violent way(which by the way is the way it happened...sad isn't it). Most people know that the movie isn't a happy movie that you can watch without crying. The movie is the most violent movie that I have ever seen. Because I heard the movie was so violent and gory, I was very skeptical about seeing this movie. But when my friend said that the movie changed her life, I decided to watch it with her. I ended up holding her hand almost the whole time (until the end of course because I needed both of my hands to wipe all of the tears away from my eyes. I have never cried so much in a movie. Even though the movie is very sad and extremely hard to watch, there are a few happy parts in the movie(especially the very end). I suggest any Christian and especially non-Christian to watch this spiritually moving movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Getting the message out","review":"I truely believe having this film released and viewed and talked about by thousands of people was a goal set out by our Lord and no matter how bloody and disgusted some people may be by the film, the message was clear. Jesus died for all of us so that we could have a relationship with the Lord! Yes there will be critics that say this film wasnt as clear about Jesus's life as some other films, which is true, but it wasnt meant to. It was meant to show people, assuming they probably knew the story of Christ, Jesus's last few hours. As a \\"movie\\" I wouldnt necessarily want to see it again and again just because it IS very violent and I personally cannot watch it without not feeling too well. But the fact that it is out in the public eye and may very well bring MANY people to Christ makes it a wonderful tool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mel may have his issues but this movie is good!","review":"I would have given this 5 stars but I hate to have to \\"read\\" a movie!

In my lifetime I've seen this story filmed countless times. From the 1961 KING OF KINGS to George Steven's gargantuan THE GREATEST STORY EVER TOLD to THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO ST. MATTHEW to JESUS CHRIST SUPERSTAR to Zefferelli's JESUS OF NAZARETH and Scorsese's THE LAST TEMPTATION OF CHRIST all telling the same story with the same cast of characters. While some of them created controversy over political or creative thinking, others generated criticism over casting choices, none of them had charges of anti-semitism hurled at them. All the good guys are Jews, all the bad guys are either Roman, Jewish high priests or non-believers. What made Mel Gibson's film so different? And why did so many people jump on the bandwagon? Except for the violence, Gibson doesn't do anything the other films didn't already do. So what lies behind all this?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"I'm not sure where people are getting that it's horribly violent or gorey especially compared to what we see on tv & online these days in so called news but ok. Having said that it's a very good movie the acting is great. I don't pretend to be a specialist or expert on religion, the bible or so called biblical events but over all it seemed to hold to the idea we've all heard regardless of what our religions are & doesn't seem to try to hollywood it up for effect. Highly recommend it. I haven't seen this in a while but when I did it was in the ancient language of Aramaic which supposeably is a dead language & thus needed subtitles which can make it hard to keep up or for some make the movie seem longer then it is. Still subtitles or not even if you arent religious or cant read subtitles or understand fluenant Aramaic it's still a great movie.

There is intense violence, so please wait until they are older. Whether or not you believe in the teaching of any church or religion, this movie will leave you touched, humbled and amazed that Christ existied.The fact that a single man believed in God so much that he endured the floggings, beatings and painful death inspires me to be a better person.I hope it inspires you, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a creation by Mr. Gibson","review":"Passion Of The Christ/ Brave Heart.

It is far better than those syrpy bible movies insstead of ignoring the cruelty of the time it shows it in graphic detail. Jim cavezi is better in theJesus role than any one. the beatings are grusome the crusifiicsion is brutal with every detail shown. one inaccuracy is the damage to the templle the Bible says the curtain between the people and the highpreist was torn nothing else. the passion is the best if you havent seen it get it or rent it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misses the Whole POINT of Christ!","review":"While this is a powerful movie and very dramatically acted, I think it misses the major point of Jesus on the cross. The director seems so obsessed with portraying physical pain and suffering inflicted by humans (which he does gruesomely well) that he fails to show Jesus's major reason for suffering.It was Jesus's brief seperation from God the Father on the cross that was far more terrible than any physical suffering. This was his sacrifice so we can be forgiven for our sins. After spending all eternity in loving company together, that period when God cut him off emotionally was pure hell. The same hell that we put ourselves through in life when we isolate ourselves from God's love.I appreciate the effort of Gibson, but I think the film falls fall short."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brutal","review":"I've seen many movies dealing with what Jesus Christ was about and had to go through in his life. In all those movies there was always something that could touch people and make them reflect about life. Those movies also showed Jesus' final moments, but what they all miss is the brutal violence and sadism portrayed in this movie. While watching it , having seen all these old movies, I knew exactly what was coming next, even the dialogue, the only difference was all the blood, extreme graphic violence and sadism this movie is full of."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Jesus chainsaw massacre","review":"Now please tell me why anyone would want to see this film?

Of course he has the right to display his version of events, but the rest of us need not be fooled."},{"rating":"1","title":"A truly gorey movie","review":"Putting all of the religious aspects aside and merely reviewing this movie, it is one of the goriest, bloodiest, most depressing movies I've seen in years. I certainly would not recommend it for youngsters.When addressing the religious aspects, this does not capture any aspect of the goodness of man or God and reflects very little of the teachings of Jesus or that time. I'm really not sure what the point of the movie was other than to capture how vicious and cruel people can be to each other. We only need to turn on the nightly news to see that. Not a movie worth seeing."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the message?","review":"I think the real message here is how a great marketing plan can turn a Mel-indulgent, suffering-fest into a blockbuster. Congratulations on your marketing Mel, but boo to your vision. Most of the people in the film are caricatures, devoid of one iota of consciense.WWJD? I think he would have walked out of the theatre into the sunlight. Jesus had a simple message. Too bad we continue to Muck it up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much beating","review":"The movie is punctuated by unfortunate series of continuous beating. Any human being with massive strength would not have been able to sustain such number of flagellations using whips with pointed hooks and nails.The holy Bible does NOT refer to the degree of such ill-treatments, for example the 'scene' when the Cross was 'trundled' on the hill and fell on the dusty ground, with Christ face down.Even the 'abduction' of Christ was transformed into a frenzied activity with exaggerations when they hit Him repeatedly so as to inflict pain until He fell over the road side, chained.We know the Camera can do marvels, but behind it there ought to be reasonable interpretation of events that should take precedence over smart technology."},{"rating":"1","title":"I see more light in debbie's passion","review":"You people are joking, right? You cried tears of joy from seeing this film? Don't get me wrong, I like gratuitous violence just as much as the next guy, but there should be some plot, especially when there is an entire religion devoted to the subject.I watched this movie with my devoutly Catholic grandmother and when it finished, we kind of stared blankly at each other wondering if there was something missing from the DVD version of the film or if the people who saw it in the theatres were really stupid enough to think that this is a ground-breaking, beautiful masterpiece.If you want to see a beautiful, ground-breaking masterpiece of the same artistic quality as this film, I hear Debbie Does Dallas was re-released. At least the smut in that film would feign to be enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"All it promised, but nothing more.","review":"This movie was dramatic and powerful. It told a story that many people already know, but it added a human and disturbing element with so much violence and so little compassion that the few spots where a kinder, more sincere character surfaced, it restored one's faith in humanity. With little dialog and hardly no explaination, this movie could've been better only if it showed more of the life of Christ and just why his deflectors where so threatened. Still, it's a must see for any one questioning our history, Christian or not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Even the best Christian can live without this...","review":"I consider myself to be open-minded and a huge Mel Gibson fan. But, I was only able to make it through about 10 minutes of this movie before turning it off. Controversy is an undestatement about the story, the message, etc. The world has enough darkness. So, I'm going to stick with what I've been taught, and leave my images of God and Jesus in the precious state they are in my mind and heart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Suffering without redemption","review":"This ghastly film was so violent that by its end I simply felt numb; it couldn't possibly be uplifting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost Focus","review":"Curiosity got the better of me and I had to go see this film; unfortunately it was a disappointment & quite confounding.It focused overwhelmingly on the torture & crucifixion that Jesus experienced, but so little on the positive messages he preached.Can someone explain why this torture is so important? Granted, it was awful and the movie does do a wonderful job of portraying the gore. Although, I still do not know what value this has? There were many others then who experienced the same thing, as there are many today who experience equally gruesome torture (even including people who have stood for justice & righteousness - just as Jesus did...but should this even be a requirement for humane treatment?).Summary: Too much painful imagery; not enough of the beatitudes"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Cinematography - but that is all.","review":"I am willing to give Gibson credit for good camera work.After that - Nothing else. This film is meant to tell the \\"true Story\\" of the Jesus mythology. Being that Jesus is a myth there is no true story.The fact is the myth is borrowed, verbatim, from other mythologies that predate Christianity by about 2,900 years. Read The Secret Origins of the Bible by Tim Callahan.Those who accept this as truth have got to learn to question things in an intelligent manner. If GOD gave you a BRAIN he might want you to take it out of the garage for a drive.If something is \\"REAL\\" it will stand up to scrutiny and unbiased testing.

That ain't good, folks."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a terrible movie","review":"What's it called when you charge to watch someone get tortured for 2 hours? A snuff film, and that's exactly what this is. This is the most violent movie made in recent years, and it's accepted because religion is pushing it. The only reason that it is not in English is because they needed the subtitles to distract you from the blood being splashed all over the screen.

I found this movie to simply be 126 minutes of torture. I was not inspired or moved in any way. It was a total waste of my time. I wondered whatever possessed Mel Gibson to make this movie, and have come the conclusion that it must be the $500 million he has made on it.

It is the scene in which Jesus is finishing building a table and bouncing on it while have a friendly conversation with his mother. In that scene one can see a Jesus of love, humanity, and compassion not evident in the gross misinterpretations of the Bible that have come to commandeer his name. It is a glimpse of what the real Jesus might have been like - learning the wisdom of the ancients as he emerged from childhood through his lost years until returning to the Bible at thirty.The rest of the movie is pretty awful. It had no character development - the king of a religious sect getting beaten senseless does not a good movie make. Anyone raised Christian will see nothing but the same old tired interpretations, essentially reinforcing the status quo without a thought of its actual validity."},{"rating":"1","title":"A horrible waste","review":"When I went to the theatre to see the Passion I was interested to see what all the fuss was about. I was taken back by the amount of uneeded violence that the film depicted. Not only was it disgusting and gruesome beyond the imagination but it was just plain disturbing. I thought that a good hour of the film could have been deleted because the violence just became completely rediculous. I almost got up and left during the film because I just could not sit through it. There were people in the theatre who actually did leave. I thought that a better, more inspiring way to show a movie about Jesus Christ would have been to show what a wonderful man that he was.....to show the good things that he did. Unfortunatly this movie was the farthest thing from that with clips of what kind of person he was mounting up to less than ten minutes in total.

This movie is great for people who loved the \\"Saw\\" pictures, just for the agony and torture.But seriously, why is it that so few people object to the idea that extreme violence is sacred somehow? We have been taught for centuries that there is something divine about violence, and that cruelty is something that God (or the Big Whatever) needs in some way. We have even been taught to equate a demand for horrible violence with God's love. Is it any wonder that we have so much violence in our society, against people,animals and the environment?

I respect what Mr.Gibson tried to do here, but truthfully, he stepped way over the line with the gore and violence. And the movie lost 3 stars with me because of it. His subject matter should not have had buckets of blood dumped on it, it deserved more respectful treatment. And as for the media, the target audience for this film is adults. It's in theaters now, we get it. If we want tickets, we'll get those too. Enough is enough. Find something else to talk about every 30 seconds, Please!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Moving and Spiritual","review":"The Passion of The Christ shows in graphic detail Jesus' last hours as he goes to his cruxifiction. If you are familiar with the Bible, I think this movie will have great meaning for you. I was crying at certain parts because they meant alot to me. I have friends who are not familiar with the Bible, and they had trouble following some of it. I had to explain certain parts to them, for example Pilot and Herrod. I don't know if that is because it is not in english - you have to read the subtitles - and there is something missing with the translation. ... It is definately a wonderful Masterpiece of filmmaking.

Honestly, I really do not care about the various controversies surrounding the film... some say that Gibson's interpretation was too literal, some say that his film was a pendulum reaction to Da Vinci code where he has attempted to please the church, some have even said that the film is anti-Semitic. Honestly I don't care. I wept through most of this movie and I can't remember when I last did that (probably Schindler's List). Yes, it's bloody. But that's precisely what Gibson wanted to show... the sheer hell of the final hours of Christ. You have to own this because it's a movie that you will need to watch every now and again to remind us of the harshness of life when we start getting down with minor irritants in our everyday lives."},{"rating":"2","title":"An astounding experience","review":"I bought this film as soon as it became available, and I treasure it.I thought, as I first sat in the theater to view \\"The Passion of the Christ\\", that I was going to have problems with the subtitles and Aramaic/Latin dialogue. I was soon disabused of that notion, as the brilliant cinematography and acting swept me into a story that I thought I knew well. Those things which Mel Gibson added to the scriptural accounts only served to enhance them, making them come alive in a new and beautiful way.I was especially touched by the interplay between Jesus and his mother, which gave us the only 'comic relief' of the film when we saw the young adult Jesus and his mother in the carpentry shop.This is truly a must-see film - whether it's the original or the recently trimmed version."},{"rating":"2","title":"A movie to meditate on.","review":"Many people are \\"horrofied\\" by the film's violence. Contrary to other films the violence was based on fact and had it's purpose. It's sad that today's world is full of cynicism and hate. I think this is one of the main reasons many people don't understand Christ's sacrifice and His love for us all. As a result the \\"bashers\\" hate the film.As we drift away from love, less we comprehend God's ways. Let us at least try it for once. . .As for the movie, I loved it. It has made a big impact my life and strengthened my faith. I recommend this movie to everyone who is serious on their search for God. This movie along with good Spiritual Direction can bring many spiritual fruits.The only thing that dissapointed me was the lack of \\"extras\\" on the DVD. That's the reason I gave it a 4 instead of a 5. A making of documentary, deleted scenes, movie inspiration sources along with other interesting features could've been added. Let's hope a Special Edition gets released."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic ..","review":"This movie came 400 years too late. We might've belived in all this nonsense in the 14th century but for an adult to be brainwashed to the extent that they actually take this fairytale for real is scary. You don't belive in Zeus. You're an atheist to Poseidon and Allah. So you know what it's like to be an atheist.

Unlike others may believe this movie did not follow the way it was supposed to. Not to mention we were never supposed to know the physical burden Christ went through. It is just Inhumane. and on top of that Aramaic is not the language they spoke. It was Greek. That is exactly the original language of the Bible. Read any introduction to any Bible and IT WILL say that. I made the mistake of watching this travesty. For those of you who haven't don't. It will break your heart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless Forte into Gibson's Mania","review":"This film, beginning with the hacking of a child's arm in the time of the mythical figure of Christ, never is ashamed to bathe in disturbing, violent images. Directed by the ego-maniac who calls himself a 'true Christian' and yet advocates killing those not in line with his myopic views, Mel Gibson, a schizo if there ever was one, does not seem to know how to separate history from his half deluded gospel scenes. Most of the story centers around Christ, who was a fabricated martyr figure which history tells us did not really exist and his fictitious \\"crucifixion\\" which \\"saved man\\", but not obviously very well if you look at all the warfare since, especially by the Catholic Church. Avoid at all costs, unless you are a fanatical Christian."},{"rating":"1","title":"not based on the Bible.","review":"Much of the material in this film was based on the writings of Anne Catherine Emmerich, a 19th century German nun.It contains many scenes that are part of Catholic tradition but found nowhere in the Bible. This film is Mel Gibson's account of the Crucifixion, not the Bible's.Sadly this film is widely endorsed by many evangelical \\"Christian\\" movements. The film is very ecumenist and not anti-semitic."},{"rating":"1","title":"The lost Tales","review":"I was really quite surprised that Peter Jackson handed over the reigns to Mel Gibson for this installment of the Lost Tales of Middle Earth. I have to say he did not do anywhere near as good a job as Jackson. And I'm totally lost as to why he changed the names of so many characters and places. And who's bright idea was it to totally exclude Gandalf from the story?"},{"rating":"1","title":"He died for our sins, no really, wait.....ummmmm","review":"For some reason, the cultural manifestation that is Jesus embodies everthing that is wrong with our country: constantly worrying and contemplating the life of someone who never even existed. When will you people get it: Jesus is a fabricated entity, created in order to get the masses to focus on something other than their mundane and meaningless lives. There is NO historical evidence (testimonies don't count) that an individual named Jesus ever roamed this Earth; this means that he was invented like the Easter Bunny and Santa Claus so that people can find some type of meaning in a seemingly chaotic world.You have now been enlightened!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Movie that I ever saw","review":"I can sum it up in one sentence: The Worst Movie that I ever saw. I know that Christs last hours were horrifying, but this movie, the way it is cut, goes way beyond what the Bible says. It is like he wanted to make the goriest movie of all times, not a factual account of Christs last hours. It was so bad that I couldnt watch the whole movie. I wish the Mel Gibson had made a \\"REAL\\" movie of his last hours. Save your money, and read the bible for the truth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perpetuation of a MYTH","review":"The movie is not worth rating. It is anti-semitic, \\"anti-christ\\" and only reaffirms the fact that the only \\"christian\\" who ever lived died on the cross. However, it is another worthy addition to the collection of fairy tales that make up the mythology of \\"christianity.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing but in a Bad Way","review":"I can't find this film moving in any degree. It is disturbingly graphic but not in an entertaining way (e.g. Pulp Fiction) or in a way that shakes the viewer's consciousness (e.g. the Grey Zone). Instead it presents a deeply dogmatic and outdated view of the final days of Jesus. I am non religious yet I have seen films that opened the minds of viewers on the subject of Jesus from The Last Temptation of Christ to The Gospel According to Saint Matthew to Jesus of Montreal. What we have here instead is Mel Gibson's Birth of a Nation with a disturbing ideology that was savagely and appropriately lampooned on South Park's \\"The Passion of the Jew\\" (kudos to Blockbuster for putting the two titles for rent next to each other)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yikes","review":"This movie is simply a sensationalist gore-flick. If you're looking for a meaningfull religious movie based upon scriptures accepted by main-stream religious leaders, then look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, Mel","review":"I have to wonder why any one would think that spending two hours watching a man being slowly tortured to death would be a good idea. It is sure not suspense. Everyone knows how this one ends. I sure hope that this does not inspire more violence and cruelty."},{"rating":"1","title":"They left out the important part","review":"Has there ever been a movie about Jesus that hasn't been controversial? The controversy alone renders this film boring - I've seen more useless writing about this one, when there's probably only about five biblical scholars in the world who could comment intelligently on it. Anyway, as for the film itself, must needs we sit through 100 greusome minutes of Christ being beaten, tortured, crucified, etc.? I suspect the story of Christ's teachings or of his resurrection might have helped balance this grim film and add a spiritual dimension to its fleshy mess. The Gospels are, after all, \\"good news\\", whereas this gore fest turns it into a withering spectacle of numb suffering. I seek not to discount the sufferings of Christ, merely to suggest that endless graphic shots of him or anyone else being whipped aren't likely to do us any good. If a movie about Jesus makes us sick to our stomach, are we likely to pursue any interest in faith?"},{"rating":"1","title":"crazy man","review":"wow a whole movie of Jesus getting the crap beaten out of him. Post braveheart mel gibson is a religious crazy."},{"rating":"1","title":"I guess if you want to see your savior ripped to shreds...","review":"Why all the horrible blood and gore? Straight out of a B zombie zombie movie. Yeah, I get that it's supposed to empasize the pain and suffering that Jesus went through to cleanse you of your sins but was all of it needed? The movie The God Who Wasn't There did a minute-by-minute tally of blood, violence, gore, etc. All but the first 10 minutes and 6 later minutes contained things you'd expect to see in a horror movie. Gibson=sadist?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Go to Church","review":"Everybody says that this movie has done more for there religion than anything. How about going to church? This just goes to show that unless it hasn't been made into a movie, it ain't important. I'm not a religous person because the whole thing is knida.....stupid. Mel Gibson knows that by putting out this movie religous people will go to see it, hence he makes all the money. One thing though, I would rather have one movie to sum it all up than some shi#y musical group."},{"rating":"1","title":"Torture","review":"The film was like having a ringside seat in the Torture Chamber. The gruesome graphic detail becomes so unreal, no man (including the human Son of God) could ever survive. Theologically unsound: the penalty to be paid for the world's Sin was death of the Christ - not His everlasting torture. The Resurrection merits a two minute post-script, hardly an appropriate balance for Easter which is still part of the Passion. Mel Gibson is clearly working through some personal faith issues in this film, I'm just saddened that he paints Chritianity with unrelenting, harrowing and sadistic pleasure."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must For The Entire Family","review":"A Respectfully done Version of the Life and Ministry of the ONLY Son of GOD, our LORD and Savior JESUS CHRIST.

Casting was right on (loved that Mother Mary was not blue/blonde as usually depicted in Western Art...Also loved that Satan was outwardly beautiful.) The story was faithful to the New Testament telling of Jesus' last day. I saw NO anti-Semitism. The story is as it was. I loved the original language, it gave the words we know by heart such power. It was brutally explicit in depicting the physical condition of Jesus by the time he was crucified... but again, this is the truth of the story. As a Christian, you need to keep looking and watching, especially if it makes you uncomfortable. The actors, each and every one, conveyed the raw emotion of the events so well, I sobbed at several scenes. It was an intense, stunning cinematic experience and I have nothing but praise for Mr. Gibson, his direction, the players, the photographers. Outstanding."},{"rating":"1","title":"HUGE disappointment!","review":"So many well-meaning Christians have found something to like about this film that I, a lifelong film buff but also a Christian, hesitate to express my views. Alas, I find little about this film that is likeable or meritable.First, the makeup and prosthetics were lamentably bad! The film had the feel of a concoction. For me, it lacked depth, gravity, artistic impact, rather like watching someone paint by numbers, or else place ingredients into a jar and shake them up, hoping they will come out arranged in some artistically rewarding order. Where was the inspiration?The one scene I liked- and I liked it very much- was when Jesus was at home and working as a carpenter. It boded so well...Alternatives? 'Jesus' starring Brian Deacon, or even the silent 'King of Kings'- neither of which is unimpeachable, but both of which are preferable."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Sick Flick","review":"This ultra-violent torture movie ranks right up there with \\"Hannibal\\" and \\"Fight Club\\" as one of the nastiest movies of all time. Whereas other violence-indulgent films profess nihilism, this one uses excessively graphic images of human suffering in order to drive home a message. But the message is lost amidst the relentless carnage. Mel Gibson needs help. So does anyone who enjoys watching this film. Those who use this movie (as Gibson himself intended it to be used) to try to make people feel so guilty and horrible that they'll seek Jesus are guilty of exploitation. This is an exploitation movie, pure and simple. Unless you want to ruin your day and give yourself disturbing nightmares, stay away from this. If you want a Christian movie with an actual story and a sense of decency, then go buy Ben-Hur or The Ten Commandments."},{"rating":"2","title":"From \\"the horse's mouth\\"","review":"Regarding Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ:\\"It is as it was\\". - recent quote of Pope John Paul II"},{"rating":"2","title":"not enough stars","review":"I'd like to give this movie a dozen stars. While I can not say I enjoyed it as entertainment, I've never seen a more powerful movie. GOD LOVES ME, screams from every second of film. It left me wishing I was less of a sinner, so that maybe just one less lash might have fallen. There is violence, but the love that made the violence necessary offsets it. It's life changing. I hate violence, I hate subtitles, as a protestant, I didn't get the Marian symbols, but I loved this movie. I prefer vhs to dvd, but this is one I want to dvd to get every bit of everything about the movie. Don't read the da vinci code, watch this movie.

From all the hype, it sounded like it would be a gore-fest. I'll admit it was gory, but not nearly as gory as I was hoping.I went to see it a second time with one of my friends and I ended up laughing through most of the movie. Not at the movie, which was no longer interesting, but at the audience. Listening to those lunatics is hilarious. I was sitting next to some old lady and I thought she was going to have a stroke by the end of the film.Maybe today's youth has been a little desensatized by TV and whatnot or maybe today's older population is just a bunch of pansies. Who knows?"},{"rating":"2","title":"I understand the Jews point of view, but...","review":"This wasnt about the Jews, or the gentiles. It was about the Son of Man coming to earth to redeem us, all of us. We had all sinned, we had all fallen short. Certain Jews & romans just happened to be the catalyst that fulfilled the prophecy...They could have been any denomination, but they happened to be in power then (all be it, thru the courtasy of the romans) and that was what was used.I do not in anyway hold the Jews responsible for the crusifixion of Christ, nor do I hope, do other Christians. People were used throughout history to forfill a destiny.Even Judas fate was sad to me as it seemed to fullfill the phrophesy and yet was regreted almost immediately upon reflection.Part of the confrontation however, I believe, was to bring the gentiles band in to the fold. Through Peter and Paul. The think we must remember is God workd on a bigger plan than you and I.Sorry if this is preachy, its just what I felt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Passion of the Christ","review":"When I had first popped this into my DVD player, I had a fairly good knowledge of what events I was going to see. I had no idea on how in depth Mel went into it. The movie was in fact word for word of what really happend. The acting was teriffic. The actors really convince the audience of what is going on. And of course the directing was great. Mel did add a little with what I thought was the anti-christ when satan was holding that little child. And yes, Jesus did suffer that much. He was not killed from the suffering because the bible says that \\"no man will kill me, but I will yeild my spirit.\\" So in all, the movie was great, and I would highly recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Movie of All Time Hands down","review":"A must have for dvd collectors.

Quite pleased with purchased product and price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleased with film","review":"Understanding that this movie was not meant to focus on the life of Christ, but simply his death and sacrifice for humans, I think this movie did an excellent job.It changes the account from the fairy-tale, sunday school version where adults tell children \\"Christ died for you,\\" and all the children nod their heads and think 'how nice of him.' This movie brought me to a drastic realization that Christ did not simply, for lack of a better phrase, drop dead, but instead went through enormous pain and suffering because of my personal sin.I once heard that even had I been the only one who Christ was trying to save, he still would have gone to the cross for just me. This movie really helped me put the entire aspect of his crucifixion into a real perspective and gave me a new amount of respect and understanding for what Jesus's act meant for me in my life."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Passion","review":"In my opinion, this is one of the best films ever done on this part of Christs life.Mel Gibson took it to the higest level he could for what really happened to Jesus on the day He took the sins of all mankind upon Himself. Every family, Christian or non-Christian should see this film. For the Christian it is a great visual reminder of just what He willing did for us all.For the non-Christian it may just strike the most important nerve in your body to turn your life over to the One who loved you enough to die for you. Most important, and one I wish Mr. Gibson would have taken a little further, was His Resurrection. With out the Resurrection of Christ His life & death would have counted for nothing."},{"rating":"1","title":"ninetynine","review":"not much to sayanother attempt to make a movie about the life of jesus christ.sub titled while a foreign language is spoken.if you really want to see a depiction of the life of jesus christ then i think you will probably enjoy this film.otherwise you might be bored."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excruciating but extremely touching","review":"I have to say that I spent the majority of the time staring at the floor in front of the screen. The Passion was just too excruciating to watch in many parts but I have to say that those parts, even though I did not watch them in their entirety, were part of the reason I think this movie is so effective. It was the fact that one knows what is happening even if you don't have the heart to look. I think the cinematography was phenomenal and the actors well casted. Overall, a must see film. But beware that this is one of the most violent movies I have ever seen and definately not for young childern."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgusting.","review":"The only thing more disgusting than the violence and gore in this DVD is the shameless marketing the producers did in Jesus' name to stuff their own pockets. This film obviously was not made to show the passion of Christ in his last day, but to stir controversy and rack in the money. As a Christian, I am ashamed I watched this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gibson missed the point!","review":"This movie is not a religious triumph, but rather a horror film and a denigration to Jesus' teachings, to his very LIFE! By focusing on Jesus' suffering, rather than on the enlightening and reawakening to God's ways, which he hoped to accomplish, this film adds insult to his horrific injury. Shame on Mel Gibson for wasting money and talent on a horror film masquerading as a holy tribute. I'm sure that Jesus would never approve, and in fact would abhor, this overlooking of his LIFE and his teachings--for in Jesus' LIFE, not his death, lies the Truth sought by real Christians!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's speak english","review":"I think the movie could be a 5 star movie .

As any who have caught wind of the film well know, it is visually, the most graphic depiction of Christ's final hours ever conceived. Unlike many others though, I feel as though the its graphic nature only acts as a catalyst to enhance the viwer's grasp of the magnitude of the sacrifice Christ made to absolve us of our sins. Granted, it may be too violnet for others, especially those who are used to the archetypical, bloodless version of Christ's crucifixion, which we've become so accustomed to from movies past. My best advice to those who are debating on whether or not they're willing to see it, is that Christian or not, everyone can benefit positively from what this film has to say."},{"rating":"2","title":"Testimony","review":"An amazing telling of how the Savior of the World sacrificed Himself for all of humanity.Violence was a very real factor in the sufferings of Christ and through His sufferings we are able to receive eternal life through the shedding of His innocent blood."},{"rating":"2","title":"How can you not love the Lord?","review":"My whole life and purpose as a christian is to follow Christ, there is no peace like the peace I know when I am in close relationship with Him. He is my all, my everything, my provider, I do, I truly love the Lord. I was 24 when I watched this with my husband and I still can remember how quite the movie theater was, all I could hear where muffled cries, sniffing and I was broken beyond words, I was touched, I was renewed, I was blessed. Mel Gibson did a perfect job. This is by far the best movie and most important movie that will ever be made. To know that there are some who are repelled by such love is incomprehensible, but you know Gos is love and He still and always loves us all, the weak, the strong, the christian, the non-christians, that's how Amazing He is, love unconditional, love supreme. And as for I and my family, we will worship Him as long as we live. To Him be the Glory forever and ever. Amen!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Powerful movie, but nothing more","review":"I'm sick of people taking this movie to be the ultimate word of God. For one thing it cannot be biblically accurate because the four accounts of the Gospels are all a little different, and it would be impossible without re shooting scenes to be true to all four accounts...In my opinion this movie used two very effective techniques to pull in millions... Unbridled violence, and strong religious symbolism. Despite the unrealistic/inaccurate depiction, excessive violence, pointless hype, possibly greedy motives, and the people who beliebe the movie to be the gospel according to Mel Gibson, this film is still a powerful piece of art.It got two stars from me because it is such an effective piece of art. The use of Arameic and Latin with English subtitiles, flashbacks (which were terrible in themselves) and dramatic music make this a masterpiece of film."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the Worst Movies of All Time - No Stars","review":"This movie is hype and inappropriate. Seeing blood and gore from the moment the movie begins until the moment the movie ends is not what Christ was all about. Love, compassion and forgiveness, that's what Jesus is about not this portrayal of his last days on earth. Are the masses really asses? I guess so, if they truly believe this is a good movie, or for that matter a heart moving movie.I suggest seeing \\"The Greatest Story Ever Told\\", or \\"Jesus of Nazareth\\" These movies represent excellent acting and a portrayal of the life of Jesus that is accurate and complete. The Passion shows the agony but no ecstasy and that's it. Those who know the bible know what Jesus went thru on his last days on earth as a man. Depicting only the gore is not necessary and uncalled for. Anyone can chop out a moment of time out of context and call it something more than what it is. And that is what Mel Gibson did here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Christianity is THE Devil's Trick","review":"I am not a Christian and I cannot say that I particularly enjoyed this movie, even though at times it really made me think. I have long thought that Christianity is a tool of mass control and psychological manipulation. The Passion really gave me the sense of Christianity as the worship of the killing of god and the worship of the ascendancy of man. With the gross amount of genocide, pain, and suffering that Christianity has been responsible for, as well as the respressive contributions it has given Western Society (not to mention the fear driven obliteration of indigenous societies), I really believed that it has served the purpose it was instiutionalized to serve. Think about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Technically not the Christ and probably Altruistic Suicide..","review":"If one looks at it, Jesus BECAME the Christ AFTER the Resurrection. It was Jesus who suffered through His Passion. It was the Christ who came back victorious.With all the technical input Gibson probably had, no one noticed this flaw.Secondly, this is Gibson pontificating.Thirdly, why glorify the violence done to someone? People are murdered every day of the week. Tortured, brutalized and killed. So why is so \\"revolutionary\\" and compelling when we see it happening to the one who orchestrated His own death?Ouch, did I say He orchestrated His death? Oooops, I did. Jesus, if being a God, could lay to waste anything and anyone who raised a hand to Him. Yet, He didn't. He therefore saw His own death a benefit to others, and did not escape the event as any normal person would who values their life above all things, AS WE'RE TAUGHT. This is Altruistic Suicide.Why is what He did so phenomenal?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Movie Ever!","review":"This is the best portral of the crusifixon ever.

First of all if he were just a good man why would he die for us. No man would. It would be pointless i he were just a man. But u say hes insane. If he were insane then he would have done inasne things and he never did any thingout of the ordinary human behavior besides claim to be God and do mircals. Then u say the Bible is false.

It is incredibly graphic and painful to watch, His passion is a story that needed to be told as realistically as possible. The film is incredibly made; Gibson shows the cruel sadism of the Romans as well as he shows the gentleness of Christ's love. This is a film everyone (over 12 or 13 perhaps) needs to view, believer or not. At the very least, it is a visceral and emotional story of a man's faith and strength."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moving","review":"Having had to wait for the movie to be released in France, I had read much about this movie. Nothing I had read really prepared me for what I saw. I believe that Mel Gibson has made a very realistic movie. To see what Christ went through for us to forgive us of our sins...simply amazing. I have only seen the movie twice and I don't know if I could handle seeing it again for along time."},{"rating":"2","title":"MASTERPIECE!!!!!!!!!","review":"I am not the most religious person in the world, but I absolutely loved this movie. I must admit that it was very graphic in details, but in a good way. I know it might sound cheesy, but I was just really touched by this movie. I literally cried like a baby from beginning to end just watching it. I was so overwhelmed by the gory images and unrelentless torture that I have a new respect and admiration for what this man actually went through for our sins, and in my own humble opinion, it takes a very heartless and cold person not to at least be touched or feel his pain in some kind of way. In my own experience, I must say that watching this movie was the best thing I've done in a long time (and the realest movie ever made) because it's really changed my beliefs in so many ways I wouldn't have ever imagined. SOOOOOO.........I strongly recommend that the believers and the non-believers check out this movie. It will really change the way you see things."},{"rating":"1","title":"No entertainment value.","review":"This film was a bad film based soley on entertainment value. I don't see the necessity in a gore fest where Jesus Christ is involved. If there were any FIRST hand accounts of this brutality, this film may have more substance. Seems that Gibson has his own spirituality on his sleeve. I don't think that creates art or has any entertainment value. Certainly blood and unrelenting violence is NOT entertaining. Nor does this film have ANY artistic value. The dialect isn't presented well here either. The Aramaic voice isn't given justice here, given the horridly poor interpretation and it's presentation. This film is trash. Simply. God bless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anyone who has any intellectual dignity should be repulsed and disgusted by its simplistic message !","review":"Basically what Gibson tries to say is that since Christ suffered a lot on the cross you better accept him or you'll suffer in hell, like Christ suffered on the cross, for eternity.See I refuse to worship a God or a Christ primarily because of my libertarian (sort of in Ayn Rand style) objections. The thought of worshiping anyone: king, master, government, god, whatever, utterly disgusts me. And I don't appreciate Gibson threatening me with his movie.I don't think the movies is as much anti-Semitic as it's anti-intellectual, anti-humanistic and anti-libertarian. The movie is an emotional garbage for ignorant fundamentalist masses ! Anyone who has any intellectual dignity should be repulsed and disgusted by its simplistic message !"},{"rating":"1","title":"A work of fiction - nothing more","review":"Christ is to Adult...as Santa Claus is to Child.

I love all Lethalwepon Film and Mad Max too. Braveheart is one of best movie in my opine.These film, Passion of Christus, is not fun movie or interest. Is all blood and blood. Not a story. Also lenguage is strange.When Christus die he come again at ending- so all blood for why? And acting not special.So Mel please do Lethalwepon 4 or Braveheart or Patriot 2. Is better movie idea. And do in English!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous","review":"Why do I dislike this movie? This movie is a very nice way to give Christian fanatics lots of ammo. And I'd like to tell you fanatics of any kind can be dangereous, not just Muslim fanatics as many Americans tend to be. Fanatics of NyQuil could potentially be dangerous, so don't give Christian fanatics something else to use against anyone who may happen to have a different belief that they do.Did Jesus go through this? Something like it, probably not exactly. Does Mel Gibson deserve the money he makes? No. Did Mel Gibson take a risk? No. He already had a large audience that would go see the movie even if no one else would. But he knew everyone would go see it because it's controversial. Controversy make a lot of money, look at Eminem.This movie is not a life changing experience because it is a movie. People shouldn't be guilted into Christianity because they saw an actor pretending to be Jesus get tortured."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mel Gibson, the new Judas","review":"Yes, Mel Gibson has crucified Jesus and has filled his pockets with gold. I hear he's fighting to get the Golden Idol too. When he raises it high I guess the Christians here will bow down before it. Okay, this review is harsh, but so is Mel Gibson's torturing movie! I guess those who don't really know the word of God feel more cleansed by going to a movie and crying. I don't think that's what God or Jesus had in mind. But the believers here are more than happy to follow Mel. Sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad service, after a month never recieved the movie","review":"Bad service, bought march 12th still haven't received by April 13th.

The violence, save for 2 scenes is not as bad as the hype has said. If yu can take saving private ryan or somehting of that ilk, you can take this. Like i said there are 2 20 minute sequences that lived up the the violence hype, but it was not 2 and a half hours of blood splattering. The movie itself is a fine piece of cinema, and Gibson, despite my reservations, has made a fine movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Anti-Semetic....","review":"For those people who complain that the movie is anti-Semetic, please, read the Bible and numerous historical texts that make reference to Jesus being brought to the Romans by the Jewish Pharisees. And yes, Jesus was Jewish so that would kind of deafeat that argument anyway. So were his mother and father."},{"rating":"2","title":"All things are new.","review":"My husband and I felt blessed after seeing this movie. Mel Gibson was truly inspired and I am grateful to him and every person who helped make this the greatest story every told."},{"rating":"2","title":"As close as one can get","review":"This movie is about as close as one can get to seeing the actual physical suffering of Christ. And it is thoroughly Biblical. One can disregard the comments of the previous reviewer complaining about it's lack of Biblical authenticity, since that reviewer isn't even aware of an actual Biblical line that is used in the movie!Jesus did tell Pilate, as Gibson's movie depicts, \\"the one who delivered Me to you has the greater sin.\\" This line is in John 19:11.Everyone should see this movie to receive a total slap in the face of what it required to pay for our sins. This movie should wake everyone up to the seriousness with which God sees sin."},{"rating":"2","title":"I am speechless","review":"A truly unforgettable movie, a life chaging movie that touches the soul of everyone, believers or unbelievers. Jesus is the most talked about person in the world and is still the most \\"controversial\\" figure in both history and present time...And yes, this alone proves me really who He is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deserves an NC-17","review":"If this movie was about anything else other than the passion of Christ the very people who support it would be screaming to ban it. This is an incredibly violent film with needless buckets of blood. Seeing the son of God turned into hamburger did not inspire me or increase or decrease my faith. Truly awful acting from secondary and tertiary actors and blatant homophobia in the Herod portion of the film add to a nasty mix. Good acting from primary actors and superior cinematography are the few saving graces. The bold decision to make this multi-lingual and subtitled also deserves to be tried again. Only for fundamentalist Christians and devout Roman Catholics and not be viewed by anyone under 17."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perhaps the best of its kind.","review":"All movies about the life of Christ have certain difficulties and limitations. After all, the last verse of the Gospel of John says: \\"And there are also many other things which Jesus did, the which if they were written one by one, I suppose that not even the world itself would contain the books written.\\" Mel Gibson's attempt at recreating the last hours of the Christ on film is one of the best so far. Yes, the physical sufferings of the Christ are not a pleasant matter, but they point on to a greater suffering which was Christ bearing our sins before a holy God and recieving in Himself the wrath of God against sin that we might be free to enter into eternal life.In the 1960's I viewed the film \\"The Gospel according to St. Matthew\\". by the Italian marxist Pasolini. This film had a real impact on my life and I think Mel Gibson's film is of a similar nature. Many people will be moved and impacted toward a greater understanding of the most significant events of all history."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very powerful movie","review":"This movie touched my heart so!

The Passion of the Christ was a beautifully made movie(a least for the first 15 minutes), using Aramaic and great settings, that brought the story to life. Yet, the excessive blood and violence made the Passion something out of a Freddie Kruger movie. The more blood and gore that could be squeezed into every scene was done so. The movie is definitely not for anyone under 10 and will most likely disturb anyone over 10. My suggestion, rent it, it is not something that is worth watching a second time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Passion for the Christ","review":"Jewish traditions and believes are portrayed throughout the movie. Soldiers in history would have beaten the prisoners the very way Gibson presented, I believe it was called \\"bloodlust.\\" It was horribly graphic. I would not recommend showing to small children. This movie has definately made my faith stronger! Highly recommended! Also highly recommended \\"The Nativity Story.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"the savior","review":"please remember that the romans had experimented with various others terrible deaths and felt that the cross was the most demonstrative form of death, in that it showed the result of disobidence to the empire."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beyond Words","review":"This movie will absolutely change your life. I'm so thankful that God laid the vision on the heart of Mel Gibson and his team.To see so graphically depicted the enormous sacrifice that Jesus Christ made for you and me will leave you without words. You do not go to this movie and \\"view\\" it - you go and \\"experience\\" it. I pray that your life and the life of your family and friends will be changed by the love of Jesus Christ and that you will fully support this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"INSPIRING!!!","review":"This movie will bring you to tears, bring you to confession, bring you to a NEW (or renewed for others) understanding of how much Christ loved us. The things He goes through before death will leave you speechless and wondering how anyone could endure such torture... but when He rose again and to know that we are free because of Him... it makes it all worth while. This is a classic that should be in everyone's library!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tough Passion","review":"This is not a teaching; this is an act as in action. The film's base on the Stations of the Cross; creates a Passion Play of great power. It's as close to a time machine as you might get; being plunged into another time zone. Sweet and rougher than usual; it's a great film to see. More horrific also; but redemptive.Blu-ray shows the great design and photography; as well as a powerful soundtrack. Two versions and chapters that reflect the stations, plus a DVD"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Move, NO features","review":"ok. for the movie it self i give it five stars, but as far as special features go. there is absolutely NOTHING> nothing at all. no behind the scenes, nothing not even a trailer. but as far as the movie goes its great, its uplifting. it shows you what JESUS realyl went through. and what he did for us, and how much HE suffered, yet people still reject him , i suggest everyone watch it. and as far as \\"anti-semitism\\" goes, thats the biggest load of crap i have ever heard LOL. read the BIBLE and you will find out everything the JEws had said and then some were recorded accuratley into the movie. the truth hurts. not anti semitic. just fact. if thats antim semitic then silence of the lambs is anti-caucasian, and candyman is anti-african american. dont be dumb. buy the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mel got it just about right!","review":"While to some the scenes of violence may be seen as excessive the emotional impact balanced it out it was never violence for the sake of violence but to show or attempt to show some of christs enourmous suffering. The scene with Mary picking Jesus up will soften most of the most hardened hearts, I love many of the 50's type bible epics but this one was the first to promote a real emotional connection, the fact thats its no in english will not bother you it actually enhances the film Mel gibson has hit the bash train latley I enjoy the majority of the films he directs the music the emotion and the fire i really appreciate about the guys films."},{"rating":"2","title":"Historically accurate but so what?","review":"Usually I doubt the historical accuracy of these kinds of films but I'll take it on faith The Passion of Christ is more or less Historically accurate. I had heard some of the buzz and knew this film was directed by 'Mel Gibson' but it wasn't what I expected. Wasn't prepared for the utter sadism of the prison guards.

I had read so much and heard so much about it, but when I saw it, I was moved beyond words. I was shaken from my complacency and was made uncomfortable, and rightly so. For I had neglected to realize all that our Lord Jesus willingly suffered. And I did suffer during the movie, at least in some small way sharing in his suffering. I felt so unworthy of his love, but yet so grateful. The movie is only a sliver of the Gospels, but it is the fulcrum, the very center and heart of the mission of the Christ."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Passion The Grace The Love","review":"All you can say about this movie is amazing!!! I think everyone should see it. For God so loved the world that he gave his only beggotten son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlassting life. after seeing this movie everyone just sat quietly in the theatre as the credits rolled. and left very quietly..

Mel Gibson's movie would have been better named THE PASSION OF GORE & VIOLENCE. Ultra-violent to the extreme, it completely ignores WHO Jesus was. This is a movie for idiots.Go rent Halloween or Friday the 13th instead. At least they have plots."},{"rating":"1","title":"A cinematic and religious failure","review":"I am not a Christian, but I wanted to see the movie because of all the hype...and what a waste of time! If you aren't familiar with the individuals who took part in the death of Jesus, you will have no idea what is going on. Why was he killed? Who where the \\"guys in the hats\\" who called for his death? Who were the people who cared about him and why? A few flashbacks give you an inkling, but the lack of a story line gives you no opportunity to become involved in the story. NO chance that anyone will be drawn to Christianity by this film!The violence was apalling, and I think that Mel Gibson (who I have always enjoyed) must be a bit twisted to focus so graphically and completely on the crucifixion without presenting it within the context of Jesus' life. Just a graphic gore-fest legitimized by the religious theme."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must-Have!","review":"This is one of those movies that can't be seen enough. It reminds us of the true meaning of Easter. I especially appreciate the scene where Jesus is praying in the Garden of Gesthemane and he is being hassled by Satan. Then, a snake crawls to where Jesus is kneeling and he then stands up, looks Satan in the eye and crushes the head of the snake. It makes you want to stand up and cheer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is what love is","review":"Gibson does an exceptional job in this film depicting Christ's life, especially his final hours, but I still don't think we will ever be able to fathom what Christ went through so that we might be saved. He did it not for Himself, but for you and me! He humbled Himself, and He came to the earth not to be served, but to serve and to save to world. No better example of what love is than Jesus Christ. Relgions offer lots of things, but Christ offers a relationship with God through His sacrifice. Nobody else in the history of the world has claimed to be God and proven it. He said He would be betrayed and killed and He was. But most significantly, He said he would rise again after three days, and He did! Jesus did many other things while He was on earth but if that in itself isn't enough to prove He is God's son, I don't know else can. John 10:10"},{"rating":"2","title":"NO DTS Track on this set...but everything else makes up for the it.","review":"According to amazon there is a DTS audio track on this release...that is incorrect.But the new video transfer and all of the other material on this set more than makes up for the loss of the DTS track."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vivid but fictional","review":"This is an interested piece of work--definitely made with a lot of dedication and, well, passion for its subject. But people should be aware that Mel Gibson has based his vision on 19th century understandings about the life of Christ. After a hundred years of Jesus scholarship, we actually know more now about the circumstances of his life, including the politics, the religious background, etc., than we've ever known before. But Gibson ignores it all to present his own idiosyncratic conception (again, no pun intended). This is NOT the way it was. If it provokes viewers to learn more about the subject, that's the best we can say for the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great if you like snuff filmd","review":"This might be the most self-indulgent film ever made.

Over 2 hrs of very little but gruesome closeups of a man being ripped open over and over is not a very satisfying film. There's no underlying spirituality at all. The message I felt Mel was preaching was that everyone should feel horribly guilty for Jesus having to die in such a barbaric way for our 'sins'. I truly detested this film with a 'passion'.Jesus deserves a better film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful movie","review":"Excellent, excellent movie---left me feeling totally drained with my eyes puffy from crying. I only wish that Mel Gibson had spent more time on the Resurrection; the brief little scene at the end left me wanting more. Growing up in a Baptist church, I was taught that we should celebrate the life of Jesus and the fact that He rose from the dead, rather than the Crucifixion. That is why the cross on our church wall is empty!

But that really didn't affect my reaction to this film, which is a brutal, trashy piece of Christ-propaganda. Christ was not the only person of that time period who suffered through this much torture and brutality. It was commonplace for people who had differences with those in authority to be beaten and executed. Mel fails to explain what singled out Christ as a symbol of good because a)he is a shallow and poor filmmaker and b)he doesn't care, he just wants an excuse to show people lots of sickening violence to spark their guilt. Don't allow yourself to be roped in by this exploitive nonsense; Jesus Christ himself would have taken offense to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"cool movie!","review":"hey dude, way to go! this movie was soo violent, the bestsince texas chainsw massacer! too bad Mel did not show up to kick some bad guy' butt, like in mad max. thats why i give only 4 stars. i hope there will be a siquel."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Loser","review":"It was a bummer finding myself looking at subtitles.

We need to remember that Caligula was mad for eating and watching gore at the same time. This movie is pure ancient Roman gore. This can't be too far of a cry from what Caligula enjoyed watching as he sat in his personal home eating and munching.A decent parent would never allow their child to see this movie. It is the stuff Caligula had watched as a child and we know how he turned out.

Amazing. Amazing.","review":"Nora Roberts outdid herself with this novel. It has it all: romance, suspense, and lovable characters. This book made me a Nora fan!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Abusively Awful","review":"This book is terrible. It drags on and on- I am 75% finished with it and still unsure who the romantic lead actually is. It follows the life story of the daughter of a rock star... the ENTIRE life story. The plot is long, muddled, boring and often offensive. Sympathy for main characters is lost when they make excuses and succumb to the abusive behaviors of others.I usually love Nora Roberts. I prefer her novels with strong complementing characters, but even enjoy her older works with big strong men and helpless little ladies. Public Secrets is an awful anomaly- save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Nora I've read!","review":"Very good story. Best Nora book I've read!

What's up with this? Didn't anyone read it before it was published? Apparently not. At one point Michael is standing in his father's orifice (instead of office). Ouch! That sounds very uncomfortable. As for the story, it is very similar to River's End. Two generations. Fame and fortune. A murder that is unsolved for 20 years. I like Nora Roberts faster moving stories much better. These two were my least favorite of all her books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Roberts","review":"I have read many of NR's novels, and this was one of my favorites. For those of you that have read Rivers End and enjoyed it, then you should like this one as well.The story of a little girl, abused by her mother and rescued by her father is touching and incredibly emotional. Roberts does an excellent job letting her readers grow up with Emma. We see her for length at 6, 13, 18 and finally as an adult.I thought it was amazing for Roberts to take on such heavy issues as repeat abuse patterns (in childhood and as adults), the ugliness of drug addictions, alcoholism, etc. This was truly one of her darker books - but I would say one of her best.

Of course to some it might be trivial, but it is worth it for those American anglophiles, like myself, who would love to be a part of that world. There is some speculation on the designers of the cake and dress which now seems funny as they weren't to be involved, but its great for the cooking demonstration, the shots of the various royal residences, and the history of the other weddings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crummy sound engineering ruins a great gig","review":"I guess Dave McKenna plays with \\"awesome technique\\" here, as the liner notes claim. I'll have to take it on faith, since the lousy sound balance ruins the presentation. Scott Hamilton's tenor sax is so overmiked, it drowns out most of what McKenna and drummer Jake Hanna are doing. McKenna sounds like he's comping Hamilton all the time, and Hanna like he's in the studio next door.It's a shame. The selections are great, and when I can hear past Hamilton's sax I can tell there's a good trio working in there.By way of contrast, check out any of Blue Note's reissues of great 1950's and 60's tenor saxmen playing with a combo. Just one example: Hank Mobley's sessions with Herbie Hancock, Harold Mabern, Wynton Kelly and other great piano artists.

If you're a Herbert fan, then you should enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fizzles out...","review":"I'm in the process of trying to read all Frank Herbert just for the sake of it. This book starts off really strong. I liked the two main characters and some of their banter made me chuckle. But about 2/3 of the way through, he went off on some metaphysical mumbo jumbo tangent and completely ruined it for me. It's like he just left off what was a very interesting storyline and descended into some incomprehensible blather about our collective mind creating God, blah blah blah. I don't even know what the hell he was thinking given how the first 2/3 of the book read. Even the first 2/3 are not great fiction, but I did enjoy it. The last third of the book is a complete confusion of eastern metaphysical nonsense. When I read the ending, it left me shaking my head. My recommendation: the minute you get to the part where Orne arrives on Amel, just put it down and move on."},{"rating":"1","title":"unremarkable, but a bit murky","review":"I read this book about a year ago and filed it away in the category \\"not-top-notch but-with-some-interesting-stuff\\".

Is this really SF? Not Herberts best work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Prepare to test your faith!!","review":"This book will absolutely test the faith of any Mormon out there. If you are not grounded solidly in the Mormon church, DO NOT READ THIS BOOK. The authors have been there, done that, so to speak, with the Mormon church. Now they unveil a whole new outlook about it that will infuriate the Latter Day Saints, and add fuel to the fire of other Christians wanting to disprove the validity of the Mormons. Whichever side you're on, this book will stir your emotions, and jumpstart your brain into a way of thinking like never before."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hate on paper","review":"As an EX-Mormon, I can still say that this is one of the most misleading, hate-filled books on the market. It has often been used in various fundamentalists churches, whose believers are far less devoted to searching for the truth than are Mormons.It has also been frequently used (along with its film version) to stoke the fires of hate in areas where Mormons are erecting temples. If you think that anti-Mormon hate doesn't exist you need only look at the controversies surrounding the construction of Mormon temples around the country - Seattle, Denver, Dallas, Forest Hills, Tennessee, and, most recently, in Boston. The National Conference of Christian & Jews, The National Council of Churches, and many, many other interfaith associations, have denounced this book as dishonest and hateful. Even many career anti-LDS scholars have criticized it's truthless-ness."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a waste of money","review":"I was looking for a book that would give me an insight into mormonism - this is just not that - it is just a sad persons viewthat tries to dismantle something the author simply does not understand.

These warmhearted songs and the tight harmony of this truly talented group will make you feel good all over. \\"Ooh Child\\" (my all time favorite song and a hymn to positive thinking), \\"Danger She's A Stranger\\" (the type of lovely ballad that sounded good on the radio as you went to school in the morning), and \\"Didn't It Look So Easy,\\" a pseudogospel number that, like everything else here, is quite pleasing to the ear and soul. By this is you want to relax, forget your troubles, and feel uplifted.It's a shame they were overshadowed by the (also talented) Jackson Five, but it's good to know that the two groups actually liked each other."},{"rating":"2","title":"Remingtons were a great find!","review":"I loved the old group Bread, and James Griffin.

The singing, playing, writing is on par with a thousand other bands. Yet when Buff Tom locks into groove, few bands are better. On Let Me Come Over, which many fans consider the band's apex, the group found their stride on virtually every song. Let Me Come Over blazes, no question, even what stands as ballads on this set have undeniable power. Underlying the fury, however, is a warm, heartfelt sound that allows you to get close to this album. I don't know what they're saying on most of the songs, but they sound like they're saying them to me. Oh yeah, did I mention it rocks? Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the essential cds of the 90s, PERIOD!","review":"Let Me Come Over is a flawless album, a record of one of the very best bands of the 90s at their creative height.

Best cuts: Every song is good but these are the best: \\"Larry\\" \\"Daryl\\" \\"Frozen Lake\\" \\"Stymied\\" \\"Mineral\\" and, perhaps the best song of the 90s: \\"Taillights Fade.\\" This is an essential record of the 90s..if you don't own it, your record collection is incomplete."},{"rating":"2","title":"London Embassy","review":"Paul Theroux is probably best known as a travel writer and the author/creator of such films as \\"The Mosquito Coast\\" and \\"Half Moon Street.\\" First person narrative of an American foreign service official who has been posted to London.

Ms. Macalister is able to write a story that is both romantic and true-to-life without being unbelievable. I loved this book so much, that when I finished it, I ran out and bought two more copies to send to my mother and sister out of state. You will absolutely LOVE this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"it's a wow","review":"I've just finished \\"Corset Diaries\\" and I'm ready to start reading it over again. Katie MacAlister is a master at \\"first person\\" point of view. The story is reminiscent of the PBS reality show \\"Manor House\\" only much better. The main character Tessa was funny, honorable and sincere. I'm baffled by some of the comments of other reviewers, in regards to disliking \\"Tessa\\" as a character. If you've truly read the book, then you must identify with the character of Barbara. There are mistakes, written by previous reviewers, about the character, for example she was not a historian, which was written in a negative review in \\"All About Romance\\" by Ellen. Books written in 'first person' are more conversational and do take more time and thought to read in any genre. If you like Jennifer Crusie, Susan Elizabeth Phillips and Rachel Gibson I think you'll like \\"The Corset Diaries\\". If you are a fan of PBS reality shows (i.e. Frontier House, 1900's House, Manor House) I think you'll enjoy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for the humor impared","review":"Yet again Katie delivers a book full of open, honest, so-real-I-can't-believe-she-wrote-that humor, that has become an endeering drawing point to her books. Although I am a large fan of paranormal romances on any given day, Katie's books offer a refreshing lift out of the dark and serious, into the light and purely enjoyable. Read 'The Corset Diaries' with an open mind, and you will find that this is a simply sumptuous book for accompanying you on those long days on the beach, or while sipping one of those icy coffee delights at the local cafe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Wonderful!","review":"What can I say? Katie MacAlister has done it again! THE CORSET DIARIES is a fun and [appealing] book that takes another American woman and plunks her into England - this time as the pretend wife of a pretend Victorian-era duke. Tessa's the kind of heroine I prefer in that she's by no means perfect - not physically nor emotionally. But she always means well. As for Max, the hero - he's not perfect, either, but if he were real, I'd bet many of us would think that he WAS perfect! :) I laughed many times while reading this book, but I was also genuinely touched by Tessa's regard for her late husband, as well as the grudging relationship that develops between she and Max's unruly daughter. MacAlister just keeps getting better and better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"COULD HAVE BEEN SO MUCH BETTER","review":"I WAS DISAPPOINTED IN THIS BOOK. THE HEROINE IS AWESOME BUT THERE WAS NO PLOT.

NOTHING NEW."},{"rating":"2","title":"it's not perfect (heroine or book...)","review":"Ok, it's not perfect. There are chunks in the middle (and ending even) where the level of detail wobble and I felt like it could have done with a few more drafts. I did enjoy the diary entry style of writing, but a lot of the detail and humor found in the early entries disappear to more 'let's just sum it up and move on' entries later in the book.That said, I had a good time reading about the plus sized 39 year old widow/heroine and came to like her quite a bit. In the beginning she had me laughing out loud a few times, sadly that level of quality and comedy was not held up throughout the story. I also wish that more attention had been given to the running of a Victorian household for TV rather than between the sheets with her man.Despite my critisism (I have a lot!) the book was a dishy treat. Do I wish the author had written a better story? NO. I enjoyed the plot line. I just wish some details and scenes had been written differently.A fun read- enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been waaaaay better","review":"Dull, flat and frequently crass. It's a harsh description of any book, but that's what I have to give this one. I've done historic recreation, so picked up this book hoping to read an entertaining romantic comedy because I know how funny these situations can get sometimes.What I found was full of cliches and sophmoric jokes concerning bodily functions, with snide remarks between the hero and heroine that passed as wit. I kept asking myself why she was interested in this guy. Then I found myself asking why she slept/was continuing to sleep with this guy if he was such a jerk. The ending is abrupt and somewhat contrived and I found no real indication that the couple had grown or made a commitment to one another.It's sad because I really wanted to like this book and ended up feeling like I was about to throw it against the wall. Friends have told that some of her earlier works are better, but there wasn't enough here to convince me to try."},{"rating":"2","title":"very very funny & sexy","review":"this was up to kate macalister's standards-really-really enjoyed the book-couldn't put it down-i like that she writes about people who are not models-jet setters or in their early 20's her books are great, this was one of ms. macalister's funniest-i highly recomend it-and i very seldem read romanaces-i find them too light weight-but this book has very well written & had interesting people with minds of their own-i find this refreshing"},{"rating":"2","title":"It was a great book.","review":"The Corset Diaries is a great book. I would recommend this book it is about a love that everyone thought was not meant to be. Tessa is a vaguely large woman, who does not believe in herself and has no courage, while Max is a muscular, sensitive man. Anyone with eyes can see that they are not made for each other, but their hearts tell them that they are. Also, the theme of the story is to always have faith even when all your hope is gone. We learn this when Max and Tessa stay together through all the drama, and finally decide to marry. Throughout the book there is tension and suspense between characters and events taking place. For example, when everything starts to go wrong at the grand ball: flying salmon, people screaming, and a saboteur is loose, we assume that the ball is going to remain disastrous, but everything slowly resolves. My reasons for recommending this book surpass the reasons for not recommending the book. Overall, I would recommend this book to other people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not deliver the Victorian aspect","review":"I loved Regency House Party on PBS. Watching people interact in a period setting was very interesting. I was so excited about this book being set in the Victorian era. The premise is great, but Katie does not deliver. I felt that the reality show was a weak backdrop to an unlikely romance. The main characters jump into bed way too quickly and I don't understand their attraction to one another. The reader doesn't get a good character sketch of the hero or heroine.The book could have been really good. Interaction between upstairs and downstairs helped the reader understand what daily life was like in the late 1800's, but nothing else did. What did Tessa do all day? We don't know, we were never told. We the reader only know how she spent her evenings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely loved it!","review":"Anyone who doesn't find this a great read, eats flies. I loved this book. I think it's great that the main character is an intelligent, thoughtful, self aware woman. A heroine that's plus sized and gets her man in the end. Loved the dishy male lead, a character you can just imagine in your minds eye. The supporting cast is hilarious, even the snot nosed brat!If you don't laugh at least once, you have no sense of humor! I'm a huge fan of Katie, ever since I picked up Improper English, the dishy Scot from Men in Kilts, and the hunky Vamp Christian. If you want a new fresh author give her a try!Jenn"},{"rating":"1","title":"After I hurled....","review":"...this book against the wall, I started to reflect on how darn hard it is to write screwball comedy. This writer likes to put her heroines in such predicaments that they either embarass themselves to humilation or just show plain bad judgement. Time after time this character makes bad choices that lead to mortifying results and after a while, I just got tired and quit rooting for her to win. Screwball comedy is as fragile as a delicate procelain teacup and this book just hammers down w/ a mondo-sized beer mug instead. Skip this sad puppy and give her Aisling Gray series a peek instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it, waiting for the movie (hopefully!!)","review":"I bought this book because I love Katie Mac books. I kept reading it because it appealed to me, as a big boned girl myself, and because it had me busting a gut. Tessa is the perfect character for this book and Max is to die for. If you go to Katie Mac's website you will see that this wonderful book is getting optioned for a movie and they, the movie people and Katie, agree with the rest of us when we say that Colin Firth woud make a wonderful Max. This book might not appeal to some people but for the most part it keeps you laughing until you cry. Keep up the wonderful work Katie Mac."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the Point?","review":"There are two very good reasons not to bother with this CD:1. The outstanding performances of Handel's Italian (Arcadian, pastoral, etc.) cantatas by the ensemble La Risonanza, currently being released and up to volume 4, which obviate the need for a CD of excerpted duets.2. The singing, which ranges from okay to hideous. Emmanuelle Haim seems to be on her own voyage of discovery, or rather rediscovery, of how to sing Baroque music in the \\"Can Bellow\\" style of the 1950s! Some of the singers on this CD simply shouldn't venture earlier than Donizetti. Some of them - in fact the majority - should know better than to cooperate with such nonsense - wide and constant vibratos, forced tempi, strained voices, ham-handed keyboard accompaniment. Haim is a total mystery, unless we assume some special affliction of musical bi-polarity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good choice","review":"If you are not a great fan of Haendel, pass!

A great disc tath all barroque lovers must have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating Inside Look In the Paint","review":"This book is more than just a bunch of pictures of NBA guys with tatoos -- though it has some great pictures. It is wittily written (the jacket says the author is comedy writer) without being condescending to the athletes. It's informative and fun and thorough.

Unfortunately, the instructor tries to get too much information in during a relatively short period of time.

The novel, has been edited to the point that it reads like a borish child's book. Yet it is still around for all to read. With so much better efforts of its kind, one must wonder why this one stuck.

Being Heinlein, the fantasy elements have scientific explanations, but are fantasy nonetheless. In 'Glory Road' Heinlein is commenting on heroes and fantasy conventions, as well as adding commentary on social and political mores of late '50s early 60's America in the usual Heinlein manner.I have enjoyed several of Heinlein's works but I did not care for this one too much. I found the dialogue to be excruciatingly bad, and the plot to have absolutely no tension or drama. Even the usual pontificating, which normally doesn't bother me too much, just grated, even when I agreed. I guess I can see what Heinlein was doing here but I didn't enjoy the result."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best sword fight ever...","review":"I think Heinlein wrote this book for one reason..the duel to the death scene. Granted the rest of the story sorta drags but I slogged through it and was rewarded with an epic dueling scene that inspires me 30 years later. At least wait until you have read that part before you put this book away. I'm also inspired by the host of reviews for all of Heinleins books here at Amazon. I'm always greeted with blank stares when I mention my favorite author and its heartwarming to see MY thoughts being written by so many others...Thanks"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not fantasy but a satire of fantasy","review":"I generally like Heinlein's novels but this one was just plain terrible. First off, it's not fantasy but a satire of fantasy conventions, from ridiculously-dumb minotaurs to silly dragons. Most of the book centres around the relationship between Gordon and an otherworldly queen who guides him on his quest. The dialogue is classic Heinlein, but the witty banter that fits so well into most of his modern-day works grates terribly in what is supposed to be a fantasy setting (but isn't, as we find out in the end). This is more of a commentary on 1950s marriage, relationships, cultural norms and sex than anything to do with what we consider fantasy novels today. The sex part is especially annoying as Heinlein seems to have had a polygamy fetish and manages to insert it rather crudely into every novel he ever wrote, and it's even worse here.Short version: not a fantasy novel, not enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book, but was Heinlein a closet ped?","review":"I enjoyed this book, especially the last 1/3, even if disparaged by some reviewers, as it strayed from your typical \\"they lived happily ever after\\" Hollywood ending. I almost lost interest in the middle as it bogged down a bit when they visited what's-his-face (Star's friend) and got kicked out because he didn't screw their 11 year-old virgin. I disliked the subtle but frequent references to sex with minors and the one reference to the occult (pentagram) used for the inter dimension/world transport/gates. Those issues aside I enjoyed the adventures experienced on the glory road, especially the eater of souls quest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poot","review":"This Book bored the ever living poop out of me!

I cant get through it. I hear that \\"Stranger\\" had really slow parts but i wasnt really shaken by them. This books faults are more on the massive string of action cliches level. I am no experienced sci-fi reader so maybe this is above average but just isnt my type o novel. Probably good beach reading, it seems to be an adventure written like a laid back day of lying in mud. Take this with a grain of salt, maybe the book gears up from where I am, halfway through... I'll update if I can get back into it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heavy-handed Heinlein","review":"The first two thirds of this book is a rollicking adventure story. It is well written and a lot of fun.However, Heinlein is extremely heavy-handed with the sex. I first read this book in my teens, and the sex scenes resonated very well with my adolescent sexual fantasies.Worse, I found the last third of Glory Road to be essentially unreadable. After the quest is completed, Heinlein gets up on his soap box, and starts preaching a Libertarian political/philosphical gospel. If -- as I am -- you are unsympathetic to this view, you will find this section of the book to be extremely annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you liked Farnham's Freehold...","review":"The very first portion of this book (a few pages) reads like the Heinlein who was head and shoulders above all other science fiction writers. Then it disintegrates into mush. This book is closer to Farnham's Freehold than it is to Waldo.At some point in his career, something happened to Heinlein's mind that altered the character and quality of his writing. Exactly when this happened is difficult to say, but this may have been the book in which it became undeniable. Glory Road could conceivably be used to mark the beginning of Heinlein's descent into madness."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Loved this fast paced Fantasy till the last Chapters","review":"This book was gonna be my #1 Favorite untill i got near to the end.

I love Heinlein, I revere him. He's one of my three favourite authors and it was always my intention to read every word he ever wrote. I will never accomplish that goal because this book stinks - I got perhaps a third of the way through it and could not force myself to turn another page.If you want a good read, almost any other Heinlein work will be sure to please - even the three or four troubled, overlong, repetitive books he wrote when he had a brain tumour are masterpieces compared to this.Spend your money wisely - spend it on something besides this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"All should walk the Glory Road","review":"Ever wanted to walk out of your daily tedium ?

I enjoyed the spirit of adventure in which he writes this. Our hero in for some great Science fiction fantasy adventure after he answers a compelling personal ad in the newspaper. After launching on his journey with his companions, they not only break local on customs in foreign universes, they fight with demons, slay giants and essentially sword fight their way to the glory of winning the universe and all!This is one of Heinlein's great classics and I am glad I finally got around to reading this one.

Not necessarily. But, on the other hand, maybe so.

Star is the only female main character. The narrator spends more time describing her phsyically then making any other comments about her. At least twice she says that she wants to 'model' clothes for him and she says that she packed her clothing thinking of him. At one point in the book the narrator wonders if another character maybe have tried to rape her, but he says that she was capable of avoiding rape and not to hurt the potential rapist's feelings. The other main chracter will only refer to her as She and in italics.Aside from all the sexism the book is boring. How Oscar gets to the other world is never explained and it goes on and on with little adventures without explaining why he was choosen and what they're doing.

Coincidentally, I myself graduated from Niceville High School that was mentioned briefly near the end of the book.I just did not get what I was looking for out of this book. There was too much family talk and not enough talk about the action. I got the impression that Jack Brehm served during a time and in an area where not that much happened, considering the length of his service. It made for rather boring read, but since I just borrowed the book from the library, I'm not out any money, only time.Two other things bothered me about this book.

The book was not at all funny to me and the characters themselves had no depth to them. I'm not sure if the architecture descriptions sprinkled throughout the book were supposed to be based on any kind of factual information or not, but it did not add much to the book and as others have noted the terms are not accurate. The relationship between the first characters in the book was the most interesting, but the Indian character quickly disappeared.

The most annoying part of this book was the odd \\"viewpoint.\\" There is a first person narrator who was trying to write from a third person omniscient viewpoint but then keeps intruding into the tale with \\"I's\\" and \\"we's\\" though he was never any part of the story.The author uses a lot of architecture related words without explanation or definition. When I try to look them up in the Kindle dictionaries, they aren't there.The characters are more stereotypes than real people. Not only are most of them unlikable, most of them are just plain boring. I don't really care about them.This book gives me the literary equivalent of \\"the frakes.\\" I just want to crawl into bed and stay instead of clicking to the next chapter to find out what building they move into next."},{"rating":"2","title":"The funniest book I ever read...","review":"The funniest book I ever read is THE ARCHITECTURE OF THE ARKANSAS OZARKS. Some bookstores misclassify it as nonfiction under architecture; it is actually a comic novel that follows the growth of one small mountain town and the odd country folk -- wise fools, all -- who live there. Do not read this book unless your health insurance is paid up -- you could die from laughing so hard, and my ribs ached for three days."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprising and entertaining subtley cerebral","review":"Humorous look at the life of multiple generations of an Arkansas family surrounding and after the civil war and how the architecture reflected the times and beliefs of the variety of peoples within and without the central family.

The hardships they have to overcome and the constant nomadic lifestyle they lead, gives the viewer something to identify with in this forever changing world of ups and downs.

Definitely a 5 star movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok, but vocals too sugary","review":"I got this album because I loved Toca Me (and the other edit, Toca's Miracle, both from the first album, \\"Toca\\"). However, the music was much less inspired in this album. That's ok when vocals are superb, but the vocals here are a little too sugary-sweet for my taste, and the emotional content seems a little exagerated.

Like \\"How Do You Feel.\\" The Cyber Trance mix of this song is nearly 8 minutes long, 3 minutes longer than the version here.Despite this, it's still a wonderful CD for dance/trance fans.

It gives you nothing, tells you nothing, makes nothing happen, while eating up pages and jumping erratically from character to character all of whom have zero actual personality or depth.This book is written in conversation speak so whole pages go by with internal (and boring) dialogue and people talking about sandwiches. I'm sure this is done to make it seem fast paced and exciting, but it's really just page filler with zero substance.A good mystery hints at what is going on. It even leads you astray so that you think one thing when it is really another, suspect one villain when they are really innocent while you fall in love with the betrayer.

The author helped me better understand emotional systems thinking and how I can use these principles in my coaching practice. Another unusual perspective I found in this book is the author's focus on coaching in the context of bottom line results. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Insightful!","review":"Mary Beth O'Neill describes how executive coaches need to work with executives as partners to help them become better leaders. Coaches need the strength to share the truth with clients in times of crisis, she explains. She discusses the core principles that underlie coaching and the four essential phases of the coaching process: contracting, planning, live-action intervening and debriefing. The book is primarily directed to coaches, including consultants and internal or external trainers, who facilitate processes and projects in organizations. While it has its share of fuzzy and jargon-laden patches, the book is generally clear and to the point. It includes a mix of examples, charts, and step-by-step techniques, plus useful chapter highlights.

It did not take me more than 30 minutes into reading to understand how valuable this book is towards self-development. It is easy to read and it's very convincing how each element in his building blocks have a directly impact on our lives. I use it to train adults and children with a slightly different approach but always giving credit to John Wooden and his book.For those who are Christians, there is a segment at the end of each block with verses from the Bible for them to meditate on. I, personally, find it very useful. For those who are not Christians, they can simply ignore it as every element towards achieving success has a very logical rationale to it and it's spiritual beliefs is largely similar in other religions.It's an excellent way to keep ourselves on track in everything that we do."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Challenge By Coach Wooden","review":"\\"Coach Wooden's Pyramid of Success\\" consists of 3 main areas:1.

This is advertised as a novel, but there is no plot or storyline anywhere in sight. It is another of the many books recently published along the line of \\"See how tough the SEALS are\\". While I have the utmost respect for the US Navy SEALS, this book is simply another recitation of BUD/S and Hell Week.SEAL wannabes and SEAL fans might apppreciate it because the author is well-known in the SEAL community. This book appears to be a thinly disguised autobiography of the author's own BUD/S experience. There are a lot better SEAL books out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"What?","review":"If one person can write an entire book on Hell Week alone, I question its validity.No reason to buy a book...Hell Week merely sucks.Save your money, you wannbe's"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring agony by a too self-indulged author...","review":"This book was a waste of my time and money! The author writes about narcissism, but does not really make any distinction between NPD and \\"regular\\" narcissism. Every problem she and her friends (who are the only ones she writes about) goes back to being raised by an alleged narcissist. While there are some insightful descriptions of negative human behavior and its consequences for those subjected to it, the author does not take an objective, scientific, or academic viewpoint. And what's with all that gibberish about Zen and meditation?? It was a struggle to finish especially those passages where she mentions being in Asia!I wonder who edited this book, because it is a mess: too many repetitive stories (we hear about her friends over and over and over again with no new insight, just repetitions of what was already stated early on in the book) and absolutely no structure. I recommend looking elsewhere for something more worthwhile on the topic."},{"rating":"1","title":"There Are Better Books On Parental Narcissism","review":"The author herself is the victim of parental narcissism, and so she wrote a book about this very destructive form of emotional abuse, ostensibly to help other victims. But, it's really a vehicle to talk specifically about herself and her own experiences. Very little of it is useful to a wider audience. She claims to be a healed child of narcissistic parents; odd that she spends so much time talking about herself.This book may work as a very basic introduction to the topic for some, but if you're serious about getting some help, get \\"Children of the Self-Absorbed\\" instead. It has much wider-ranging and more practical advice than this one does."},{"rating":"1","title":"Solutions would be nice.","review":"This book has a lot of value in terms of recognition: I was able to see myself, my family structures, and how the influence of narcissistic parents plays out in adult life. But I was unsettled by the sense that Golumb is still angry at her situation, and hasn't truly found a new way of looking at life. When I read a self-help or psychology book, I need a guide who is integrated, self-actualized. Witnessing someone else's struggle is not enough for me; I question what she has to offer. I finished the book wondering if there really was any hope for children of narcissistic parents.Of course the answer is Yes, but I couldn't tell from this book.It was interesting reading, and is well-written, but I'd advise checking it out at the library before buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"One star is a complement","review":"I am so glad I borrowed this book from the library instead of having purchased it. I agree with the other one-star reviews that this book is nothing but the author going on and on about how unfair and hateful her life with her narcissistic father was. While I understand very well that it's difficult to live such a life and that one must have an outlet such as writing about it, I feel like I was sort of duped into reading this book. There was the promise right in the table of contents that the author was going to provide some sort of solution or help of some kind to others who were dealing with the same kinds of problems she had been. Unfortunately, even in the solutions sections, all she did was go on about more of her horrible experiences. I think she should have saved everyone the trouble of thinking they were getting a self-help book, and put this book in the category of \\"autobiography\\" since that's very much what it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be only 3 chapters long!","review":"This book is only worth it for the first 3 chapters, which are good. They don't help you DEAL with your parent's narcissism, but they do explain it very well, if you are like everyone else and have been going, \\"what the heck is happening?\\" for most of your life! Beyond that, it is like other reviewers have written: it is mostly the author trying to deal with her own situation, and offering up semi-relevant case histories of her patients. One of the chapters, \\"The Child of a Narcissist Who Becomes a Narcissist,\\" should feature the author, not \\"Alan,\\" because it's pretty obvious early on that she is deeply wounded, and became one herself as a result of her upbringing, which she may or may not realize. Repeating, the book is worth it if you are willing to pay for only about 50 pages of real info. Otherwise, skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a letdown...","review":"The introduction of the book leads one to think that this will be a good clinical book on the topic of Narcissistic Personality Disorder and its effect on the children of narcissists. That is, until you get to Chapter 3 and realize that the book is about the author's own \\"unfair\\" life and the lives of her friends. The objectivity of the author is zilch because she is personally invested in her own story and its presentation. She also seems to judge her friends (\\"so sad that they can't stop the narcissistic pattern\\"). This is literally the first book that I have ever thrown away! I agree with other readers who felt that the author's own narcissism is showcased in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"You can do better","review":"I found \\"Trapped in the Mirror\\" to be a tedious read. Elan Golomb's lack of objectivity is hard to take and everything comes across as pertaining to her, something a book on narcissism can do without. I also take offense when someone diagnoses everyone they meet and labels them with the disorder de jour. Not everyone in your life is a narcissist, some are just garden variety jerks. You can do much better on the subject of narcissism with \\"Malignant Self Love,\\" by Sam Vaknin."},{"rating":"1","title":"self-indulgent self-analysis with metaphors run amok","review":"I sympathize with the author, who has serious issues of her own to address, but I felt as though I should be paid to be her analyst by reading this book. I was drawn by the case studies, which I thought would provide personalized accounts of this serious issue; instead, I found each case study slanted to illuminate the author's own problems. I got more insight reading the book jacket blurb (which summarizes typical narcissistic behaviors) than I did plowing through the text itself.... In her valiant attempt to garner sympathy, the author has not left a single metaphoric stone unturned. When she most needs to be clear and concise, she inter-weaves images until they make no sense at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of \\"stories\\" but not much to glean from them","review":"I found this book to be very disappointing. While there were some informative bits here and there, too much of the book was filled with stories... \\"stories\\" about people that are narcissists or who have someone in their life that is. And through all the stories, I didn't feel there was anything to learn. After reading 1/3 of the book, I flipped through the rest, looking for any nuggets, and found very few... certainly not enough to read the book completely from beginning to end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fails to balance the objective and the subjective","review":"I think this book makes some good points about narcissistic parents, especially if this territory is unfamiliar to the reader. Unfortunately the points are meandering at times, the organization is confusing, and the examples used in the book strike me as too personal and not objective. For a recovered child of narcissistic parents, the author sure spends a lot of time talking about herself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trapped in the Mirror","review":"This book was informative and shed a lot of (very disturbing) light on what it is like to be raised by a narcissistic parent. I could relate to the plights of many of the people that Elan interviewed. The one BIG distracting factor of the book, however, was that it seems that no one did any editing. The voice jumped from first person to third person and back again. The tone of the book flip flopped around from clinical explanations to personal accounts to some sort of fantasy fairytale style that I could not follow at all. For this reason, I had to read many passages a couple times just to try and decipher what Elan was really trying to say. All in all it was informational but very painful to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Narcissistic Need and Entitlement Deprivation","review":"\\"Trapped in the Mirror\\" by Elan Golomb is a compelling and useful companion book to \\"Alcoholism, Narcissism, and Psychopathology\\" by Gary Forrest and to \\"The Destructive Narcissistic Pattern\\" by Nina W. Brown.Comparatively considered, I found the multi-faceted novella-like approach of the interwoven personality studies (and the frankness of the psychoanalytical interpretations) to be comprehensive and worthwhile for personal consideration and reflection.In an \\"All things considered\\" approach, this work reminds me of an effective application and affective illustration of Karen Horney's recommendations in her work on \\"Self-Analysis\\"; consequently, this book is very appropriate for \\"Do it your self\\" analytic types who want to nuetralize the personality disturbances of narcissistic and authoritarian parenting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reality hits home!","review":"My therapist gave me this book to read, it opened my eyes to the suffering I have been trapped in without even knowing it. The author has several true stories including herself about the narcissistic up bringing that starts at home. I cried, not from saddness, but from identifing with the book and all it enclosed. I have several books and intend to ship them out to other people I know with the same \\"trapped\\" life. Defenetly a book worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trapped In This Author's Mirror","review":"Do NOT waste your time reading this book. I couldn't finish this book and believe me I tried. I ended up thumbing through the last two chapters just to see if there was anything worth reading in the end since the rest of it was a complete bore. I mean did I have to sift through a bunch of stuff to find the diamond in this book, obviously not. Through each chapter I would find one sentence that would hit home and then read through the droning stories of her friends and herself. I felt punished. I felt like I was sitting with my Narcissistic parent and listening to his bull.Please don't waste your money or your time. Trust me and the others who have given this book a negative review. Its not worth it. I give it one star for its creative cover and title. The rest of the book is just brain farts from the author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointless and Self Absorbed","review":"Author IS trapped in the mirror. It became so tiresome to constantly read in detail of her thoughts of herself. Anecdotes of others were in a detached form of narration (as if impersonally describing a movie scene) and self serving, inserted whenever the author seemed to become briefly aware that she talked incessantly of herself, took a break from herself, and then circled right back into her detailed self absorption. It appears that she wrote her conclusions first, then wrote the anecdotes to use as \\"proofs\\" for the conclusions. This book supposedly offered self healing, yet at the end, she states, \\"it is inappropriate for me to recommend a course of action\\". Then why write the book? To painfully tell everyone about yourself and your life course? Just like life with a narcissist, there was the promise made, dragged out, and never delivered, all while focused on herself. What a waste of good money. Looking for a better book? Take a look at \\"Stalking the Soul\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely enlightening","review":"Highly recommended if you're dealing with narcissistic parents.

DON'T READ THIS.","review":"If you are looking for a book that will help you cope with narcissistic abuse from your parents, spouses, or bosses...look elsewhere. The author is seethingly resentful of her emotionally bullying father, and a good part of the book is a series of autobiographical vignettes about her inability to stand up to him after all these years.

The author describes them well, but doesn't distinguish between parental influence and genetic traits---i.e., my brother is just like my father, I am just like my mother. Also, sadly, the author herself is clearly a narcissist herself...there is so much self-centeredness, grandiosity, and quickness to take offense at small things......My advice: skip this book and keep searching!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money and Bookshelf Space","review":"Wish I never bought it, waste of $$-the book captured me in the first few chapters, but as I read on, I became bored and also had the uncomfortable feeling that I was indeed reading a book hat is the product of a ...narcissist, one who happened to have gotten a degree. I don't feel the book is very professional at all, and while it is nice to have authors share SOME of their own experiences, this book can only be considered a purging of the author's soul, not at all a self-help book, or one that offers anything to the reader.I also wonder if the author's patients need to endure endless stories of her own pain, rather than have her listen to them, which is the career she has chosen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anecdotal at best","review":"This book was frustrating. I kept waiting for answers, and all I got was anecdotal evidence of a woman and her brother. There are better books..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A valuable source of information","review":"This book has helped me see that the roots of my own narcissism stem from my interactions with my parents at a very early age. When the parents needs are greater then their children's needs then the parent is essentially negating the reality of the child as a living, sovereign, sentient, being with their own life and their own soul. The roots of narcissism begin with this parental rejection. I have seen this to be true with my own narcissism .The book is written in a very elegant way. It is written with great humanity and I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book will help open your eyes to your private pain","review":"A psychologist recommended this book after being forced to end a twenty year relationship with a narcistic in-law. This book explains in human terms how we slowly give our power over to people who, by their nature, can never be happy. So narrow is their world that no one can stand in it beside them. Golomb explains through case studies, that this is a real and enormous problem, many the reader will relate to in their own life. While I felt a stronger editor could have helped bring out the later chapters on 'what to do', this is still an excellent primer. It certainly lifted a illusionary but powerful guilt from my shoulders."},{"rating":"2","title":"I FINALLY Understand","review":"This book has been life-changing for me. Having grown up in an entire FAMILY of narcissists, I now understand that each one of them had a specific agenda for me, and that made it impossible for me to discover who I really am. The good news is that the information in this book can help facilitate this discovery going forward. I read this book at the suggestion of a CoDA friend, and we were involved in a step-study at the time. This book helped \\"flesh out\\" much of what we discovered during our step study, and answered many of the questions we'd both been struggling with for years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful Healing","review":"Most scholarly and popular literature on the subject offers intellectual understanding; this book reaches a deeper place. It validated thoughts and feelings I could barely give voice to. The author describes with knowing psychological precision how pathological narcissism and its mirror-image problems, excessive self-sacrifice and paralyzing self-doubt, are passed on in families through an unhealthy interpersonal environment. She openly discusses her own struggles with narcissistic issues; it is the strength and insight born of this struggle that give this book its profound emotional resonance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing...","review":"After seeing others' reviews I greatly looked forward to reading this book. But I found it not much more than the author's extended personal journal and catharsis. The stories from her own life and those of her friends and patients could have been useful if they were better edited and surrounded by insightful analysis. But instead, the stories go on and on - after a while I found myself skipping the long narratives to glean some useful information. It may be worth checking out of the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money and time.","review":"The introduction was godd but that's about it. The rest of the book is about a series of examples and that's all. No real analysis, explanation or substance."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Blind Leading the Blind","review":"The idea that this author is in any way justified in writing a book on healing or conquering narcissism is laughable. The book is filled with countless examples of her own insanity--like the time she cracked her skull and insisted on seeing an Eastern meditative healer instead of a doctor. Of course, her parents intervention was proof of their narcissism.This is a fascinating topic but an awful book. Most of the anecdotes come from group therapy that she ATTENDED instead of led. The book bills itself as an authoritative work on a topic that the author just happens to have a bit of personal experience in. Really, it's a rant, a cathartic work aimed at healing HER wounds and not THE wounds. I think there is a massive conflict on interest in writing about a problem that personally affected everyday of her childhood. Each time she describes narcissistic qualities you can tell she is projected the qualities of her parents. Pass."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good service","review":"Received book in good time and fairly good condition.

If, as she says at one point, no one is black or white, why does she fail through 262 pages to demonstrate this with her parents, who, along with the author, are the primary characters of the book.The writing is mediocre; there is too little perspective; too little guidance; too much psychobabble; and the metaphors Ms. Golomb is fond of using more often than not are either confusing or utterly miss the mark.

Although I was offended by the illustration for rule 21. The rule in itself is a good rule,\\"When we disobey or forget any of the 21 rules of this house, we accept discipline and instruction,\\" but the illustration featured a young boy sitting on his dad's lap with a paddle in his father's hand. This kind of discipline is not allowed in our house and I do not think that it is appropriate to expose children to this kind of abuse.

Rather than being the typical \\"do this, try that\\" decorating manual, Spirit of the Home starts by getting you in touch with the philosophy and psychology behind creating a home.

Clark Gable plays the role of Jake Luva and Joan is Bonnie Jordan, a young girl who has to go to work after the stock market leaves her family penniless. This is one of those rare pre-code films that include risque dialog and themes. The film even includes a brief featurette with intro by Leonard Maltin, saying that Joan was \\"nobody's victim.\\" That's for certain. In this picture she goes from victim to victor, yet that road she traveled wasn't easy and wasn't smooth. There were many sparks that Joan and Clark Gable set off together in this film which made it memorable. I also love how youthful and young Clark Gable looks without his signature mustache. \\"Dance, Fools, Dance\\" is certainly a keeper that belongs in the collection of any Joan Crawford fan.The movie is 80 mins./black and white/produced by MGM and was released in 1931."},{"rating":"2","title":"My two daughters loved it","review":"My two daughters, 2 and 4 years old, loved this DVD.

It's not on the same level as Peary's \\"Guide for the Film Fanatic,\\" because cult films aren't included (obviously) and it's Peary's love for more obscure, curious films that I feel rates his books higher than Ebert's or Kael's. I don't think the book is meant to degrade the Academy as much as it is to expose readers to some lesser-known or underappreciated performances (I can only assume he's a big fan of Chaplin). Whatever Peary's reason for writing it, his analyses of the films and of the performances that he cites as best in every year are well-written and thorough, and this book is a treat for anyone who enjoys reading about film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better title - \\"The Big Book of Stuff I Like\\"","review":"Yes, 2001 was a better film than Oliver!

Because they weren't as highly regarded on their intitial release as they are now. It's as simple as that. Each year can only be looked at as a snapshot of that moment in time, not the be-all and end-all of opinions.And opinions is really all this book is about. Peary feels the need to state his loud and clear, preferring it to the AMPAS voters and expecting us to the same.

Other problems: there is a picture of each knot as it's being laid, but not of the knot as it appears when dressed (tightened) -- this can make a huge difference for some of them.

The epic 'Who's next' ranks as one of the greatest accomplishments in music history. However, lets not forget the packaging of this deluxe edition. In an age with music downloads, the CD has become almost an after thought. Not in this case! You'll get a high quality, durable package that opens like a book. The discs are designed to look like the original record. The booklet is more like a novel -- almost 30 pages including some rare photos.

So I bought it and I am completely satisfied.Some people say the remastered versions are not as good as the original vinyls. I really can't say either way because I never listened to the vinyl. Regardless, this is definitely in my Top 5 favorite albums. It has the ever famous 'Baba O'Riley,' 'Won't Get Fooled Again,' and 'Behind Blue Eyes,' but one of my favorite songs on the album in 'My Wife,' a song I would have never heard had I not bought the album.If you like The Who's popular stuff, there's a good chance you will like this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Early Who CD with several great tracks!!","review":"A must have for any Who fan.I listen to this CD all the time.With hits like Baba O'riley,Getting in Tune,Won't Get Fooled Again and Bargain,I never get tired of listening to it.THE WHO were truly one of the best rock bands of 60's thru the 80's."},{"rating":"2","title":"I still love this album, but...","review":"I still think \\"Who's Next\\" deserves its status as one of the greatest albums in rock history.

Unfortunately, I just can't listen to this album nowadays without thinking of new-car \\"Bargain\\"s and yuppie morons playing polo in their SUVs to the strains of \\"Baba O'Riley.\\" The licensing of classic songs for use in commercials is a very annoying practice which really ticks me off. Don't get me wrong--I'm not getting on The Who's case or calling them sellouts, but SOMEBODY (maybe at Universal or The Who's publishing company) is quick to lend their songs out.

It doesn't take a high dollar stereo to hear the improved sound on the original nine songs. The tracks from the Record Plant in New York are great rock with LESLIE WEST of MOUNTAIN sitting in on the session and adding some great guitar. The best has been saved for Disc 2. The Who run through songs from the not yet released LIFEHOUSE(Who's Next). LOVE AIN'T FOR KEEPIN', PURE AND EASY, BARGAIN, BEHIND BLUE EYES, GETTIN IN TUNE, and WON'T GET FOOLED AGAIN are played for the first time in front of an audience. Anyone who complains about the cost is not a true WHO fan. I had the pleasure of seeing THE WHO perform in Dallas in November 1973 on the QUADROPHENIA TOUR. The opening band was LYNYRD SKYNRD. This is an excellent collection of WHO music and should be owned by anyone who loves classic rock. BUY THIS!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best rock albums ever done. A true rock classic.","review":"This album was one of the first I ever bought, and I have bought it many times over the years. The lyrics bring to mind real feelings, emotions and situations. Who's Next is one of those albums that speak to the inner soul. Sometimes when I need to recharge I will put this album on and let my mind go. Listening to this album never fails to make me feel better. This album, as well as other Who albums, are/is great therapy for the mind. This album is one of those albums where it is hard to pick a favorite song because all of the songs are great. I never put it on to hear just one song, I put it on to hear the whole album. Truly one of the best albums of all time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Creed strikes again!","review":"Creed! WOW! Amazing band. I have to give My Own Prison and Human Clay five stars each.

When I listened to it, it was incredible. But it is also so much more. Listening to this album, one gets a definite picture of what the Who are really all about. Now that it is digitally remixed and remastered with new liner notes and bonus tracks, it makes listening to the album a pleasure. In my opinion, this IS the Who's greatest work ever. Some of the best songs are \\"Baba O'Reily,\\" \\"My Wife,\\" \\"Behind Blue Eyes,\\" and \\"Won't Get Fooled Again.\\" If you liked this album, you might be interested in looking at the box set \\"Lifehouse Chronicles\\" available at Pete Townshend's commericial website. As for \\"Who's Next,\\" it should be considered a rock classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Sound!","review":"When you give this album a ring you can't help but notice how it overwhelms you with dynamics. More than any other album by this band this album shows raw power and poise. It ranges from the anthem like Baba O'Riley and Wont Get Fooled Again, to the tender ballads such as Song is Over, and Behind Blue Eyes. This is truly an exciting listen for anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic rock album for your collection","review":"I bought a copy of Who's Next when it was released in 1971.

This is a must have for all rock fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Who on SACD is a must!","review":"Upon my first listen I did notice that the high frequencies were a little on the low side. But you know what - if you like the sound of records, then this can be really refreshing. Too much high information will have you turning the volume down instead of up. The Who demand high volumes! For each successive song, I ended up turning the volume up higher and higher to really grasp the detail of this recording. The sound stage is amazing. SACD is incredible in this regard. Roger Daltrey's voice comes alive on this recording. Reminds me of some MFSL LP recordings where the vocals stand out more. And Keith Moon's drums sound more alive. Guitar work and bass are way more accurate sounding. This is a must purchase, especially if you like to hear the Who loud! Don't pass this SACD up..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A desert island disc, end of story","review":"Who's Next is in the uppermost echelon of essential rock albums -- whether you're a big fan of Townshend and the Who or not. For many of the same reasons any self-respecting music fan needs to own Sgt. Pepper, Zeppelin IV (or Physical Graffiti), etc. Not only was this the peak of studio output of an always-great band, it also remains among the best-ever uses of synthesizers in a rock context. The drone openings to Baba O'Riley and Won't Get Fooled Again have sent chills down spines for 29 years...regardless of whether you already own the vinyl and original CD you need the remaster, if only for Pure and Easy, which was originally intended to be the centerpiece and thematic standard-bearer for the album, but was cut from the original release. If you only have one Who, this is it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who's Next? Fans Who Know What Classic Rock Best Sounds Like","review":"This was probably the best studio album released by this English band - one that garnered merit from solo Beatles' members and The Rolling Stones alike. Baba O'Riley, Won't Get Fooled Again and Behind Blue Eyes are among their most emotionally intense signature songs, effectly portraying youth resentment while at the same time shadowing obligations of adulthood. With all songs remastered and tracks added, this first-rate recording surpasses what average rock bands accomplish(ed) among their entire days. After listening to this disc, your stereo may soon start believing it has become your most valued asset. With Entwistle at near talented prime, this CD now also provides an appropriate tribute of/to his bass genius - something much to be missed/remembered by the Rock community..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who are you??","review":"Hi, I'm Tommy (no kidding).My father gave me this old CD with music.

I put it in my Walkman from 1993 and hoped for an awesome album (hopefully as good as \\"St.Anger\\"). What a disappointment! I hated this album! Here's why:1.) All songs sound the same2.) Do they even have a bassist? I sure as heck can't hear the bass.3.) The guitarist was awful4.) The drumming was so simple, all in 4/45.) The vocals were horrid! He sounded like a dying cat6.)

I have a wisteria on my wall that has shown more promise in that department. I find the overuse of reverb on the guitars one of Townsend's least innovative movee. The tracks seem poorly put together and although the technology of the time was limited by todays standards other groups, The Beatles, Stones, Monkees managed OK in producing quality output. The songs themselves have always been overated IMO. The album is only rescued by the, un credited backing vocals provided by Bruce Johnston of the Beach Boys. I have that on the highest authority and I only wish he had produced the album as well. At least some credibility would have been added. I will be sticking with my vinyl version of Whos Next. Sorry guys."},{"rating":"2","title":"The greatest rock album and band in the history of mankind.","review":"Get serious. If you've got to read a review about this album or this group, you've let some of the greatest years in rock music pass you by. This is agruably the greatest album written by (not so) agruably the greatest group of all time. Their genius is obvious. Keith Moon (drummer)as usual, ruthlessly separates the men from the boys. Daltry, Entwistle and Townsend are living legends, and rightfully so. Life without this album, and most of their other albums, is a questionable existence at best."},{"rating":"2","title":"What Rock Should Be","review":"WOW! That basically sums up The Who. I love their power chords, energy, and intense musical stylings. After listening to this albulm, and others, I am envious of those who lived when they first broke onto the music scene back in the 60s (I am only 20). The Who is what rock is supposed to be like."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Absolute Greatest Album By The Absolute Greatest Band!!","review":"The best album of the best band ever, Who's Next is a must have for anybody with a rock n' roll collection. 'Baba O'Riley' and 'Won't Get Fooled Again' are two of rock's greatest songs and those two alone could have made this album great, but it wouldn't have been The Who's style to stop with two good songs. 'Behind Blue Eyes' and 'My Wife' are also great tunes.

I'm not a big fan of theirs but I'll make exceptions on this album. Behind Blue Eyes, fantastic, My Wife, funny, been there, Going Mobile, hey there you go Pete. Best album by The Who by far."},{"rating":"2","title":"No extras","review":"I too love this album. I can't say much more about this album that already hasn't been said. It is great, filled with some of the best songs of the era. My only complaint is that it is not the reissue CD that contained a few extra songs. That's my reason for 4 stars. Too bad, I would have bought it to replace the original 1984 CD release. But, if you don't have 'Who's Next', I strongly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great album made even better with added tracks.","review":"The added tracks make a great album even better.

I first bought the album in 1971 and played it till it was no longer payable.As much as you hear the short bursts on the television, it gives you an indication of how great this music is. Rock on and widen your scope for THE WHO."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yet another twoering Who classic!","review":"Nine songs, all of them rock classics- now there's an album. Released in 1971, Who's Next is a damn good record by a damn good band, full of great riffs, anthemic choruses, and beautiful ballads. This is \\"hard rock\\" as it was meant to sound, and the world is all the better for it. \\"Baba O'Riley\\" is a classic rock \`n' roll anthem, with that brain-bending synth line and a chorus the size of Mt. Everest. \\"Bargain\\" is a similarly crunching rocker, and \\"Won't Get Fooled Again\\" is an epic politically charged masterpiece, with a strong cynical edge and some great guitar playing. \\"Love Ain't For Keeping\\" is an eerily pretty, folk-driven stroll, and \\"Going Mobile\\" a rollicking postmodern car song. \\"Behind Blue Eyes\\" is a bitter and introspective ballad, and \\"My Wife\\" is one of the funniest rock songs ever written. And it's catchy! \\"Getting In Tune\\" and \\"The Song Is Over\\" are lush, gorgeous piano driven ballads. Now that's what I call a great album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Who Album And The Young Vic Concert","review":"This is the first time the original master tapes were used to remaster Who's Next [Deluxe Edition]. People with lower end audio equipment will probably not notice much of a difference, but to me it doesn't sound as harsh and tinny as the 1995 version. Most of the bonus songs are available on other collections, but having them in one place is convenient for collectors. What makes this essential purchase is the Young Vic Concert from the aborted Lifehouse project."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Who CD!","review":"\\"Who's next\\" contains the most melodic, intense and innovative pieces of music ever made by the Who. Each tune is an experience to the listener - the music (and texts) awakens your senses and keeps them alive for several hours after you've turned off the music."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Getting in tune to the straight and narrow.....\\"","review":"The Who is one of the legendary bands that I have sadly overlooked over the years. Aside, from The Who By Numbers, I remained ignorant and stayed away from their other albums. I don't know why. Maybe it was because I just wasn't interested in their music. Well, now that I'm more open-minded, I've taken the chance and explored Who's Next, and it's been a HUGE pleasure. I can safely say that this album is just excellent. I know that I've heard snippets of \\"Baba O'Riley\\" and \\"Won't Get Fooled Again\\" now and then, but I've never heard them in full. Now, I can revel in the music completely, and it's a great experience. The other songs (such as \\"Behind Blue Eyes,\\" \\"Getting in Tune,\\" and \\"Bargain\\") are also brilliant. The only songs that are fairly weak are \\"Love Ain't For Keeping\\" and \\"Going Mobile,\\" but it's nothing bad. This is an excellent album by The Who, and it makes me want to explore their other albums.Grade: 9.5/10"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Who's finest moment","review":"I once read a critic describe \\"Who's Next\\" as the best pure Rock album ever made. It's hard to argue against that. This hasn't aged a bit in my opinion. It's still vital and alive today and has become the music of more than one generation.\\"Who's Next\\" has it all- Townshend's guitar work, Entwistle's bass, Moon's drumming and Daltrey's vocals (that scream on \\"Won't Geet Fooled Again\\"). This is one of the indispensible Who albums to own (the others being \\"Tommy\\" and \\"Quadrophenia\\").From \\"Baba O'Reilly\\" to \\"We Won't Get Fooled Again\\", \\"Who's Next\\" is a masterpiece of Rock."},{"rating":"2","title":"Welcome...to the 70's...","review":"Unlike the latter part of the decade known for its kitsch and Disco music, Rock entered the 70's with a bleary eyed hangover experienced after pulling a decade long all-nighter - jimi, janis and the beatles were gone - Altamont, Manson and Heroin replaced peace love and understanding, it was a new dawn and for one perfect moment in time the stars aligned and Rock's biggest stars actually became their most creative artists - the Who, Stones, The Kinks, Neil Young - each came out with their seminal albums through their own different paths and Rock music was never again the same. Who's Next reflected a greater optimism and sense of purpose than the Stones dark moods in Exile on Main Street or the Kinks bent toward nostalgia on Village Green but it was hard earned and paid for and stands the test of time as the Who's greatest acheivement."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best rock album ever!","review":"This is probably the finest example of the sound of the \\"Who\\". Mixing straight forward rock and roll with the mournful sound of \\"Behind Blue Eyes\\". One cannot help but feel the emotion in this collection of songs. Ranging from sadness to pure joy on to rebellion all in one album! I consider this to be one of my personal favorites, destined to become a classic. Sounds as fresh and envigorating today as it was on its original release date of 1971! Superb!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The greatest hard rock album ever released!","review":"If someone asked me to define rock and roll in less than 1 minute, I would play them Roger Daltrey's scream at the end of \\"Won't Get Fooled Again\\" and right up to the ending of the song. That scream is the most perfect moment in the history of rock. No one else has ever come even close."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Rock Album Ever ?","review":"Maybe! This band, at the absolute height of their formidable talents? They were awesome. Saw them near Saint Louis when this album was new (Summer '71). Unbelievable. Yup, they wained a bit later, but not on this! How many other rock releases from 1971 can you even stand to listen to now? 1971 was \\"a very good year\\" for music, but this is really tops. Check out Pete's live in Chicago album from last year to see how well his writing holds up now, after all this time. Fantastic stuff. A killer album that also contains the all-time dorm speaker-tester \\"scream\\". Can you guess where? Great cover art, too! It's really a shame I can only give 5 stars for this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worried","review":"Hi,I'm a little bit worried because the CD hasn't arrived so far.I know that it's christmas time, but it should be here by now.It has happened with me before.I bought an O.C.Smith CD that was delayed for more than two months.I had to mail it back, because you sent me a second one after my complain.Can you trace the shipment?Regards,Sergio"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, but tails off after hits","review":"Who can deny the greatness of tracks like Baba O'Riley, Bargain, and Won't Get Fooled Again? These tracks alone are worth the price of the album. However, the majority of the rest is unmemorable. It is an essential British Invasion piece nonetheless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ever wonder why not everything recorded is released?","review":"This CD explains it all. Just because something made it to tape doesn't mean it's worth the time or our money to buy. As much as I like The Who, this CD is a big disappointment. Apparently they've learned something from Jimi Hendrix's relatives who continue to release mediocre performances and claim they're just-discovered gems. Buy the original Who's Next and forget all the extra [stuff], and save some money too."},{"rating":"1","title":"2003 and not an SACD hybrid?","review":"How could MCA release a remastered version of this greatest of all WHO albums in March, 2003, and use only antiquated 44.1K Hz CD technology? The Rolling Stones hybrid SACD/CD remasterings of the past year are of stunning sound quality. Pink Floyd is out on SACD. MCA, don't leave the Who behind. I'll wait on this purchase until I can hear the real sound that is on those vaulted tapes in a DSD remaster."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic remaster of the Who's finest sounding LP","review":"The original tracks to Who's Next sound bigger and clearer than ever. Thanks to Glyn Johns production and engineer Jon Astley, Keith Moon's drumming is finally heard in all of it's fire and glory. The bonus tracks are kind of a history lesson of the Life House project. You get the idea on how hard they worked before scrapping Lif House and salvaging the strongest songs. My only peeve with this edition is that they don't include the final mix of \\"Pure and Easy\\". That being said, these CDs never leave my CD player. The live show is interesting. The band hasn't quite got \\"Won't Get Fooled Again\\" into their DNA yet, so it's a bit scattered. But still, it's the Who in their early 70s prime and they really rock."},{"rating":"2","title":"What rock should sound like","review":"Great instrumentation, gut busting voacals, songs of defiance, anthems, worthy fillers, beginning to end excellence. A true 5 star album. The Who has forever sounded so different than any rock band and yet so rock and roll. Keith Moons drumming flows with the music much different than those of groove style drummers, Entwistle's bass playing is electric and melodic and rhythmic and breathtaking all at the same time, Townshend's power chords and fitting stylized solos and unpretentious song writing (at this time of his career) was at its best. Daltrey's scream in Won't Get Fooled Again says it all. How about his anger in Behind Blue Eyes. Enough said."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who's Next is The Who's Best","review":"Wont Get Fooled again is one of the greatest Who songs ever and one of the best rock songs. Who's next also contains Baba O'Riley, Behind Blue Eyes, and Bargain. All four of the songs mentioned are timeless classic's. But thats not it My Wife is a great humerous song and Getting in tune is also powerful. The album is a must buy especially with the bonus tracks. A Classic indeed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST CD EVER RELEASED","review":"this is the best thing ever. if you are a who fan get this cd if you have only heard the who on tv commercials and theme songs.

I am in awe of this legendary band.After performing their songs so many times over the years, they still have the passion and dedication to work at fever pitch! Their decision to perform \\"Who Are You\\", \\"Behind Blue Eyes\\", and \\"Baba O' Riley\\" indicates their awareness to the fact that many fans consider these to be some of their best moments.There are other fans/customers in this review posting who have already made all necessary historical references to the album, so I'll cut short by saying that this C.D. should be right next to your \\"Sgt. Peppers\\" C.D...It is a defining milestone in the evolution of rock. It sounds corny, but I am absolutely proud of this band!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy this now.","review":"I have never understood why the Rolling Stones get credit as being the greatest rock band ever. Who's Next destroys this gross misconception after the first five minutes of the album. This was, and still is, the swan song of rock and roll. Who's Next breaks all the rules, and drags you along with it, whether you're coming or not. Some of the songs on here, particularly \\"Baba O'Reilly\\" and \\"The Song Is Over,\\" were some of the first to kick start the progressive rock rise in the 1970's. It is also the first time a synthesizer was used on a rock album. Pete Townshend wrote his finest set of songs ever, many of which have become classics. When all is said and done, nobody has come across as honest, innovative, and intense as the Who did during their heyday, and this album chronicles that better than Exile on Main Street or Beggars Banquet ever did."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the hell is this?","review":"Yeah swell...I finally got my new CD by The Who, \\"Who's Next\\". Too bad when I put the CD into my player it labeled some of the songs in Spanish and others in English. Unfortunately the names of the songs were incorrect, no matter what language it was in.

Roger can't sing at all and pete townsend was a pretty bad guitar player and keith moon isnt all that great. behind pink eyes which is amongst the lousiest songs ever written is the most horrible trash tune and could match similar songs like bohemian wrhapsody,free bird,and satisfaction. i rather listen to mark knopfler insted.he is much,much,much,much,much better.get any of his albums insted..he rocked not townshend.ps. take the word for it kids.bluh!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I changed my mind---it [is bad]!","review":"I hate this thing, not only did it cost [$$$], but it has no english!

A surfer dude moves to Cleveland, espouses California-esqe, quasi-Zen cliches, wins the hearts of Cleveland-anchored, angst-ridden lasses, annoys said lasses absurdly anti-California but eventually lovable clunkhead brother and friends, and wins a free-for-all downhill rollerblading deathmatch, all with the help of his impeccable rollerblading, his perfectly coiffed head, and his ingratiatingly wacky cousin Wileyman. There are no standouts in the crowd. Like a watch, each character works together to produce an unintentially hilarious piece of celluloid mindlessness. Put it on the shelf with Zapped, Showgirls and any of the TeenVid series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crazy Rollerbladin' Action Takes Cincinnatti by Storm!","review":"While I heartily agree with both my colleagues, this movie is a classic surfer goes to Cincinnatti and turns the city around through the crazy antics of rollerblading type of movie. While Shane McDermott plays the surfer to a tee, performances by Seth Green and Jack Black make this film hilarious and well-worth a dozen or so viewings. Shane's character is plagued by the prep Blaine and the muscle-bound hothead Jack; although treated as an outcast at first, his witty comebacks and assorted rollerblading tricks eventually win everyone over. As Shane himself says, \\"The wave is mine,\\" and you must search for this wave of a movie, bra. Hang-ten, five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"absolutely hilarious","review":"This movie is not a comedy, but it is hilarious.

And then, I never saw it again until now. After 20 years, wow...that's a long time, it is still not a bad film at all. In fact, even for a low-key picture, Airborne probably has the best rollerblading scenes ever, even better than the ones on Rollerball with Jimmy Caan. That is one of the chief reasons why I wanted to see the film again. Shane McDermott's performance is impressive because he literally walks on a fine line between cool and corny. That's a very tough thing to accomplish, but he does it very well. All in all, Airborne is no Point Break but manages to be an effective, fast 90 minute fun flick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete disappointment","review":"Completely ridiculous.

Then I waited longer for the price reduction. This movie brings back a lot of memories from my younger years when roller blades were the must have thing. Me and 5 other friends on my street got roller blades after seeing this movie. The story itself is very good and if you like roller blading you'll love the action scene's.

I was excited about it, after learning a young Seth Green and Jack Black were in it. The movie is horrible! If you are having trouble sleeping at night, just watch this piece of crap and you'll never want to wake up again. The movie is mainly about the very short lived roller blade fad of the early 1990's, let's just say this, surfing is always was and always will be super cool! Skateboarding is always was and always will be super cool!

It won't change your life or make you want to get into the film industry, but it will bring a smile to your face for 90 minutes.It is pure, clean fun centered around a California surfer being the new kid in a Cincinnati high school. They surf, rollerblade, play hockey, earn their driver's licenses, and try to impress girls. The plot is basic, but the movie moves relatively quickly and keeps you constantly interested in the cheesiness.The movie is highlighted by many memorable characters including early roles from Jack Black and Seth Green. Both actors have hysterical characters, with several one liners from Jack Black that are regularly quoted at my college.Again, the movie is sheer entertainment, great for anyone that likes to have fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Airborne","review":"This is a movie that likely isn't popular with many nationally, but is if you are from or grew up in the Northern Kentucky/Cincinnati, OH area, which I did. Lots of cool things in this movie between seeing scenes in Pompelios Restaurant, the old landing on the river in Covington, KY which is gone, Riverfront Stadium when it was still here, and more. As far as growing up is concerned, it is cool to watch if you grew up in the 1990s. Jack Black and Seth Green plays roles in it well before they became known too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Received bootleg copy","review":"Be forewarned that this is a bootleg copy.

As usual the crimes become more personal where eventually Grazia, herself, becomes a possible target.ALMOST BLUE is a very well written psychological suspense drama. It is quite unique in its structure. Chapters or actually sections alternate with point of view between the killer's, Simone's and Grazia. The chapters are quite short keeping the pacing rapid throughout. The length of the book is more that of a novella yet works perfectly for the drama portrayed. The end result is a chilling portrayal of the criminal mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simone is definitely blue, but the story is green.","review":"The basic story is not remarkable. Young cop Grazia Negro is pursuing a serial killer of university students in Bologna. The male cops undersestimate her, and the bodies are piling up. What is remarkable about \\"Almost Blue\\" is that center of the story is Simone, a young blind man who navigates the world by smell and characterizes his experiences according to colors he has never seen. Green voices are bad. Blue voices are good. Simone spends his time in his room listening to the world on his scanners with jazz playing in the background. One night, Simone hears the \\"green\\" voice of a man who is a serial killer. Grazia finds her way to Simone and enlists his help in finding the killer.

The sheer malevolence of Count Dracula was admirably portrayed by Mr. Lee. Of all the Dracula films produced, \\"Count Dracula\\" surely rates as one of the top three. The screenplay was one of the closest renditions to Bram Stokers novel that I have seen, and I have seen nearly every Dracula movie ever produced. Herbert Lom did a remarkable job as Prof. Van Helsing, but nowhere near Peter Cushing. The special effects were good, but could have been better and in some areas of the film, the sound quality will be found wanting. However, for true gothic horror, this film is superb. I would definitely recommend this movie to any horror fan in general and any Dracula fan in particular."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christopher Lee finally speaks as Dracula","review":"In the Hammer films Christopher Lee played Dracula as an inhuman creature, hissing and growling more like an animal than a human being. The tragedy of this film is that you get a feel for what Lee could have done from the start if Hammer had gone more in the direction of Stoker's original novel. Whether this is the most accurate depiction of Stoker's \\"Dracula\\" is certainly debatable, but I think we would all agree that this is Lee's most interesting performance as the Count."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jess Franco's Count Dracula","review":"Atmospheric as promised.

We have 3 distinguised actors, Lee, Lom and Kinski, in a dull version of Stokers book.

Very disappointed in this one. It should have the dates correctly stated to avoid the confusion. I certainly did not need to spend the money i forked over for this one. The music is very good but king biscuit is the better buy by far. Crossroader is also listed as a song on the bootleg version but is nowhere to be heard on the disk though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Leslie West and Mountain need to be in Rock & Roll Hall of fame","review":"I have been a fan for 30 years- I was at this concert in 1973.

I ordered this 5 weeks ago. I never received the package. Standard shipping from the USPS. I have contacted Siren Disc to get the tracking number, but they haven't replied. So much for ordering music via mail. I am disappointed with the whole process, no human to contact, no product, lost package from the Post Office.

So here I am."},{"rating":"1","title":"Isolated","review":"My review is not low because of a conservative anti-Crossan bias (not that I'm unbiased), but the book, for all its great length and detail about the cultural world of the 1c Roman empire, barely gets into the Apostles teachings and theology.Perhaps more inexcusable, is the fact that the book interacts almost not at all with any dissenting scholarly opinions, and completely ignores the most significant Pauline scholars out there.Useful perhaps to understand the culture of the time, but not helpful to understand Paul's thought. But still Wayne Meeks \\"The First Urban Christians\\" does a much more thorough job at this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre attempt that really is not in search of \\"Paul\\"","review":"Crossan and Reed here make a really poor attempt to do several things, provide a historical, sociological, anthropological, and religious context to the world of the historical Paul, while at the same time present a modern travelogue and archaelogical primer of Paul's world. But at the same time, they attempt an exegesis of Paul's writings, give themselves literary license to rewrite scripture, and try to downplay or even declare wrong whole portions of the New Testament. They obviously started the book with a clear agenda to challenge and find illegitimate non \\"politically correct\\" portions of the New Testament and so the title is completely misleading. While obviously everyone is entitled to their own views on scripture, this attempt at religious revisionism is absurd, especially when these authors pretend to do it under the guise of scholarship."},{"rating":"1","title":"Suffered in the Execution","review":"Crossan and Reed deserve two stars just for the attempt to explain Paul of Tarsus with an interdisciplinary approach. Unfortunately, their worthy ambition exceeded their ability to create a cohesive analysis, and what results is an uninspiring mishmash of travelogue, history, archeology, exegesis, sociology, art history, and polemic."},{"rating":"1","title":"In Search of Paul : How Jesus' Apostle Opposed Rome's Empire with God's Kingdom","review":"The author is obviously an intellectual scholar who only knows what he believes to be true. The simple fact that he believes that Paul is the author of only seven of the 13 books tells me that he has no knowledge of the Holy Spirit in the canon of scriptures. Furthermore that the equality of mankind Paul speaks of is the equality through faith in Christ not equal rights liberalism. This writer may claim to be a Christian but has no knowledge of Christianity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Master innovator","review":"This set features a number of jazz standards done Brubeck style, with his innovative time signature changes and tempo changes. His son Chris joins him on bass and bass trombone to add a nice family touch to the recording. This is a 1981 album and just a pure joy to listen to from start to finish. Dave was in his fourth decade of writing, composing, and performing music and this album communicates the passion that still exists in him after all of that time. Superb!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sound and Look Good, Too Quiet","review":"Pros:--The chimes sound pleasant. They're attractive, too, with dark green chimes and a pale green stain on the wood parts.Cons:--Requires a strong wind to make them sound. Unfortunately, they're rather quiet with little sustain, so it's hard to hear them over the wind unless you are quite close to them.

The entire story is told by each of these storytellers on a stage decorated with colorful ladders.The reason my rating lacks a star is that the second Cinderella story makes people who use cued speech seem awful. It promotes a prejudiced opinion that people who know cued speech (can lipread with a little signed help) are stuck-up and mean.For those of you looking for videos to help you learn ASL or help your child learn, the signing is faster than most \\"learn this\\" type videos, and the speech doesn't match up closely with the signs (example: if you are looking at the sign when they say the word \\"rabbit\\" you are not going to see that word, it will be a different part of the story).However, if you already know some sign and want to see the sentence structure, this is perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enchanting!","review":"This precious book is a delight on every page.

All along the way, we are touched by the people her healing hands and heart have touched.

The 1970 re-issue had a different cover (what was wrong with the old one?), different from the other Pickwick and RCA Special Edition LP covers. As usual, RCA is master of the crass posthumus re-packaging/re-issue, feeding off Elvis' dead flesh.

It started falling apart after a few months of use. The zippers break for no apparent reason. We also had a zipper separate from the material leaving a whole that I tried to patch. The latest news is that the extendable handle broke while wheeling the bag across a street. When it broke (once again, for no apparent reason [global warming maybe??]), I realized that the concealed portion of the carry handle was made of cheap plastic. This is deceptive because the outer portion appears to be made from some type of metal. Why they would make this critical part out of cheap plastic is beyond my understanding.

Or fired the editor she used to use. Or rushed the book to print.This book is a barely filled in outline. The characters are flat; the situations empty. Not enough time was spent filling out the characters and making them 3 dimensional; making them real. Perhaps if she took this outline, she could flesh out 3 really good books.And it's disheartening to have a woman perpetuate the idea that \\"toxic bachelors\\" can be \\"cured\\" by the right woman. Women have been banging their heads and hearts against these shallow, self-serving men throughout history, only to end up with a broken heart and damaged self-images.

I agree with what the other reviews mentioned (except for the one person who thought it was well thought out and written) and will not go into the same details. Most of my annoyance came from the repetitive phrases and lack of depth to the characters and plot. I have only read a few of Danielle Steel's books (which I found so similar to each to be boring) and thought I might give her one more shot when I was looking for something to read in the airport. I can't believe she has sold ANY books with the quality of the writing I just experienced. An utter waste of time and money.

I was going to pre-order her new book coming out this month, but I cancelled it because I have a feeling that book is going to be the same. I am not sure if Steel is just running out of things to write about or if she just doesn't care about her fan base anymore. She either needs to step up her game and get with the program or retire her typewriter. Get it together, Steel! You're losing your fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Toxic reading","review":"I give the author credit that she changed her traditional storytelling format. This was from the male perspective. Charlie Harrington, Adam Weiss, and Gray Hawk, were good friends and dedicated bachelors. Each had their own complicated, flimsy reasons for being commitment-phobic. However Gray, the loner artist finds Sylvia; Adam the lawyer and wild bachelor finds Maggie; and Charlie, the blue-blood finds Carole. They are all stereotypical characters that we have seen in her previous novels. There is an annoying lack of attention to details and it shows when little Gabby appears with her seeing-eye dog Zorro. Charlie pets him like a household pet and not as a working dog. Conversation between the men sounds at times inane and immature.

Throughout the book I caught myself saying \\"Okay, I get it.\\" Only to find that the very next paragraph was belaboring the point made in the previous paragraph. How long does it take to convey the point that these three guys love their annual European yachting trip for obvious reasons? How stupid does she think her readers are? This is the first Danielle Steele book I have read in approximately 10 years - - it will definitely be the last. And what is up with that ridiculous photo of her on the back cover dressed up like a polar bear in the seat of a fancy red car??? Give me a break!

She has become very idiosyncratic and predictable. Every book has her main character 'being honest.'

Her characters are ALWAYS rich, beautiful and boring. Curiously, they are almost exclusively only children whose parents are dead. You can read the first chapter and predict the last. I howled with laughter when she describes the bonding conversation between the men. No men I know talk like that. Ms. Steel needs to get out in the real world.

In this instance the writer who took Barry Sadler's original notes (Sadler did not complete this one) made a real mess of it. The incidents in this overdone novel relate to the 1967 Six-Day War but chronologically in the Casca series it occurs AFTER 1970 (I think Sadler was going to write about the Yom Kippur War). Also this book tends to be one mad assault on an Arab fortress after another and it gets boring. The only relief is a brief lull in Jerusalem when Casca does a bit of reminiscing. Otherwise its really a waste of the readers time unless you like a Steve Spielberg-style all-action Rambo all-out war from page 1 to the finish.

I kept hoping I had missed something that was going to reveal itself at the end, a wicked twist or something to make the whole read worhtwhile. Alas, for something that could've been a fun mystery/adventure turned out to be way too obvious and left me feeling a little shortchanged.

In reading Laura's memoirs I found a very real and honest view of what we (cf patients) go thru everyday. Laura had an amazing strength and courage to endure all her trials and I found reading her personal story helped me understand some of my own feelings.I think this book is a wonderful read for all persons...if you face an illness, know someone who does or just want to be touched by a lovely young womans story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read after hearing story on NPR","review":"It's a quick read which surprised me given the poignancy of the subject matter. I wanted to read the book after I had heard her tapes on NPR last year. The book is a very personal account of living with (and ultimately dying of) cystic fibrosis and assumes a similar close knowledge of the disease. It does not contain much if any medical background to balance out the memoir."},{"rating":"1","title":"heartfelt and sad but ultimately not compelling","review":"this book is well enough written, and its author goes through hell. her struggles were difficult; her death was tragic. however, this book doesn't capture the deepest level of her experience. it's somehow not very personal, although it's a memoir about the author. it reads a lot more like a diary, with events noted and visitors named but not much reflection on the meanings of things or explanation of the relationships the author had. not a bad book, but somewhat flat."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you've got the money, go for it","review":"I do not own this machine, but I have used it twice for 60 minute sessions at a hotel. It is one of the most dynamic workouts you'll ever get on a stairmaster. This machine mimics running up stairs exactly and gives your quads a great workout, better than any other stair machine I've used. The quality of construction is exceptional, and it should be with this hefty price tag. It's extremely heavy, but I was able to move it around, so you could stick it on your back porch if company comes calling.If you have the money, then this would be an incredible addition to your home gym. It delivers a solid workout with high-quality construction. An awesome product, just very pricey."},{"rating":"2","title":"great dino book","review":"I bought this book for my son for Christmas, I can't wait to give it to him.

The art is to be appreciated, however it's not as though the pictures are complex enough to grab the attention of the reader.Each page contains (on average) less than ten words. I'm surprised it is so well-liked.As for the subject of the TRex being a Carnivore, I think it's fine. Some things are the way they are, which is what the book is trying to convey. Acceptance of one's self. However, bizarre and lame ending.I only gave it two stars due to the beautiful art. Otherwise, I'd pass on this one.

Not just the Brits, but this quality little photo bio book piqued my interest. Just about 80 photos covering William's life from opulent birth through tragic adolescence in 1998, one year after the demise of his mum, Princess Diana. Pix of trips, sports, school, family and semi-private precious reflections cast deep into his sad eyes.This is not just a *Tiger Beat* oooooo & ahhh, look at him book. Quite introspective as to what a royals life entails even at an early age. But, ok, he IS cute too! Authoress Valerie Garner interjects interesting factoids.

This cd is amazing, and has quickly become one of my favs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top music and performance!!!!","review":"Saw this band live at the 40 Watt club in athens ga, home of REM and Widespread Panic, and they left me speechless..One of the best debut albums ever....I challenge you to see this band and not like them!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"can you say \\"I've heard this before\\"","review":"What a BLAND totally AVERAGE band.

Don't waste your time or money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meet Virginia is great - the rest is anticlimactical","review":"With the exception of the first track (meet virginia), this CD sounds like the one you bought from the bar band last friday night, played twice, and then exiled to that CD black hole in the trunk of your car or bottom of your closet. The band proved that they can knock the socks off their listeners but they fail to do so repeatedly throughout this CD even when the music seems to serve up the opportunity to do so. Although the band's raw, un-processed sound is great, tracks two onward just does'nt cut it. Hopefully however, we'll hear more from this band in the future in which they'll capitalize on their capability to compose and deliver truly inspired raw emotion translated into alternative rock like they did in the track \\"meet virginia\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very enjoyable","review":"I've had this CD for a while now, and I still enjoy it very much. I like country in very small doses, and this band has it just right. Let's hope there's more on the way!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!","review":"Absolutely one of the most uninteresting bands I have ever heard! If you're a fan of simple, mindless tripe, you'll love Train. Like a bar band that's finally made it big, Train lines their music with banal affectations and riffs stolen from Led Zeppelin and REM. Sure to be playing proms again in a year or two, this band is simply no fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE best","review":"Train is an awesome CD - every song is great. And, if you haven't seen them live, run to their next concert. These guys should be HUGE! My only complaint is that they don't have a follow up album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Train","review":"I have to admit, I don't buy too many things based on the recommendation of strangers. But this time I decided to give the mass audience a chance.Boy what a mistake that was!Not only is it full of cliched pop tunes that seem to have no cohesiveness with the overall framework of the album, but it's also full of ripoff imitations of every great rock band in the last thirty years.To give it a chance, I listened to it over ten times in one week-end - each time hoping it would grow on me. Afterwards, I figured the only thing to do was to \\"meet virginia\\" and tell her quit her day-job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing CD!","review":"Highly recommended! I bought this CD after seeing TRAIN live on tour with matchbox twenty. I am most impressed with how closely their live and recorded sounds match. This CD has not been removed from my changer since the day I bought it; it's amazing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Meet Train","review":"I became addicted to \\"meet virginia\\" and had to get this cd. I must say, I was not disappointed! Although I can barely listen to \\"virginia\\" (can you say..worn out) I still listen to this cd all the time. It is an easy going cd mixed with a rock, countryish, alternative style of song. I think the best songs are the extra tracks after the last listed song on the cover. Some of the songs are funky (eggplant and caviar for you), but I liked the whole package. Check it out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album!","review":"This album is just great. It is one of those few albums were every song you just love. They have a great sound.For all of those waiting for a new album: If you ever are lucky enough to get to see them live, they offer a 6 song limited edition E.P. with new material available only at shows(their way of giving something back to their fans)but really this is a great album. Every song is fantastic. But, having to chose I'd say Eggplant, Train(a hidden track), swaying, and days are the stand outs for me. But really it is a album full of 14 great tracks that never get old no matter how many times you hear them. Train is by far the best new band to come along in a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"TRAIN IS ABSOLUTELY AWESOME--ON CD AND IN PERSON!","review":"I SAW TRAIN COMPLEMENTS OF MY LOCAL RADIO STATION (WRAX FM 107.7) IN BIRMINGHAM, AL. THEY PERFORMED AT THE XTVAL LAST SEPTEMBER. THE GROUP HAS A SUPER STAGE SHOW, INCLUDING A COVER OF LED ZEPPLIN'S \\"RAMBLE ON\\". I HAD NEVER HEARD OF THEM UNTIL THEN. I WENT OUT IMMEDIATELY AND BOUGHT THE CD. IT IS WELL WORTH THE PRICE! (PLUS THERE ARE 3 EXTRA SONGS THAT REALLY ROCK!!!) IF YOU BUY NO OTHER CD THIS YEAR--THIS IS THE ONE! BE ON THE LOOKOUT FOR THIS GROUP TO GO ALL THE WAY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Different from the rest","review":"Trying to put Train into a category is pretty difficult. From the alt-country of \\"Meet Virginia\\" to the distorted sound of \\"Eggplant\\" Train defies easy description. From the simple titles to the challenging lyrics, Train definitely has developed their own sound, a rarity for a debut CD. Still a little rough around the edges and occasionally trying too hard to be different at the expense of melody, (\\"Idaho\\") Train delivers a solid CD. Accessible but never boring, Train has proven to be off to an interesting start."},{"rating":"2","title":"On track","review":"Train mixes southern guitar rock with capable and interesting vocals into a really solid album. \\"Homesick\\" and \\"I am\\" are particularly strong. \\"Meet Virginia\\" is a great quirky little song that has nearly been ruined by excessive radio play -- not that that's the band's fault."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Roots Rock","review":"I consider this one of the top 5 rock albums of 1998. The songs are diverse enough to keep the disc interesting, but are bound together by a common thread - that of roots rock. Some of the tunes are introspective, such as \\"I Am\\", \\"Idaho\\" and \\"Free\\" while others develop characters with amazing clarity, such as \\"Meet Virginia\\" and \\"Homesick\\". The arrangements are fundamentally simple but the playing is dynamic enough to provide rich texture. The band is mature enough to let the music breathe rather than clutter it up and in the process, the songs have taken on power and authority. The recording quality is excellent. This is a very solid album with no duds. Essential!"},{"rating":"2","title":"IT RULES!","review":"The train cds is one of the best cds i have ever owned! I love all the tracks! My two favorites are meet virginia and number 4. I love train! they rock!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just a small town girl taking the Train to Happiness","review":"When I bought this CD it was because I'd heard \\"Meet Virginia\\" on the radio and loved it...

Nothing personal, but it just doesn't appeal to me in the least. Don't buy this CD, like I did, punting on the reviews being a good indicator.

I didn't like the slow, plodding \\"Meet Virginia\\" the first time I heard it, let alone the other 15,000,000 times.It amazes me that this is so popular! The amazon.com review compared this to REM. I think that is an extreemly bad comparison.

This album was terribly boring and very unoriginal. A fairly depressing album with little substance. If you think Train is all about \\"Meet Virginia, Drops of Jupiter\\" type of music, then do yourself a favor and DO NOT get this album...If you do, then don't say I didn't warn you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This system requires that I give at least one star...","review":"Comparing this band to REM is like comparing a dung beetle to Mecha Godzilla. Train is tiny, weak, and spends its days pushing around ... well, you know. In the story of Rock n' Roll, REM is legendary, Train is not even a footnote."},{"rating":"2","title":"great CD you can listen to the whole way through!","review":"Someone suggested this CD to me; I like anything from Pearl Jam to the Gypsy Kings to James Taylor.

After running into an old flame who had the CD and listening to the whole thing with him, I RAN to the nearest music store! Being from Idaho, the song \\"Idaho\\" is definitely one of my favorites (plus it's just an incredibly great song). I absolutely LOVE this CD!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful CD and a wonderful price also.","review":"Okay, here's my story. I wanted a new CD and only had $12. Went to my local music store, saw Train and knew that I hadn't heard it yet, I scanned the 1st song and bought it. I put it in my CD player and listened to it all the way without skipping through any songs! It reminds me of Sister Hazel meets Antheneum (What I didn't know). I am very picky when it comes to music and I think that anyone who likes music that you can drive to and/or just listen to when studying or just bummin' around the house really needs to run, not walk and get TRAIN!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Something Everyone Can Enjoy","review":"Instead of clinging to a specific genre of music, Train manages to maintain neutrality in their music. Not quite rock, not quite country, not quite blues. This is just plain good music. If you're looking for an album that won't offend anyone, even your grandmother, this is the one. I listen to it over and over and find enjoyment with every listen. This Train has rolled into my top 10 collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't stop this train","review":"Meet Virginia is my absolute favorite song because it reminds me of well, me. But to go beyond that song leads one to a taste of some originality. Eggplant intriques with the title alone. The song is actually a heartfelt expression of some strange sense of deep love. Untitled track 12 really lets Train exhibit its slamming new prowess. The song motors on like those European quickies! Do listen all the way through."},{"rating":"2","title":"Help! Can't Stop Listening To It","review":"I caught this band on VH-1 Storytellers and went out to get their CDs. First listened to \\"Drops of Jupiter\\" and it's lovely, but their debut album \\"Train,\\" which I got later, I think somehow got glued into my CD box in my car, at home in my stereo, in my computer at work. Help! It's been over a week... The poetry of the words, the riffs of the guitars, the slamming of the drums, the punch of Patrick Monahan's singing. It's got it all."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!","review":"Started listening to this CD a week ago and it's been in constant rotation ever since. Great songs. A must have for your CD collection!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"My friend suggested this CD, a band I had never heard of before, and said that I had to buy it. I went out and did, and it has instantly become one of my favorite CD's. There is no song better to open a CD with than \\"Meet Virginia\\", as if Train is inviting you to see what they are all about. But the best song on the album is \\"Free\\". If that song doesn't get you going in the morning, that you need some severe caffeine pills. Amazing CD, definately a mix of Dave and Jackopierce, but a cutting edge sound that distinguishes itself from all the garbage that's on the radio. Still has that local band sound which makes it even more appealing. Can't wait for the next one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sincere Rock At It's Best","review":"You can hardly find good CDs these days that have an all around good gutsy rock feel. This band is really worth a listen if you like bands that are simple and straight ahead rock. \\"Homesick\\" is by far one of my favorite songs of all time. I have listened to it over and over. It's an awesome cruising song on a beautiful day. I have just pre-ordered their new album and wait with anticipation that it is as good as this one. 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Ride on the Train","review":"What a great suprise. This album is wonderful. Blind, Idaho, and the two hidden tracks are the stand outs. \\"This is how I feel\\" When I frist heard Train, on the radio, I thought it was David Bareward from David and David, the styling and vocals are very close. So put the disk in the cd player and take that Train to \\"Idaho\\", it will be a great trip."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a voice!","review":"I was hooked from \\"Meet Virginia\\", which was my reason for buying the album, and I was pleasantly suprised by the rest.

If you don't like country... it will be even more painful."},{"rating":"2","title":"living in a deep transparent world full of dreams and wishes","review":"I believe the group\\"train\\" has put out there most exhilirating piece of earth. the first time i heard this song was on the radio while sitting on my bed dreaming. it reminded me so much of myself. always living a dream life then it really happening and wishing that it would just go like it came. so peaceful and relaxing. this song \\"meet virgina\\" has put a deep inpact on my life. showing you that life always has it ups and downs but really more ups than downs because nomatter what happens it is always happier on the other side. this song in particular brings up two people who thought life would be easy and happy all the time , who come to find out it really isn't all peaches and cream. after finding out this, the man wishes to go back in time to undo his mistakes when the lady wishes to persue her dreams without really thinking what she is doing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great music...","review":"I don't own this CD, although I wish i did. I've heard some of their songs, like Meet Virginia, on the radio. This is a really good song, like the lyrics...yeah.

I'm glad that Alice promoted it, or esle I probably never would have heard it..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good listening from start to finish!","review":"It is rare to find a CD that you don't have to skip over songs you don't like.

I found this record to be unoriginal, derivative, and uninspired. Train is yet another in the ever growing genre of alt-country best exemplifed by Uncle Tupelo (particularly March 16-20) and Golden Smog.I can't blame them for trying. It's very faddish and popular right now.If you're interested in acoustic based masterpieces, check out \\"the good earth\\" by the feelies, Whiskeytown's Faithless street, or sound of Lies by the Jayhawks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"I must say that this is one of the best CD's I have ever purchased. I bought it and listened to it constantly before going to see them in concert. I couldn't find one song on this disk that I did not like. Then getting to see them live only bolstered my appreciation and love for this band. They don't pander to the small-minded, soda-pop rock that many people are listening to. They bring back the solid guitar rock that is lacking in much of today's good music. This is definitely a CD that everyone who loves good music should have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hooks you and never lets go!","review":"A fantastic debut CD - took a chance on it after reading write-ups & reviews, and was not disappointed at all! The Allman & REM comparisons are off - they fall more into the Dave Matthews Band & Blues Traveller league.Quite simply, this CD is loaded with catchy tunes from start to finish - any it gets better with each spin. Train was a breath of fresh air amidst the rather strange 'hiphopgothdeath' sound that tops our local rock stations."},{"rating":"2","title":"California songwriting at its best","review":"Before I bought this CD, the Counting Crows' August and Everything After was the CD that got maximum play on my machine. If you like songwriting without the fluff---lyrics that appeal to your existance and experience--this is the CD to have. Very influenced by the Counting Crows, each song has a \\"feel\\" to it. Perfect rainy weather music. Welcome to the scene, guys."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent CD from start to finish!!!","review":"This has quickly become one of my favorite cd's for more than one reason. Train's feeling and emotion is packed into each one of these songs, and they can be great to sit down and relax with or to bob your head and sing along. The lead singer's voice has the emotion of Ed Vedder and Robert Plant packed into one, but also retains a gentleness that soothes the soul. The southern-influence reminds you of great bands like Synyrd and the Alman Bro's of the 70's, but they still have their own unique and powerful sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another good example that rock is back...","review":"This is one of the best new albums I've heard in a long time. I bought it because it satisfied my \\"two good song\\" rule: Any band can come up with a one-hit wonder, but a CD with TWO good songs on it is worth purchasing. And so, after hearing \\"Free\\" and \\"Meet Virginia\\" on the radio, and decided that Train was worth a try. Plus, I had seen them in concert with Ben Folds Five and had been quite impressed with their live show. Well, the rest of the CD doesn't disappoint. My suspicions that they have an affinity for the Allman Brothers (an affinity which this homesick Southern boy shares, by the way) were proven correct by the CD. Nothing like a little bit of guitar-driven rock to shake me out of my MTV-induced doldrums. Couple that with inspired lyric-writing and lead singer Patrick Monahan's sublime vocal stylings and you've got an album that will keep me listening for a long time. Train's self-titled debut is a worthy buy for any true rock-and-roll fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this album and Free is my favorite song.","review":"I love Train. This band deserves a shot at the big time. I wish I could find a website about them. Does anyone know where I could.

I hope Trian makes it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is an okay album.","review":"This album is (once again) a okay album. This is the first album from Train's collection. It has their breakthrough song \\"Meet Virginia\\" on it. The other songs are okay and they're not that great really. I hope that you enjoy it though. I'm sorry if I offend you if I say that I never listen to this cd and that I probably shouldn't be writting this review, cause I haven't even listened to every single second of this album. I don't think I listened to #11 song \\"Swaying\\". I don't think I listened to #10 either.

Whether by time or content or subject. I guess it really wasn't organized at all.Im sorry that I don't have a better book to recommend, but I can tell you to save your time on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pick something else!","review":"The author divides the book in several short sections (e.g. history of major events, history of philosophical ideas, history of wars, etc). As a result, everything is so cramped and fragmented that it's impossible to get the big picture. E.g. the actual 'history of major events' section has aprox. 100 pages - way to little to summarize thousands of years of world history.Obviously, everything is relative, but I would have failed the exam I bough it for had I relied only on this material. History is whole, a mixtum compositum, of religious, military, philosophical etc ideas and events - not a series of separated and fragmented dots.Overall, a disappointing experience - and an unusual one, considering that most books in the \\"Dummies\\" series I used beforehand were simply great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Juvenile!","review":"This is a terrible book! The history parts are disjointed and badly arranged. The worst part of the book is the author's constantly referring to some movie on the historical topic at hand - and often the movies he mentions are junk movies. With so little space to cover world history, I can't believe he would waste so much on old Kirk Douglas movies, for instance!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Superficial at best","review":"If you are someone who is interested in their personal education and wants to know the basic fundmanetals of world history, I would NOT reccomend this.This book seems to have been written for the purpose of giving someone who is in a college history course just enough superficial knowledge to feign comprehensions on exams.The book is not written in chronological order, instead it has many topics and just writes about different eras of history in regards to those topics. Essentially, its just a fact book, with silly jokes in it, intended for people who are not interested in history, but still not engaging enough to even hold their attention. There is a difference between memorizing facts and understanding ideas, which this book does not seem to grasp.If you are over 18, likely, this book is too childish for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insulting to Dummies","review":"This book is an affront to Dummies. It is also below the standard set by the For Dummies series (Estate Planning for Dummies is excellent). A Dummy would be better advised to get a used copy of a world history textbook, for less money, and just read the table of contents. It's difficult to imagine who Haugen's target reader is, since even Dummies have choices."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book..but does'nt cover different styles","review":"Like the other reviews, this book is great. It has beautiful pictures and very informative instructions but it really only covers ONE style. Telemark. And it slightly covers Hallingdal style.

There is simply not enough of it here folks - And you would think this being the unrated version would contain enough of it to keep you satisfied.....The only scene worth viewing is within the first 10 minutes with Julia Strain, but even that is too silly to be considered sexy or erotic. I will say this though - Shannon Tweed looks really GREAT in that black outfit (NOT the nun outfit, either). There is just not enough skin for the males out there. Miss Brooks is not all that pleasing, either.

The producers put tall former Playmate Of The Year/B-Movie star Shannon Tweed (good girl) and tall former Penthouse Pet of The Year/B-Movie star Julie Strain (bad girl) together in a western setup, and somehow fail to exploit this casting coup. Next to no face-to-face rivalry between these two, and at times Tweed and Strain seem to be playing in two different films, shooting on two separate sets. The two might have been paired in a sexy girl/girl scene, or certainly set against each other in a catfight parody of the Old West showdown. But neither possibility is explored--- haven't the producers learned the true meaning of the word \\"Exploitation\\"?? Film is competently made, but has no real raunchiness or gusto to its concept. A golden opportunity wasted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shoot Them All ... But Start with the Director","review":"...I really wanted to like this film.

I do like the story background set in the old Western and I am glad at least they tried to have a plot in the movie. Don't expect a lot of explicit nudities even though the film features Shannon and Julie. The love scenes are quite tame.

From her detailed accounts and character descriptions, you will get to know Shay as well as the people she came in contact with as if you were right there with her. It reads like a Judy Bloom book, but with an obviously different subject matter. There are many funny, interesting, and sometimes even sad and brutally real accounts of strip club life through the eyes of this real life stripper.

This book is far more organized than my college textbooks and so much cheaper. I've had so much anxiety watching my peers fly through the course effortlessly.

I made it to the middle of chapter three and decided to buy another resource. The information is presented in an illogical order (new vocabulary after you are asked to use it) and to make matters worse words are thrown in to the exercises that have not been introduced. That would be OK but the book's format does not make searching for the mystery words easy. Also, in some exercises words are introduced incidentally as an after thought and after you need to know them. My suggestion? Introduce vocabulary FIRST that is needed in the chapter exercises and lessons. Add more reference lists that can easily be accessed as students are trying to commit to memory the principles being taught."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spells it out nicely!","review":"I took about a year of German in junior high and didn't really remember anything but a few swear words!This book really helps at a beginners level to really spell out the hows and whys of the language.Out of the 3 German books I purchased this is my favorite."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great beginner guide","review":"I won't write a long and overbearing review. The book is a great companion tool for learning the German language. I particularly enjoy how it debunks the myth that German is an impossible language to learn.This book cannot and will not get you to be fluent alone, but it makes a great secondary or reference source. It not only teaches you some vocabulary, but it really goes into the German grammar and syntax. I haven't used it for long, but I think it will be exactly what I wanted from it, a good auxiliary tool."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Comprehensive but poorly written book","review":"On the plus side, this book hits all the bases. The code examples are well chosen and concise. The information seems accurate and up to date.Unfortunately its something of a hodgepodege. The lead author does a poor job of organizing the book into a coherent whole.It refers in passing to concepts which are not covered until later in the book. If this were my first XML book, I think I would find these quite confusing. At the local Borders I spent some time looking through \\"Learning XML\\" by O'Reilly ( admittedly a less comprehensive and advanced book) and was struck by it s better, clearer the writeing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Explained Material","review":"This book suffers badly from two problems: multiple authors and padding. Padding makes some of the sections too \\"chatty\\", while paradoxically failing in providing a good explanation of the material. Multiple authors makes the quality of the content sections very variable. At best they are adequate, at worst appauling.Take the XML Schema chapter. Its painful to read, with complex examples badly explained and a more or less random list of individual features explained not very well. Understanding XML Schema by reading this chapter is like learning a foreign language by reading a dictionary.There are FAR better choices for XML coverage, such as the OReilly series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't enjoy it.","review":"I've only read a few books on the subject of philosophy so I'm definitely no expert, but this book was the most ridiculous I've read so far. While I embrace the possibility of a God and am not opposed to authors writing about why they do likewise I think its a bit irresponsible how much Tom Morris enforces his views on the matter in what is supposed to be an introduction to philosophy. Obviously the people reading this book won't have a strong knowledge on how philosophical arguments work (I don't), so it's not difficult to manipulate the reader into believing profound ideas with an elaborate train of thought that can be hard to keep up with.I could talk about how ridiculous his anecdote was about a psychic grandmother prophesying who he would marry and all the other bull**** I had to sift through to get a few gems, but then this would start to look more like a rant than a review.Toodles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Assumptions","review":"The author uses the reverse logic to decide which viewpoints he wants to drill into you over the course of 350 pages. He has conclusions he wants to \\"prove\\", and along the way he adopts whatever viewpoint will help him \\"prove\\" his beliefs later on. He just blindly assumes certain things must be true because they \\"feel\\" true, which is a horrible way to construct an objective introduction to philosophy. An awful disappointment of what could be a great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes, but","review":"I wanted a readable introduction to philosophy, and Morris provided that. The book was entertaining and informative and did not throw me, sink or swim, into some deep philosophical pool. I found the author to be fair in his presentation, leaving me to chart a sovereign course. So I recommend this book. But do not follow it up with the author's recent works. Something seems to have happened to Tom Morris on his way from Notre Dame to The Morris Institute for Human Values. Today he sounds more like a salesman than a professor."},{"rating":"2","title":"...but What is the Answer to the Question...","review":"The author discusses and explains the perennial question of philosophy from the point of view of an intelligent layman. It is issues based and doesn't attempt any historical perspective.The best thing about this book is that the author provides his answers to these perennial questions. He doesn't try the antiseptic \\"present each view as equally valid\\" approach. Instead, he tells us where he is comming from and why. I like this approach because, as a reader, his perspective serves as a reference point. Weather one accepts his view or not Tom does a good job of explaning why he believes what he does and what considerations are important. He also provides the oposing viewpoint. Philosophy for Dummies will not teach you the systems or ideas of the great philosophers. However, if your goal is to understand the issues and formulate your answers, this book is one of the best!"},{"rating":"2","title":"No dummy","review":"This book is not what I expected from a work entitled \\"Philosophy for Dummies\\". In fact, I'm not sure what I expected but this warm, passionate, humorous and personal examination of philosophy caught me by surprise and rapidly drew me in. It is a real winner. The negative reaction of a minority of previous reviewers is not unexpected however. The author makes no attempt to hide his own position: a convinced and convincing theism. His \\"bias\\" obviously upsets some atheists but I would much rather read this passionate and \\"friendly\\" introduction to life's big questions than some dry tome that pretends to fairness but whose heart is a heart of darkness. Actually I think I do know what I expected from an introductory book on philosophy - cold, ivory tower intellectualism and word games - but what I got from this book was something much more envigorating, satisfying and hopeful.

There were several times when I actually laughed out loud as he baldly dismisses any argument that incorporates atheism as a world view of \\"what's the point?\\". I don't like it when an author inserts his religiously biased view point into what is supposed to be an overview text. No thanks."},{"rating":"1","title":"unbelievably biased writing","review":"Anyone with any real philosophy background will imediately see the bias Morris has that gets in the way of an objective analysis of philisophical issures. (But what do you expect when you have a 16 year professor of Notre Dame write a \\"philosopy book\\")? This book should be called \\"the catholic worldview, with some extra stuff\\". I am normally happy with \\"dummies\\" books but this one is very dissapointing. Morris's bias reaks on almost every page, with his usage of quotes, \\"great idea\\" marks, and poorly covered topics.If you really want an objective analysis of philosophical issues, dont buy this. If you are a christian who wants to reinfoce your worldview, this will help."},{"rating":"1","title":"Theology According to Morris","review":"I checked this book out of the library hoping to get a primer on the Philosophy courses I never took in college. This book starts out innocently enough but goes on to subject the reader to Morris' view on theology. The goal of the book appears to be to convert the reader to Christianity. If you aren't a believer your life has no meaning. Shame on you Tom Morris!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Author is Biased","review":"I agree with several other reviewers that this book greatly reflects the author bias. I don't think this is appropriate for an Introduction to Philosophy book. I guess I was able to pick up on the author's bias because I have done other reading on the subject, this may not happen with someone who is truly looking for an introduction. \\"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Philosophy\\" is much better (and more scholarly while remaining readable) than this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weird ideas don't add up to philosophy","review":"Tom Morris has a nice easy style, but my! This book is full of nonsense. I'm not really impressed to hear that he thinks he speaks to angels, and that they predicted one day he would be a great philosopher (they were wrong...) I don't even spend my whole life worrying about whether or not there is a heaven and if so, how do I get in - and so I'm not really interested to read about the his 'new' theory about the 'conservation of belief' - which shows that 'in fact' it is sensible to believe in God. I don't care about this stuff because none of it is what I'd call philosophy. Fortunately, just as I was losing faith in the Dummies series, someone showed me the UK version, which is both fun AND about philosophy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Subjective and Offfensive","review":"Although you will find some very insightful ideas and quotes in this book, it is really the story of how Tom Morris views the world and its greatest thinkers. Morris subtly tries to guide the reader to a certain opinion and explain why all the differing opinions lack merit. Some may find that this book affirms the beliefs that they already have. Others may be offended because Morris does not forgive those who have opinions that are different than his own. I fully expected to not agree with Morris on some subjects, but I was offended by his attempts to mask his objectives in writing the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Philosophy For Cattle","review":"The \\"Argument From Desire\\" is the most feeble defense of theism that I have ever encountered. And yet Thomas Morris presents it as if it were an important cornerstone of theistic thought - awarding it with one of those little \\"important idea\\" markers they use in the Dummies book series. Meanwhile, he gives atheism and its arguments no more than a cursory, heavily biased glance.Let me be clear. I am an atheist. My viewpoint could be wrong, of course. But the LEAST I expect from an introductory book on philosophy is an HONEST presentation of ALL points of view - addressing views the author disagrees with fairly, and admitting to the limitations of arguments on their own side where necessary.If you want your introduction to philosophy in the form of a biased indoctrination to Christian theism, then this is the book for you. On the other hand, if you prefer to hear all sides and form your own conclusions, you had best look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Christian Propaganda","review":"This book is thinly disguised Christian propaganda. It presents a lopsided view of philosophical views with the intent of convincing the hypothetical newcomer that christian ideas are prevalent and dominant in philosophy. Any argument that disagrees is presented as a strawman and then dismissed.If the book was open about its agenda to began with, this wouldn't be a problem, but it sneakily presents itself as an objective introduction, which makes it subversive and blatantly dishonest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Real information but biased - kindle edition poor","review":"I don't need to add to what has already been said in other comments about the author's heavy handed biases in this book. While I agree with many of the author's positions, that's not the point in an intro to philosophy. I feel disillusioned with the Dummies people for letting something like this get published under their name.My real frustration is with the low quality of the kindle version. Someone seriously needs to go through this edition and fix the fact that the main text and side captions are run together.In short, a total ripoff. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Probably a good book...","review":"The book never showed up. They just refunded my $ and told me to keep the book as their gift when it got delivered. A gift that doesnt exist? Gee thanks. I've made hundreds of purchases on Amazon and Ebay and have never had a product just not show up. Everybody makes mistakes but their was no attempt on their part to satisfy the customer. Thats why they just lost this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slanted toward Judo-Christian beliefs.","review":"This book isn't a summary or even an introduction to all philosophies, only ones that seem to compliment Judo-Christian faiths. If less pages were spent debating only two types of western beliefs, there would have been plenty of room for several other belief systems to be mentioned, and then the book would have been a more useful resource."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slanted toward western beliefs.","review":"It provides a very conservative view of what faiths offer happiness and kind ethics. Significant weight is put upon debates that provide limited options.While praising the many benefits of following a god, the book fails to cover the countless negative attributes that allow individuals to justify witch hunts, mass suicides, genocide, bigotry, child neglect, etc. God whorshiping is not the only \\"package\\" that offers \\"life after death\\", \\"free will\\", \\"love toward all people\\" and peace on earth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too religious.","review":"It's clear where this author's beliefs lie. An introductory book should have less bias."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst books I've ever read.","review":"I thought it was incredibly unprofessional the way the Dr. Morris promoted his own philosophy rather than objectively giving an unbiased introduction to philosophy. This book was a terrible investment and other people would be much better served by reading a different selection. Dr. Morris makes his bias very clear."},{"rating":"1","title":"I do not recommend this book.","review":"Tom is a smart man, and capable of writing a good introductory to philosophy book. He just chose not to. The only thing this book is really good for is listing off the names of some of the different philosophical beliefs. I imagine he turned this book into a simplified version of some of his other books, and he promotes some of his other books at different times in Philosophy for Dummies.Parts of this book are offensive because in Tom's eyes you are irrational for not believing everything he does, even when he doesn't offer a particularly strong argument why you should believe him. He tries to steer the reader in his direction the whole time instead of giving you a fuller understanding of the philosophers. I strongly don't recommend this book. You would be much better off just purchasing a used philosophy 101 text."},{"rating":"1","title":"Philosophy it aint","review":"This is a well presented book in an enjoyable format but it is not a general philosophy book. The author spends a large amount of time proving the existence of god. While he is entitled to his opinion on that subject he sneaks up on people who think they are getting a general introduction to philosophy but are actually getting \\"How to prove god exists in the coffee shop.\\" This is of course excellent fun for the non-theists for there is nothing like proving something you think is total hog-wash. In the hands of theists however it becomes a Gollum-like struggle for the ring.Lots of other good general introductions to philosophy out there. Tom give up philosophy and become a minister."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insulting and self serving","review":"I won't go into much detail beyond saying that the author attempts to frame important questions in a scientific manner and doesn't use scientific criteria to evaluate them, nor does he reach any conclusions that are practical.

This book is not for geniuses nor for \\"dummies\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"One-sided view of the world!","review":"This book ignores philosophies like Buddhism, Taoism, and Confucius, which over 40% of the planet have followed. It's true that the book pretends that no such eastern philosophies exist. The common dictionary offers better coverage. A book I recently finished, Understanding Einstein, goes into greater detail covering the many philosophies the world has to offer. Readers need to go to books like The Art of Happiness to find what this book clearly overlooked. Voltaire's Philosophical Dictionary also offers great insights into the every-changing views of philosophy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Plain Bad Presentation","review":"If I had a penny for every straw man, i.e. an argument intentionally presented in a poor light, knocked down in this book, then I would have gotten back the money I spent on it.It doesn't bother me that Morris wrote a book that presents his own philosophy. It doesn't even bother me that he is no good at presenting a viewpoint he doesn't agree with. What bothers me is that the book is supposed to be a crash-course in general philosophy, and what Morris gives is just his own beliefs.I found the arguments for and against God's existence to be of a particularly poor quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Philosophy for Dummies","review":"I need this for school, and its perfect.

I have found them to be a clear, neutral and unbiased reference sources, particularly when I am new to a subject. Unfortunately, this is not true of Philosophy for Dummies. This book is highly biased and should have been entitled Manipulative Evangelical Catholic Philosophy for Unsuspecting Dummies. This is a very sneaky book whose true intention, namely to prove to you that God exists and that you should believe in God, doesn't really become apparent until you are about halfway through the bookTo do a quick, objective comparison I also purchased the Complete Idiot's Guide to Philosophy. What a difference! Not as well written but a truly objective overview of the major lines of philosophy.

A nice philosophy for someone who can't put his hand on God but wants to real badly. As for his 'Principal of belief conservation', a ship cannot sail, Mr. Morris, if it is anchored in the same old harbor.You can find things worth exploring in this book but Philosophy 101 it is not.

I have not yet sold anything on eBay but plan to soon. (I have bought a few things though!) I think SellNow will make it easy to create a great seller's page. I like the way it keeps track of everything you've ever sold and will print out mailing labels, invoices and lists.Again, I have yet to sell anything and am not familiar with the actual eBay set up for posting an item so I won't compare the two yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rip off","review":"Anyone advertising this privately-published government grant report is probably trying to sell a copy stolen from a library.- James A.

To the shock of anyone who relies on major media or public education for their opinions on the Republican party, this turn of the 20th century recount is an eye opener. The Republican Party was formed over a single issue: abolition of slavery. In 1860 the party got it right with the nomination and election of Lincoln. In 1861 with The Emancipation Proclamation they got it right again. And again in 1865 over vehement northern Democrat opposition, they got it right with the 13th Amendment in abolishing slavery (The South was a given opposition but could not vote as they had seceded).The book is a very interesting read, written when the history was fresh on the mind of its author (George Washington Platt).

It was a slippery slop down with her other books and this one was really the topping on the cake.I couldn't even read the whole book. I gave up about chapter 6 and skipped to the end. I just kept hoping the story would get better but it didn't. I am disappointed I wasted money as well as time on this. The female lead was mainly the reason I couldn't force myself to read. She is ridiculous and weeps over everything. She knows the guy a few days, meets his son and is in tears because the son doesn't like her? She acts like a child instead of a 37 year old women.

I like my main characters to be so strongly developed it's like they're right here when i read. And i get sick of the wimpy \\"i need my man to save my butt\\" attitude of the females as well.

I was disappointed and maybe in the future if I find myself extremely bored I'll try reading it again -- but I don't hold my breath. The problem? I couldn't connect with the heroine.

The story sounded funny - writer travels to England for a writer's conference and falls for a Scot. However, from the beginning, the main character was just plain annoying. For the majority of the story, she whined. It was all about her. Even when verbally attacked by various characters, she had very little back-bone. I forced myself through the first half of the book and then just skipped to the last few chapters. The book was just dragging and I wanted to finish it.

This book helps to clarify the gist of textual deconstruction and Derrida's implicit political motives. I've come to the conclusion that much of the 'barrier' to understanding Derrida has to do with problems in his (anti-)philosophy, which come to light, for instance, by comparing his work with that of Deleuze who also develops a \\"philosophy of difference,\\" yet without avoiding the question of substance which contemporary thought must address anew. I had read other 'introducing..' type books, but most of them simplify the material too much. For the dillegent, focused reader, this book yields a good middle way to comprehension between Derrida's daunting original texts and other introductory books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Iconic","review":"Only one or two decent, yet massively corny tunes...BUT...this was, and remains a cultural \\"straddle\\" and iconic album.

He returned to what he did best. Concord let him play what HE wanted.This is the upbeat half of a live concert. (CD \\"Spring is Here\\" contains the ballads and swing songs half, although the songs are more evenly divided than on The other excellent Concord live releases \\"Pure Getz\\" and \\"Blue Sky\\").A state-of-the-art recording, an excellent side group.

Namely, what was the retaliation against the Porn King (Tom Arnold), and how did the two-fingered guy get the guy from X-files out of the burning building - and why was this never mentioned! Did they just not have time to deal with those two situations? The story is getting a little convoluted now. Way to many things going on.

Each season just kept getting better and better and I have recommended the show to family and friends. Oh, and by the way, Jax Teller is hot and Jemma can do no wrong in my book. Way to show a strong woman who believes in protecting her family. The only thing that scares me about this show is my weird attraction to Tigger who is a total freak!!!

Then I ordered it again. Not only was disk four all black (as in blank) but it would not eject from my player. I tried to play it on two DVD players and had the same result. The seller is fully responsible for sending out these faulty DVD'S. Once again I will be sending this set back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Show EVER","review":"This is an awesome show. It has action, drama, emotional connection and some HOT actors/actresses. For the people that think this show is about violence and crime only, obviously they have not watched the seasons consecutively. Yes there is violence (a lot of it) and profanity, sex, drugs basically all of the stuff that is in the real world now. But mainly its about a guy who loves the \\"family\\" feeling and the closeness of friends (his club) but is looking for a lifestyle away from the drugs and violence. Protecting his family and his club is all that Jax cares about. You will love season 3 but I strongly suggest that you watch season 1 & 2 first. You will be hooked and just as excited as I am for the 4th season to come out this fall!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So Unreal","review":"We just finished Season 3. I have to say this must be the most over rated series on TV. What's up with all the hugging and kissing ? One goes to the washroom and comes back.

It was ok, but not great. Overall, my big issue is that the set I got takes literally about half an hour to load on our blu-ray player.

I have a cursory knowledge of LEAPS and have employed them in the past, but I decided a refresher course was in order both to reacquaint me with basic LEAPS concepts and to inform me of any relevant info about current LEAPS offerings. THE LEAPS STRATEGIST failed on both counts.This book was written for readers who already understand LEAPS fundamentals and are interested in their use in, I will say, sophisticated applications that far exceed my objectives.

I have read other books where almost 100 pages are devoted to this strategy alone.The author is also flat out wrong about one thing:Page 251....\\"Many index options, however, are traded using the European Style rules.

I had a C-Section and tried breast feeding with the Boppy. Holy Cow was it painful. The last thing I wanted was anything up against my belly. Then once I stopped breast feeding I found my husband's recliner and a pillow from my sofa propper under my arm worked a lot better, plus I don't have some goofy pillow that doesn't match my sofa laying around.

I tried many solutions but in the end, this one worked for us. I use two at night and only have occassional leaks (mostly because of where I might place the pads if there is leakage). Otherwise we have dry nights.I tried Poise pads and feminie pads. They are designed NOT to leak so it would not overflow into the diaper. With these pads you get the diaper absorbency AND the pads.

Thomas Jefferson is referred to as \\"Jeffie\\" and true to form, hack Orloff outright lies about Jefferson's supposed fathering of children with slave Sally Hemings, propping up her opinion as fact when all available DNA evidence only suggests Thomas was but one of 25 possible candidates.A Founding Father deserves better than this and so do readers.

Its great for a child who is fascinated by dinosaurs,"},{"rating":"2","title":"Change of Opinion","review":"Initially, I purchased this book and was very unhappy with the choice of pictures. I think many of the horses look like they are fighting. BUT, I saw Kyra in person and she was excellent; very soft and gentle handling of the horses. No yanking or cranking. She insisted on more relaxed necks. So, I decided to give the book another chance and I am glad I did. Kyra gives really excellent descriptions and techniques that you can use right away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clearly the best book on dressage in a long time","review":"Kyra writes as clearly as she teaches and rides. Her explanations are logical and simple, but not simplistic! This is a great aid for understanding dressage and the perspective of the horse."},{"rating":"1","title":"overrated","review":"I have read 'Dressur Med Kyra' (in both Danish and Swedish). I doubt this translation will improve upon it. Clearly - I have been told -- Kyra is an excellent instructor. This book (written together with a colleague of Kyra) is more of a showcase thing. I'd stick with Podhasky, la Guérinière, or Müseler (if you can get a hold of a copy). Most dressage and horsemanship (some arguably so) books at ... are getting the 4-5 star treatment. Every book has its fans. This rating, though, would be very misleading regarding Kyras book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Core book for your riding collection","review":"This was recomened by my Instuctor.I have always enjoyed articles about her clinics and demostations,I'm also a Show jump rider so the princles are not the dutch fashionable ones.

In my opinion, he abused his readership just because he had a successful novel in Lonesome Dove. He is a very negative person and offers nothing of positive influence in A Narrow Grave or any of his other publishings except Lonesome Dove. Larry McMurtry is prejudiced to all people from the south just because one southerner \\"offended\\" him. I reget wasting my money on any of his other \\"works\\". He reminds me of Steinbeck.

The story is set in the 1970s, during the police crackdown after the Soweto riots. The \\"hero\\" is a mild-mannered Afrikaner schoolteacher who wakes up to the real conditions in South Africa when his school's black gardener dies in police custody. The teacher sets out to investigate the death, only to draw the attention of the police and the ire of his family and colleagues, who don't understand why he wants to \\"cause trouble.\\" The book brilliantly links the personal and the political, but it isn't merely a \\"political\\" novel. Rather, it's a close examination of what it means to see the world through the lens of an aroused conscience. As such, \\"A Dry White Season\\" is a rarity -- a page-turner that grips the reader while also making him think hard about personal accountability in the face of injustice and corrupt institutions. Fans of Graham Greene will love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad message for children","review":"This book is a collection of inscriptions collected from children, only there are some really nasty and mean ones included! I don't know what the authors were thinking but this is NOT a book for any children who aim to be peaceful and accepting individuals.Kids sometimes write mean things to each other; kids will be kids....but for two adults to collect and publish some of these nasty insults gives children a message that not only is it OK, but it's worthwhile. For instance: \\"You remind me of London - always in a fog!\\" Or, \\"girls faults are many, boys have only two - everything they say and everythign they do.\\" Just a sample, some are even worse.

Well, I see 5 hikes in the South Coast Range, 18 south of Lake Tahoe and 29 in the Southern Sierra Nevada! The southern-most hike is just a stones throw from Bakersfield.

Dianne Reeves may have the best voice in jazz today, but in this CD every song is over produced, arranged, and most sadly, oversung. Anyone who has listened to Ms. Reeves sing knows she has great vocal ability, but it feels like this is an attempt to see how stylized and how much vocal gymnastics she can wow us with. From the original songs (which are awful and should never be a part of the best of, to the couple of standards which again are over arranged (and over the top with vocalization), this CD was totally disapointing. You want to hear the best of Diane Reeves, get the soundtract to \\"Good Night and Good Luck\\" as this is truley an artist at the top of her vocal game with great arrangments of wonderful songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Anita Baker of the jazz world","review":"One of the most brilliant female jazz singers to emerge in the second half of the 20th century, Dianne Reeves touches on everything from contemporary vocal jazz to quiet storm soul to covering some of the great jazz chanteuses of years past. Best known for the tender 1987 jazz-soul ballad \\"Better Days\\" which has affectionately come to be known as \\"The Grandma Song\\". She's probably at her strongest when she stays contemporary, but her extraordinary singing talent can still do some of the old masters proud."},{"rating":"2","title":"good music","review":"It's a really good cd ,I only purchased the cd for one song, Better Days.

Yes, I understand artists want to do their songs differently after many years, but sometimes it just doesn't work. The music on this CD is too spacey and her voice is incredibly annoying. I found myself skipping over track after track. ELI is still her best work as both a songwriter and recording artist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"The book is a plea for a more inclusive democracy.

My wife and I took our two sons (age 6 and 4) at the time, and they absolutely loved it. Guess what, so did the other kids. As a parent it was silly, though not as stupid as say Sponge-Bob, but it was appropriate. There really wasn't anything in the movie that a young child shouldn't see. And no, I don't let my kids watch Transformers or Lord of the Rings at this age. They threw in a little religion in there, but in a non-forceful way, and with no real denomination.

His one year quest to learn more about this subject is very illuminating. I agree with many of the assertions and conclusions. For example, I was a fencer in College Varsity and I definitely agree with the fact that there is a distinct advantage in some sports for a left hander.

I own all of the seasons, but this one I just had to get out of my house. The quality was equivalent to DVD resolution, it wasn't sharp at all. Ari's character seems more mean than sarcastic and they even made Eric sound like Ari. Not for anything but there can only be one Ari Gold. This season pretty much set up future seasons of Entourage, but it could have been a little more dynamic. Eric finds himself struggling to get in Sloane's pants all season and also find's himself caught up with some little barely legal chick. I have to also say that the whole crew including Ari are not aging well at all. The previous seasons of Entourage have been pretty original and maybe they set the bar a little to high, but for now I have to say you maybe very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bugles and a Tiger","review":"A wonderful account of life in a Ghurka regiment, personal and lots of attention to detail, the reader is drawn to the authors authentic and colorful approach.

As a convert from Lutheran to Catholic I bought this book to learn more about the change I'd made. After reading this I was firmly convinced I made the best decison one could make in a lifetime. If your a Protestant you owe it to yourself to understand your own history. And and accurate, full history, not a jaded one presented by most Protestant historians. As I was, you've been lead down the very destructive path of living a realitive life, one where your soul has been improperly seperated from the Church. Belloc clearly shows how Protestantism has lead to Industrial Capitalism and also the very destructive modern way of living a life based on Realitivism according the the structure presented by the Frenchman John Calvin. The Reformation was clearly destructive to the unity that Christianty had invested 1,500 years in building."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book....very insightful","review":"Belloc, an English historian, is known for his views on Western civilization. Catholicism has played a HUGE part in forming culture and morals in the West. No one can argue that. However, many will shy away from the ideas presented in this particular work because it presents an uncomfortable theory: with the disruption and shattering of Christian unity came a disruption and shattering of Western civilization. This disruption did not occur at one time. Rather, it happened with each of the major heresies - each one attacking one facet of Christian - and therefore Western - civilization.I think this book is a great counter to the historical revisionism occurring in our age."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally some answers!","review":"My sixteen year old daughter was diagnosed with bipolar four years ago and this book has been a godsend. Great thing is that it doesn't seem to be geared towards one particular age group and that anyone with bipolar or has a loved one with it can find this book helpful. Not only does it explain the chemical aspects of bipolar but talks about it in a way that finally makes sense. Something that years of psychiatrists and therapists has not been able to do. It really helped take the stigma away that my daughter had built up in her mind, that shes not a crazy freak. It made her realize that its something that even though it will never go away that with some effort it can be treated in a way that she can live a somewhat normal life. It addresses everything from meds, school, work and everyday life to how their loved ones can help them and how to deal with both spectrums of bipolar."},{"rating":"1","title":"definitely not a great one--more for family members","review":"While this book does explain some about the differences in bipolar disorders and what they feel like, I feel this book was more made for family members to explain to them how WE feel with the disorder.

As for suspense, I think we can all infer what happens throughout the novel in the first 50 pages of the book, but its the emotion and tenderness, not events, that Anita Shreve always instills in her books that makes them worth reading. As with any of her storys, you become entwined with the characters, feeling their hurt, feeling their betrayal.And as with any good book, Shreve ends her stories leaving you with more questions than answers."},{"rating":"2","title":"intriguing","review":"Domestic violence stories are so difficult to read. Anita Shreve is such an outstanding writer, and she presented Maureen/Mary's plight in a wonderfully compassionate manner. I was on the edge of my seat reading the events as they unfolded and was saddened that Mary didn't receive the justice that she deserved. I think had this been in current times instead of the 1970's, the outcome would have been different. An excellent, thought-provoking novel from one of the best authors of our time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Read!","review":"I took this book to read on vacation. Once I started it, I couldn't put it down, and ended up without anything to read the last couple of days! I loved the way it was told from different perspectives-the journalist and the people she interviewed for her story. It is extremely well written, but very troublesome. The topic of spousal abuse is handled very differently, as told from a 1970's viewpoint. It is amazing (but true) how people \\"looked the other way\\", whether they really knew what was going on or not. There were even some characters who thought \\"she asked for it\\"! It is haunting because you expect the journalist, a female, to be more supportive in her article, but is she unsympathetic, or trying to get readers?

I can't even write a decent review of the movie itself because the subtitle is white and whenever there is a light background in the scene, you basically stop following the dialogue.

From the description, you think it might be a little bit funny.Instead, this film features four senseless murders, an aimlessly wandering plot, boring conversation, and a brutal raping that is no picnic to watch. Where is the clever dialogue? Where is the entertainment value? And if no entertainment value is to be found, did I learn anything from watching this movie ? I learned that I should have gotten another video.Don't waste your money or your time. Get something else.

A superficial examination of the play reveals it to be a self-rightoues lesson in grammar. But a deeper inspection shows it tobe a toungue in cheek comedy (albeit a critical one) that reveals much about the British society of the time (particularly linguistically speaking). Henry Higgin's unabashed condescending attitude provide many laughs while Eliza's emotion filled responses are also humorous and no less insightful. The prolougue although irritating to most, gives the play a unique voice and the epilogue although considered by many to be a literary fallacy says true to Shaw's style. I have only one complaint about this book that I can rant on about to no end, that fact that he say's English is the language of the Bible. Is English the lanuguage of Crime and Punishment or Metamorphosis because it was translated in English? Please, don't insult us. But aside from that it is a Brilliant play!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Pygmalion was wonderful, but Major Barbara...?","review":"This was, all in all, a charming little book. I loved the Pygmalion and the manipulative male lead, Professor Higgins. Major Barbara, on the other hand, was as boring as could be. The preface? Don't even bother reading. It was absolute boredom, and completely unaffective on the reading of Major Barbara. The Pygmalion, while I did not particularly enjoy the epilogue (I'm a romantic), was very clever and yes, probably the real aspect of how things turn out. So, all being said, read the book! It is a delightful little sample of Shaw's work."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Man With No Identity","review":"OAS forces were dwindiling after the failed attempts on the head of the President of France. They had all failed and opptions were slim. The final one was assasination. Only one man could do it. He was only known underthe alis of Clark Duncan. He stole passports, killed five men, and made the smallest longrange gun ever created. I have thought a long time about the question \\" do you recomend this book\\". Ive come up with the answer yes and no. The reason is, that there is a lot of French and technical terms that make the book go a little slower than any other than I have read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely worth reading!!","review":"Suspenseful, entertaining, a very good read. Forsyth, though, was a bit slow in caputuring the readers' interest but as the book progressed, the reader is taken in by the plot and suspense to find out what happens next. I must agree with some of the previous critics though. Although it was necessary to give the reader very little direct information about the Jackal in order to effectively portray his character, a little bit more subtle or implied information could have been hinted hear and there concerning his training and so forth. Aditionally, although the book was a good read, I felt dissapointed with its ending. My final questions were, \\"that's it ... is that all?\\" However, these final quesitons also attest to the book's powerful plot and its ability to keep the reader engrossed to the very end. In spite of a few shortcomings, it's an overall good read and I definitely recommend it. I must commend Forsyth."},{"rating":"2","title":"A superb suspense novel told by a true master.","review":"I loved this book. I read it many years ago and then re-read it more recently. Frederick Forsyth is a master. He portrays such interesting characters is such a sublime, eloquent manner. He builds suspense bit by bit in an incredibly analytical and seamless manner.Not only is the suspense so well developed, but so are the characters. You really get inside of their lives, especially the police inspector who methodically hunts down the assassin.His main character, Le Chacal, the assassin, is so controlled and so smooth. The assassin is a master of disguise and evasion, and perhaps the coldest man on earth. He is willing and able to kill to fulfill his mission - the assassination of Charles de Gaulle.Yes, Frederick Forsyth is a master. A master storyteller and a master suspense builder. This is a superbly well-written novel that will draw you in, making you read until the wee hours of the evening, or morning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not too bad","review":"This isn't a bad book, but it was slow in some places. I think it's kinda cool though that a modern-day movie (the Jackal with Bruce Willis) was based almost entirely on this book and what happens...I feel it's a testament to how good this book is that it could inspire such a powerful movie almost thirty years after its release. But as to the actual book, it's not too bad, though you can tell that this is a first novel. Expertly researched, and very moving at times. However...the ending was a little sudden...almost as if the author was in a hurry to end his wonderful novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forsyth's Best","review":"Forsyth wrote this book, supposedly, in about six weeks. It compares favorably to works that have taken months, or years, and is more compelling than most of le Carre's novels. The \\"Jackal\\" is on a methodical countdown the day he will assassinate de Gaulle, and the French authorities frantically attempt to find and stop him. The best aspect of the book is that one can see from both the perspectives - Commissaire Lebel's manhunt, and the Jackal's preparation and execution of his plan. Great thriller!"},{"rating":"2","title":"You won't be able to put it down--GUARANTEED!","review":"This is not great literature like \\"The Scarlet Letter\\" or \\"Brother's Karamazov\\" but it is the best at what it attempts to be--possibly the most suspenseful, can't-put-it-down thriller ever written. The tension is wound so tight that I actually HAD to put it down to collect myself and catch my breath. The guy who gave it one star is seriously delusional and bitter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Thriller!","review":"Don't know how I missed this one over the years. It's said to have invented the modern thriller, and I can see why. Even though some of it is now dated, and you know Charles DeGaulle was never assassinated, you can't put this book down. Some of Forsythe's long narrative passages would be considered too much by today's standards, but he does know how to flesh out his back story and his historical setting for his story.The Jackal character himself is one of the best villains I have ever read in any book. Cunning, skilled, ruthless, and yet with a code of ethics in dealing with his sources for the tools of his trade that make him a highly believable and well-rounded center of the book.Great piece of writing, great thrills and great suspense."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe I had the will to finish this.","review":"A few boring, shallow, stereotyped characters move through endless variations on a chase scenario. Everyone in the book either works toward his goal, or thinks about how best to accomplish it. Meanwhile they show absolutely no emotion. They might as well be robots. (Both main characters are described serveral times as \\"meticulous\\") And get this-- it's five hundred pages.Go ahead and tell me it's escapist fun and that anything as highbrow as character psychology doesn't matter, but if you think anything this repetetive and endless is \\"fun\\" or \\"thrilling,\\" you're probably just fooling yourself based on all the hype."},{"rating":"1","title":"Against the Laws of the Universe","review":"I started The Day of the Jackal with high hopes, and I was just making my way through the first chapter, trying to sort out the characters, when I came across this information: On August 22, 1961, dusk had fallen at 8:10 pm, but on August 22, 1962, dusk fell at 8:35 pm. Those 25 minutes were to change the history of France.\\" Maybe some physicist or astronomer out there can correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't that impossible? On the same day of the year, in the same location, wouldn't dusk fall within a few seconds of the time it fell the year previously? Since the failure of the assassination plot depended on this fact, and since I'm not normally interested in plots and chases and assassination attempts, I stopped reading the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply the best","review":"Researched over three years and written in 45 days over thirty years ago, this is still the best thriller I have ever read. I've seen its influences in so many books and films since. Forsyth, by way of a dead-pan and cold prose, maintains an air of mystery and callous efficiency in the assassin during the course of the book. Even now I don't really know what his real name was, or nationality \\"...rumour was that the man was an Englishman.\\" Rather like the detective on his trail I feel some admiration for the clinical would be assassin and a small part of me wanted him to succeed at the end. Whenever you read a good thriller always remember, if you haven't read this already, that there's a better one out there waiting for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better Then Average","review":"This is one of the author's better books. The story and the plot are great, so much so they have been used in any number of other books and movies. This is the original and the best. Sure there are a lot of people to keep track of but that does not take away from homing in on the main characters and keeping them straight. Overall the writing is good and the author spends a good deal of time on the main characters. This is worth the time to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Ultimate Assassin","review":"Its a story of one man working on one contract. After this job he will not need to work anymore. The price is high because the prize is huge--France. Its a cat-and-mouse game between the Jackal and the French Colonel Rolland as the Jackal plans the assassination and Rolland tries to stop him. But who is Rolland looking for? No one knows who the Jackal is. He has no partners, no connections, no name. This is the best novel I have ever read. EVER."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant !","review":"This book is a very good thriller. Even though written a while ago, it did not age. The atmosphere is very realistic and I have been amazed to see how well a foreign writer could describe the atmosphere of France in the 60's. So, another Forsyth to add on your list."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why Didn't I Read this Earlier?","review":"Every now and then I get a yen for a good page turner, a real pot boiler. An airport read, if you will. Day of the Jackal fits the bill, perfectly. The one probelm with this book is that it is almost impossible to put aside. Forsyth weaves a superb yarn from a historical context, namely French military disaffection with DeGaulle and a subsequent plot to kill him. The suspense generated is equal to any novel I've read. Make sure you have a few hours at a stretch to read this."},{"rating":"2","title":"truth not a story","review":"The attempt on the life of French President Charles de Gaule is not a fiction or story ;but a histrical fact; of course narrated by the author in an excellent way.Even the movie had not that much thrill as the book. chandramowleeswaran"},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good but not exceptional.","review":"I really didn't like this book all that much.

It fascinated me. How the assasin, the Jackal, had a high powered rifle custom built to fit in a fake crutch to attempt to kill DeGull. Nothing against France. He disassenbled it and then put it back together when he was ready to use it. The part at the end was cetrainly suspenseful to me. I was shiocked to find that the French intelligence used electrodes on the genitals to interrogate supsects in an assanation plot against the president.The end was cetainly a cliffhanger.

Of course, its got to be a conspiracy! Still, I'll give it two stars just for its humor factor. The tape is really kind of boring (when did Elvis become so pointlessly verbose?) but in the book, we find out all the details on the author's psychic abilities, the conspiracy that kept Gary Hart from becoming President, astrology, and just all sorts of things.

Her husband, Earl Morris, is the epitome of that era, dressing the part and doing the grunt work to preserve the buildings and walls, as well as removing the objects.

The film is filled with soulful characters in parallel with this world, cognizant of their situation yet uncertain of their fate. So much that it hurts, in a sweet way, to watch. I truely recommend this film to everyone, especially those who are not yet tired of humanity."},{"rating":"2","title":"History repeats it's self..only this time ..She exists.","review":"one of my all-time best movies ..a film that's worthy to watch over and over for it's richness in story , direction , acting and a wonderfull Sound track by Zbigniew Preisner that would certainly impact You..About the movie ,that paranormal atmosphere within the relationships of the characters in that movie gives it such an enigmatic feel with a surprising end ...for you'll figure out some how that it's a story about fate and history that almost repeats it's self..( a complex linking ) but this time..that gentle pretty young woman exists to change that history repeating it's self with her fate.................."},{"rating":"2","title":"KIESLOWSKI AT HIS VERY BEST....Très Charmante","review":"As with the other entries in the TRICOLORES trilogy, Kieslowski has given us another slice of his soul. One could easily leave off saying \\"I have seen the enemy, and he is me\\", for Kieslowski always gives us humanity at its most diverse. The common thread through all 3 films is mankind's devices for handling pain and anguish, and he allows us to make our own interpretations. Just as with BLEU, with Juliette Binoche, and BLANC, with Julie Delpy, Kieslowski has offered up another masterpeice in ROUGE with the truly beautiful and talented Irene Jacob. Of the three, RED is my personal favorite, on the weight of Jacob and Jean-Louis Trintignant as a character of central importance to the past and to Jacob's future; however, I strongly recommend all three, and in the Correct French order of Blue, White and Red."},{"rating":"2","title":"A masterpiece of unconventional storytelling ...","review":"Obviously this can never entertain your average Hollywood film goer, but for those who have aquired the taste for skillful film making in any genre will find 'Red' irresistably intriguing. The director uses color, composition and symbolism to achieve a visually accomplished film asking philisophic questions resulting in love and life affirming answers. Perhaps the best element of 'Red' is the subtle magic of recurrant and synchronistic events which result in healing broken hearts and fostering new passions. Irene Jacob is wistful and enchanting. Personally, I feel this film is a cinematic masterwork ranking up amongst 'M', 'Casablanca', 'Citizen Kane', and 'Evil Dead II'. One of the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life's circular procession","review":"Red is a film about life as an interwoven tapestry of beating hearts just missing each other at every turn.

I found this version to be quite enjoyable, not as good as the Edmond Gwenn version, no one plays Santa like Gwenn, but this was a neat little trip back in time when TV put on their own abbreviated version of classic movies. Lux Radio Theater in the days of radio put on their radio audio version of classic movies and in the '50's when TV came along Lux continued in the new medium with hour long versions made for TV of movies. This is vintage '50's TV at it's most fun, and is a real blast from the past.

It wasn't long before we realized that this is a 47 minute abridged version of the original classic. I purchased this movie from my Sony Bluray player and nowhere did it indicate in the description that this film is abridged, nor did any other version of the movie (other than the more recent remake) appear in the list of film options.

I'm pretty sure these guys know what they're talking about, but when it comes to talking about it they seem to have a problem. The text is choppy. The sample code is so disjointed that it's almost impossible to follow. In chapter 2, for instance, we run into something called the Contact Manager. This example uses a form with several menu items and buttons. Instead of descriptive names that'll let you understand what's going on without bringing up the program the buttons have names like \\"button1,\\" \\"button2,\\" etc. Names of the menu items are \\"menuItem2,\\" \\"menuItem3,\\" etc. Trying to learn something from this book while you're away from your computer is an exercise in futility.

Taking some examples: la dolce vita critizies italian high classes, ginger e fred does the same with tv people and fake lifes, satyricon attacks directly our society. e la nave va goes against opera singers and their world, but it doesnt end there. opera singers are like movie stars of the WWI. everything its fake, everything is a scenery, the ship is an opera show. and is as cold and superficial as the opera world (and cinema world, of course). Fellini is a genius. I think we can all forgive him for filming amarcord and watch every other movie again.

And don't get me wrong, there are other good Fellini's films too like Satyricon."},{"rating":"2","title":"A charmer.","review":"I love the poetic, dreamlike quality of this film, and the absolute sweetness of the whole concept. Doesn't always make linear sense, but it always makes emotional sense, and I suspect that was what Fellini intended. And Freddie Jones is simply perfect as Orlando, a gently clownish figure who is never allowed to become just a buffoon. Admittedly, I've had a crush on Mr. Jones, ever since seeing him in \\"The Bliss of Mrs Blossom\\" as a teenager, lo these many years ago. Can't help it, I'm a sucker for men who make me laugh...And be sure to make especial note of the opening sequence, which is mesmerizing.

Talib is an amazing artist and his verse compliments talib's very well, I cant say which one is better bc both are so amazing.

There's a whole chapter where the artist has drawn normal faces except everybody has a circle for a nose. Probably there's a point there, but it escapes me. Also, I'd rather have straight instruction than somebody trying to be cute and funny and failing miserably. That said, there are a few good points to the book, but I wouldn't buy it new and pay full price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starts off good, but then......","review":"Well, I really wanted to learn how to draw well, so I picked this up.

Of all the sources I used, I found this to be the least useful. I didn't feel this really helped me with useful techniques, nor did the examples given break down what they did enough to help me figure out -how- to draw them. \\"Figure Drawing for Dummies\\" is more useful, perhaps primarily because it had a tighter focus. This is not a book that goes far enough to be useful for the beginner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good Introductory Book on Drawing","review":"This is a good book about drawing, but it's not an excellent book. Yes, it says it's for dummies and sometimes I think I qualify, but I was expecting more examples. I was expecting to be held by the hand as we, the authors and I, worked through several drawings from start to finish.Still, I got out of the book. I learned quite a bit about composition and perspective. I like the fact that the book tells you to have a positive attitude and I like how I learned how to see lines and shapes, but did the book make an artist out of this dummy? No it did not. Did it teach me how to draw? Some. Did I learn a lot? Yes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Book","review":"This book is very in depth and covers a lot of subjects surrounding the subject of drawing. I do like that it has a section of how to draw on the computer, tips on how to draw cartoons, adding textures to hand drawn pieces, etc. The author covers a variety of techniques and gives a lot of good insight on how to discover your own personal style. The tips are very good on how to become a better artist by focusing on focal points & proportion. I definitely think this is a book that anyone can benefit from - you could be just getting started - this book would give you a lot of information, but if you take your time and read through all that it has to offer, it is well worth it. OR you may be like me, who has drawn for years, but I feel like there are some things I never mastered very well - for instance, I draw cartoons well, but not so much real objects or people. I like the material this book gives on each of those subjects. This is definitely an art class in a book - nicely done."},{"rating":"2","title":"its a good book","review":"this book covers the basics real well and of course it takes time, patience and discipline at getting said subject directly for details,etc.. this book covers some of the basics and its the real pencil and sketch way of drawing. this is the kind of book that to me would have been helpful back in the day when an art teacher was trying to explain a way of drawing a figure or object. this is a detail book and it will get you back in the groove of drawing if its been a while or ots a cool place to start if you are just starting out."},{"rating":"2","title":"love it","review":"it is a verry well writen book and I lirned alot from it .If you love painting or drawing it is a must have book ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good, very overlooked","review":"In yet another enjoyable performance, Macaulay Culkin plays an 11 year old kid who has not had that much quality time with his dad, who is an ex-con.

This book assumes you already have a lot of knowledge of Classical Latin and are able to jump in and move quickly through the material. If you already know Classical Latin and need a refresher, this would probably be a good book. If you're beginning your Classical Latin study, pass on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for beginners","review":"I'm having a terrible time with this book because it does not take a step by step approach. Within the first few pages the student is expected to master the first declension of each of the cases together, rather than mastering one case at a time. Though Latin is admitedly a complex language, beginning with information overload only serves to frustrate the learner. I would only recommend this book to someone who has already learned a fair amount of Latin and is looking to refresh their memory, but it's not a very good beginners' course."},{"rating":"1","title":"Synchronization Problems","review":"On the DVD edition, the voices are obviously out of synch with the mouth movements of the performers.

I decided to give it another chance, but didn't enjoy it any more this time. Although I realize it is a symbolic film, I still feel that Maltin's criticism, \\"heavy-handed\\", is very appropriate.Still, fans of Fellini will find this disc to be of interest, and you will be happy with the good picture quality (much nicer than the worn theater print I saw originally), and the fact that contrary to Amazon's description of \\"full-screen\\" format, the film is actually in letterbox format."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre and Pretentious","review":"Read Henry Miller and Louis Ferdinand Celine instead if you want to experience what a really good work of art looks and feels like.Fante try's but he rarely gets off the ground.

I tried on several occasions to read Fante in light of Bukowski's praise. Comparatively, the writing is less authentic, postured and less than marginally vivifying. The repetitive contrivance of any dialogue involving the main character (Arturo) becomes inherently annoying as he launches into bombastic phraseology where other characters are mere sounding boards. In short, stick to Buk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bandini rules","review":"This book contains several wonderfully memorable scenes, including the great battle against the crabs, the drowning of Bandini's women, Bandini's attempt to pile more than thirty boxes on a hand cart, and his sister's reaction to his silly novel.

I was tipped off to Fante by way of Bukowski, \\"[his] god.\\" Ask the Dust was all right, but I found this book to be very bad. No alternate meaning there, just plain BAD. Fante's narrating protagonist is super pompous and annoying throughout the entire thing. There were maybe one or two vaguely funny incidents, but aside from those, the novel is a painful BORE. If you want a taste for Fante, try Ask the Dust, which is similarly arrogant, but much milder.

Binchy provides plenty of life events to keep the reader's heart aching for Benny through all her success and failures (real and imagined). The story is like real life - unpredictable, predictable; misinterpreted events and betrayal (real and imagined). I enjoy reading about Ireland, and I grew up in a small town - so this book has everything for me. Life in the Irish village (and cities) is at once exotic, yet the themes of friendship and growing-up are familiar. This book stays on my bookshelf, so I can re-read it when I'm in the mood for ordinary life events, turned to angst through a compelling narrative."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seen the movie?

You get to watch Benny grow up from insecure chubby little girl to young adult with true inner strength.

The only reason I bought this book was because of seeing the book title mentioned on several messageboards (like every other post, dah!) Anyway, I was sadly disappointed as one might imagine. The story is boring, and the characters need to take some vitimans, maybe a B12 shot or something to put a little life back into them. Did I hear the word RETIRE!

If the batteries go bad, you have to do it all over again.It didn't even work at first, but Mr. Fix-It got it working. That lasted for about 2 weeks.

They are sparrows and other city birds and they are all around except on this bird feeder.

I thought the hockey theme was fine and i thought the dialogue was funny, but i just didn't feel for Theresa. I thought Michael was a nice guy and she just kept stringing him along. So i can see why he got mad at her for doing it. I thought he could have did better. I don't know if i want to read any of the other hockey books. Maybe i should read the first and see. I just didn't find this book all that romantic, i found that i was bored within chapter two and i skimmed the rest of the book just to get through it. I thought she had too many characters in the book and not enough of the main characters in order for their love to be believable.

That's not the case here. The first song Nervous Breakthrough gets the album off to a nice disco/dance sound. Ladyfingers has the good message of having warmth in the relationship when it is needed. Sexy Hypnotist is my favorite, with its unique guitars and middle-eastern sound. Devotion has Luscious Jackson trying some punk-rock, and they have the rock voices to pull it off. The interlude instrumental in Devotion is definitely one to check out! The hip-hop of Alien Lover is very clever. Friends is the perfect anthem for appreciating the meaning friends have in life. Gabby's voice is sounding better than before. The last song, Lover's Moon, has beautiful violin, and has an emotional depth not shown on the rest of the album. Not one song on this album sounds stale. It's a great buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ideal Road Trip CD!!!","review":"Wow!

It is almost impossible to get good historical fiction and Suttcliff is one of the few great authors in tha genre. I really care about the characters in this book. I can really identify with Marcus's feelings. Esca is extemely interesting, and Cottia is not the typical female back-up. As you read this book you will believe that the characters are real. Suttcliff really understands how human beings think and act. That sounds really stupid but it's true. Suttcliff cannot only do good character development, she can also do good descriptions that create a picture of the scene in your mind without becoming tedious.

It has detailed discriptions of roman provinces, plus an excellent plot. But the start was unbelivably boring. In fact the worst ten pages I have ever read were the first ten pages of that book! The rest was an excellent, you-can't-put-it-down book. It is undoubtedly one of the greatest adventure stories of our time, based on a real event. In 117 A.D., the ninth Roman legion went north to deal with a rising in one of the Celtic tribes and never came back.

Instead of being a Roman warstory it is about the unconvincing relationship between two men . Nothing much warlike happens and it does not really convince as a war story or anything else.

His father was a part of the ninth legion which disappeared many years before this due to mystifying circumstances, taking with it the legendary Eagle. When tragedy strikes, Marcus feels he must discover the truth of the situation: why they disappeared and where the Eagle ended up. This is a heartfelt story of honor, tragedy, and loyalty, ultimately resulting in many lessons learned and truths disclosed.I would recommend this book to anyone.

On first viewing, the ambiguous ending may suggest one interpretation; on the second viewing something else. For me, a third viewing uncovered meaningful Hitchcock homages I hadn't noticed before. (Although this isn't a \\"suspense\\" film, I thought I heard more than a faint echo of _Vertigo_.)A word to the subtitle-phobic (I count my self among you): fear not. This film is neither talky nor plot-driven. It communicates visually and aurally (great use of music and incidental sound).

She holds imaginary conversations with him and sets a place for him at the dinner table as if he were still alive. Yet there is still a margin of reasonable doubt about the husband's fate. Charlotte Rampling's portrayal of the increasingly unhinged Marie is excellent.

With superb lead actors, naturalistic lighting, and a sparse, rueful score, Kieslowski digs into the heart of the matter to defend an almost Platonic vision of l'amour. The relationship that develops between Magda and Tomek may be unconventional and even disturbing--Tomek's voyeurism has more than a hint of psychological obsession--but Kieslowski eventually grounds his story in Magda's emotional epiphany.

Just to see her, he does all sorts of things to interact with her and see her close up, because he loves her. Their interactions are not the usual love story, but a love story nonetheless.\\"A Short Film About Love\\" is an expanded version of one of the \\"Decalogue\\" episodes.

I have rereadthese accounts many times and will do so in the future. Unfortunately I cannot say the same about Neale's book\\"An Island to Oneself\\". I found it to be self indulgent and with a snob appeal I find distasteful at best. For south sea tales I recommend all of Frisbie's (and his daughter Johnny Frisbie) books.

I don't believe he ever raised his voice in this movie, acting very subdued throughout.There isn't as much action as you see in most modern-day horror movies but yet this is such an intense story that you don't lose interest.

Every cliche' they could dig up, from a male professor version of Maria Ouspenskaya (remember the old witch actress from all the old 40's B Horror movies?) who professes to not know much about werewolves, but tells Jack everything about werewolves, to fake looking contact lenses and bad hairy makeup.I only watched 'cause there was nothing else on and I needed a good laugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"a real dissapointment","review":"to be 100% honest with you, this movie stunk! i was really looking forward to it as a fan of both jack nicholson as well as this genre of movies in general. fact of the matter is, the script & storyline was weak. gave great acting talents very little to work with. the special effects were bad. the sole shining moment was jack whizzing on another fella's shoes, but even that is not worth suffering through such a monumental dissapointment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I want my star back","review":"The star selection thingy owes me one star, because I shouldn't have had to give this movie anything except this poor review.

For the love of...look, horror has to do with horrid and horrible. This is a movie that deals with the unfortunate. Unfortunately Jack's character is turning into a werewolf.

Then the new computer started blue screen crashing. Every time it did, I was using the memory card reader. I uninstalled it - no more crashes. Viking says that the fact that their equipment/drivers have not passed WHQL testing doesn't matter? It matters. This unit does perfect, very fast downloads of digital camera images.

However, I was happily surprised by its ease of installation it terms of drivers, and by the presence of a PCMCIA adapter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality Control Problem","review":"The first viking reader I received had a defective eject button. The second reader would read some PC cards but not others. The third reader refused to read a second card after the first was removed.

That's it!Once a SmartMedia card is inserted into the reader, it mounts on the desktop (Mac), just like a floppy, zip or any other storage device. This is super slick! To move the data, one simply drags and drops to a folder. But, it gets better: the data transfer is FAST! Wow! I copied a 4MB TIFF image from a SmartMedia card to a G3 in a blink of an eye.

All of my other hardware peripherals connected beautifully under XP. After spending time on the phone with Viking support, I was more frustrated than ever.

When I called Viking, they informed me that they did not advertise their unit as working with Windows ME -- obviously my mistake.

I bought this kit excited that I could use the adapter and just pump straight into the Playtex drop-ins.

You will NOT need to purchase two kits to begin with because Platex makes the pump AND this kit and the pieces all fit together...no adapter necessary. This will give you additional freezer storage capabilities, but only 4 liners at a time. (the reason for only 4 stars).

While some choices in tempi and the the seemingly inevitable build-up each tune receives are a bit \\"eclectic\\", it is what he does with voicings that hold my attention. There are some surprises for all in his use of the extreme low notes (hey, they're on the keyboard, so why not use them mentality).I'd recommend this recording for those that want to fill a room during a party.

Most have answered France. (Please see Stovall's excellent book.) However, many have suggested Brazil. This book is a collection of writings from African-Americans about their experiences in Brazil. It proves that we have the power to dream and to think globally. This book, in many ways, reflects Black American hopes rather than Brazilian realities. In fact, all the gushy writings from deceased, bourgeois, light-skinned, Black conservatives will rub most living progressives of color bonkers. Still, this was an important book. I read it for an African-American studies course on Brazil at Brown University. I am glad I had a chance to peep it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Out of date and abbreviated travel book","review":"I haven't even left for Shanghai yet and I know this book is a disappointment in comparing it with my friend's Lonely Planet and doing some quick online research.

I'm normally the person to think \\"there is a lot of people in that restaurant we just passed - Lets go eat there\\". Regarding hotels I tend to book from home at the internet and just need the star rating, the website and \\"tips on how to get the best rate\\".But if you flip through the hotel and restaurant pages, everything looks to be squeezed in and if you need it - then you REALLY need it - I guess that I would be really angry, if I ended up stranded in Shanghai without a good hotel listing ;-)So the only negative I have is the quality of the paper.

I have yet to try it on the ground in Shanghai, but I will update this review if my opinion changes.I'm disappointed that the maps in general are not integrated. The overview map of Shanghai doesn't show you the pages for the individual neighborhood maps. Similarly, the individual neighborhood maps don't show you hints to the maps for surrounding pages. Frommer's should look at how Lonely Planet guides do this. There's no copyright on doing maps that are easily tied together.For me, finding a good hotel means it should be close to a subway station. In particular, I wanted to find a hotel on the Line 1, because I need to make frequent visits to the northwest. Although there is a subway map on the inside cover of this guide, there are no stations shown on the overview map of Shanghai.

If you want more level-headed (and accurate) advice on piercing and tattoos, go to a REPUTABLE piercer or tattoo artist. If you enjoy fear-mongering and misinformation, by all means, buy this book. For every horror story this woman dredges up, there are countless good experiences that do not result in scars and various social traumas. On a more positive note, this book fully deserves the full 1 star because it made me laugh so darn hard.

It is set in Tombstone, AZ just prior to the gunfight at the OK corral. While reviews I have read from the UK were positive, even glowing, it is an excruciating experience to the American viewer/reader. Doctor Who's original aim was to educate its young viewers, but in this story it takes individuals from the most documented gunfight in US history and completely changes them. From the Doctor being mistaken for Doc Holiday to Wyatt Erp spouting scripture every five seconds to the painfully \\"western\\" language...you not only have to dispell your disbelief, you have to bury it.

For a much deeper treatment on the subject I would recommend Karlfried Graf Duerckheim's works. Also, it would have been helpful to have more specific methods discussed.

Additionally, the manufacturing process leaves a slimey residue on the cable itself which will most certainly get on your hands/anything else that comes into contact with.

When I finally decided I better order him I was afraid that he would not have much detail as the picture shows but when he arrived I was amazed they did such a good detailing job. He looks just like the actor. A great deal of detail was put into his clothes and weapons. I was also amazed that his arrows actually worked because they were alot less bulky than Lurtz's bow and arrows. This is by far my favorite action figure.

His left arm doesn't go down, it just sticks out to the side. And his right arm won't hold an arrown to his bow. I think the reason why is because my Legolas must have been one of the first versions of him made (I got him before the movie was released). So he doesn't really do much, except hold an arrowless bowas if he were going to fire an arrow with it. The paint job is exquisite work, and very \\"elven\\". However, his ears are not elf pointy. His ears are hobbit pointy. I wasn't too happy about his ears. But overall, it's a great figure for a setup or display (which is the way I have all my LoTR characters), but not at all very playable.

The surround sound feature is marginal, actually diluting the sound, but this seems true of all the artificial surround features. These also feature an in-line volume control, and a control for the extent of the surround sound feature. Someone obviously took great pride in creating this headphone.

You still get a nice ambient effect and the sonic landscapes are interesting ones indeed. I had not heard of most of these artists, but after listening I intend to pick a few of them up. Co-workers have asked what I was listening to, saying they thought it sounded great.This is a good sampler of ambient music and should not be expected to be more.

Their writing felt very light and airy, lacking in substance. It didn't help that every other page was completely blank save a quotation.More troubling, there's a not-so-fine line between thinking positively and denying reality, and the authors here fall on the wrong side of it. Ironically, they acknowledge this line early in the book and pledge to heed it. Yet later in the book, for example, they encourage the reader to deal with painful memories by simply imagining how they would have liked things to go and dwelling on that.

Half the time, you can't even hear her, and when you can her voice is mediocre at best. She offers nothing new to OTR, and My Destiny is way below average. She is nowhere near as good as most of the female artists who currently top the charts today, for that matter, she is nowhere near as good as some of the female artists to come from the show(aka: Kelly; Carrie; Fantasia) For those of you who say she is very pretty, SO WHAT?!

Whitney could, Mariah could, but in my opinion Katharine can not and thats what needs to happen on this cd.

Katharine can not. That doesn't mean her cd when it comes out will be the same. time will tell. Some Where Over The Rainbow comes off much better live. It was refreshing on AI when it was done live. Done in the studio it's just another dull ballad. Both songs need some spark. Let's hope when her cd comes out the spark is there or there's no sense in buying it.

The song is a very \\"Thank you\\" type of song (Which would make sense after coming off a show like American Idol) I would love to hear people try to sing this at graduations!

We listened to it in the car, and we can't stop listening to it! still love SOTR, although I still miss watching her sing it.

I don't know what those other reviewers are talking about when they say [...] about Katharine's vocals and for some strange reason, everyone is killing on My Destiny. A lot of theses reviewers are saying not to waste your time on My Destiny because it's a crappy song. I think she did it really well and I know a lot of people who like that song. I do like Somewhere Over The Rainbow, but I think she did it better during the season then in the studio. On the singles cd, it skips one of the lines and they did it slower and different and it just doesn't sound right. I also think that in the line \\"where troubles melt like lemon drops,\\" the word \\"like\\" is wwwwwwaaaaaaayyyyyy too low for the song, but I still give it a huge thumbs up!!!!! P.S. I also think her versions of Black Horse and a Cherry Tree and I Have Nothing were better than the originals!!!!!!! Just remember--McPhee is our McPhavorite!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT WORTH YOUR TIME","review":"I hate to give this single a bad rating because I like Katharine Mcphee. The problem is in the songs and not being able to hear her voice clear. My Destiny is just a bad song. There's nothing because of the over production that Katharine Mcphee can do. Her voice is solid but not strong and you don't get a chance to hear her voice. The music is too loud. It's not a song that Kathraine can save. so sorry. Some where over the rainbow is flat. The song is missing something that made it great when other artists did it. Save your money. this is not worth your time. She will have a cd comming out this year maybe it will be better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good enough.","review":"The problem with Katharine is her inability to communicate in the proper manner with the lyrics. They are much more inspiring than her voice can touch. I just don't think it was wise to tackle such a classic. They should've went for something a little less intense. My Destiny is okay, for a teenage prom, but I don't see it going anywhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"WONDERFUL!!!","review":"After hearing both of these songs on AOL I was anxious to hear the CD. I was not disappointed. Kat has an amazing voice. Both of these songs are wonderful. I never tire of hearing Over the Rainbow and My Destiny has the potential to be a big hit. Too bad people don't listen to the music instead of letting their pre-conceived biases color their opinions."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't like it","review":"She doesn't sing very good because her voice is pitchy when she sings high and loud. She shouldn't smile when she sings sad songs. Some of my friends like her voice but most don't. It doesn't cost very much to buy this album though so go ahead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible Voice, a new classic SUPER HIT in Somewhere Over The Rainbow","review":"I have been a huge fan of American idol and I am also a critic, but who would not be addicted to the sultry songstress' bluesy vocals that is only matched by what she could incredibly do with her voice? So, naturally, I find this single terrific and a must-have. As blown away as I am with Katharine's amazing musical talent and the arrangement of the first song, crediting the genius of producer David Foster, I must say that \\"Somewhere Over The Rainbow\\" will go down in history as AI5 \\"best performance of the season\\" and the \\"best new single based on a classic\\". That being said, Katharine McPhee will shine in many places with her talent and beauty, and would grace the recording world for a very long time. Bravo Katharine! 5 STARS!"},{"rating":"2","title":"SUPERB","review":"ok.... i really liked taylor's single.. \\"do i make you proud\\" was way better than what he performed on AI, but lets face it people... KAT WAS JUST MAGNIFICENT!! \\"somewhere over the rainbow\\" was aamazing! i may be the only one who says this, but i actually liked better \\"my destiny\\" XD, don't really know why, it's cheesy and all.. but i can't stop listening it :P.. anywho.. good thing amazon has deleted the reviews that were repeated in an infructuous attempt to boicot katharine's single.. pathetic.. anyways, she's so beyond that and i know theirs a career of full stardom over the rainbow for her ;) ja, loved it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect in everyway!","review":"The hype on this CD.

Check out Eva Cassidy's \\"Songbird\\" to hear her sing it and you'll be amazed at how much better she can sing it. It always makes me cry. Sadly, on the cusp of her success, cancer silenced Eva's voice forever, but we are still blessed with the work she left behind; eleven CDs."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Repeat","review":"I had a review on here that mysteriously disappeared.

I wasn't feeling either of these songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Much to Work With","review":"Kudos for being able to make such a terrible song sound as good as she does. You can't fault the girl for the material she was forced to record. Over the Rainbow is one of my all time favorites and she does a beautiful job with a great arrangement. BTW this is not about American Idol. This is about music judged on its merit, not on who you wanted to win a competition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breathtaking.....","review":"Katharine does take your breath away. I read some of the negative comments about her. And it just doesn't make any sense to tear her apart like that. She is a good singer.

I don't think so!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!!!!","review":"The soul patrol/Yaminions/ Daughtry fans need to stop writing horrible reviews just because your jealous and mad your favorite lost.

Judy Garland --check her out.. she sang the song the right way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pitchy and Overproduced","review":"Overproduced to compensate for weak vocals. She lacks the range and can't hit the high notes. Pitchy Pitchy. Somewhere Over the Rainbow is to big of a song for her. She is no Judy Garland. My Destiny has the worse lyrics.

It's a great single!"},{"rating":"1","title":"i don't get it","review":"i don't get how she made runner up on AI--there was much better talent on there. I thought i would give this a try but am greatly disappointed in the two singles. I don't see either getting much radio play--i'm sorry not seeing the appeal here-not trying to be mean but she isn't producing a winner with this one--maybe the next one will do better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kat has some work to do","review":"I listened to both tracks of this CD numerous times to try to decide if I wanted to buy it. Her rendition of Somewhere Over the Rainbow is more contemporary than the original Judy Garland version and isn't bad, but for me it had too many vocal gymnastics in it. My Destiny was better on the CD than it was sung on the finals of American Idol , especially in the beginning of the song, but by the middle I had to turn it off. Her voice sounded \\"too much\\" and too loud and it was incredibly annoying to listen to. I think Kat has potential to be a very good artist, but would prefer to see more soulful music from her where she doesn't try to overstretch her vocal range."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brillant voice","review":"This cd is wonderful, you can hear the full expression of one of the most beatiful voices of america. The principal single \\"over the rainbow\\" is perfect, the version showed here is even better than the original played at American idol contest. Ideal for a romantic night, candles and twilight, the caress of her voice can conquers everyone.The second song \\"my destiny\\" is good too but obviously become pale next to the perfection of the other song. It let you appreciatte other aspects of katherine's voice not expressed on rainbow track, like more power nearly afro voice and higher tones played at this song.In short a great purchase. The only defect i can say is that you want taste more of her art, but there is only two songs in this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"Kat's voice is just so amazing and \\"My Destiny\\" sounds so much better recorded. she will have a long carreer ahead of her."},{"rating":"2","title":"my favourite idol this past year.....","review":"kathrine mcphee argubally was the best singer this past season. she had range, depth, and control of her voice. she was one of the few idols that was classically trained to sing.... i felt kind of bad that she did not win this year... taylor is a good entertainer but a microwaved michael mcdonald (but that is another story).this single includes quite possibly the ebst performance on her stay on idol. \\"somewhere over the rainbow\\" was by far one of the best performances since fantasia's winning performance of 'i believe'. very good rendition of this song....im not to fond of 'my destiny', but she did do very well on this track as well...overall i thought she should have won idol and this single proves that she should have instead of the other guy....3.9 stars out of 5"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST","review":"Katharine McPhee has the best voice I've ever heard.

Kudos to David Foster.MD is indeed a great song, its lyric tells about her journey on AI, her devoted fans, her story, her destiny; such a memorable song.With those two great songs, she brings us the essence of a pure voice with a great great vocal range. Her beauty meets her voice so well; that's what I call MAGIC. Thank you Katharine, for your blessing voice that you have...Can't wait for your first album, Kat..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow.","review":"To whoever said this was a ripoff of Judy Garlands version, you must not have ever heard it because this sounds nothing like Judy's. That being said, I think Katharine and David Foster did an amazing amazing job of Over the Rainbow, definitely a favorite. And as for My Destiny I originally had low expectations but the studio version is absolutely amazing. It totally surprised me. Both songs are fantastic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Katharine has amazing voice, and this single is HOT","review":"I always like her voice during AI5, I think she has a beautiful vocal and very controlled singing ability. And this single is great because Somewhere Over the Rainbow has always been one of my favorite songs and I love Katharine's version the most. My destiny is not much a great song, but I like how Katharine does it. Compared to Taylor Hick's single, I would rather buy Katharine's because the songs are much better. However, both of them are great singers and performers"},{"rating":"1","title":"COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER","review":"Katharine mcphees first single is a disapointment. My destiny is a small fish in a big pond. In other words the song just doesn't make it. It is a ok song that does not get the listeners attention. It's a song that if on the radio you might change the station, because of bordom. Katharine Mcphee has a good voice that you don't get to fully hear because of the way the song is arranged. Some Where over The Rainbow has been done too many times.Good singer fair songs. Wait for her full cd to come out"},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy on the ears","review":"What great songs.

Although \\"Over the Rainbow\\" is quite well done and shows off a very pretty voice, it lacks the \\"Wow\\" factor that more polished performers have given it, and \\"My Destiny\\" is not that great a song in the first place, but Ms McPhee just didn't make it work.Hopefully the full length album will be better received."},{"rating":"2","title":"Katherine Mcphee is a wonderful singer America!","review":"\\"Somewhere over the rainbow\\" is my favorite.

We are in the presence of true talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Abysmal","review":"I can see why this has a 3 star average now. Katharine just doesn't know how to sing with a different style.

It leaves you with an empty feeling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really dissapointing.","review":"I was a big fan of Katharine on the show, but her single kind of dissapointed me.

Wow, amazing talent Katherine Mcphee is!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Wonderful","review":"This is an absolutely wonderful CD. I absolutely love Katharine's vocals. I wasn't crazy about My Destiny on the show, but it sounds wonderful on the CD. She had mentioned that she was sick and couldn't sing it in the right key on the show and I can definitely hear the difference.I really wish people would stop bashing her on these ratings. If they truly disliked the CD, that is one thing, but it is very obvious that most of them disliked her during the show and therefore probably haven't even listened to her CD. I know I wouldn't spend money on a CD if I didn't like the person before the CD came out. I think they are just having fun trying to make her ratings go down and it's a shame to do that to a young woman that is just trying to make her dreams come true."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great voice, but unimpressive songs...","review":"Ms. McPhee has a great voice and talent, but \\"My Destiny\\" is in one word - awful, and is (in my book) the worst original song \\"Idol\\" has ever released as a single. The second song \\"Over the Rainbow\\" may be a great song choice, but the arrangement (starting with the little-heard verse) does not excite me.I have a terrible feeling that this talented young lady may be headed in the same path as Justin Guarini and Diana DeGarmo - runner-ups whose debut albums were poor sellers. However, I see a great future for her nonetheless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhere...","review":"Somewhere Over The Rainbow was really not done very well. She just doesn't have the same connection that Judy had with the lyrics. It was a beautiful phenomenon at the time of its release.

I see why now, this is just an abysmal collection of two poorly produced songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacking anything special.","review":"I think the producers are at fault here. It isn't exactly McPhee who runs dry at the lyrics, its more the lyrics themselves. Written by Nick Lachey and Tamyra Gray doesn't help either.

I wouldn't reccommend this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really the best I've heard in ages..","review":"Katharines voice has to be one of the best voices ever! Its crystal clear and beautiful.

It ain't right. She can sing and she's sure nice for the eyes, but I really hate the music she's chosen to perform. I found her rendition of \\"Somewhere Over The Rainbow\\" drastically overrated; it wasn't even that great. I loathe that song, I don't know why she would try to bring it back to life over five decades after it was written. The lyrics are really cheesy, I found it painful to listen back to in \\"The Wizard of Oz\\", but in modern times it's even more of a disaster. The song ought not to have been famous; songs today have to have a beat or a bit of pizzazz to'em; soft stuff can have its moments but at least not on this CD. This review of course will be disagreed"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Surprising and Impressive","review":"Ok, when she sang My Destiny on the show, I was extremely dissapointed at the level of cheesiness of the song. The recorded version here on the other hand, is far from that. The song is beautiful, especially the beginning. I did not expect My Destiny to be so good. Somewhere Over the Rainbow I think we all know she can sing. This recorded version is my favorite version right now, it is just phenomonal. Both singles in my opinion are very beautifully sung, a steal for sure!..and please do not listen to the haters. I doubt they have even bought the single, or listened to them for that matter. Buy it or listen to the iTunes clip, judge for yourself. I have and right now I am just very impressed with this result."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing new star!","review":"Kat has an absolutely fantastic voice and this single proves that.

The slight touches and additions to this song only make it stronger. Sounds amazing.And just like reports have said, \\"My Destiny\\" sounds a billion times better on here than it did during her performance of it on the finale (where she sang it in a lower key due to being on bed rest)...and it also sparkles. She turns what could be another unruly Idol song into something of a lovely quality.Katharine McPhee really has a gift and hopefully this is just a prelude of many wonderful melodies from Kat to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great First Single","review":"Although I am more of a Taylor Hicks fan than Katharine McPhee, I am delighted with her first single release and would recommend it as a great alternative to some of the \\"trashier\\" songs available today from other top female singers.

The AI competition is OVER, but these people's careers have just begun!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"On her way to superstardom","review":"If you didn't watch American Idol this year, you'll be pleasantly surprised by this debut recording. If you did, you already know you want to buy this one. This is not your grandma's Over The Rainbow, but has a more modern feel reflecting the musical sensibilities of a young contemporary artist, who still respects the original versions of the standards. My Destiny is more of a power ballad; Rainbow is for quieter moments. Each has a place in your collection of beautiful music. McPhee has a lush, rich quality to her voice that, given a showpiece like OTR, can really produce goosebumps. If this is any indication, later and longer albums will satisfy fans of the many musical genres McPhee has already proven she can sing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"This is a fabolous debut album from Katharine. [...] Anyway SOTR is flawless...amazing vocals and you can just feel the song its just amazing. My Destiny, yeah cheesy song and stuff but hey I like it actually she couldn't do anything about the song and she sang it as it was given to her so I think it was fabulous...except for the ending which was a bit over synthesized. anyway great great album so go check it out everyone I def. think it's worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceed my expectation","review":"I didn't think the song My Destiny will be this good! and to my surprise David Foster produced Somewhere Over the Rainbow.Katharine's voice is really beautiful just like the person.

It's funny how most reviews on here are either 1 star or 5 stars, it sounds like the people giving 1 star just don't like her, and probably don't know anything about music or how to rate a song. Somewhere Over the Rainbow is the better performance on this single. Her voice really comes out great on that one. My Destiny was better performed live, but as a song, I think it's great.Also keep in mind for the people giving her these horrible reviews: Would she have came in 2nd on American Idol, out of hundreds of thousands out there who auditioned, if she was as bad as a lot of people here are saying she is?

This is a book about 21 uniquely Modern homes on the waterfront. Each is showcased with a floor plan, quick synopsis, and photos. It is mostly a picturebook. One of the wonderful things about this book is that it presents itself as a portfolio. You get the sense that such a presentation was handled with the sense of care and understanding that each architect himself would have put into representing his/her house had they done them individually. Unlike other books showcasing Modern architecture, this one provides a good range of solutions architects have employed to capture that \\"million-dollar view\\", whether it is siting, materials, or spatial organization.

Writing about the controversy between pro- and anti-Jefferson positions -- without acknowledging that one side can not prove its case, while the other is forced into the tortured pose of having to prove a negative, is to miss the crux of the entire debate.Two hundred years after the story first gained circulation, the DNA evidence demonstrated nothing more than had ALWAYS been asserted -- that the Hemmings's children were fathered SOME DESCENDENT in the Jefferson line.Books like Gordon-Reed's only highlight the affliction currently paralyzing much of the historical community: the willingness to ignore facts in favor of a narrative of the way in which we WISHED events had happened."},{"rating":"2","title":"The fight against a one sided view by a one sided view","review":"Professor Gordon-Read does the thing she seems to argue against.

Not only is it without the biases that Jefferson's biographers have often brought to the issue, but it highlights those biases, so readers can evaluate the facts for themselves, and make their own decision. The book is repetitive, longer than it needed to be, and the continuous questions (not unexpected from a legal academic) require the reader to think and reach his or her own conclusions, not just absorb the author's opinions, but that's the purpose. The author does not tell you what she thinks, or what you should think. Rather she tells you what the evidence is, what reasons the evidence might or might not be trustworthy (both ways), and how Jefferson's biographers have in many ways treated the evidence inconsistently in order to get the result they desired. All in all, an outstanding treatise on the subject, and as far as I can tell, remarkably balanced."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful reading","review":"I bought and read this book before the DNA results. This is the most unbiased look at the Jefferson-Hemings story I have read so far. The author examines the facts pro and con. According to Madison Hemings, Sally's son, the child she had after returning to Monticello from Paris died. Why can't this be believed? This would explain why the Woodson DNA test was negative. Despite all his greatness, Thomas Jefferson was just a man, subject to all the weaknesses that we all possess. The true feelings that these two had for each other will never be known but I choose to believe that he loved her. That is the only way that I can forgive him for being a slave owner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Historic","review":"Important for any Blues collector.

Our family doesn't even think to start our Christmas morning festivities without 'popping' in this cassette (now buy CD's!). We even listen to this collection while we wrap Christmas gifts! We are a Christmas \\"fanatic\\" family and have literally hundreds of Christmas records, tapes and CD's but this collecton is the only one that can add to the warmth of this special season and I know it has become a family tradition that will bring cherished memories to our children when they have families of their own.

While this is no MST3K, her jokes can be somewhat funny, but it is nice to have these movies that aren't normally available on dvd. The movies can be watched with or without Elvira which is also another nice added touch."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Video and Audio quality of the Gamera movie is Unwatchable","review":"I bought this DVD for Gamera, Super Monster and was disappointed to find audio and video that looked like it came from a 3rd generation VHS copy. I have one other double feature volume in Elvira's Movie Macabre series and this is the worst video quality that I have seen.However, the video for They Came from Beyond Space is of acceptable quality for this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Elvira fans only.","review":"OK, I know this is part of Elvira's series so the focus here isn't necessarily on the actual films. But, if you're thinking about buying this to finally see Gamera Supermonster, you're going to be pretty disappointed. The video quality will make you nostalgic for the days of big box VHS rentals while the audio will make you feel like you have a towel wrapped around your head. Obviously this release isn't licensed (there's no language to that effect anywhere) and this is not a public domain movie, so I'm not sure how they got away with releasing this in the first place.They Came From Beyond Space fares better, though not by much. By that I mean it looks like a well worn 16mm broadcast print was used rather than a well work ex-rental VHS.And the final insult? The host segments aren't as funny as I remember.Unless you are an Elvira completest or someone who can't find another source for Supermonster, avoid this disc at all costs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hidden Talents","review":"Always enjoy Krentz' books - and her different slant on her theme.

Also her sense of humor is good."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Jayne Ann Krentz's bests!","review":"I truly enjoy Ms. Krentz's books, and Hidden Talents is one of my favorites. The character development is great, the chemistry between Serenity and Caleb is wonderful, and who can resist the quirky, off-beat inhabitants of Witt's End? Pick this one up and see if you can find a bottle of \\"Ole Hogwash\\" (a Witt's End product) to drink while you read.

You won't be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Back Page","review":"Serenity Makepeace knows a lot about whole-grain bread, but she doesn't know beans about business. She's expanding her natural foods emporium to sell local handicrafts by mail-which she hopes will benefit her offbeat artist community in Witt's End Washington. But she needs a crack fincial adviser to make her dream a reality-so she charms her way into the office of Caleb Ventress, a handsome wolf in conservative clothing.An expert in the art of the deal, Caleb isn't sure what to make of the unconventional Serentity-but there's no doubt he's attracted. A pass from a paragon of conformity-even one as handsome as Caleb-is more than free spirited Serenity bargained for. But when a lethal blackmailer threatens her plans and perhaps her life, she puts her whole trust in the man who seems her complete opposite-and the net result might be true love."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Good Source Of Information","review":"This book goes into some unexpected and welcome depth. It is not a superficial 'Welcome Wagon' type volume. It displays both the good and the bad that one will encounter here. It is well worth reading and considering before moving to the 'Aloha State'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Negative view","review":"Quite a negative view of Hawaii. Just remember that this is just one persons view of Hawaii and this author did not seem to assimilate well. Any person who travels is able to find the downside to any city. She quotes from her book that someone said about not asking about the type of job but whether one is employed or not, seems condescending and incorrect as Hawaii has one on the lowest umemployment rates in the country. Pass unless you want a pessimistic read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too focused on the caucasian reader","review":"Like many other reviewers, I've been considering moving to Hawaii. Like many other reviewers, I feel that it's a little too negative and moreover, I do not think it is even suitable for myself. There are many stories in there talking about haole moving there being unwelcomed. I didn't know what haole meant but from the stories it seemed to imply that it's a term for caucasians from mainland. (that's indeed the case, looking it up on wikipedia) I'm of Asian descent and grew up in California, and I don't feel like I am getting useful information out of this book at all regarding how locals would view me. There are some useful practical information in there, but there are probably better books for those also."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good book for haoles","review":"Having lived my whole life on the mainland, I was interested in a move to Hawaii. I found Toni's book and hoped that it would help me with the logistics of a move. Although there are some good tips on moving there, I found her chief audience to be haoles (whites). Instead of encouraging an assimiliation into the culture and appreciation for the people, there were cautionary notes as to how 'they' were different. I found most of the book quite superficial. Only a few chapters at the end about the actual logistics of moving and finding a job were of any help."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie, with poor acting","review":"This is deffinetly a treat for the Lupin fans. It delivers great action and fun as well as superb animation. My only gripe were the actors used for it. Lupin (or Rupan as he's called in this) sounds like he sat on his keys, Zenigata sounds constapated, Jigen just sounds horrible (sounded like the actor was trying to rip off the style of whoever did his voice in the Manga release of Cagliostro) while Goemon and Fujiko have more fitting (yet lame) voices. I hope that Streamline or Manga redo this one with thier actors, but I'd still recommend it for any fan of the Lupin series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed - Meant for Principals and Above, Not Parents","review":"While this is probably a very good book for any school administrators in a position of power, it really does not offer much in terms of realistic, valuable advice for parents. As the incoming PTA President at my children's elementary school next year, I was looking more at what parents can be doing to foster relationships and run a successful PTA.The recommendations given in this book are focused at the administrative level and must really be implemented by those in authority, as I am the last one who can be telling my Principal that she needs to completely overhaul our entire system. For those whose principals are receptive to that, more power to you. For those whose principals are not, I suggest you look elsewhere for helpful advice. This goes well beyond the Bake Sale and really has nothing to do with the PTA unless you are an adminstrator looking to change things or your school's relationship with its parents."},{"rating":"2","title":"a great one","review":"this movie is a great one the main guy is a blind guy. the blind guy is played by Armand Assante (Judge Dredd). the blind guy shoots better then all of the other guys that can hear. and nails the enemy on there own territory."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I didn't find anything likable or entertaining about this movie. The characters were shallow, the story was ABCDE, and the end uses a silly deux-ex-machina. Much of what happens occurs for no good reason. We're never given the slightest reason to believe that anything that happens is credible. I came to this movie as a fan of the writer (from Carnivale), but was very disappointed that it had absolutely none of the subtlety, depth or interest of his work on Carnivale.Reading the other positive reviews makes me think it's possible my high expectations led to my disappointment, but I don't think so. This was just too simple, silly and loose for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"STILL NEEDS WORK","review":"I like it how Barbie Co are making different cultures barbies but still needs improvement.

This book really got me thinking about cool ideas to make my webpages more interactive and more exciting. This book does do a good job of providing explanations on coding for Netscape, as much as you can do that. I was dissapointed that many of the URL demos listed in the book are no longer working URL's. Some topics didn't go into as much detail as I would have liked.

In the book Beauty is the horse that was chosen to ride by the people in the story.I like this book because it's about horses. Also because it shows me what a horse's life is about. I really liked the book because of Beauty. Beauty is smart. When it was raining the bridge was broke and no one saw it but Beauty.

I'm a seasoned web developer needing a really chunky tutorial on DHTML, and this book ain't it. Jeff kicks off with a general intro to CSS and the DOM - ok but not brilliant, better info exist on the web. Then things go downhill. All his DHTML applications are mundane at best (image rollovers, weedy pull downs) or downright obscure at worst (MS channels). Code is NOT explained line by line and you are not left with the feeling you can do it yourself. As long as you want to add Jeff's example into your pages then you're golden, if you want to learn the underlying principles and then develop your own stuff...forget it!

(The caveat is because there are great souls who prefer to remain hidden.) Though his wisdom was vast and his discoveries in deep meditation greatly advanced our understanding of humanity's capabilities, his writings are so huge and dense, that comparitively few have understood the majesty of the man's philosophy. That is why Sat Prem's book is so valuable. You will never find a more succinct or readable tome on Aurobindo.

Tonino Guerra's screenplay is matchless; Giulietta Masina's performance is the most sublime of her career (better than La Strada, Nights of Cabiria, Juliette of the Spirits, etc.) owing to Marcello Mastroianni's equally moving counterpoint; and Fellini's mise-en-scene is even better for laughs here than in 8 1/2.

It contains the text of Persius' (A.D. 34-62) and Juvenal's (circa A.D. 127) satires. The update is really well done. The introduction provides an excellent introduction to the genre and a background on the transmission of the text.The translation is well done. It is a prose translation of the Latin poems. Generally the translation is accurate with \\"idiom-for-idiom\\" translation, using equivalent contemporary American expressions for ancient slang. The translation has extensive footnotes to explain historical, mythological, literary, and geographic references. This is very handy for a reader without a mastery of classical literature."},{"rating":"2","title":"A euphoric experience for logophiles","review":"Of the dozens of books I own on obscure, bizarre, and fascinating words, The Endangered English Dictionary is probably my favorite.

But this one doesn't take the back seat to any of those in any way. The combo of McNeely(piano)/Johnson(bass)/Hart or Lewis (drums) form a perfect (read well stretched) canvas for Mr.Getz to paint on. \\"Tempus Fugit\\" swings with passion. \\"Blood Count\\" showcases the (controlled) lyrical ability of Stan's horn.

I can tell you that at the time, I enjoyed the history section as a means of giving me a rough musical chronology, as well as the listener's recommendations. Much of the book, though, is really...silly? Is that the word? Sophomoric? Moronic? We learn, for example, that Berlioz was a lunatic - that's the general impression, we get. The descriptions of the composers and their musical traits sounds a lot like Joan Rivers's red carpet quips on Oscar night. \\"Love the concerto, darling, but oh! What are going to do about that hair?\\"If you have to get this book because it feels safe and easy, then do it.

The book is relatively easy reading, and gave me a great understanding of the vocabulary and the concepts involved with broadband technologies. The author expressed himself well and explained many of the topics clearly. It is a great book for people in the IT industry who want to understand the software systems that are used to operate these PC like devices.On the negative side, O'Driscoll did not develop alot of content on areas like voice activation and MPEG-4."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent resource for teacher and student alike","review":"I am an ESL/HS English teacher and have used America Writes for two years now. The choices of stories is excellent, introducing English language students to classic authors such as, Hemingway, Langston Hughes,Hawthorne, and O. Henry (to name just a few). The prereading questions and vocabulary along with idioms and expressions help tremendously to prepare the reader for the selection. It's great being able to have my students read at the higher level of content that they are ready for emotionally and intellectually and still have their language needs addressed. I would love to see this be made into a series with more than the one edition!! I highly recommend it for teachers as well as students working on their own to broaden their reading in English!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Review by an eye witness","review":"I was at the gate as a prisoner moments after the 42nd Rainbow Division arrived at Dachau in the afternoon of April 29, 1945.This book gives an excellent and true picture of all the events surrounding the liberation and also as a general description of the conditions and horrors of this concentration camp. Speaking English, I was immediately hired as an interpretor and thus could see and observe both what happened inside and outside the camp at the time of the liberation. While the 45th Division arrived at another point of the vast area of the camp at about the same time, it was the 42nd Division that accepted the official surrender and took some fire from the SS that still manned the watch towers. Both divisions shared in the liberation.Ernest Seinfeldes893@columbia.edu"},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing","review":"An amazing story of a very sad, ugly time in history.

It seems to adapt to the mood you are in and uplifts or sympathizes with you, cheers or consoles and is never, ever boring. It is beautifully scored and performed and what I would call a classic classic. It is an addition to your collection that you will never regret and always look forward to listening to these soothing sounds."},{"rating":"2","title":"AP Stats Savior","review":"Barron's AP Stats Prep book is what got me my 5. I spent the year in Stats class not paying attention, not doing homework, and for the most part not understanding a single thing about stats. 2 weeks before the exam I went through Barron's front to back, and got a 5! The information is organized in an easy to use fashion, and there's plenty of practice problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"Understandable","review":"After a completely incomprehensible text book, I was prepared to open this prep book and continue being confused. However, the Barron's guide was easy to understand, contained all pertinent tables, and even had some visual aids that made memorizing p and p-hat much easier. Sure it was boring, but its a prep book its not supposed to be fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"not the greatest","review":"unfortunately i didnt look at any other ap stats review books since i was forced to get this one by my teacher but this one wasnt that great.

Its not a terrible book and it probably helped me a bit with practicing, but i could have done without it."},{"rating":"1","title":"the day my virginity went away","review":"This disc is pretty boring. I mean, it was totally exciting that it was the first release from NIN in five years or whatever, but I never listen to it anymore. TDTWWA is probably my least favorite song off The Fragile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just buy The Fragile","review":"This single contains what I consider to be the two worst songs from The Fragile. I can't imagine why anyone (other than collectors who get all the halos) would want to buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"not the best Trent can do","review":"Let's cut to the chase - it's pointless to argue with others' opinions on this. I usually enjoy NIN immensely, but I have to say this is not the greatest disc I've heard come out of his studios. Starf uckers inc. Is repetitive and poorly lyricized. I maintain my hope that The Fragile will top his previous record, The Downward Spiral in all fields. We shall see what we shall see."},{"rating":"1","title":"I HATE THIS CD!","review":"This is the worst music I've ever heard! And Trent's voice sounds horrible on this cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yeah Right, Real Emotional","review":"Trent is at it again. I would like to say that to anyone who thinks Trent's music is soul-baring, it ain't. TDTWWA's lyrics are like bad poetry from a suicidal person. Maybe these are his emotions, but they aren't creative, they aren't inspired, they are just dull and tacky. And Starfu%%%rs is beyond reasonable comprehension. The only sentiments I've ever heard that were more simplistic were the words from the poem Miniver Cheevey. Only a juvenile mind could write such appallingly laughable filth. Bob Dylan is an inspired lyricist. Stephen Malkmus is an interesting lyricist. Trent Reznor is a pretentious child who thinks he has something to contribute to the music world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trent must die","review":"I believe after hearing the new single that Trent Reznor's career is going downhill. After a long departure from working with NIN i think he's lost his touch, the perfect drug, then the day the world went away... hopefully the other 38 songs are better."},{"rating":"2","title":"layered, adventurous, beautiful...worth much more than $3.00","review":"tdtwwa is beautiful, layered, hypnotic. i've listened to it again and again and still can't get enough of it... the two versions seem like two completely separate songs, but are both incredible in their own ways. and starfuckers rocks in ways other bands only wish they could manage... if you're driving and listening to this, you will speed up by at least 10mph. perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"to the person who thinks he's a music fan in NY","review":"To my friend in NY who has some personal agenda against NIN, attacking their song's lyrical merit and overall artistic value. And you cite the Beatles and others as having more meaningful lyrics such as: \\"Obladi oblada life goes on bra Lala how the life goes on\\" Hmm, they may have revolutionized music, but i bet NIN could have expressed it better. Trent Reznor has some of the most powerful and tortured lyrics on songs like \\"Hurt,\\" \\"Something I Can Never Have\\" and others. I'm not saying this single is the best NIN i've heard, not by a long shot. I just hope you out there in NY have something better to do with your time than bash someone's lyrics because you don't appreciate what he has to say. PS--this was in no way meant to disrespect the beatles (as if anyone possibly could)"},{"rating":"1","title":"People should post what they feel","review":"First, I think anyones opinion should count, not the only the ones who like NIN. If they only posted if they liked it (and this isn't limited to NIN cds) everything would have 5 stars, and that would take the point out of criticism.Anyway, I've bored you enough. I love The Fragile, but this is pretty crappy. Star Fuckers is terrible, and The Day the world went away is pretty good, but doesn't match the Fragile. Well, I've bored you enough! GOODBYE"},{"rating":"1","title":"He can do better.","review":"Considering the gruops on the labels he owns besides Manson, are all experimental or jungle/ drill and bass/ drum and bass techno youd think Trent would have taken a clue and let himself be influenced by them, liek Squarepusher so on. But instead he has chosen to use technology not to make innovative ionterestign music but songs that sound liek they could have come off broken or tds. Starf..... is great actually, its what earned the 2 stars from me, up until when it erupts into STAR F-ERS INC!!!!! with the howling guitars and classic NIN style, it doesnt quite work with the techno drum and bass dubbiness of the rest of the track, so take off track one and 3, change the chorus sections of track 2, and youd have a great single. Maybe since he ahsnt left his house since 1994, he thinks its onyl 1995 or soehting, but it isnt, and this is old"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing.","review":"I used to love Nine Inch Nails. The music used to be industrial and intriguing. Now I wouldn't be surprised to hear it on a Nintendo or Sony Playstation soundtrack (with the lyrics taken out, of course). It's all soft and gooshy guitar-strumming plus Trent yelling about things which don't even make sense anymore. Can you believe this guy is in his mid-thirties? The only GOOD thing about \\"The Day the Whole World Died\\" is the last five minutes of the third track. The piano stuff is really nice. This is part of what I referred to as gooshiness before, but honestly, it's the only part of the album worth listening to, simply on the basis of its being pretty, because it's not the kind of thing I want to hear from NIN. I'll listen to Mozart and Mahler if I want pretty."},{"rating":"1","title":"NIN needs to change which clearly hasn't happened here","review":"I've followed Trent Reznor and his crew for quite a while, and I've loved his music. With the comming of this album everybody said his music was going to change, to such an extent that his band was to disclame him and name the album Trent Reznor opposed to Nine Inch Nails. This rather excited me and I was quite dissapointed when I heard this music. It was exactly the same as the Downward Spiral. Trent needs to change and gets some new ideas in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was expecting something COMPLETELY different, based on all I had been reading in the press. The Day the World Went Away is similar to Hurt, and Starf***ers sounds like plenty of other NIN. I still look forward to the new album, but my expectations are now considerably lower. Basically, I was disappointed with this single. Hopefully, it will grow on me as it has on other listeners."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally","review":"I got this the first day it came out and i loved it.. i was floored when i listened to it and still am.. leaves you Needing more of his new stuff.."},{"rating":"1","title":"not his best","review":"just not his best work. i'm sure there are many better songs on his album he could've chosen to put out as a single, but he had to be an idiot and do the isolation bit. the thing that really bugged me, though, was the fact that there were only two versions of the song on this. from a nin single you'd expect to get three or four. i remember getting 'head like a hole' and getting shocked that there were ten songs on it.if the fragile is anything like the songs he put on this single, there's no way it'll sell as good as the downward spiral. not that that's a bad thing...it's just that these suck."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you can't beat them, don't join them.","review":"Trent needs to either evolve with his music or quit. He is putting out the same lame songs he's been putting out since the late 80's. It's a sign of failure when bands on your own label are better than you. Whatever he went through to make this album, he needs to do the reverse to make his next one. I hope this slump breaks eventually, because my friend listens to him, and I don't want to have to listen to another wack cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hope he is on his way back to the studio to redo the album","review":"After waiting for four years I was excited to hear about the single, but when I bought it I was glad I did not pay over $3.00 for it. With all of his music these are the worst songs. I hope he is testing the market with these songs and decides to go back to the studio and redo the album. What a joke. Na, Na, Na, Na........."},{"rating":"2","title":"Should hold me over","review":"I've been waiting impatiently for the new NIN album and after the disapointment of perfect drug i was a little warry of the new single. I heard StarF*ckers Inc. on the radio, not a bad song but still not what i was expecting and a little diapointing. but TDTWWA is amazing. TDTWWA is one of his best ever and the Quiet mix is almost a good. Its beatiful, melodic, and not nearly as clostrofobic as anything on downward spiral(which is one of my favorite albums of all time but i like airy music) however the single doesn't recieve five stars because of StarF*ckers although its a good song it seems to be leaning to much towards the stuff on broken and i'd hate to see him go backwards in his carreer any way its worth the money for the 2 mixes of TDTWWA its amazing"},{"rating":"1","title":"El stinko","review":"Reznor sounds worse on each sucessive release.

Trent is one of the most complicated geniuses and always leaves his fans in shock when they finally hear his albums for the first time. By shock I mean complete happinness. StarF****ers is one of the most innovative songs i've ever heard. The day the world went away has many different layers to it and kicks totall a$$. This single is a must have!!!!

This one is much different from the previous one, its more fast paced and uses guitars really well.The cd shows a nice blend of what NIN has done and will keep doing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"From cutting edge to blunted","review":"Never have i been so disapointed with a release. After all this time, and after seeing that Nothing records was distributing the good uk techno, i figured Trent Reznor would have figured that his old sound was old news. instead of moving on, he moved back; a mushy-rock \\"i'm-dying-inside\\" balad and a commercial pseudo-electro-metal yell-fest. Nothing Jon Bon Jovi couldn't have done with a dose of PCP.this sucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Europe Is Obviously On The Decline","review":"I guess Europe has finally slipped into the cultural toilet. All I have to say is that this album is trash. Depressing lyrics do not turn me off. Stereotypical, stylized lyrics that show no effort do turn me off. And as to Miles: \\"On The Corner\\" and \\"In A Silent Way\\" have more integrity and brilliance in their first notes than this entire album. Miles was no commercial artist, because he changed. Reznor is doing the same thing he has always done, in an attempt to keep fans. Reznor's fanbase is as stupid as him if they think he is revolutionary."},{"rating":"1","title":"966696","review":"I think most of the reviews I've read of this single, both here and elsewhere, have been either too harsh or too Trent-adoring. Trent as a pretentious, mopey juvenile is no big news -- if you don't accept that about him, I'm not sure why you'd be out at the store buying NIN discs in the first place. At the same time, to say this single is \\"genius\\" strikes me as pretty damn silly; if it speaks to you in some way, that's great, but really this is just an extension of the stuff heard on The Downward Spiral, nothing exceedingly innovative (and certainly disappointing to those of us who were thinking the bands on the Nothing label would have been influencing him.) Starfkrs has some nice techno but it's a really stupid song, with painfully trite vocals and lyrics. The \\"Nah Nah Nah-ing\\" on the last track can be nerve-grating at times too. I have to admit Trent's voice has the most appeal when it's put through effects and muted a bit."},{"rating":"1","title":"The day he bored me to sleep","review":"Useless addition to the halos - you have the single ( might as well listen to it on the album ) you have Starf**kers Inc ( might as well listen to it on the album ) and the quiet version ( pointless but pretty ) All in all you must be a raving loony obsessed NIN fan to have this although I don't see the point in having it. Luckily I sold mine so I haven't got to hear this anymore"},{"rating":"2","title":"hmmm.........what can i say?????","review":"I think it's a great cd, but the odd thing is that The Day the World Went Away (Quiet) is on part 3 of the We're In This Together singles.....odd........But anyways, i'd still recommend this anyways."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST SINGLE EVER!","review":"For a single, it's a mighty worthless one. The only reason one would buy this is to complete his collection, because frankly the one new track on this CD is bad enough to be ranked as NIN's worst material ever (save the TDTWWA rick rubin remix). Band's evolve, but not necessarily for the better. Let's just hope they don't end up like Led Zeppelin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Groan!","review":"I've waited five years for THIS? NIN rips off Pink Floyd with the Day the World Went Away, then goes on to rip off the Prodigy with Star Fu**ers, Inc. This is what happens when Trent Reznor parts ways with such longtime collaborators as Chris Vrenna and Robin Finck. The total NIN freak will have to own this CD, even though it's weak and boring. I can only hope the upcoming album is a little more uptempo--a little more like the NIN I love."},{"rating":"2","title":"Getting a Taste of The Musical Genius that Would Soon Follow","review":"Released as a teaser single before the greatest album in the world (The Fragile) came out, The Day the World Went Away single doesn't offer much, but here's what you will get.1. The Day The World Went Away - An excellent song in it's original version as found on The Fragile.2. Starf**kers Inc. - Pretty much the same version as found on The Fragile. This is my least favorite song on The Fragile, and therefore I could have done without it on the single.3. The Day The World Went Away (Quite) - An amazing re-working of The Day the World Went Away. The title tells you what you're getting, and it's a great song.Get this INSTEAD of the We're In This Together Now Pt. 2 single.I insist everyone who proclaims they enjoy Nine Inch Nails own this, simply because it's associated with the best record in the history of man; The Fragile."},{"rating":"2","title":"nine inch nails pounds another great sound","review":"As like many other people, at first i didnt like it. but after wards you find your self walking around the house(or whereever) singing the song. i have become addicted to the nails all over again. i can't wait for the fragil to come out, it will be the album of the decade and the best tour to start the new millinium!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent.

He is definetly staying away from what everyone is doing and from what everybody expected him to do.

My favorite track on this album is number 3. Chris is at a point where his voice is still maturing and he has pulled it off. I'm also glad that this album is getting lots of promotion. His first single \\"Run it\\" started from the bottom of the charts and made its way to number 1. GOOD JOB CHRIS. Also when listening to this album, you're going to hear the fire and determination in Chris' voice which will send him to the top. There's lots of singers in this world but it's only the ones with a purpose behind their voices that will send them to the top.

What happened to masculinity in R&B? Even Michael Jackson and Ralph Tresvant never sounded like a girl when they sang; they sounded like young boys singing.

The impressive voice matched with the music gives an aura that's not matched by many young R&B; writers. And it's not like he's coming from a big market like New York or LA, this is straight from Va.His hits \\"Run It!\\", \\"Yo (Excuse Me Miss)\\", and \\"Gimmie That\\" are obviously strong but there's a lot more to this album like \\"Ya Man Aint Me\\" a topic everyone can relate too. Production is great on tracks like \\"Poppin\\" and \\"Just Fine\\".\\"Winner\\" will definatley give you the overall feel of this album and the predictable title \\"Is This Love\\" shows you Chris Brown's singing at his best. The only thing that should have been left off is the \\"Run It! Remix\\". While he's no Usher or Mario with time and work Chris Brown could be on his way to the top."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic for a newbie!","review":"I initially bought this album because of \\"Run it\\" really not expecting too much, however I was pleasantly surprised. The remix (track 14) with Bow Wow & JD is hot & even better than the original. Actually it's my \\"rev up\\" track of the moment.

When I got the album, there were soooo many more hott tracks and I was soooo happy that I got this cd. I love \\"Ain't no way\\" THAT IS THE BEST SONG! And \\"Just Fine\\" is wonderful.

Only three songs or more are really great. \\"Gimme That\\", \\"Ya Man Ain't Me\\", \\"Run It\\", and \\"Say Goodbye\\", thats very impressive for a debut. He's not the next Usher. He is the next Chris Brown. I always liked \\"Whats My Name\\" because it is very artistic, and I like how the song was composed. The rest of the songs are just album fillers. They aren't worth listening. It's kinda worth buying if you like skipping through an album, but if you are looking for an album to listen to the whole 9 yrds, LOL, I wouldn't reccomend this one.

This is not music; this is trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely Unacceptable","review":"I can't stand the way this kid sings. It's like he's shouting throughout his songs in a whiny high-pitched voice. It really irritates me that a 16 year old wants to sing like a 12 year old. It's not gonna work. Chris Brown really needs to get some vocal lessons and fast because he knows nothing about range. I wasn't impressed with his debut album either- it was boring, nothing unique about it at all. Just the same old same old stuff you here on FM radio. There wasn't even at least one ballad on the CD that had the potential of being a classic and could be sung on American Idol. I have no idea how this boy got a record deal, but there are plenty of teenage boys out there who can dance and actually sing.

The X-files is the best show, so of coarse all of the episodes are good, but I would recomend this. Darkness falls is really cool how all these bugs arekilling people, Tooms and Squeeze are about a freaky guy who eats livers and the rest are cool also. Scully and Mulder both relate well in these episodes, they show how they can trust each other. They are really cool.

As it is, abridges abound, with some of the best (like \\"Bum's Opera,\\" which is a blast) really cut short. Make no mistake--it's great Rodgers and Hammerstein. Read the book (you can find it in some libraries) and see what life you can imagine into it. It is obscure because people in 1956 who were \\"important\\" deemed it was lesser R & H. Give it a spin and see what you think.

The title caught me right away, but as I opened the book to a random page to check it out, I was blown away at how that particular page related to what I was going though at that moment. Not a coincidence. The chapters are short and managable for a busy mom, but the message is BIG. I used it as a daily devotional, and it put me back on track to appreciating my blessings!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeping it snappy.","review":"I purchased these pieces of elastic in order to mend a few pants, skirts, and bras that had lost all of their elasticity. I liked that there were several sizes included in this assorted kit. I am not an experienced seamstress so I had to cut pieces a few times to get the desired level of elasticity. The cut pieces did not fray at the cut ends which is wonderful. I sewed the elastic into the lining of the clothing so they will not have direct contact with skin. Even so, they seem soft enough that it wouldn't be uncomfortable to wear them directly against skin.I don't know how the elastic will hold up over time with stretching and washing, but thus far I am satisfied with the product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Quality - Just Wish I Went to the Dollar Store First","review":"I've been needing some of this knitted elastic for a couple weeks now, and just wasn't running into it locally. So I ordered here from an Amazon vendor, and then the day before it arrived, I found a larger package at the dollar store. *Sigh* Well, it was only a couple bucks here on Amazon, so I'm still glad to have the extra. It's nice quality and seems like it should last. I'm using it to replace a shoelace inside the waistband of some shorts; I much prefer elastic waistbands. This stuff worked well, but seems to be the exact same quality of what I got at the dollar store, so I'll need to remember that for next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slightly bizarre","review":"I have read the other reviews and based my purchase on them. I was greatly disappointed by several big \\"holes\\". First, there is no full alphabetical listing of vowels and consonants, upper and lowercase letters. Second, there is no phonetic pronuciation in either the English or Russian halves. You would have to be a second year student to know the pronunciations already OR have to try and write out each word letter-by-letter. Not useful at all for carrying along on a trip to the CIS or Russia."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice but defective","review":"The holster seems to be constructed well. The gun fits nicely into it. It states in the description that it will fit on a belt up to 2 1/4 inch wide. That is true IF you are using the metal belt clip and not the sewn in belt loop that will only accept an inch and 1/4 wide belt. Using the metal belt clip on the belt on the outside of the waist does not provide a stable attachment of the holster; I would not use it this way. The snap on the strap that secures the back of the gun to the thumb break, broke off so now the strap in non-functioning. This snap failure happened right out of the package. I have purchased and used other Uncle Mike's products since they were of good quality but this one is of low quality.

While the construction is solid, the image quality is not what I was expecting. Images are soft, colours lose their intensity, and chromatic aberration increases. It seems TCs are better used with prime lenses, but results were not much better when I tested it with a 50mm f/1.4.If you don't mind losing some image quality, then this TC may be of use to you; otherwise, spend more money on one made by Pentax."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mirra-coat","review":"very satified with the product and supplier, i have made numerous purchases without any issues."},{"rating":"1","title":"TrailSeal Tailgate Gasket","review":"Product does not work for truck beds that have been lined.

What an amazing waste of [money].I'm a fan of the genre in general, but this book is the worst I've read in a long time. Nowwhere near the class of David Morrell or even Tim Green.Honestly, I gave up and stared at my seatback after 150 pages. I just couldn't take any more. The characters are all one dimensional carictures, the central plot element is asinine (everyone is upset at Web London for surviving an ambush), its description of the difference between a psychologist and psychiatrist was painful, the FBI/military people just don't have realistic attitudes, the dialogue is stilted.... the list goes on.Save your time and money, skip this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many good books in the world to waste time with this.","review":"Admittedly, I did not read the entire book because I had to put it down after 200 pages. It's that bad. The dialogue is cheesy, the characters shallow, and the plot (near as I can tell at the half-way point) might as well have been outlined by a fifth-grader. And did I mention that it was way too long? I have not read Baldacci before, but this book ensures that I never will again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big book, big disappointment","review":"Superhero stuff centered totally around one character. The author tries to make him more than one dimensional by putting him in therapy. Shades of \\"The Sopranos\\". Some books you enjoy and think they would make a great movie. This just seems to be written for the movies and not a very good one at that. It's Bruce Willis or Arnold Schwarzenegger territory. Not up to Baldacci's best. I should have given up after the first few chapters. As an American living overseas, I'm afraid the most enjoyable parts of the book were the descriptions of my native Virginia."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Good Book Turned Mediocre","review":"I must admit that I for the most part enjoyed reading this book while recently on vacation. It is a long book with well developed characters that puts together an interesting and suspense filled mystery plot. Then, as the mysteries and riddles of the story begin to be resolved ... you become dissatisfied by how weak the resolution to the story ends up being. The story becomes weaker and weaker, and more and more unbelievable with every page beyond the midway point. By the end - you are sorely disapointed. SPOLIER ALERT - It would seem like David Baldacci just got bored of writing, since there is no coherent ending to the story. The book just ... finished, in what would appear to be the midway point to a longer story. Not recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"This is a solid thriller, and probably the best I've read since Craig Furrnas' THE SHAPE. Murder, mayhem, intrigue.

Full of half-baked cliches and undeveloped characters, it is the last Baldacci book I buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whoever Wrote the Jacket Cover - Never Read Ludlum","review":"This book is so ridiculously predictable that it would have been better if he'd left out chapters. (If you buy it, please skip chapter 21 as from there on... well, you'll get the idea.) At times you felt like the writer wrote himself into a corner and had to backtrack and insert a chapter to help the book make sense. Even then - the absurdity of all the pieces coming together - as they do in the end - is laughable. This guy writes nothing like Ludlum, Grisham, etal, and should not, however remotely, be considered to be in the same class. It is a beach book at best.NB: The review by Kristen White is one of four, three for Balducci, that she has written. Clearly she is his publicist, publisher, sister or in some way connected to Balducci. There is no way a review for this book, like the one she has written, is put forth without some outside motivation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and unfocused","review":"I was very disappointed in this novel. It starts slow and plods for 500+ pages. It has no gripping focus. Too much information about horse farming that adds zero to the plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is it Baldacci or Baldacci as ghost writer?","review":"I usually love Baldacci. This one was worth skipping. It was disconnected (except by far too frequent \\"oh, by the way\\" fill-ins) and seemed, in fact, to have been patched-together by an inexperienced author, a poor stylist, and an overworked editor. The final acknowledgment to an FBI hostage rescue team operator and would-be writer may tell the tale. Baldacci wishes him every success in his writing career. So do I -- but I hope Baldacci rediscovers his muse."},{"rating":"1","title":"just can't finish all of 'em","review":"when i started this book and read the first chapter, i thought man o' man, this is classic baldacci. but then, just like someone snapped their fingers, it was over. what i forced myself to read turned into a bunch of mush about everything hrt. the concept was good, but it seemed like the author tried to tell us everything he learned in research in a chapter or two. as i was reading i caught myself thinking, i just don't care about all this extra. can we get to some story here? this book was incredibly boring to me and i never made it past the third chapter. sorry if i am ruining anyones day, but i loved the other baldacci books and this one is simply not up to the caliber he has shown before."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs to take writing 101","review":"Good guys, bad guys--black /white, no shades of gray. Lots of passive writing style.I've never seen such two dimensional characters in a book that is so popular.His use of English is very amateurish--I was tripping over his writing style--very distracting -- I had no empathy for any of his characters.I'm a Clancy, Ludlum, Follet fan with a taste for Stephen King sometimes. They are master storytellers with wonderful grasp of the English language. Their characters are three dimensional and have complexity.Baldacci's characters make comic books look like classics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ponderous machine","review":"At the beginning ,action every 100 pages, and boy do those pages drag. The plot is movie style convoluted and not close to reality based. How come we keep witnesses alive so long, when all that is intended is their demise?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Deep Fiction","review":"I'm enjoying reading \\"Last Man Standing\\" as an attempt at a change of pace from Norman Thomas Remick's \\"West Point\\", the non-fiction book I'm also reading. I'm surprised at how heavy and involved Mr. Baldacci's book seems, even in comparison to the history and philosophy of \\"West Point\\". That's because Mr. Baldacci does such great background work for the tales he spins that they seem to be serious non-fiction. This one is no different, possibly the best. I won't say any more, or I would risk ruining it for you. Just know that I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I am extremely disappointed in this book. I thoroughly enjoyed all of his other books (especially \\"The Winner\\"), but this one was slow & uninteresting. I have read 225 out of 548 pages and have finally given up on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst books ever written","review":"OK, so I exaggerate. But only a little. I can't believe (1) Baldacci actually submitted this for publication knowing his name would be associated with it, (2) a publishing house actually paid for the manuscript, and (3) I was dumb enough to read it. I think I'll take a pass on the author's other efforts."},{"rating":"1","title":"A first try","review":"The general admonition for beginning writers is to write what you know about.

The book is excruciatingly slow: I am on page 340 out of over 500 pages and struggling to finish. Nothing much seems to have happened since the opening scene, and the plot doesn't make much sense. The writing is poor, and the characters are mostly not very interesting or believable. So far, the best word to describe this book is boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Carelessness reigns!","review":"I was really annoyed by the blatant grammatical errors - this book could have been proof-read by a grammar school drop-out! (or perhaps a graduate school student).Doesn't anyone care about correctusage these days? And doesn't anyone know the difference between \\"me\\" and \\"I\\" or \\"can\\" and \\"may\\"?Too, the characteristic soul searching of the protagonists is boring!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and Racist.","review":"I found this book to repetitive. It just keeps going on and on, on how bad Web feels about the death of his 7 team mates. Also, it has harsh racist descriptions on some characters that don't really add to the story at all. It just adds to the stereotype of how life is in Annacostia, Washington DC. One such description is that of the black grandmother of the missing kid. She is described as a big black woman about the sides of a small car with big breast and lives in a house full of rat excrements. I don't recommend this book at all, but if you are a narrow minded white male, who thinks that he is at the top of the hill looking down on the rest, this book is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"a real plodder","review":"Having read only \\"Absolute Power\\" by Baldacci, I wasn't sure what to expect with this latest. Maybe I've read too many Clancy plots, but this one certainly was disappointing. I wasn't even sure I would finish it, finding it so full of cliches and stereotyping that I was aggravated. Seems like the author simply took several \\"in\\" subjects and meshed (or is that messed) them together for a plot that was too complicated.Many characters were shallow, and the two locales of the storyline were also unbelievable. Most irritating of all, however, was that London was so invincible. I will think twice before opening another by Baldacci.Besides that, I again spotted several typos, i.e., words not caught by spellcheck, that should not have been there. At the end, Baldacci thanks a couple of excellent editors for their \\"eagle eye\\" and \\"superb\\" editing. Ha. One more instance of consumers paying for flawed merchandise; glad my copy was from the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time","review":"This review relates to the audio version of Last Man Standing. I listened to 22 hours of this book only find it had the worst ending ever. The budding romance that had been developing throughout the book, even up to the last chapters, died so suddenly that I was sure there was more to come, until the reader's next words were, \\"The End.\\" It was as if David Baldacci got tired of writing this book and decided to finish it off quickly. This was my first attempt at a David Baldacci and I think it will be a long time before I get the courage up to read/listen to another. My sympathies to anyone currently listening to this story."},{"rating":"1","title":"TV in words","review":"I had read Absolute Power and enjoyed it, but either I have moved on from the genre, or this book is not very good. I kept getting the sense I was reading TV scenes and dialogue, that Mr. Baldacci was writing a screenplay. I also thought the book was too long, mostly so that more scenes could be written.Just like with James Patterson, Jonathan Kellerman and others that turn out a lot of books, I think that the author suffers from too much writing and ends up relying on cliches (and there are plenty), thin plotlines and simplistic characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"So sorry. Usually, I love this author but this novel was a major disappointment for me. Web, the main character was boring and the book way too long."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Hollywood Movie","review":"I'll make this review short and to the point, unlike the book. It's totally cheesy. Hollywood will most likely get a hold of this one. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointingly Weak Effort","review":"Having read all of Baldacci's books, I looked forward to another great read, but ended up suprisingly disappointed at this weak effort. It seems that Baldacci packed as many story lines into this one as he could possibly think of -- which were both uninteresting and unbelievable -- then expounded on them in repetitious detail (seemingly to show off how much he knows about so many things), only to have them all come together in an all-to convenient and unconvincing ending. Even more disappointing were the 2-dimentional characters and equally flat dialog. It's hard to believe that this is the same author who penned such rich characters, settings, and plots in his other novels. I only hope his future efforts return to prior form. Skip \\"Last Man Standing\\" and wait for the quality stories we have come to expect from Baldacci. In the meantime, try reading Vince Flynn, starting with \\"Term Limits\\" ... you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful...","review":"How I managed to finish this book is beyond me. I've read \\"Split Second\\" and kind of assumed that Baldacci's other works would be similar: fast-paced, enjoyable airplane read. Shame on me. This book was slow and dull.This has to be one of the longest, more painful \\"thrillers\\" I've ever read. My main problem with this is the scope of the book. In my opinion, Baldacci tried to take on entirely too much, too many twists, too many characters, etc. In the end I just didn't care. The characters were lifeless and stereotypical, and not a single one stuck out to me. He tried to be be a bit Clancy, with a dash of Grisham topped off with some Dan Brown, and it didnt' work.I just can't, in good conscience, allow anyone else to read this book, it was that bad. However, I have enjoyed \\"Split Second\\" so if I get the opportunity to read his other stuff from a library, I may take it, but never again will I have the patience that I did with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Baldacci Has Lost The Knack","review":"Nobody could get this book published unless he was already a best selling author. I believe this is the worst book by any multiple-published author in the past 20 years. He fulfilled is publishing contract but not he hopes of his regular readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Last Man Standing","review":"Having read all of Baldacci's book I was disappointed in the quality of this story. It was an unbelievable plot and insulting to the reader. Maybe the author needs to take a rest from \\"thrillers\\" and go back to writing books more like \\"Wish You Well\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Run Of the Mill","review":"I'll summarize the deficiencies of this book shortly. The plotting, while complex, is not believable; too many rugs are pulled out from under the reader, there are too many laughable twists at the end, and too many cartoonish villains. This last problem is one shared by the rest of Baldacci's characters: in a book centered around the protaganist's psyche, he and everyone around him seems absurd, too damaged to function, and too interested in promoting the author's own political musings on the side. The technological and organizational detail is flavorless and lengthy. Finally, the thing that killed the novel for me was the prose. Muddy, clunky, unpolished, unedited--for a specific example look at the number of times he uses the word \\"however\\" unnecessarily in the middle of a sentence. It was an infuriating verbal tick of his, and it just made everything else stand out that much more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bummer","review":"I can't believe this is the same guy that wrote 'Saving Faith'. It is probably the worst book I've read in ten years. It is so convoluted not to mention totally improbable, that I got to the place where I didn't even care how it turns out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining Story held my interest until the end","review":"I thought overall that this was an interesting and well written book. The psychological intrigue was more interesting than the action storyline and there are some unpredictable twists coming at the end. I was entertained by this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"An enjoyable read","review":"Last Man Standing was a nice easy read. The twisted tale of Web London and HRT made it so I could barely put the book down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but a little immature","review":"I've read almost all of Baldacci's work, and in some sense I'm impressed with his writing. He does his research, you can't discount that, yet most of his books up to \\"Last Man Standing\\" have been repetative, with much of the same plot. I found this a refreshing and new side to Baldacci, and enjoyed it very much, was unable to put it down, in fact.The only two things which kind of threw off the potential for this to be an exceptional book, was his naive way of explaining things. I found it to be a tad annoying at times, but overall good.I also feel that the end could have been different, but I give this five stars because it's definitely a worthwhile read."},{"rating":"1","title":"dont buy this book","review":"after writing several fun earlier books this writer needs to take a couple of years off, no wit, no surprise, no suspense, full of derived characters and situations from other series, all the gears show, dont buy this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Textbook writing.","review":"I've read textbooks that were more entertaining. Reading a novel is supposed to be fun. The long boring paragraphs that take up half a page would have put me to sleep if I had not given up after page 12.

Last Man was my first for this writer--and my last."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst 'thriller' I've ever come across.","review":"Unbelievably bad. Many of the characters have laughable names, there's repetition of the plodding plot for readers too dumb to keep up, a lot of it is predictable and the writing is so bad there are exclamation marks sprinkled here and there to remind you that you should be excited.

Hats off to Baldacci. This is virtuoso writing and I thoroughly enjoyed every page."},{"rating":"1","title":"ANNOYING","review":"This book disappointed me. Getting through it was like walking through thick, deep mud with cement shoes. Even though it had all of the ingredients to make a compelling and riveting read, Baldacci just couldn't combine them to make it so. A page turner? Yes, if you count the times I simply turned pages without reading them to finally get back to the story because he wanders off into pointless and boring details not relevent to the plot. Another annoyance in the story was how in one chapter Baldacci will relentlessly remind the reader of how the characters are macho-can-kill-with-thier-hands-studs. Then suddenly you are reading that these men of the elite Hostage Rescue Team are really so sensitive they can be brow-beaten by their wives and can't cope with the stress and violence of thier jobs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to his standards","review":"I have read and enjoyed most of Baldacci's books.

So many twists and turns that I think even he got lost."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this book at all costs!","review":"I read and enjoyed Absolute Power so when I started Last Man Standing I couldn't believe it was so bad. The characters are cartoonish, the plot is stupid beyond belief, the ending wraps up all the loose ends in a way that sounds like an A Team episode! I forced myself to finish it hoping that there would be something to it, there was'nt. I laughed out loud during the climatic sceene.This has to be one fo the worst books ever!This dog gets one star because you can't go lower"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best of Baldaaci","review":"The Last Man Standing is disappointing. The hero is so interested in what has happened to him and his own self-analysis is so detailed that it's hard to maintain any real interest. Baldacci's previous books were page turners. This one sat around for a long time waiting to get a page turned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Story that is rather slow to unravel","review":"This book took about 100 pages before it really captured my interest. However, even then, there are just too many subplots and details to make this a fun read.Given the way the story unfolds, it's almost amazing that Baldacci was able to tie up almost all of the loose ends in the final 100 pages.You can tell that Baldacci is a very talented writer, but subtelty is not part of his repertoire. This story was more complex than it really needed to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"2.5 Stars maybe. Falls Apart at the End","review":"Okay, so you're willing to suspend your disbelief and give the central character all the tough-guy attributes coming to him in this kind of novel, but the end of the story is even hard to swallow given your aforementioned acceptance of his SuperCop status.Look elsewhere for compelling tough-cop fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah","review":"Is David Baldacci a good writer?

The story was so contrived and far-fetched, it was cartoonish. Baldacci is a pale [copy] of the best writers of this genre, such as Clancy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Baldacci stumbles","review":"I have really liked all the other Baldacci books I have read, but this one didn't come close to his usual standard.-To me, the opening scene was related poorly, without clear details about the surroundings. The city wasn't named and the only description of the physical surroundings was \\"refrigerators scattered about prevented vehicles from approaching the building.\\" This lack of detail gave the whole thing a surreal effect and a \\"Mad Max\\" kind of science fiction feel that took me a while to shake.-His government characters and descriptions made me feel that he was trying to be Tom Clancy instead of David Baldacci-The street language used by some characters came off completely unrealistic.-The plot is so convoluted that by the end each twist generates a weary sigh of frustration rather than a quickened pulse of excitement.Although I was far beyond caring what happened to this contrived array of characters, I did read until the end to see how this train wreck resolved itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utterly Predictable","review":"Just finished this novel - my first by Balducci. The action scenes are okay but spaced very far apart. The suspense is practically nonexistent given the predictability of every move in this book. Balducci tried to throw in twists at the end which are lame and feel to have been concocted just to tie in absurd story lines. Don't bother with this one. For great mystery/detective novels, I highly recommend the earlier works by Robert Crais and Michael Connelly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful!","review":"There may be all of the elements of a good story here, but it got lost in the telling. I found the writing to be confusing, the characters to be without depth and the plot to be aimless.

You could have cut the book down by about 200 pages and it would have been a great book. I gave it four stars because overall it was good, but had too many fillers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"My first Baldacci book, which lead me to read ALL of his books. Action-packed mystery....awesome!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Suspenseful","review":"I have a 60 minute drive to and from work every day so I \\"read\\" countless books on CD. Mostly, I listen to these books to stay awake so I'm always looking for something fast and exciting that I don't have to think hard to comprehend at 5:30 am. This book was the perfect fit. The characters are developed, but not too deeply where it's confusing who is who, etc.. Unlike other thrillers that I've read, you really begin rooting for the main character because of the opening scene. Big F is a great character too that always keeps you guessing.I recommend this book definitely as a way to get the blood flowing a little bit in the morning or at night."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre and Long","review":"The book has a good setup. You've got a elite Hostage Rescue Team at the FBI that gets utterly wiped out in a mysterious surprise ambush and one man happened to freeze and survive. That makes two big mysteries and there are another few piled on top of it.Unfortunately the characters aren't as formed as you'd like and it makes it hard to get attached to them. In fact, almost all the male characters turn out to be your classic tough guy with a kind sensitive interior and tragic past. I found myself just waiting to find out what the next character's childhood issue would be.The book does its best to pull up a surprise ending by forcing a few disparate stories to become strangely connected.The book is okay as an action/suspense read. I was entertained throughout, but not moved or inspired in the slightest. I finished unattached to any of the characters and somewhat annoyed at the way four or so plotlines just kind of loosely fall together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunately Long and Boring","review":"I have read all of Baldacci's books and was incredibly disappointed by this latest novel. The book was choppy, did not flow well, and was incredibly too contrived. I have never read a book where everyone was bad in one way or another and everyone had something to do with it. There are no good characters, I did not even like Web London very much. The only character I enjoyed was Romano and unfortunately we did not see enough of him. The 200 or so pages in the middle of the book were slow moving and uninspired; just filler. The scenes on the horse ranch were boring and I found that I had to force myself to finish the book, expecting some major surprise. Unfortunately, no major surprise came. The main bad guy is too predictable and you figure him out when he is first introduced."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't 'Stand' any more! (1.5 stars)","review":"My first(and probably last) David Baldacci novel. I gave it an extra half a star for at least starting off well, with an interesting premise, and some believable action scenes and character motives. Then, apparently Baldacci took a long lunch, and let that room full of monkeys bang away on typewriters until they'd finished the story!Way too many characters, subplots and 'Bet you thought we'd forgotten about THIS!'-style twists and revelations tacked onto the end of the story. Most of the characters and their dialogue, are corny and forgettable. By the time I reached the end, I just didn't care how any of it fit together.The guy who suggested that anyone who likes this book should try reading Harlan Coben was insulting Harlan Coben. As cliched as Coben's books are, Baldacci surpasses him in stilted prose, and stale cliches."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak Plot, Cheesy Characters and Dialogue","review":"If you like a thriller, this is probably an OK book. However, the dialogue and characters are embarrassing--every male character is either enormous, unbelievably handsome, or has been through more firefights than they can count. Nowhere does the plot or dialogue feel realistic, and about halfway through the book the effort to suspend disbelief gets to be a real struggle. Come on--spotting a glint off of rifle scope 1,000 yards away in the woods, just in time to get out of the way? Coolly observing that the sniper must be using (among other things) a 10 power scope?? Very cheesy for anyone who's actually been around firearms at all.That sort of reflects the entire book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"I am a great fan of Baldacci's other novels but this one is bad. It has tons of boring details, too many unloveable characters, and an ending I didn't like. It was very hard for me to finish it and when I had, I wished I hadn't bought it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A bit long on detail","review":"I have read all of Baldacci's later books. You can definitely tell this is an early work. There is a significant amount of detail and \\"setting the stage\\" in this book. I definitely think it could have been shorter and been a bit better. He just seemed to ramble on about things that were'nt necessarily needed in the book. Plot was great, and I enjoyed it, but it was just a bit long."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing in this book rings remotely true","review":"I've been entertained by Balducci's past books, most notably The Winner, and I can accept a certain amount of fantastic plotting as well as the next person. However, the magnitude of convoluted plotting and superhuman heroics dumped on the unsuspecting reader in Last Man Standing goes over the line. The hero, an improbably named Web London, is an FBI hostage rescue expert who lives with bordeline psychosis and the ability to heal from his repeated life-threatening wounds. He is the only man to survive an ambush and drags his survivor guilt thoughout the remainder of the book like the carcass of a moose. Balducci is clearly riding on his reputation in this maddening book."},{"rating":"1","title":"LAST MAN SNORING","review":"THIS HAS TO BE THE DULLEST BOOK OF 2001.

THE DENOUMENT OF THIS SIMPLISTIC REVENGE PLOT IS SO PREDICTABLE AND DISAPPOINTING IT MADE ME WONDER WHO EVER EDITED THIS?

At least the book is a fast read. However, after 400 pages of set up, the hero solves the mystery involving about 5 different bad-guy characters in less than 10 pages. My favorite part is when Web discovers someone may have tried to kill him by finding a wound from a tack(!) on a horse's back twelve hours after the event. Give me a break!!!! You could not find a tack wound on a poodle 12 hours later. As I said, this book is a quick read, but be careful if you have a sixth grade education or higher."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck...","review":"Slow, tedious, drawn-out...

I picked up on that quite awhile before it was revealed but there were still many surprises and complexities to the plot that at the end of the day had me involved and intrigued. Baldacci creates a host of rich characters in \\"Last Man Standing\\", and I am quite surprised at the relatively weak rating it has here. I mean it is a true page turner, and I can't see how many readers would disagree with this fact. Although many obviously have. Maybe not Baldacci's best novel, but far from his worst as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Macho For His Gun","review":"I have read and enjoyed Baldacci (The Winner, Saving Grace...) but this book is shallow, filled with high caliber guns and the muscle-headed lawmen who love them. It is almost silly and laughable at times. I felt somewhat embarrased by the languaging and style of the writing. I left this story hoping that the simpleminded characters were not in any way indicative of actual FBI and police, but were just artifacts of a too-fast effort on the authors part. Recommendation: leave it behind on the shelf, and hope the author does not become another Clancy, he seemed capable of much more in earlier efforts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extraordinarily Awful","review":"This is perhaps the worst book I have ever finished. The only reason I read it all the way through is that I was on vacation in a non-english-speaking country and had nothing else with me.This book reads like the fantasy of a gun-obsessed 10 year old boy. The characters are, without exception, cliches. Everyone is the best of the best at what they do -- super-elite hostage rescuers, graduating at the top of their class from ivy league institutions, world-class horse breeders, the best drug dealer around.The plot makes absoutely no sense and is slowed down by numerous digressions into wholly irrelevant material, like computer cookies, horse trailers, and target practice.I like books like this, but I will never ever read a David Baldacci book again. The author should be ashamed of himself for putting out this embarrassing piece of trash."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but too long!","review":"Baldacci writes a good story but at 548 pps it is too long because he goes into detail on any thing that comes up:guns,cars,horse farming,functions of FBI units. I'm surprised he didn't spend 25pps on Viet Nam. I enjoyed the plot and subplots, the characters, and all the action but the bookshould be about 400 pps long. i wasglad to put the book down just torest my mind. The main character isWeb London, the last man standing.He is a member of the Hostage Rescue Team or HRT. There is a lotof action and murders or killings but you won't know why until the end. Drug lords are at each other'sthroats to make money on Oxycontin.a prescription drug sweeping intothe cities. Web and his partner,Paul Romano, are using their ownmethods to complete their assignments and ferret out the plans made by psychiatrists and drug runners and even higher-ups in the FBI. This is a good read but be prepared to plod thru the dullpages to get into the action,"},{"rating":"2","title":"Engaging Work","review":"Last Man Standing spins a complex web of deceit, psychological drama, action, and, oddly, non-traditional family bonds. The book is fast paced and weaves a very complex story with well developed characters and a realism that is rare among techno-thrillers. The author drops hints throughout the book leading to an awesome conclusion. Just when you think you have the story resolved, Baldacci sends you on another even more intriguing tangent.I particularly like the ending of the book. Baldacci seems to write with a real world perspective -- in other words, the hero does not ride off into the sunset with all issues resolved. Rather, the hero remains human even after the conclusion.Excellent book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"What a waste of time. This book is good for one thing. It reminded of something I need to work on. My stubbornness. Sometimes I can be just too stubborn for my own good. When I was reading this I just wouldn't quit and had to go all the way to the end. This will teach me. Thank you Mr. Baldacci!Here is a synopsis of the book: \\"A\\" is the biggest strongest man in the world. No way! \\"B\\" is the biggest strongest. How can they be if \\"C\\" was in the most awesome group of men in the world? Then they try to catch a bad guy who thinks he is the biggest, strongest and smartest of them all. Thank you again David!This would have received a 1 star except I was reminded of the lesson I needed."},{"rating":"1","title":"This fish bowl Pagoda killed my Beta fish.","review":"I bought this decoration for my Beta fish. One day I found him stuck in a hole, his scales torn to shreds by the sharp edges. He died a few minutes later. Please look for decorations that are not sharp. Just because it is for aquariums does not mean it is safe for your fish."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Globe sessions will take you on an amazing ride","review":"I waited impatiently for the new Sheryl Crow album to come out and upon returing to my home with cd in hand I laid back and was blown away by Ms. Crows third album The Globe Sessions. For anyone who is still debating on getting the new album run out this moment and buy it because songs such as There goes the Neighborhood, Crash and Burn, and Riverwide will drive you insane(in a good way). Sheryl Crow has definately proved herself to everyone who thought she wasnt going to be around that long. I can't wait to see her win a few more grammys."},{"rating":"2","title":"The hits just keep coming! A Grammy Nominee for sure!","review":"Not necessarily better than the last two but it is as good. Definitly a few hits here. \\"The Difficult Kind\\" will be on the charts for sure as well as \\"There goes the Neighborhood\\", \\"Anything but Down\\" and of course \\"My Favorite Mistake.\\" This is a Grammy Nominee for sure. There is lots of good listening here. It has been in my CD player for two days now. Please someone pass on the good word to Sheryl for me if you have a connection. Can hardly wait for the next CD at the rate she is producing great music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not compare to previous releases","review":"I cannot put my finger on it but there is something different about this Crow release. It does not have the energy/emotion that her previous CDs had. I only liked a few tracks where as on her previous CDs I liked every single track."},{"rating":"2","title":"One word to describe it...GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Sheryl Crow's The Globe Sessions is really a great CD and worth buying if you like her previous material. Very personal and interesting lyrics and great sounds, pure rock. From the beginning to the end great music. My favorite is There Goes The Neigborhood."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shery Crow just keeps getting better!!!","review":"I own all of Sheryl Crow's cd's. I absolutely love ALL of them!! But i do have to say that my favorite is \\"the Globe Sessions.\\" This cd has all you want and could get out of one cd...the lyrics are just great! I couldn't and still can't stop listening to this cd! I love \\"my favorite mistake,\\" \\"riverwide\\" and \\"members only\\" but of course all of her songs are good! If you like any type of Sheryl Crow music \\"the Globe Sessions\\" is the cd to buy!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Bonnie Raitt wannabe","review":"Sorry folks. I hate to be the voice of that which is negative, but the album is pretty boring and repetitive. A young friend (I'm 50) often lends me his cd's so that I can \\"keep up\\" with what is current. We often agree, but this one is simply \\"second verse, same as the first.\\" Give me Bonnie anyday."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved it all","review":"Usually there are at least one or two songs on a CD that I end up forwarding past because I don't particularly like them. I have not found that to be the case with Globe Sessions. The whole thing is good. I especially enjoy Riverwide. It has a different, poetic quality to it that is uncommon among popular music. This CD always gets me singing along. You won't regret buying it for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty darn good","review":"I would reccomend it to anyone going through a tough break up. It'll make you dwell and fester and angry all over again. Personally, its just what I needed. The songs are personal and poignant. If you're looking for something even remotely perky, you won't find it here. I can't believe I just used the word perky."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sheryl Crow has REAL talent","review":"Sheryl Crow has always been a great song writer, and performer. The more personal content of her newest album, makes her even better. The live cd is absolutely wonderful. The live album is just a woman, a guitar, and a microphone. (with a back-up) She is out there completely raw and exposed during this performance and it is absolutely fabulous. Get the album for \\"The Globe Sessions\\" and then treat yourself to the awsome ability of a truly great live performer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major Disappointment","review":"I loved her Tuesday Night Music Club, and I eventually grew to love her self-titled album, but this is... smurf drivel. I am exceptionally disappointed with the CD. Everything sounds washed out. Some of the lyrics are nearly as nonsenical as the ones on the new Alanis Morisette CD. <shrug>If you liked \\"Favorite Mistake,\\" beware. It's the best of the bunch, by far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sheryl Crow is the best guitarist and singer","review":"I believe that the \\"Globe Sessions\\" the best at the play of Crow because the music is hypotesising. Even if she just one one Grammy that proves that she is the best at what she does. Play music. The more she give music like this a try the better she is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Three hits in a row.","review":"I've loved all 3 of Sheryl Crow's CDs, but especially like the songwriting on this one. Listen to \\"The Difficult Time\\" a few times to realize what a powerful lyricist she is. Great job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"This CD has such of diversity of tracks from the rocky Am I Getting Through I&II to the folky Riverwide. The cover of Sweet Child O' Mine is also excelent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even Better","review":"Adding on Sweet Child o'Mine to the CD officially makes this album perfect. It was incredible before and adding this outstanding cover makes it even better."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"The Globe Sessions\\" is one of the best albums of the year!","review":"After being a huge fan of Sheryl Crow's second self-titled album, I was rather weary of what to expect from \\"The Globe Sessions.\\" What I found was one of the best albums I have ever heard in my life. She moved from the 70's funk-like experimentation on her second album to a masterpiece. \\"The Globe Sessions\\" loses, however, some of those political songs that I learned to love with the exception of a couple, including the hidden song \\"Subway.\\" Never will you hear such haunting songs like \\"Riverwide\\" and \\"Am I Getting Through\\" from any of today's top selling performers. Too cut this short, \\"The Globe Sessions\\" goes above and beyond what Crow has done in the past, and gives her fans the sweetest music too their ears."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Sheryl Crow fan after this CD","review":"Bought a few CDs that have the 5.1 capacity for my car. This was not one of my favorites...guess I am not a SC fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two great artists, one great song","review":"I Just wanted to let everyone know I like BOTH the Sheryl Crow and GNR versions of \\"Sweet Child o' Mine.\\" A Rare case of a remake matching the original."},{"rating":"1","title":"HOW DARE YOU COMPARE sherryl crow to THE GREAT AXL ROSE!","review":"Sherryl Crow is not talented at all. Besides she is not a good performer. Guns n Roses were one of the Greatest of our time, and Sweet Child O' Mine had something to do with that. This album displays little talent, and all the songs are generally the same, and BORING! AXL ROSE shows so much emotion on stage, and in his music. Sherryl Crow DOES'NT EVEN BELONG IN THE SAME SENTENCE AS ONE OF THE GREATS OF ALL TIME!"},{"rating":"1","title":"the cd is listenable..","review":"...its not her best work, tho. And, if a woman was going to do the chick-spin on Sweet Child O Mine, it should have been Nancy Wilson with Heart drilling it. I feel physical pain with Sheryl's version (and, since she included it on this cd, its appropriate to review it)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sheryl's 3rd cool album","review":"This album didn't spawn many Top 20 hits like her first two albums. The biggest hit on this album is MY FAVORITE MISTAKE. I like MEMBERS ONLY because of the awesome lyrics(\\"All the white folks shake their asses!\\"). In the song,all the rich kids and politicians shake their asses also. I also like MISSISSIPPI,CRASH AND BURN and THERE GOES THE NEIGHBORHOOD."},{"rating":"1","title":"i still liked her better as michael jackson's background","review":"all i wanna do was catchy and a couple of other tracks here and there but is this woman tone-deaf or what?that voice is horrible.what happen after doing i just can't stop loving you on stage with michael jackson on the bad tour? i see her playing guitar,bass and writing,producing etc.. she ain't no tenna marie.crow is the perfect name for her uh tone.cuz she doesn't sing she crows really bad and loud."},{"rating":"1","title":"NEVER SHOULD HAVE COVERED GNR!","review":"Sweet Child O' Mine (the Guns N' Roses version) is one of the greatest songs ever! Even people who aren't into hard rock love this song. It is a modern day classic. It contains one of the greatest guitar solos in history as well as one of the greatest intros. In the Sheryl Crow version, they are gone. Also Sheryl Crow's voice isn't nearly as good as Axl Rose's. If you like this version of Sweet Child O' Mine, you should buy Apetite For Destruction and hear the original, it is much much better. Sometimes an artist can cover a song and make it better (Jimi Hendrix covering All Along the Watchtower for example), however Sheryl Crow falls way off the mark with Sweet Child O' Mine. Even my friend, who loves Sheryl Crow, admits the GNR version is MUCH better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another artist gouging the fans....","review":"Well, this re-issue with \\"Sweet Child of Mine\\" on it is nice, except for those of use who bought the album already without that song on it! Let's see, fans are supposed to shell out more money to to pick up a copy with this \\"bone-us\\" track on it. So, Sheryl now joins the ranks of artists reselling the same songs over and over again to loyal fans by adding a \\"bonus\\" track. Shame on you Sheryl Crow."},{"rating":"2","title":"the globe sessions underrated","review":"I agree with all the Amazon customers who thought that editorial on the Globe Sessions was way off beam. Sheryl Crow, on that record as much as the other two records she has put out, writes songs that go from weird and funky to simple and heartfelt, and she has a great voice. Sheryl Crow is often underrated, particularly by men. All I can say is that people who diss her haven't been listening to her records properly, and have not had the pleasure of seeing her live as I have, and so have missed half the point about her. Who are these editors who think they know better than the Grammy committee, her fans, Q magazine, Rolling Stone etc.who think she is very talented?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Versatile and fun--the premiere woman folk-rocker","review":"Sheryl Crow was the industy's best kept secret in the 80's, always in the background of star's like Michael Jackson. With her debut album of Saturday Night Music Club, she emerged and has remained at the top of her game. Most recenlty, she even produced a few songs for Stevie Nicks (of Fleetwoot Mack fame). If Tuesday Night Music Club lived up to it's long title (with tracks that glorified having fun and taking this thing one day at a time) then Globe Sessions personified its title. While staying true to her personality, she ventured to more universal themes. Track #3 \\"Riverwide\\" is a parable, telling the story of a women's reemergence into society aftrer living in the belly of a whale for a year. The song \\"Crash and Burn\\" shows the internal conflict when starting over is the only sane choice, but your heart is still looking behind you.If you like Sara Mac, Janice Joplin, or Jewel, this is an absolute must for your personal collection"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I play her self titled 2nd album over and over & never get tired of it, it's that good. That being said, I was completely disappointed by this album. All the songs are uninteresting and forgettable. Save your money & wait for a (hopefully) better next album."},{"rating":"2","title":"True listening pleasure.","review":"Sheryl Crow's third and most recent effort, \\"The Globe Sessions\\" should be classified as a retrospective. While not exactly a retrospective of Crow's prior work, it's more an acknowledgement of her musical roots/influences and a nod to her musical peers. The first track \\"My Favorite Mistake\\" opens with a sound eerily reminiscent of the Stones' \\"Gimmee Shelter\\". Her second track, \\"There Goes the Neighborhood\\" has an underlying beat suggesting David Bowie's \\"Golden Years\\". And the catchy \\"Mississippi\\" brings to mind Prince's \\"Raspberry Beret\\". \\"Anything But Down\\" sounds like something Chris Isaak would record and a couple other songs sound like fare that Bon Jovi would deliver. What this album may lack in originality on Crow's part it makes up for in true listening pleasure. While I thoroughly enjoyed the album, I must admit I am also most comfortable in an old pair of shoes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stick It To the Loyal Fans Again","review":"A super album, by the single greatest female lyricist and musician of the 90s. The Globe Sessions is a must buy, and a future classic.Nevertheless, once again a record company has chosen to stick it loyal fans (who tend tend to buy initial releases) by re-issuing an album with a bonus track. Well, I've learned my lesson. No longer will I buy new CDs when they hit the shelves, as I did with this one - thereby missing out on \\"Sweet Child\\". Sheryl - if I had your clout, there's no way I'd renew a contract with a company who did this to your most loyal fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sheryl Crows best album","review":"Sheryl Crow over the last decade or so has established herself as one of the top writers in music.Sheryl is somewhat of a throwback to the 70's or possibly the 60's.Sheryl not only writes top folk songs, but can Rock an audience as well.The Globe Sessions is to date, her finest work.Included on the CD are, There Goes the Neighborhood which is one of her better songs.My Favorite Mistake is rumored to be about her fling with Eric Clapton, that did not work out. My Favorite Mistake features some outstanding guitar from her guitarist Peter Stroud.Anything but Down is another great song.The Difficult Kind follows, and features some outstanding harmony as well as fine lyrics. Mississippi is another great song.Sheryl Crow has not only established herself among Rock audiences, she is also establishing herself amongst Country audiences.I remember the first time I heard the CD. I enjoyed it very much and it was a breath of fresh air............you will too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Are you ready to ROCK!","review":"This album is definitely one of Sheryl's finest. A deeply personal album with absolutely incredible song writing. If you can't get enough of soulful rock, get this album. ( Also great party music!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the good stuff.","review":"Sheryl's third and best CD. Her songs have grown more complex and their meaning deeper over time. Sheryl fans will have much to enjoy from this CD, from the haunting \\"Riverwide\\" to \\"Favorite Mistake\\" to \\"Mississippi\\". Very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every song is good; can't figure out why all the bad reviews","review":"I can't figure out all the negativism about Cheryl Crow out there in the review and elsewhere. Just because she has a bluesy and ennui-ridden voice, her music is still great. I listen to this album all the time, and I can't imaging, for example, Linda Rondstadt or, god save us, the ridiculous Cranberries, attempting this combination of blues, rock, fun, reflection, melancholy and mischeviousness. Good job, Cheryl. Keep on this track."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent album","review":"I wasn't a Sheryl Crow fan - until I heard this album. Fantastic work, which has grown on me with successive listens. I'm glad I ignored the Amazon and Spin reviewer comments and listened to the samples - those two reviews are way off base IMO."},{"rating":"2","title":"Emotionally Charged Garage Record","review":"This is a stellar record from Sheryl Crow. I was certainly not expecting this when I first listened to this record. This is one album that is certainly likely to make you think and question your own relationships. Sheryl Crow has such a way with lyrics and they come across beautifully on this record. Such tracks such as \\"The Difficult Kind\\", \\"There Goes The Neighborhood\\" and \\"Am I Getting Through Part I & II\\" are true masterpieces. I love the way that Ms. Crow deviates from her \\"mainstream\\" sound on this record. She didn't make this record for the masses, she made it for herself, and that's what true artists are all about. An excellent offering from Ms. Crow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Globe Sessions really shows Sheryl's talents","review":"The Globe Sessions is one of Sheryl's best cd's yet! It totally ROCKS!! You will fall in love with it the first time you hear it. The lyrics are very catchy and the melodies are awesome! You will most definitely be satisfied with this cd. I as sure as heck was!"},{"rating":"2","title":"She did good","review":"Music review on: The Globe Sessions [ECD] by Sheryl Crow. I thought that her first CD was a little better, but this one is still good. I especially like \\"My favorite Mistake\\", it was one of the reasons why I bought this CD. After I listened to the rest of it, I found myself very interested in her songs. Her songs seem like they have a lot of feelings in them, and at times she may have been trying to get a point across. I think her songs are very original. The songs on this CD vary from upbeat to a slower pace. I think that was a good idea, because depending on what mood your in you can still listen to it. Some other songs featured in this CD are: \\"There goes the Neighborhood\\", \\"Anything but down\\", \\"Mississippi\\", and \\"Members only\\". These, in my opinion, are a great variety of songs with great lyrics to match the beat. Although the CD is not one of the chart toppers, I still think its a great CD. I would recommend it to all Sheryl Crow fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sheryl Crow? A musician? Who'd have thought that?","review":"I do not consider myself a Sheryl Crow fan. I mean, I hated that \\"All I wanna do is have some fun\\" song when it came out. But Sheryl's new album is a remarkable piece of work. Everything from the classic Elvis Costello rock sound of \\"My Favorite Mistake\\" to the angst-ridden grit of \\"It Don't Hurt\\" to the forgotten Bob Dylan tune \\"Mississippi\\" is on this album. For once, Sheryl proves that she is no longer just a pop singer anymore. She has put together some modern-day rock anthems that you won't be able to get out of your head for weeks!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hold on to yourself, this is gonna hurt like hell!","review":"Can we erase this CD and try again! I'm sorry Cheryl but this attempt does not live up to your standards or what I would come to expect from you. Other that a few OK songs I expected more. I am deeply disappointed with this release. But your in good company, Alanis is in the same boat. Have 2 stars faded? Must be that Year 2000 thing! Save your money buy the single, although from what I hear there won't be one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Influenced or Plagerized??","review":"I liked Crow's previous Cd, but I can't say the same for her latest release. The first track \\"My Favorite Mistake\\" seems a lot like Marvin Gaye's \\"I Heard it Through the Grapevine.\\" And the second is a Blondie rip-off. Did Sheryl Crow run out of momentum? Or was she not of her own making in the first place?"},{"rating":"2","title":"TRULY AN EXCEPTIONAL ALBUM","review":"She's done it again. \\"The Globe Sessions\\" is a excellent piece of work displaying her hard work and great vocals. \\"My Favorite Mistake,\\" \\"There goes the Neighborhood,\\" and \\"Anything but Down,\\" are particularly enjoyable. Although, that doesn't compromise the talent of the CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"so bad I threw the CD away at the airport, but....","review":"even though I loved the material, the bored, pretentious, grubby delivery ruined it. She needs to re-release the songs with more attention to the performance.

Don't you think?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing if you compare it to the other albums","review":"Sheryl Crow surprised me with her first two albums, they were groovy and had excellent lyrics. But the new album was disappointing because the songs do not have the \\"freshness\\" that the others had. Only two songs (My favourite mistake\\" and \\"The difficult kind\\") are convincing. Additionally it is a lack that the booklet does not contain the lyrics any more. Sheryl Crow should add them in her - hopefully better - next album."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent album you will play again and again","review":"Congratulations to Miss Crow on another splendid album. Perhaps the songs are not as catchy as her last album, but is more than made up for in her maturity as a singer song writer. Cetainly a must for any Sheryl Crow fan, and those who are not. Very very highly recomended."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD is an excellent CD","review":"After I read all these negative reviews I bought this CD with fear in my heart, but after one listen I found to my relief that this is a great CD. Now it's true that this isn't as good as her first CD but who cares! Why go around comparing one thing to another and all that. Just if you listen to this CD alone without considering all those other factors it's a good CD. The songs and lyrics are all good. Just listen to it on it's own merits. If you liked the other CD's she has done then I think you will probably like this one too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Style is lost on this CD. This ranks as a filler CD.","review":"Sheryl's CD lost the energy of her self-titled CD in 1996. This will be my last purchase of her work unless she changes back to more upbeat tempos. She has a great lead guitar on this CD; too bad he doesn't get to shine with his talents. She needs at least one all instrumental track. I can't listen to the whole CD at once without turning on more upbeat music."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING!","review":"I expected a lot from this album and I got very little. Sheryl's last album was much, much better and more interesting. There are only two songs I like on this CD. You should listen to it, but I think it would be better to borrow it from a friend and then to decide..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't believe the hype!","review":"This is grammy quality material? I don't think so. I got this cd because I heard two different people compare Crow's music to the Rolling Stones. I don't know what they were thinking when they made that comparison. This album doesn't rock; it is a bore with only a highlight or two. \\"My Favorite Mistake\\" and \\"Anything But Down\\" are good but not great songs. \\"Mississippi\\" is a really catchy song, but Sheryl Crow is no Bob Dylan. I'm just glad it was a free selection when I ordered it. I would not recommend it, and I certainly wouldn't give her a grammy for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what you might think.","review":"The album starts out with the hit \\"My Favorite Mistake.\\" But it seems that Sheryl used up all the good stuff on the first song. The rest of the album seems to get draggy. Quite a disappointment compared to her previous work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best from Cheryl (sorry!)","review":"I was elated to recieve this album for Christmas, but was terribly let down at it's content; nothing on this album is as how great her other albums are !!

Incredibly powerful in showing what a beautiful woman she really is. Well worth buying the CD just for the video."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this unless you're already a Sheryl Crow fan","review":"After the excellent Sheryl Crow album, The Globe Sessions is disappointing.

Give the girl credit, she's better than Alanis!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sheryl Crow is a great talent","review":"I just wanted to say that I'm a Gun's n' Roses fan and their 1988 Appetite For Destruction CD is among the best CD's ever recorded by any artist (and, taken as a whole, a lot better than this CD). GNR's Sweet Child of Mine is an all time classic and deserved its number-one spot on the Billboard Charts, but when I first heard Crow's version a few days ago it just blew me away! Her version is better than the original! I love it. One of the few cases where a remade song is equal or better than the original. Keep up the good work, Sheryl!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great CD!","review":"Is this how amazon.com sells CD's, by completely trashing them? This is an amazing album. It may not have the top 40 feel of Tuesday Night Music Club, but it just shows how much Sheryl has grown as a writer. I get the feeling the reviewer has an ax to grind. The Difficult Kind is the most beautiful, haunting song I have heard since Stevie Nicks \\"Gold Dust Woman\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Think She is Moving Towards The Blues","review":"I loved this album, highly listenable for die-hard fans. It can also draw in some new fans, from the beginning. My favorite songs are>>\\"Riverwide\\", \\"It Don't Hurt\\", \\"Anything But Down\\", and the beautiful bluesy ballad \\"The Difficult Kind\\". I think she is maturing more and more, probably until an album of hers explodes with perfection. Some songs are like stray tracks, but it's all good, it is worth your listening."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of rock's most gifted stars.","review":"The Artist Formerly Know As...recently praised Crow and he's right.

What a perfect voice Ernestine Anderson has. When I imagine the perfect female Jazz/Blues singer at some sophisticated club, it would be her. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good performance. Bad DVD.","review":"I remember buying the CD for this show as well as the VHS, back in the late 80's. While it was a great concert then, it seems very outdated today. I would've nonetheless given this DVD a 5/5 hadn't it been for the terrible digital transfer from Grandstand Entertainment.It looks like it was transfered from a second generation source and, to make things worse, the show itself has been compressed to half the total capacity of a single layer DVD. It's overly soft and grainy and the sound is far from enjoyable, as well. I've transfered older VHS tapes to DVD that looked and sounded better than this release! It's no wonder Grandstand Entertainment has since gone out of business...I'll stick to listening to the CD, until a better DVD edition comes along."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, A Bit Dated Though","review":"This is a good concert DVD and worth having if you are a fan of Carly Simon. It was filmed in 1987."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Video","review":"First I love this concert! I have it on VHS and it is on of my favorites. I bought the DVD expecting normal DVD video quality. The concert was certainly duped from VHS without any remastering. The picture quality is actually worse than VHS. I will however, purchase Carly's concert again if it is ever released on Blue ray"},{"rating":"2","title":"CARLY SIMON ~ PURE MAGIC ON MARTHA'S VINEYARD!!!","review":"With its gorgeous scenery in the background, cool breezes blowing across the bay, & the changing colors of the sun over the water it doesn't get much better than this - except for the arrival of the legendary singer-songwriter Carly Simon!!! Here in her magical setting, Carly Simon is at her best - performing her greatest hits in fine form! Standouts include 'Two Hot Girls on a Hot Summer Night' & 'Coming Around Again/Itsy Bitsy Spider', among others! This DVD begs the question: When, oh when, can we get the other Carly videos on DVD?: 'The Concert at Grand Central', 'My Romance', & 'Greatest Hits'!!! Legions of Carly fans want these on DVD!!!!!! She is quite simply the BEST!!!!!!!!! What a MAGNIFICENT concert DVD this is!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Carly in a wonderful concert setting","review":"This 1987 concert at Martha's vineyard is simply wonderful. The songs that Carly has chosen are presented in a casual but heartfelt manner . Her recent albumn at that time and the title track Coming Around Again are done with real emotion and you easily go with Carly on that song. Nobody Does it Better and Your So Vain also are sung by her with great melodic artistry. Simply a must have DVD for any Carly Simon fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Carly's best public performances","review":"Carly Simon is a very talented song writer and an underrated performer. I loved the children participating in \\"Coming Around Again / Itsy Bitsy Spider\\"! Some of her children were a part of the group."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Carly","review":"This is a wonderful Carly Concert, especially considering where it was recorded: The Vineyard, a favorite place, and before a small audience.....since she suffers from \\"stage fright\\", and always has, the venue was perfect for a great performance.I do feel that much of the \\"live\\" concert was dubbed, since background noise is nonexistent....but, I could be wrong..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great concert","review":"My taped copy of the TV broadcast was finally wearing out, and the \\"third party sellers'\\" used DVD's were all extremely expensive. I finally noticed the \\"VHS\\" link on the concert's DVD page and found Amazon has lots of reasonably priced VHS copies being sold by \\"third parties.\\" If the DVD is re-released by the manufacturer I will buy it, but in the meantime I purchased one of the \\"very good condition\\" VHS copies, it plays great and I am once again enjoying this wonderful concert. I've read reviews saying Carly was ill at ease, but to me she sure looked like she was enjoying herself up on stage giving a great performance."},{"rating":"2","title":"fantastic delivery!!!!","review":"Not tried the dvd yet as I bought it for my husband but can I say the delivery is fantastic from this company, will be using them again!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simon: Live From Martha's Vineyard","review":"If you are a Carly Simon fan, this is a MUST HAVE video.

Over 1000 color images in 140 categories! I no longer have to wade through scrores of books to find one or two elephant collectibles I have. Virtually all the elephants have the basic information I am looking for (maker, size, value etc.) and many have much more. The index and resources sections are chock full of places, makers and artists so you canto find out more info. I understand Volume 2 is underway and I cannot wait for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"nanna is wonderful","review":"I love this video. Nanna's technique and philosophy is so unique and simple. She removes the mountain that we create when we think we need to know everything. She simplifies belly dance and shows you what you can do when you learn to do one movement really well. Then she pairs it with another simple movement. This video is challenging in that it has fast transitions and deep muscle movements. (Nanna works from the deeper set of muscles in the abdomen). I really love this artist and this video is one of the best on drum solos that i have seen. It is simple yet challenging and exciting to watch. I look forward to more videos from Nanna. This is a wonderful dvd for all levels of belly dancers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Plain Bull is just plain bull","review":"This book is not poorly written. It is annoyingly written. The author's inflated ego oozes out of every page and makes the book untenable. It is not unreadable, it is simply not enjoyable. If it weren't required reading for a course I am taking, I would not have gotten through the introduction. Other reviews praising this book are from other academia doing that mutual praise thing. BAAAAAD book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice & easy Thai tea","review":"Very easy and tasty Thai tea to prepare.

The product details relates it would fit, a check of all numbers, product style and manufacture said it should fit. There was no way this model was designed for a 1995 Ford Explorer. The details list about 200 vehicles the thing fits so be leery of it because 9 times out of 10 you will be sending it back, also don't throw the box away when you open it because it is a pain to find one that will fit this boom-a-rang looking thing. I paid for it via credit card on Dec 28th, 2007 and still waiting for my account to get credit as of Jan 28, 2008.

Her cast is somewhat \\"cheesy\\" but fun, doesn't make me feel threatened. There are moves that I can't keep up with yet...I'm used to a real aerobics instructor in front of me. Have plenty of time to grow accustomed to the routines. There are a variety of routines to choose from and the music is great!Liked the personal bio. info, as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Turbo Jam is fun!","review":"Make sure you have a bottle of water for this workout!

Not bad at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Workout!!","review":"I love Turbo Jams! I've been doing these workouts for the past year and a half, and I've seen great results. I lost 10lbs in the first couple of months, and toned up too. They are fun & easy to do. I feel like I get such a good workout without overdoing it. I do the 20min workout the most and try to do the others when I can, and I see results. I like all of them, but usually only have time to squeeze in what I can...which is usually enough to at least maintain my progress. So far these are my favorite videos to do.I haven't found anything I like as much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Making exercise fun!!","review":"Not being a fan of the gym I have purchased a lot of exercise videos over the years as a way to keep in shape, and the Turbo Jam videos are by far my favorite. I have owned this video for roughly about 3 years and still enjoy it. This video is a combination of kickboxing, aerobics and dance-the variety keeps it interesting. The music in this video is very high energy and helps with keeping me motivated to continue working out. Charlean (trainer) comes across as being very energetic, positive and fun. With a lot of other videos it seems pretty easy to get annoyed and irritated with some of the things the trainers say but not this one. This is one video that isn't sitting on my shelf gathering dust."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Buy","review":"I always watch infomercials for whatever reason. I'm happy I bought this online through Amazon. Much cheaper and quick turn around (I hear it takes a while to get products directly through the other site).I've been using the DVD for a month straight and it still keeps me challenged. Great workout and great momentum."},{"rating":"2","title":"Turbo Jam Rocks!! Love the Cardio Party!!","review":"I love this video...I have lost 20 lbs. so far and I have been doing the workout for about a month and a half. I will keep on going and check back in later. The music is great and you can override the instructor so you don't have to listen to the comments. The pace is perfect and I don't get bored! Love it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Addictive, fun cardio workout","review":"This program will give you a really good workout. It's fun to do, low impact but really high on energy. At first some parts were a little hard for me to follow. I got the \\"Learn and Burn\\" DVD and that helped with learning the moves. I would not normally fall for informercial products. I'm glad I got this one. It really is as good as they say."},{"rating":"2","title":"Turbo Jam Beachbody 5 Rockin Workout","review":"Chalene Johnson rocks!

It was quick result. And also quick shipping."},{"rating":"2","title":"Addicting!","review":"I figured I would try this after seeing the infomercial a million times. I thought Chalene would be annoying but I was very wrong. The music is great and she is very motivating. I like how the backround people are the same in each video.You have to do the Learn and Burn and get the moves down in order to get the full effect. There are other tapes on the website in addition to these. I plan on getting those as well.Great workout overall. Very fun and never boring!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Received as promised","review":"Received cd in good condition; as well in a quick amount of time. \\"Pleased\\" with the service; would order again from them..."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT FOR ME","review":"Purchase this after my trying the other beachbody regimen, I'm not so impress.

I like the music and the moves are not cheesy."},{"rating":"2","title":"fun yet effective workout","review":"Despite most of the negative reviews this work out is awsome! I started this workout after I gave birth to my twins and it worked great! I often find it hard to stick with a workout DVD because I get bored easily..not the case with this DVD at all. You are getting a great workout and having fun at the same time..I lost 8lbs doing this for a little over a month! The most effective workout Ive tried!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Offers a great workout","review":"I've been using P90X but wanted a different cardio workout. This workout is very fun, and let me tell you, you work up a sweat. For me the hardest part was getting the choreography down, but after doing each workout a couple of times, I knew what to do, and really started enjoying it. The music is fun, Chalene's personality comes off the screen, and I love the fact that when we are working our left side she is working her right side so we are mirroring what she does which I think makes learning the moves so much easier.Once you learn the routines you have the option of turning up the music and not hearing her, but I'm not quite there yet.Anyway, I recommend it. You will need some hand weights for the sculpting workout, depending on your fitness level, anywhere from 1# to 10#.Because I liked Chalene and this workout I actually just ordered her new collection of dvd's called Turbofire, can't wait to receive it."},{"rating":"2","title":"FUN FUN FUN","review":"This DVD is just awesome. The CD had no scratches, played right away in the DVD player and very smoothly too.As far as the workouts ? They are super fun. ITs great that you can decide which one to do (the 20min if youre short on time, or 45min if you want to tone up as well, or the AB jam to add definition to your abs). The music for each workout is great, it keeps you going and going and going. YOu forget youre working out, literally. And Chalene is just great at keeping you motivated. She's funny, silly and doesnt have a \\"shoot me now or shut up\\"voice while you listen to her, as other DVD trainers I have experienced with (i.e P90x or Jill Michaels).Definitely worth $20, all the way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Workout king","review":"This video was horrific and way overpriced. Go with insanity or better yet just do your moms aerobics instead, you'll save money and get in better shape."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME WORKOUT!!!","review":"I just finished doing the learn and burn which is the first workout of the DVD set. Wonderful!! If the 15 minute basic workout made me bust into a sweat, I can only imagine the rest of the workouts!! The instructor, Chalene Johnson, is dynamic and motivating.
