ALBUM EVER","review":"I've been down with P.O.D since Warriors EP in 1997. They've released some AWESOME stuff over their time BUT I can't believe people rated this CD with 5 out of 5 stars! This is a horrible album - Will You is by far the best track, but it's doesn't touch The Southtown, Alive, Satellite...etc (the list goes on) Satellite is FAR superior to this album! Infact, it's so superior, it's like a totally different band recorded it. Marcos [leaving/getting kicked out] sure has taken it's toll. This self-titled album is like an album of b-sides! Hopefully their next album with Jason will deserve a 5 out of 5 star rating. Until then, I suggest you spend you money on their previous albums: Satellite, then Fundamental Elements."},{"rating":"1","title":"too many \\"warriors\\" here","review":"I am not a \\"warrior\\" but Satellite almost had me converted. Unfortunately, gone are the rap-metal powerhouse anthems like \\"Boom\\" and \\"Messenjah\\" - to be replaced by harmonies that seem sleepy, and sing-songy. I'm not calling for a rap-metal resurgence (indeed, Sonny's laryngeal gargling on \\"Wildfire\\" immediately got my heart a-pumpin'), but one listen to the first single quickly illustrates the album's greatest weakness. Following the shouted \\"WILL YOU!!\\" with the plaintively sung, \\"love me tomooooorrow?\\" drains the shout of all its power. Now go back and compare that effect to the relentless build-up of \\"Messenjah.\\"\\"But Whisky,\\" protests the Warrior; \\"everything you say just underscores the message!\\" Fine, then: knock yourself out over the message. But the sad truth is this album simply does not rock."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the finest albums yet by a very gifted group","review":"Hands down this is the best compilation of music that P.O.D. has ever written. Their mixture of reggae and rock on this album, not to mention the new guitarist, has created an absolutely astonishing album. The first and probably obvious difference is the guitar works. Jason Truby has a very completely different style than Marcos. Marcos' style had a much more \\"soul vibe\\" to it but still very rock. However, Truby has brought a much more rock style to the table. I really liked Marcos' solos better but Truby has his style as well and is very good to. I really want to congratulate P.O.D. because they have seriouslly done a good job. The bottom line is this; buy it because it is definitely worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"POD is back with a better sound!!!","review":"Okay i dont know why so many people are hating this album. Personally i think its one of the best rock cds ive heard this year!! It rocks a hell of a lot harder than Satelite, its definately not soft rock like some people would have you beleive. Through the whole cd you can feel the intense energy in all the songs, then the final track leaves you calm and satisfied. Since i love the guitar, i would buy this cd just for the last song. Its one of the best instrumental songs ive ever heard. So if you like good ol' rock then dont listen to other people and go get this cd!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly Disappointing!","review":"If you're a fan of old-school P.O.D., this album is probably not for you. Since their last release, the boys from the big S.D. booted their long-time guitar player, Marcos Curiel, for unclear reasons. Despite adding Jason Truby of Living Sacrifice fame, they fail to create anything fresh or exciting on this highly disappointing release.P.O.D. is notorious for evolving their sound from each album to the next and their ability to mix various musical genres. However, without Curiel, P.O.D. has lost much of their hardcore punk and Latin influences. What remains is positive radio-rock, some rap, and a lot of cheese-ball pseudo-reggae. The result is a recording that sounds a lot more like 311 and Pax 217 than P.O.D., yet lacks any sense of maturity, energy or direction.Hopefully Jason Truby will find his voice in P.O.D. by their next release and bring some of his metal background to the table."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better with listening","review":"Much of what some of these reveiewers are saying is true, this is a \\"quiter\\" album than satellite. The riffs are not as memorable and it is not as edgy, but that is not a bad thing. One of the reviewers said \\"stick to the formula\\", give me a break, if bands did not experiment and grow music would get awfully stale. This is a very good album that gets better with repeat listening. It does not have songs that quite reach the impressiveness of the first 5 tracks on satellite, but as a whole it might be a more well rounded and solid album. After the first five tracks on satellite (which are so good it is hard to keep pace) the albums quality nosedives. Here, however the song quality is consisitant and tight. Check out \\"Change the world\\" and \\"Waiting on today\\". And \\"Revolution\\" stands beside the great cuts from the previous album. A worthy effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"hey this is really good!","review":"I just got the album from a friend of mine a couple of weeks ago and I gotta tell you, it is great. This album I thought in my opinion beat satellite because I wasn't really down with pod rap/rocking but this was more straightforward to rock and this is a very good thing for them. Sonny's voice is what made me like this album so much. He has improved on it big time on this album. Songs that stick to me most are \\"Asthma\\" \\"Find my way\\" and \\"executing the grounds\\". The only song I disliked was \\"Will you\\" because he says the same thing like 10 times in a row. Don't let this be a bad reason not to get this because all the other songs are really good and its only just that one song I personally dislike. So if you decide to get this cd go ahead because its worth the money and you'll discover the changes and how much better it sounds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best CD","review":"I went to mass...I'm not Catholic and later that day I played the cd. I listened to it non stop for over a week. There was a song on the cd that directly corresponded to the message I heard that day at mass. P.O.D. rocks and they are challenging 311 for the spot of my fave band and this is my 1st P.O.D. purchase. Get the cd! You can play this anywhere..parties..home..or a liberal church.

On one hand, as a P.O.D C.D., I'ts pretty mediocre. However, as an album alone, It's good. this album is very different than all other albums. This is probably due to the fact that the old guitarist left, replaced by Trubee. I'ts Not, by a long shot, a good P.O.D album, but standing alone, is worth the fifteen dollars.(but why is the DVD for PS2 only? why not Xbox?)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Below Average","review":"Wildfire is the only song that really stuck out to me on this album. Overall the remainder of the songs contained stale lyrics and below average music that was a bit on the dull side. Uninteresting. I don't recommend buying it unless you need a cure for insomnia."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely Horrible","review":"I am at a loss of words on how bad this album is. I was Hoping that it would be as good as satellite. Boy I was waaaay off. There isn't one solid, good song on the album. I was so disappointed. My advise, waste your money on something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"To Jah","review":"First, i was reading through the 'Reviews' and i read a little thing written by Daniel saying \\"Jah is hebrew for God\\" and well i just think that it is a very dumb thing to say... \\"Jah,\\" which was actually the word used for God by the originators of reggae music. , you know... the Jamaicans, SORRY DANIEL(thats why the word is used)! Not Sonny, even though he tried hard to sound like he was(Jamaican).P.O.D. disapointed me alot this time around... srry. Buy P.O.D. greatness: Fundemental Elements of South Town / Brown / Satelite... Why not all 3?! Pretty much everything P.O.D. has done before this...Asthma, Will You, Space, and Change the world; They can hang, but BARELY !!!! Maybe even Revolution, if i listen to it alittle more..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simpy Amazing","review":"This CD...like the title says is amazing. I had very high expectations for this Cd for a few reasons. One, because of Will You. After hearing the first single I was even more psyched than I already was. The next reason is for the reviews I read and what P.O.D. was saying about it...all said that this was the best P.O.D. had put out...ever. Then the final reason is because of Satellite and how much of an amazing album that was. Well, when I purchased the CD and listened to it...it blew all my expectations away. This is by far the best CD P.O.D. has EVER put out and is one of the best albums of the year. All the songs on this CD are awesome, including the 6:30 instrumental Enternal. From begining to end this CD does not disappoint. If you liked Satellite go out and get this CD...NOW!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of P.O.D.'s Best!","review":"Even better than the Previous album Satellite that first made them Famous!

P.O.D. have pretty much completey abandonned their rap-metal fusion on this album. Although there is a hint of it on the album-opening track \\"Wildfire\\", the rest of the album is rapless.This album is way more melodic than previous P.O.D. releases, which is its greatest strenght, and at the same time its biggest flaw. Although P.O.D. is good at writting nice melodies, after a while, one starts to miss the raw grungy style that would appear on previous albums.On this album you don't get the wild screaming you would get in songs such as \\"Set it Off\\" and \\"Lie Down\\", but there are still enough heavy riffs to keep any metal fan satisfied.If it was P.O.D.'s \\"grunginess\\" that you liked, this album will disappoint you; if it's there passion and awesome riffs you enjoyed, then this album is a must-buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Takes getting used to...","review":"When I first heard about this cd, I heard it was gonna be the heaviest P.O.D. cd ever, escially with the addition of Truby, the new guitarist from Living Sacrifice. I'll tell you right now...it is not really all that heavy at all. It is a very different sound for P.O.D., but it is still good stuff. I'll admit, when I first listened to the cd, I hated it. But after I played it through a few times, I grew to love it. As for getting rid of the reggae crap...? That \\"reggae crap\\" is what makes P.O.D. who they are, and not some regualar rock band nowadays. It makes them unique, and they are stongly influenced by reggae (if you watch the DVD you'll find this out), so I wouldn't expect it to change. Give the cd a chance and I'm sure you'll like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"HUGE DISSAPOINTMENT","review":"I expected alot more from this album. I thought the band would be better with truby since the first song they did was for the matrix, that song was unbelievable. So, I was expecting an awesome album. When I heard the song \\"will you\\" I thought it was ok and it grew on me. It turns out that when I got the cd, \\"Will You\\" was the best song on the album. That was just a decent song. I was crushed. POD is my favorite band. If you liked their other cds then dont get this one. Unless you want to pay 11 bucks for 1 good song."},{"rating":"1","title":"There's So Much Better Out There...","review":"I think it's safe to say that P.O.D. is a band of yesterday. Not that record sells really tell anything about how talented the artist is (otherwise Usher's CD wouldn't have sold a million copies in a week), but I think everyone knows that the style of music this band does is dead and gone. And the DVD is nothing special. It just shows that everyone in the band except the new guitarist is a wigger and they spend a lot of the time either watching break dancers or showing off their lowriders. And no one in the band is really too interesting to watch. No funny moments, much unlike the new Primus DVD. So, I suggest you avoid this album, because I wasted $14 on it, and it would still be alright if they didn't add all those bulls*it reggae influences into it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best (Sale Priced) C.D I've Ever Bought...","review":"I saw this on sale at Target for 10.98 and decided to give it a listen.

In the first single \\"Will You\\" the singer displays an annoying whiny screech. And the rest of the album is more of the same. I also hate the reggae sh*t they put in their music.

Awesome band, awesome lyrics and message, awesome guitar playing. I loved ETERNAL at the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better then satellite","review":"Even though satellite may have been more of a success i still think that this new self titled album by p.o.d is their best effort yet. What makes this such a great album is that fact that it's just 12 good hard rock songs on one cd and the fact that it has more of a reggae influence doesnt seem to be a problem. Sattleite was just inconsistent and most ot the songs had a rap metal sound to them but this album delivers straight hard rock. The inclusion of a new guitarist also means that the guitar riffs are spiced up and sound better. On the whole this is a much better album then the previous one."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst pod cd to date","review":"It looks like the departure of POD guitarist Marcus left the band with no where to go but downhill.

I felt gay vibes from it after halfway through the book. They story line was bogus.

It's not scream your head off scary (more of a spine-tingler), but I mean, just the prospect of your family wanting to kill you is a given heart-pounder.I like Yu Watase's manga because no matter how sewrious the atmosphere is, you can laugh at the hilairious expressions of the characters. Plus, the boys in Yu Watase's manga are always super hot...like Yuhi and Toya, for example. I may be crazy, but I think that Yuhi is a bit cuter than Toya...I like his hair.(shut up brain, shut up.)

It did take about 3-4 minutes to assemble/set up, but is well worth it. The game moves along quickly and is quite fun. I like that the game does not require batteries as well. The object of the game is to make it through the spooky mansion and reveal the villain dressed up as a ghost. Each time a player spins the spinner, the number of spaces is either on a tombstone or a ghost. If you get the ghost, you must press the ghost down at the top of the mansion. This action causes the staircase to shake, a trap to lift and fall, a moose head to knock you over and many more fun traps.The ages on the box say 5 and up, but as long as your child can count, and spin a spinner, they can basically play the game. They may require some adult assistance to know what spot on the game board to return to if they get thrown off of the board, aside from that, this is a great family game!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome toy for Scooby Doo fans","review":"Just purchased this for my 8 year old son's birthday. We've had fun with it already. In particular, there are design concerns in older reviews. This appears to have been handled well. Our toy is well constructed. All the moving parts and \\"traps\\" work well and vary when they occur, which is cool. Also - with two people, the game is over relatively quickly (10-15 minutes) so it's fun, but also not a long drawn out affair (a plus for parents!) My son was over the moon when he saw it. He was able to assemble it completely himself. A good addition to our games."},{"rating":"1","title":"this game is a pain","review":"My daughter is 5 and loves games and Scooby Doo. She got this for Christmas, and even she does not enjoy it because it is so flimsy. Pieces fall off when you attempt to play. The premise is silly also. Well, I guess Scooby Doo in general is silly, but the game board fall apart at every turn and it is so frustrating to play."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like Totaly Worthless","review":"Please spare yourself the agony of this poor excuse of a toy. I can't say enough bad things. Took my wife 1 hour of trying to put together before she gave up. I managed to get it together in about 20 minutes. Beware, you will need a micro scope to read the directions. It's so small an un-legible there may as well be no directions.Once the game is together it's very flimsy and poorly bilt. This game was obviously never tested by children when it was being produced. B/c had it, it never would have been made. I couldn't even push the ghost on top down without pieces of the game falling apart. Forget a kid doing it.My 2 boys are huge Scooby Doo fans. They couldn't wait to play it. Even my 5 yeard old is quoting as saying, \\"this game's a piece of junk.\\"Save your kids the disapointment and stay far away from this garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lack of durability is upsetting","review":"Although the Scooby-Doo board game was fun initially, it quickly lost its appeal when we soon realized that the pieces don't hold together that well at all. The back walls come loose and fall down constantly as do the snake stairs. It's nearly impossible to get past the snake stairs because almost every time you get on them, you have to press the ghost down and then you fall off them. The snake stairs also come apart from the frame of the game and you have to try to assemble them again. We decided to keep it together all the time instead of disassembling it and putting it back in the box every time we were done with it, but that didn't prevent us from having to assemble it each time we wanted to play with it and having to assemble it several times during the game as well.All in all, very poor quality and craftsmanship and just an annoyance to play. The bother far outweighs the educational and entertainment benefits."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great fun if you like to waste your time and money","review":"This game was only fun for my family insofar as we laughed and laughed every time another piece fell off. Every time someone had to push the ghost down, one of us would yell, \\"call the repairman!\\" Traps almost spring, hinges jam, and players fall off the board (creating amusing family controversy over which player used to be on which space). One of the most fun and entertaining challenges of this game was trying to figure out where the players start, which is not indicated on the board or in the instructions. The game is especially fun for four players, as the instructions state that players may not occupy the same space, and must therefore stack up behind one another in a delightful log-jam configuration. After a rollicking ten minutes of sheer side-splitting frustration, we declared our six-year-old the winner and then selected another game that might tempt us to play it more than once."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this mess of a toy","review":"Such great promise. The box makes it look like a really neat toy.Here's the truth:It's terribly made of cheap cardboard pieces (including the tokens)It's pain to put togetherIt will fall apart many times dueing gameplay.It will not fit back into the box assembled, so it will need to be completely taken apart and reassembled for each play.The game is just not fun. Spin a spinner, move the cheap cardboard pieces on a cheap carboard board. Pressing the \\"trap\\" trigger shakes the whole thing and knocks every piece over, so every turn is spent picking up the pieces again. No originality. You literally may as well get some dice, some pennies, and a piece of notebook paper with some squares drawn on it. It would be a much more fun experience than this.Sorry... my family are big Scooby fans, but this purchase was a mistake."},{"rating":"1","title":"My seven year old daughter is crying \\"This is the worst game ever!\\"","review":"It doesn't stay together, the instructions are unclear and the spinner doesn't stay put.

I am boxing it up and taking it back to the store tomorrow.

My four year old son had the game for three weeks and it went in the garbage. It was very disappointing and a big waste of money. DO not buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware the Haunted Mansion","review":"The game is actually a pretty good concept and kind of fun. Plus, it has the bonus of going pretty quickly. Unfortunately, it is made so cheaply (overpriced!) that at times it is almost impossible to play. First off, the game board is small, so it is even hard for smaller hands to move the pieces on the back of the lower lever. Then the snakey stairs fall off continually. Plus, they are so shaky that the characters fall off almost every move which is a complete pain. Once you make it above the snakey stairs, the rest of the game is OK. Assembly is very easy. Our ghost didn't pop up properly at first, but now works fine. Beware - your kids will want to press down the ghost all the time. I don't see this game lasting long without breaking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic fun for the entire family","review":"This game won the award from www.hauntedhouseparts.com for best board game of Christmas 2007.

It covers from the basic BIS regulatory capital framework to the state-of-the-art credit risk models. Numerous worked examples demonstrate the calculation for different risk weighted capitals with or without netting clearly. Well-known credit models such as KMV, CreditMetric and CreditRisk+ are rigorously explained. Advanced issues like default correlation, joint credit migration and loss tail events are also addressed appropriately. With the general framework, economic capital and risk adjusted performance measurement can be quantified.

Parkman tells the story of LaSalle's journeys in North America with a novelist's style and a historian's attention to detail.Of particular interest were Parkman's references to things which exist \\"today\\" referring to his time, the mid to late 1800's. As such, the reader is treated to a double dose of history by viewing past events through the eyes of someone who wrote over 100 years ago. The book was an exciting and enjoyable read.My only criticisms of the book were that the volume of the footnotes was somewhat distracting, and that a few key phrases were not translated from French. Otherwise, excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"America's Tacitus","review":"Parkman is that unusual combination of great scholar and wonderful writer. His books depicting the history of French exploration of North America and the conflict between the French and the British for control of North America remain the basic narratives of these events. Parkman's writing, combining narrative, psychological insight into major historical actors, and use of rhetoric that seamlessly reflects his narrative, is often superb. This particular book is almost entirely devoted to the career of the Sieur De La Salle, the French explorer obsessed with establishing French control over the Mississippi valley. Parkman provides vivid portraits of the almost incredible hardships of travel in North America, the character of politics in the French colonies, and an insightful treatment of La Salle and his associates. Parkman's powerful but restrained language often recalls the style of Tacitus."},{"rating":"1","title":"La Salle and the Discovery of the Great West (Volume 3)","review":"Published by General Books, this is a travesty of a book.

But this book was very effective in showing the compromising, cowardly side of the French during WWII in a very subtle and unsettling way. Nossiter, like a good journalist, lets people tell their own stories, and somehow get people to talk themselves into some pretty deep holes. My one criticism is that the book is too scholarly, the topic is certainly dramatic, and I think that it drags a bit in some places. I once read that the French haven't yet figured out which side they were on in WWII.

As usual, the solution is found in the history we are given. Bennis's debutante youth and her status as a celebrity author are the perfect cover for inviting Gregor to investigate a murder before it happens. The mental chaos of celebrity and politics breaks the mirror of the characters' thoughts into a jumbled mosaic that masks the real story (and reflects the author's personal views, if her website is any indication). The principle corpse-to-be is Senator Stephen Whistler Fox, a flesh-and-bones marionette on the strings of a very skilled political manager whose ambition is to be the President behind the President. Readers can decide for themselves whether Fox represents anyone in the American political scene, but please remember that this book was written several administrations ago."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great video for toddlers","review":"My 17-month-old son watched this video for the first time onvacation.

For instance, the cover is bright orange, containing cheap clipart. It is written in large readible font as if for senior citizens. The whole book feels like a set of handouts in a classroom written in the 1970s on an early word processor.However, this book works. It provides good information. It identifies the main forms of self-defeating behavior that prevent self-discipline. It has 15-minute writing exercises that let you identify ways in which that self-defeating behavior hinders you. It then provides key skills necessary to overcome that self-defeating behavior.Worked for me. Crisp, clear, and focused. No fluff. No useless examples, no self-promotion. Just the facts. Useful ones.

This starts Patrick on a strange path to realizing his new dream of using his gas to become an astronaut. There are several amusing detours along the way, like when he is recruited by an opera singer to fart the high notes, before Alan and Patrick team up to create a gas powered rocket to save a marooned spacecraft from the (fictionalized) U.S. space program.

Before Lancelot jumps into the cart, the narrator states that \\"reason is the enemy of love.\\" In the scope of the book, and the code of chivalry, reason is the enemy of this genre.Take with Nyquil."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ladron Que Roba A Ladron","review":"Really enjoyed this movie.

This crew banks on the fact that the men and women who clean your office and fill your water glass are virtually invisible and can slyly commit grand scale larceny. The standard caper stereotypes are deployed, but a heist that succeeds by pickpocketing and valet parking switcheroos is massively more believable than one that depends on blacking out Las Vegas (as in Oceans 11). Telenovela hunk Fernando Colunga helped Ladrón reach as high as #16 in the US Box Office top 20.

The women of the Vertavo String Quartet play with exquisite empathy and energy, and bring out a wealth of nuance that this lovely, good-hearted music, in its score, suggests to these fine artists. The sound quality, I find, is natural, clear and clean - and whether played at low or high volume, has fine presence. My interest is principally in the Grieg, but the Debussy, too, is \\"an immense world of delight\\". Subtlety does not diminish ardor. This pairing is apt, since early Debussy (such as this Quartet) was, like early Delius (as in his beautiful Florida Suite), noticeably influenced by Grieg. Amidst the surfeit of CDs, this one is truly a landmark recording. If this repertoire is your cup of ambrosia - I'd say, hesitate not, o seeker."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super collection !","review":"It's fabulous this box contains 3 films : The Firm, Top Gun and Day of Thunder.

Too bad, it was a interesting story line."},{"rating":"1","title":"pure pablum pulp fiction","review":"this was one of the most horrible books i have ever read. considering how fascinating the subject matter is, it needed to be treated a little more seriously. this trite potboiler turns a thousand years of Russian history and events with world-shaking consequences into a bad soap opera with decoder ring marvel magic. the highlight of the whole book is when the black man has to face down an 800 pound gorilla named \\"king arthur\\" in order to save the beautiful white russian woman. she is a circus performer, and that is exactly what this author has done with the romanov legacy--turned it into a three-ring circus act. anything that has a black man facing off with a gorilla needs to be burned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Must be his first","review":"For Steve Berry, the search is the thing. This could not be more true for the main characters are poorly developed. The hero Miles Lord is black because he has to be (read the book) and he is totally unbelievable as is his boss - and villain - Taylor Hayes. Lord is pursued by a trio of bad guys who makes the three stooges seem like Elliot Ness. If these guys had failed, most authors would have had their bosses kill them off after the first miss rather than transport them halfway around the world to fail for the umpteenth time. What should be dramatic becomes truly funny. The search for the Romanov's shows Berry's lack of skill at this point in is career."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Thriller","review":"I have read 4 Steve Berry novels, and this one is probably the best, slightly ahead of The Third Secret. For those that find the idea of a 21st Century Czar unfathomable, you will have a hard time enjoying this novel.However, for those who aren't that familiar with Russian history will find this both informative and entertaining.Just like in The Third Secret, Berry does a terrific job of intertwining factual history with pure fiction to create a very entertaining story.I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Historical thriller","review":"Present-day Russia is returning to imperial monarchy. An American lawyer is sent to do a background check on one of the candidates for czar, and he gets mixed up in deadly conspiracies and century-old mysteries.Yeah, the plot's a little improbable, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. If you like Dan Brown, you'll be fine with Steve Berry. He's also written _The Third Secret:_ more like _The Da Vinci Code_ but centered around the Fatima prophecies."},{"rating":"1","title":"had potential, but not worth the read","review":"I picked it up because I'm all for some historical fiction,sometimes it's the best kind, the kind that could almost be real. However, I must say I couldn't stand the way the author chose to write the book, in some weird second third person narrative mixture, at times I didn't know who 'he' or 'she' was referring too. So, bad grammar wise. For the story, it really wasn't nearly as interesting as I thought it would be, and many times it lacked the background/depth to make the story in any way real. Also, the book portrays Russia as a desolate country with tons of poor and mobsters everywhere. I don't know if that's true, but at least to me it didn't seem very accurate. And to top it off the main character wasn't even endearing, I didn't like him more than I liked anyone really....all in all, don't buy it"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best I've ever read","review":"I read a lot of fiction and non-fiction, and have an interest in Russian history.

If this what you find delight in, you will have a full plate. Not me. This book pummels the reader with the dark aspects of the human spirit, with everything that is dark, heavy, and tedious in the Russian soul, the only relief being when you put it down and do something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Brilliant","review":"Who the hell really knows what became of the Romanov's? We'll never know, but Steve Berry brought a whole new light and tale to this great story.His main character Miles Lord was great. Berry simply and brilliantly created tension and suspense by having his main character be an African-American in Russia (no place to hide).I read this book in two days and have re-read it twice since. I have tape holding the spine together. Berry's outcome on the entire Romanov family excited me, and got me thinking and studying all of the actual history behind their downfall.A true lover of history, he does his readers right, by properly researching and making the outcomes suspenseful and believable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass this one by","review":"I was so looking forward to reading the book because of the subject matter. Unfortunately, I found the characters shallow and in some cases down right simple-minded. The novel moved in a slow and predictable manner.As another reviewer noted, the use of Russian words and phases puzzled me at times. Especially the author's use of chornye. Growing up Orthodox and Ruthenian, the word meant black. I never heard the word used as the author states. As with the coon chase, you would think there was an attempt at atonement by the author.Last, you never kill the dog. Kill whole villages and cities, but never the dog."},{"rating":"1","title":"Once I put it down I could hardly pick it up again..........","review":"This started out to be a fairly interesting book, but by the time I got halfway thru it, I gave up.

I wish I had waited and checked it out at the library instead of buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Suspense?","review":"At one point in the book one of the characters asks why anyone would believe this crap?I was asking myself the same question, but the book plunged forward, skirting close to the edge of a cliff. The gist of the plot is that Russia decides it wants to bring back the Tsar. Why? We're never told, just that there is this commission that is going to pick a new Tsar in six days and the vote must be unaminous.Six days - right.Miles Lord, a dufus lawyer, who manages to piece the century old clues together that lead to the Romanov heir, but can't figure out that every time he calls his boss, people show up to kill him.Too bad they didn't succeed. Any character this dumb deserves a dirt nap.Thrillers are suppose to accelerate towards the end. This one s-l-o-w-s down.Save yourself the trouble, read something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had to finish it","review":"Every once in a while, a book comes along with such an unbelievable plot that you have to finish it. \\"The Romanov Prophecy\\" is a perfect example. Aside from the plot, why did Berry have to create a fictious town and county in North Carolina? And his measurement of Red Square needs to be re-examined."},{"rating":"1","title":"so many false facts about Russia","review":"I am not commenting about the style of the book. Some of facts about Russia are just so wrong and of course only the negative ones. How can he say that in former sovjet schools the kids were tought, that black people are inferior (page 136) !!!! The schools tought that all people are equal!!!And there is much more.

Save you money and your time and pass on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good \\"What if...\\" edge of the seat mystery/thriller.","review":"Conspiracy theories are almost a hobby in America and the fate of Tsar Nicholas II and his family has a rich history of doubt and questions. Numerous pretenders, some supported by Romanov family members, appeared during the years claiming to be one of the Grand Duchesses (usually Anastasia) and Tsarovich Alexei, so this is literally a world-wide curiousity. Finding the burial site of the family and subsequent DNA proving that there are two of the Tsar's children missing only feeds the idea of a possible escape by one or two of the children. While the political premise that kickstarts the story is a stretch, the desperate race to find clues while being hunted by another group of conspirators altogether, makes it hard to put down this book. The author has research the subject well and in his Author's Note lets the reader know what was fact, what was extrapolation, and what was imagination."},{"rating":"1","title":"Benefit of the Doubt","review":"From time to time I comb the shelves of a bookstore in search for a new author. That's how I stumbled into Steve Berry. Reading the summaries of his books it's clear that he tries to emulate Dan Brown; Brown actually endorses \\"The Romanov Prophecy\\".Needless to say it doesn't compare. This book is confusing and slow. The plot is unbelievable and the bad guys are the most inept lot put together in the history of literature. I know this is fiction, but if you know a little about Russian culture you will keep raising your eyebrows, too many licenses and inaccuracies.This is Berry's first effort, only for that I will give him the benefit of the doubt and two stars and maybe pick one of his latest offerings like \\"The Third Secret\\" to see if there is improvement.As for you fellow reader I will recommend to skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most boring novel ever","review":"Dumbest people are after even dumber.

Took awhile to get started (got interesting after 100 pages or so). Interesting and wasn't as bad as some of the books I've read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A definite good read...","review":"Although I agree that this book is not Berry's best, it is still a page turner. I enjoyed the characters and how they seemed to survive one murder attempt after another. Although it is a definite \\"leave your brain at the door\\", it is still a fascinating ride! I liked reading about the historical conspiracy surrounding the Romanovs... the market is saturated with conspiracy books about DaVinci and the Catholic Church etc that it was almost a relief to get into this book and its plot.Its a good \\"curl up with hot tea and a book\\" book. It will have you looking up websites about the Romanovs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow. You guys are cold!","review":"I enjoyed this FICTIONAL book. I got into the character of Miles Lord and didn't think he was editorializing about racism . . . anywhere. And I thought that the inability to consider the \\"inside\\" bad guy was a mistake that a normal person would make. The reason that the Romanov conspiracy is odd to us is that it's been kept from public scrutiny for 90 years. But if you study your history and look at the cold war and it's results from the October Revolution, it makes a lot of (common) sense and knowledge.Miles is running for his life a lot and while not tedious, that got to the point of, 'come on man, WHY are they after you?'A really terrifying novel about Russia today is Martin Cruz-Smith's \\"Wolves Eat Dogs.\\" This is not up to par as that. But I found it enjoyable and worthwhile, and I would read Mr. Berry again. 4 Stars. Larry Scantlebury"},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting, but...","review":"This was a very interesting concept, and Russian history is twisted and fascinating enough to pull this off. Russia wants a return to the old ways, specifically to the tsarist regime, and are conducting inquiries into the closest living male relative to Nicholas II to be their next autocrat. However, concept aside, there were entirely too many coincidences for this to be believable. An example would be how one of the villains agreed that such an action was too expensive to maintain, but - don't worry! - he personally felt the need to reinstate it when their joint venture began.I just didn't buy it, though the hero's actions were often human - he sometimes just didn't know. Good, but again...Fate lent a hand, and everything was fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not great, don't waste your time","review":"I bought this book after reading The Third Secret, thinking I'd get another good read. I was so wrong. The Romanov Prophecy is predictable from page 1. About halfway through, it turns into one long chase scene. There are no plot twists or turns, you know exactly what's going to happen from the beginning. I started to quit about 2/3 of the way in, but felt I had too much time invested to just drop it. There are much better thrillers out there. Try The Historian. Fantastic book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Reading","review":"I haven't read a book this action packed in a long time.

Kenyon expounds on a theme common in most his writing that the world gains knowledge through the five senses while spiritual knowledge must come through our spirit. We cannot know God through our physical senses but as we recieve revelation of God's Word we gain insight through our spirit. (1 Cor 1:19-22 KJV) For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent. {20} Where is the wise? where is the scribe? where is the disputer of this world? hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world? {21} For after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe. {22} For the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek after wisdom:Godly understanding and Godly wisdom must come from God.

I love family saga type novels with lots of story in it.But I did feel a bit unsatisfied at the ending....with only about 20 pages left to go, I kept wondering HOW she was going to tie up SO many loose ends. I feel she rather rushed it and could have spent a bit more time. For instance....Clemency appeared to be the main character and yet...we never even got to \\"hear\\" her thoughts on the final outcome at the end. And it was a pretty dramatic ending for Clemency....yet, nothing.Going to try one of her other books though, as I like her writing style."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid and steamy stuff!","review":"If you've ever had any gastro issues then you'll enjoy this book, especially if you travel abroad.

I'd recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Average at Best...","review":"The first thing you should know about this video is that it is filmed live on a Marine Base and the audio is terrible (there is the constant sound of jets taking off in the background). When it comes to unarmed combat/self defence, I believe in the K.I.S.S. principal (Keep It Savagely Simple). Most of the techniques demonstrated in the video are FAR too complicated to work under stressful conditions. If watching a bunch of 18 year old robot recruits sloppily attempt to imitate an instructor teaching ...re-hashed martial arts is your thing... have at 'er. There are many books and videos out there which are worth your hard-earned cash - this isn't one of them.

I gave a can of the chicken a ride in a food processor to make a chicken salad. Took a lot of seasoning and the addition of onion, pickle, etc. to produce any taste.

However, be forewarned that Brother does not provide good Mac support or drivers. Not all the features are supported on Mac computers.What I don't like is, the build quality is cheap cheap cheap. Very cheap plastic trays that don't slide in and out easily. When printing card stock, the stock gets caught on a lip on the back of the printer and will cause a jam if you don't stand there and manually guide & remove each page. On one occasion, a regular page got stuck in the drum and I had to replace it at a cost of over $150. Suddenly this printer is not such a bargain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great printer at a great price","review":"I bought this printer about a month ago because of the rebate and the fact that it has an automatic duplexing feature. At work I have the hp 2200 duplex printer that costs several hundred dollars more and at home I have an NEC laserjet (non-duplex) which I feel is poorly built and designed.I am glad I bought this printer because I don't see any difference between the print quality of the hp 2200 vs this printer. Although I haven't timed the printing, it seems the double-sided printing is faster on the brother.

The book includes seven Matthew Scudder stories, nine Martin Ehrengraf stories, three Bernie Rhodenbarr stories and the complete texts of the three previous Block short story volumes. As a bonus, there are five \\"new\\" Block stories, never before previously anthologized.The stories run the gamut from hard-bitten to whodunnits? to even the occasional horror story. Block shows every bit as much mastery with his short works that he does with his novels. The diversity of his subjects and the bredth of his knowledge is simply breathtaking. The book also includes a short prologue by the author, explaining how the book is laid out and giving a little helpful background.Overall, \\"The Collected Stories\\" is a fine tribute to a great writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helpful and Educational","review":"This is a very nice book with great pictures and old print ads.

It may just have been that my style is different, but if I remove that from my opinion, you still have a book that doesn't deliver many interesting ideas. Without spoiling it, I'll just say that there are a few plots going on at the same time. One is a trite story about an abusive father, one is about a ghost and the last major plot is of a \\"mysterious\\" storm called the darkness that supposedly always takes a member of the main character's family.

What's worse is that you are forced to call them because the manual (best use for it is picking up after your dog) is terrible and their Web site is equally awful. Go with a player that has USB not a damn parrallel port. And Yes I am in ECP mode! Damn thing can't get in connect mode. Yes I went to file and selected connect and list. Still got errors, errors.

Shipped with Duracels and not some lame brand. No problem loading the mp3s.

The transfer was a speedy 680kps through the parallel port to the device. It expanded the memory automatically without any problem either. Only one point of caution -- the manufacture's rebate program states that they must _receive_ the rebate request 8 days after purchase. Considering it requires the UPC from the box, this is impossible given normal shipping times.

It is very easy to strap onto a chair, easy to clean, and easy to strap the child into. Unlike some of the booster seats on the market, this will look attractive with many adult dining sets instead of jumping out and screaming \\"baby booster seat\\".

Alas and merde, the lazy, arrogant so-and-sos who had made the DVD version had omitted to include English (or any) subtitles. What a large potential market they have missed.

This rivals (perhaps outdoes) my love for amethystium.Perhaps the best way to describe my opinion of this CD is an illustration:Suppose that all of the greatest euphoric heights of trance were cast into a concentrated area of anguished emotion. Then suppose that this mixture was fired through with electricity, and then shot on a beam of light into the setting sun. Upon impact, the wave created would be... The sound that comes out of the speakers whilst this CD spins. I was literally vibrant with energy after i finished this album, and sat there stunned.Buy it. BUY it. FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, BUY IT! This CD is worth 100 dollars, but it's being sold for $15.99!!It will blow you away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for the genre","review":"I really like the Industrial scene but it's tragedy is that it's often redundant, using the same old Skinny Puppy spooky-shock formula. I use to be really into the scene but then I started moving away from it. When I was in a record store recently, \\"Dark Angel\\" was playing on the speakers and I asked who was playing and the clerk said \\"VNV Nation.\\" I had heard good comments on them before so I decided to buy \\"Empires\\"I am really satisfied with the album. I can't really compare them to another industrial band but they remind me a lot of Underworld. Good emotional sophisticated beats with great vocals and lyrics. My favorite tracks are \\"Rubicon\\", \\"Standing\\" and \\"Dark Angel\\"(Which is worth the whole album for). \\"Empires\\" will give you a lot of good spins in your player."},{"rating":"2","title":"VNV Empires: Stunning and beautiful dance electronica","review":"This is the latest VNV Nation CD I have purchased and listened too a couple of times. (VNV means Victory Not Vengeance) VNV stems from EBM grassroots of England and the duo who make up VNV Nations put out all their talents out for all to see in this stunning, trace electronica ensemble. This album was initially released in 2000 but one could summise that they released this record out last month. What attracted me to this group was the sound of the music and the poetic lyrics that are sung in such a fashion that belies this day and age.Many of these songs like 'Legion', 'Savior' and 'Kingdom' can find a home on a playlist in a dance club, these songs are primarily dance songs that one can shake their booty too. All the songs are a nice blend of electronica with splashes of industrial mashes and sounds. This has become my favourite VNV Nation album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Trance-Industrial","review":"While most refer to this as \\"future pop\\" I think a more appropriate term is trance-industrial since it has the hard beats of some industrial but it is very melodic and reminds me of Sasha or Oakenfeld in some respects. The album is interesting in that it tells a story and the names and lyrics of the songs follow the theme chronologically. While there is some filler there are a good number of outstanding songs, including Kingdom and Rubicon. This takes me back to the days of going to goth clubs and watching, while drunk, people dancing under the strobe lights to this and other at-the-time cutting edge music. Futuristic and depressing, but also interesting and often times excellent this is highly recommended if you like synth music from the 80's or industrial like KMFDM or Nitzer Ebb."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excelent EBM","review":"Some ebm and industrial purists might disregard this cd as an \\"up-beat\\" and cheezy record.

VnV nation is an amazing band..simply amazing..by this cd..at all costs!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Repetitive, untalented and sloppy.","review":"VNV Nation is a terrible example of the music i love. Their compostition is weak, repetitive and slow. The pentamiter of the lyrics does not match with rythym or bass. The vocals are slow sloppy and untalented.

The kind of song that makes you feel like your floating or flying or spinning in circles non-stop? The kind that leaves a tightens in your stomach, tears in your eyes and your heart pumping? This is VNV Nation's entire CD. Empires is a beautifully written, produced and performed album that captures everything from heartwrentching songs that make you watch to dance with your arms so far to the sky that you touch the stars, and ballads that make you want to lie in a ball and cry. Music- GOOD music, is that which can effect your emotions. Bravo VNV Nation. ~**Victory, Not Vengance**~"},{"rating":"2","title":"one downfall","review":"While this albumm will no doubt be a favorite with vnv nation's fans there is a slight downside to this album. I purchased Vnv's \\"Standing Burning Empires\\" cd single (which is hardly a single at all with two cd's and 8 different songs and one that is not found on the full length version) and thought that it was phenominal. I couldn't wait to get the whole thing. But once i listened to it, in my opinion track 5 on \\"standing burning empires\\" saviour (vox) was ruined on this album. There is a reason for this. On the full version \\"saviour\\" is just a music track while on the single it is a full song with lyrics and makes a great song. In my opinion they did themselves an injustice by not including the song in it. Otherwise the rest of the cd is great although i perfer the remixes of most of the songs on burning empires."},{"rating":"2","title":"MUSICAL PHENOMONA","review":"This is probably among the most best band of today, or at LEAST lyrically, they are miles ahead of many musicians today, Standing is extremely emotive, beautiful, the lyrics are great throughout this whole CD, heck all the melody on this cd, along with his voice, is all outstanding, it's sad that this cd or Futureperfect isn't on the Rolling Stones 500 greatest cd's of all time, especailly considering some of the cd's they have on it that don't even compare with VNV"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have!","review":"If you don't own this album you have no excuse not to.

Keeping track of all the characters was a monumental feat that left you wondering WHY they were actually written into this novel. About the only completely \\"fleshed\\" out character was Scott - The main character's lover who happened to be a Baseball athlete. Sprinkled adorations of this character created many stalls to the story line that I began to NOT care for Tom or Scott. I also found myself cringing at all the location descriptions given to the reader about Chicago. Again, this intricate location detail created a stall to my reading. Hasn't this writer figured out that less is more? Yet, I continued through the 182 pages HOPING to get some real writing style that would drive me to the entertainment value I get when reading a Joseph Hansen novel. How sad I was to see this book finish flat. Time to cleanse my brain with a Dave Brandstetter detective read. Oy...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who Cares Who Did It ...(Yawn)","review":"This has to be one of the dullest mysteries I have read. I felt like the whole book was a mere excuse for the author to express his venom against the Catholic Church. Characters have less personality than dry bread, they are nothing but extreme stereotypes with name labels. The events are almost non-events; things seem to happen but no real progress is made. When the murderer is finally revealed, a reader couldn't care less because it is difficult to remember who is who! And the writing style - after a while, I began to wonder if it was that flat and mundane on purpose!I liked one thing about this book, though. My copy was only 182 pages long."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautifully crafted novel. Read it!","review":"Robin Hemley's loving tribute to his sister, Nola, who was lost to the madness of schizophrenia in her twenties, is alternately pensive and soaring. A middle-aged Hemely recalls and tries to understand his sister, through her memoir, as she struggled mightily with spirituality and disease. But ultimately, the book also reads like the memoir of a family of writers still looking for beauty within Nola's battle. Throughout this unique work, Hemely enhances the story by including the writings of his mother and sister, unlocking additional layers to the family's story. This is a book for anyone who has dealt with or tried to understand the world beyond this one. Most impressively, Hemley's redemptive novel transcends the ugliness of disease and presents a beautiful picture of Nola, a creative and thoughtful woman whose life was taken unjustly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inventive hardcore DnB","review":"I thought drum and bass was dead until I got this EP by Rephlex- favourive Ovuca. He is a Finnish guy who really knows the craft of producing freaky danceable beats...

It's just like when we are thought the English language outside England/US. Then a harsh uptempo DnB beats and heavy bass-sounds come in - - like Bogdan Raczynski, but more soft and with structure.

Anyway, about the EP: it's great, with some atmospheric tunes, and always exciting song structures. I also like the conversations between the man and the wife, which are nicely fit in the music.

The needle and the toothpick are more prone to getting lost than anything. The knife edge is not very sharp from the factory, and it is made of such strong steel and is so small, it can be a real challenge to sharpen.

Raimondo and his organization unites far left extremists with islamic supremacist terror-supporters under the banner of hating Jews, Israel and the United States. This \\"book\\" will probably play well in places where hatred of Jews and Americans is common. I can see it becoming a blockbuster in France, Saudi Arabia, or Quebec, for example.

Unfortunately, most often (over 95% of time), when I follow his references, they are very shallow and from non-credible websites/sources. If one bases his conclusions and reasonings on flawed and non-credible sources, then such conclusions should be very seriously questioned.Unfortunately, that trend is evident in this book also: shallow references, baseless or illogical conclusions, non-existing sources, ill-intentions, and unsubstantiated claims. Once a reader finishes a couple chapters, the author's lack of credibility becomes so overwhelming that one loses interest or any motivation to continue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anti-Semitic rubbish","review":"The title of my review says it all. This book ignores the mountains of evidence and instead opts for conspiracy theories mixed in with slight tidbits of truth to make it more believable. For example, yes the Israelis were following some of the 9/11 operatives. So were the FBI and CIA, along with ABLE DANGER. However, as was well documented in the 9/11 comission report, these organizations were not able to connect the dots. It is well known that Israel spies on America...so do the French, the Germans, everyone.

Save your money and by a book by Steven Emerson."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre","review":"I picked this up after reading numerous positive reviews. Unfortunately, the material did not even come close to living up to the hype. On this album, Gross starts out reasonably well - and there is hope that he will find his rhythm and gain momentum - but he soon slides into predictable mediocrity.

For the Columbia Basin this book is very good. Anything that catches your eye is likely to be included, despite the book's slimness. In central Idaho the coverage is not so good, and you will end up wondering if what you're looking at is in the book. Just remember, as with all small, easy to use plant guides, there are probably five times as many plant species on the ground, even in the Columbia basin, as there are in the book.The natural history coverage is reliable but not terribly extensive.In Washington I have found it's nice to have this in combination with the authoritative but unfriendly and jargon-ridden Hitcock and Cronquist flora. Taylor will get it for you if it's a reasonably common plant, or give you a good starting point for wading around in H&C, if there's any doubt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brief and Uneven","review":"This book attempts to describe the presidents humour, but ultimately leaves the reader wanting more.

A compendium of presidential humour should have more balance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wit and humor from our presidents.","review":"Indeed I wish Bob Dole was in this book, instead of reporting on the wit and humor of the highest office's previous occupants. I believe humor and the ability to laugh at yourself is a great asset with any person in high office. When Dole lost in 1996, he stated he slept like a baby....he cried all night.The book is structured on rating the president's ability to crack jokes. Many people believe that Lincoln and FDR had great wits. Dole states the many unknowns such as Coolidge's jokes about his silence. Some of our underrated Presidents had great wits.This is a nice little humorous read.

The script has no thought whatsoever and is utterly predictable. Not to mention it seems to drag on for what seems like an eternity. The characters are paper thin, reminiscent of old MacGyver and A Team episodes. This movie is nothing more than a comic book with lots of cheesy special effects. This is just Hollywood trying to be trendy and cool. Sure, Angelina Jolie looks good, but that's about it for this movie! Instead, rent an adult film. At least that way you might have a plot!

That sounds a reasonable enough concept for a Hollywood movie, but with predictable skill our Californian friends drain even this miserable \\"Raiders of the lost ark with a woman\\" theme of any redeemable qualities.

It wasn't the worst, but it was just a waste of everyone's valuable time. Where to start. Lara croft,is played by Angelina Jolie. She's beautiful but this role hasn't spread her range as an actress. The video game based sequel has Croft in search of an ancient artifact called Pandora's Box, \\"The most powerful thing ever imagined.\\" I'm getting tired of the same old plot of an ancient artifact being searched for. Why can the plot be about how the audience can give a damn about this film. The visuals are nice, but there so boring and repitive that i almost fell asleep. The ending is boring as well.

This time around, we don't have the whole I MISS DADDY subplot, but we just have Lara doing what the character was meant to do - going after the fortunes of the lost tombs, with a couple of missteps along the way :-). To me, anyone that digs the whole Indiana Jones type movies, to miss this one would be a wrong descision. Lara Croft without a doubt, is the new version of that kind of action/adventure hero, and does it without being anything other than Lara Croft (who just happens to be a woman). This movie continues to tear down the myth of leading action female roles, and we are all the better for it. Sure, there are impossibilites, non-realities, etc. But when we go to see these kinds of movies, we willingly leave all preconceived notions at the door and just go in to have fun.

While they were cool and the movie was better than the original, that's not really saying that much.Lara Croft finds some sunken treasure from Alexander the Great beneath the ocean, which includes a sphere that looks like a bowling ball made of amber. She looses it to some other treasure hunters and finds out that it's a map to the Cradle of Life, where Pandora's Box is kept. The \\"bad guy\\" wants the box to sell as the ultimate weapon so Lara's got to go save the day. The monsters I described above are the guardians of the box.

If I had seen it on PBS, I would not have purchased it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brought tears to my eyes","review":"I saw this on PBS last night; when I read the program description, I thought it would be boring - photos of a lake? I was later glad nothing was on Nick at Night, as this was an incredible documentary. The photographs were stunningly beautiful; the video of the photographer at work was amazing. Several of the photographs featured brought tears to my eyes. He mentions some of the technical aspects involved in the photos, and the sheer challenge of limiting himself to taking just one exposure per day. I plan on adding this and the bookChased By The Lightto my collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jim Brandenburg's Chased by the Light DVD","review":"Watch this video and you will be calmed,soothed and inspired. A peaceful almost religious experience. Buy the book also, it is absolutely beautiful. Jim Brandenburg is an outstanding photographer and human being. Buy a copy for yourself and after viewing, you'll soon want to buy one for the most precious people in your life. If you care for the natural world and the preservation of this planet, you owe it to yourself to view this video. Thank you Jim Brandenburg."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for","review":"I've never written a bad review before, but I feel I should in order to warn others. This is a very cheap cue rack that was chipped in a few places and even had a long split in one of the boards. Don't go by the color of stain in the picture, it is very misleading. It is a much darker color when you get it. Don't waste your money on this! Spend the extra money and get one thats going to last."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful experience for children","review":"This video is informative, fascinating and beautifully paced. It has everything to engage children's minds and attention - farm animals, farm machinery, trucks, children, excellent musical accompaniment and plenty of lively fun. It is clearly and delightfully narrated by Vermont story-teller Mac Parker. It proceeds through all four seasons on the Bessette's dairy farm, illustrating both the work and the recreation of the family. Children will want to see it over and over, and because it's so well-made, parents will be happy to oblige."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute junk!

It took about three months to get the watch back. They do stand behind their product, but it takes a LONG time to get it back. I have gone diving with this watch atleast 15 times and it keeps very accurate time. The mother-of-pearl face is really stunning.This is the 1st watch I've owned that I can honestly say I LOVE."},{"rating":"2","title":"Found it interesting and helpful","review":"This book has a lot of useful information and even websites to review for additional help."},{"rating":"1","title":"Probably works on some stuck bolts, did not work for me","review":"I got these to try to get out several stuck and broken bolts. Needless to say, it did not work. They are not strong enough and broke. I got a $4 bolt extractor set from a tool store, and they got two other bolts out. I wish that I had done that first, instead of buying a more expensive one that did not work for me. Yes, I could probably send the broken one in and get a replacement. Just to have it break again? Better to save the postage."},{"rating":"2","title":"NEVER SOUNDED BETTER!","review":"\\"The Letter\\" by the \\"Box tops\\" was one of the best CD's I think I have heard in a long...long time! Naturally, I was attracted to the CD because of their famous song, \\"The Letter,\\" that just happened to be playing... as I waited for the helicopter to whisk me off that ancient LST that had been my home for an entire year in the Mekong Delta of S. Vietnam in August of 1968.Not only was \\"The Letter\\" fondly remembered but every song on this CD is a work of Rocking-Soul that will take you back to time when words and music still went hand in hand.This CD is well worth the price, and if you liked music from the 60's you won't be sorry you're ordered this one!! Buy it, Play it, and Enjoy it!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Old Irish Songs","review":"Most of the songs I had remembered from childhood when I received a copy of the Unicorn tape from my sister as a gift. I recall the song being VERY popular when I was just a wee little girl. It was played on all the Rock & Roll stations around town. When I received the tape, I played it for many years. It was especially enjoyable while driving trips between Duluth and the Twin Cities. This CD has most of the same songs and some new ones that I play in the car and while doing laps in the pool. It is fun, fun, fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS IS A GREAT CD!!!","review":"IF YOU ARE A FAN OF THE BOX TOPS, THEN YOU WILL ENJOY THIS CD!!

Out of the one's I've read so far, I think \\"Red Rackham's Treasure\\" was my favorite. I loved the way Herge made Calculus, and thought he was extremely funny, even when he did get annoying! I love the Tintin books, and look forward to reading every single one again!

Great toy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too hard to figure out.","review":"I bought version 2 (that I didn't use a lot) and upgraded it to version 3 because I got a new DV Camcorder and thought I would finally use it. It didn't capture well with my 1394 card nor did I find it intuitive. I hate the fact that I don't know how long my video is and that I can't cut my videos where I want to the first time. I heard that Ulead VideoStudio works great...I'll be buying that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away from this piece of [garbage] at all costs...","review":"Put nicely, Videosuite 3.0 is terrible. It took me a couple days to figure out how to bring in video (MGI is so smart that they don't include an instruction manual with the software). After I finally had to have a computer-expert friend come over and make the thing work, it made me want to cry. The process of puting clips together is basically impossible, and adding music...forget about it. All I wanted was a little program to help me get started in making skate videos. Usually, when software falls short, the effort itself is worth some praise, but Videowave III...holy crap. I repeat: avoid at all costs, except if you need a really expensive coaster. On second thought, it's so bad that it would probably make a terrible coaster too. I returned the thing a week after I made the mistake of buying it...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Wall Hangers","review":"I just used these with my plate collection and am very happy with them. They hold the plates without putting pressure on them like the old fashioned kind of plate hangers. One thing that I think could be improved is that they are rather thick. In spite of that, they don't overwhelm what they are holding. Another thing is that the plate sits in them and could be knocked off very easily by someone brushing against them or and earthquake, etc. If you really treasure your plates then I wouldn't hang these where they could be easily bumped up against. In spite of those two things I would definitely recommend these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this \\"dumb\\" carousel","review":"This product does not work as advertised. The unit has \\"Smart and Easy sensor settings\\", which sharp claims it automatically determine cooking or reheating times and power levels for nine popular microwave foods. Don't believe it, it doesn't work. The popcorn setting leaves the popcorn 80% unpopped, the defrost settings leaves food frozen as a rock. My previous 800 watt unit was more efficient.This unit can be very dangerous as well. The botton front edge of the unit gets extremely HOT! One several occasions my family members got burn welts on their forearms.Also, the unit frequently ARCs for no reason causing sparks and loud noise. Some foods are ok, but others, like heating up a samore will cause problems.I have always been a fan of Sharp Microwaves, but this model is the pits."},{"rating":"2","title":"Score Keeper","review":"Not too bad.

Hey before you buy this cd, let me tell you something: This is not a Spanish Guitar player, not even a Spanish like one. This guy is just a begginer-like player, he's harmonically and technicaly handicapped. Somebody has to stop this guy. Tell him the truth: You can't play! I don't know what did he do to get his contract, but when i heard this cd, this came to me: He's the William Hung of the Guitar, that maybe learned to play with the AKORDES tuition software. Not even him would buy this cd! I repeat, DO NOT BUY THIS TRASH!

I was disappointed by the fact that the Tortuga Cake does not have the expected rich flavor.

I downloaded this book to read to my granddaughter and she absolutely loved it. Although she is from the \\"digital age\\", she enjoyed the author's human take on what it might be like to be a cat. I only gave the book 4 stars because of the difficulty younger readers might have reading it. It was written in 1857 by an English author whose style is probably a little too sophisticated for 21st century children (which is a shame). That being said, if the book is read with the help of an adult it is a fun and timeless read, and, did I mention? It's currently FREE! :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bigfoot Research 2010, Part 2","review":"where do i begin..This documentary is horrible & not worth a dime!

I hung onto this DVD and gave it another chance. Now that I've increased the weights for this, it always has a place in my rotation. When Heidi does the first set of dips using no weights, I use a 15 lb. dumbell. For the leg presses and squats I use 15 lb. in each hand and for the one legged plies on the bench I use 20 lbs. on the tie-in of the working leg and 20 lbs on the opposite shoulder. For the hip rotation I use 20 lbs. on the working leg. This gives me a great workout-I'm working hard enough that my heart rate's up there and I feel I've worked everything. That's what I love about the Firm-I even keep some of the basic tapes for when I'm not feeling up to the \\"gut-busting cardio\\". I can use heavier weights & light weights for the cardio when they use none and I always feel I've gotten a decent workout. You might try it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't break a sweat","review":"I have worked out for many years and used both the old Firm work outs and FitPrime's original workouts. These two workouts are very easy, and like some of the original FitPrime workouts, a little clumsey. They are ok for the days you don't want to work too hard, but you may have to do both to feel like you've done anything. In fact I tried to find out if they were designed for older women, but found no information about that. I am older--past 50 and I found them a yawn."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW just WOW","review":"I had seen the lifetime movie a while back and wanted to learn more about the crime.

He has been using Barney interactive earlier on, which I highly recommend to every parent. My son was trying with the mouse and its really not as good as expected. He got frustrated with it pretty fast. I suggest Disney takes a look at the Barney Interactive CD's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"My 15 month old loves this software! She particularly loves helping Pooh find his honey and playing peek a boo with Tigger. As far as the Start, Control, and Alt keys are concerned (in reference to ... ...), I have had no troubles. Although it is a bit slow on the reaction time for a couple of the modules, you wouldn't expect Winnie the Pooh to be bouncing all over the screen either. The musical pots and pans with Roo has an instant reaction time. As far as keeping your baby attentive, keep in mind that babies still have short attention spans, and most won't sit still for an hour (mine never sits still). However she has sit still for 20 minutes in my lap to play this game! Overall, this is an excellent program, and I will be purchasing the toddler version in a few months."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"For my 14 month old duaghter, I purchased this software as well as Reader Rabbit Baby/Toddler and JumpStart Toddler. She lost interest in the Disney software after approximately 5 minutes. It is not as interactive as the others and is not particularly engaging. She's nuts about the Reader Rabbit software and has learned to use both the keyboard and mouse with the Reader Rabbit games."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Sad Portrayal of Female Friendship","review":"I'm surprised that so many people have written positively about this book. Cunningham takes on way too much, neglecting major details that could've enriched an otherwise bland, sad story of women in NY. True friends would never neglect sharing the significant details of their lives: a mastectomy, infertility, a parent's impending death. These women focus exclusively on adolescent concerns: their weight and men. How sad for them. This book made me appreciate my friends all the more!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland Buddy Book","review":"Friends attempt to make it to a dinner party/baby shower...hostess is rushed, critical snob friend doesn't make it a priority, pregnant friend insecure....blah, blah. The information you get on these gals is not enough to connect you ...but if you had more time with them, you may not find it all that interesting anyway. I love books about female friendships but not this one. This one is just okay. If your reading time is precious, don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre and poorly edited","review":"The constant fixation with the surroundings of each story was mundane, distracting, and, at times, incorrect for a story set in the 21st century. Although the novel is not bad for a quick read, often repeated phrases such as \\"mucho dollaros\\" and \\"cheapo\\" are jarring and should have been edited out."},{"rating":"1","title":"You've got to be kidding","review":"This book, which was recommended in a reputable book review, is one of the biggest wastes of time I've spent in a long while. (I only finished it becayse my book group is reading it.) The characters are caricatures: Not one of them seems remotely believable, and nothing that happens to them rings true. Even the small details are off the mark: A woman from Kentucky pronounces the word kids as \\"keeds\\"? Sorry, but I don't think so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superlative, literate fiction about single women's lives","review":"This book is so startlingly smart and truthful, it brought tears to my eyes. The tears were followed by laughter. I looked into this novel as into a mirror. How do you know all this? I ask the author. Can you read my mind? Do you know me? And my friends? I felt my body and soul were exposed and I did not want this book to end. There are erotic sequence too, that seem so true, I wonder if they are memories. Destined to be read widely by women with above average intelligence. I will read it again and again, and give to my best friends in a chain of friendship...Loved, loved, loved it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"Very slow moving, overall not a very interesting story.I was expecting something more chic lit and funny and it wasn't that at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Six single women, six stars!","review":"There should be a higher rating to express my utter rapture with this fantastic book. I never thought there would be an accurate novel to depict the real life stories of working women in their 30's, 40's This is so much more intelligent than Sex and the City, they are not on the same planet. These women make their way in the world, navigate through city life and have believable affairs with men. I loved the Postcoital divide...into which a man disappears after sex. Too funny, so true. I fell in love with the Native American man who sweeps the hostess off her feet, their love scene is truly beautiful. This is sex that is not embarassing to read, yet true and utterly evocative. My friends are all reading it and say the same thing. This is a gift!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What an unreal waste of time!","review":"Lucky for me, I borrowed this from the library. how angry would I have been to have wasted money on this! What could have been an AMAZING story, falls flat, dead. ONE character out of the six MAIN characters has a MINIMAL resolution to her issues. The others have NONE. ZERO. One character--one of the more interesting characters in the book--has a big \\"secret\\" that we wait most of the book for her to reveal... and when she does... YAWN!The character from Kentucky... pul-lease, did this woman do ANY research??? Be serious!Martha, who by all standards, should have had some experience to teach her something valuable... no, she is unchanged.Just a ridiculous waste of my time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful -- luminous prose","review":"It's rare to find a sexually frank book with the poetic and social insights that this unusual first novel offers. I know the writer well through her memoirs, Sleeping Arrangements and A Place in the Country, and am so excited that this novel surpasses even those marvelous autobiographiocal accounts. The \\"beautiful bodies\\" are complete, real women, not tinny stereotypes. Their dreams and complicated relationships with one another, men and the city, make for luminous prose, insomniac nights. Heaven!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I couldn't even finish this book!","review":"I rarely stop reading a book after I have started it, especially if I get more than half way through it. I stopped reading this book after I had read more than half of it. The entire first half of the book is just long, drawn out character descriptions and not much plot. I am giving it two stars instead of one for the mere fact that one of the reasons it may have been difficult for me to get into the book was because I would read it too sporadically and in small doses because I was very busy at the time. Cunningham's novel, \\"Dreams of Rescue\\" is much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dragon Ball Z at its best","review":"Listen up ya'll. You want the pure, unsaturated Dragon Ball Z, then the Mangas are your best buy! I have issues 1-7 for DBZ and DB and they are great. Uncensored, uncut, blood, guts, perverted humor, the works! They even use the real names (i.e. Son Goku and Kurirun).See the things America networks didn't want you to see (like the a Ginyu Force member getting his head torn off). Plus one issue is like 10 eps of the TV show. Issue 1 has the entire Raditz saga up to Goku's death Issue two is the snake way and Gohan's training and so on.This series is a must for Dragon Ball fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY FROM THIS COMPANY","review":"I have yet to receive this order & I have not received a credit.

Two GB (gigabytes) are more memory that ANYONE could possibly want in a card. I can take over 1,500 pictures at 4 MP (which comes out to about 1.08-1.8 MB each) and still have plenty of space left over for videos. I shot a video today and it lasted thirty minutes. THIRTY MINUTES!I recommend this memory card over any other type, brand, model, etc. You just can't go wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smoke and mirrors","review":"Seems like a good price for a 2GB memory card.

I only needed a 2GB card for a new amp I bought for my guitar. It's an amp that you can jam with. You can store backing tracks on an SD card and then plug the card into the amp and select the song you want to play along with. The amp only works with a 2GB card so that is why I bought this one.

No worries."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a memory card","review":"I bought 2 of these for my cameras. I have a Nikon D50 and a Canon A570. Not much to say. The cards hold a lot of high resolution pictures. Work for my photography needs. I don't use the salvo setting for more than 5-10 shots at a time so I have no need for the fast memory cards in my D50. The A570 is a point and shoot so there are no need for the faster cards there.

However, I bought this card and it quit working after 6 months. I would have not minded if it had been replaced, but neither the seller or SanDisk would replace it(yet this listing is claiming a 5 year warranty). The seller would not replace because it was too long after their return period. SanDisk would not replace because their warranty applies to \\"Brand New in Factory Sealed Retail packaged products only\\". So I am not knocking SanDisk exactly, but the bulk cards. Great price, but if something messes up you're outta luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shipping Charges Are Outrageous","review":"This is a common thing I've found on the internet, especially on Ebay, but more and more on Amazon these days too. I selected several SD memory cards, placed them in my cart. When I went to check out, the total for the cards was about $70. The shipping was more than $85., and the tax was more than $12. The actual shipping charges would be less than $5. I don't know why these people do business this way. At best its dishonest, and at worse, its fraud. For me its a complete turn-off, and I won't do business with these kind of people. I just wish Amazon had a way for me to filter these merchants from my searches so I don't waste so much of my time. As this practice becomes more frequent on Amazon, I find myself using Amazon less. I can see a time in the near future where I'll only use Amazon for book purchases."},{"rating":"1","title":"Check out the shipping price!","review":"I placed an order for 3 of these SD cards, thinking they were are great deal at about $4 each. When I saw the shipping charge, though, I reconsidered. The SD cards came to $12.03, but shipping & handling was $18.97! Actual mailing costs has to be under $2 for these things, so the seller is luring people in with a low product cost and making a killing on the shipping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Device is Fine, Shipping is Outrageous","review":"I bought this card for $9.42 and had to pay $6.99 for shipping. I though maybe there's a reason, that the actual shipping price was high. Nope. It just came in a padded envelope and the postage in the corner said...58 CENTS! Now, come on. Where did my other $6.41 go? If they need it to make a profit, then they should just make the price that much more.That being said, the card works great. No problems, but maybe you should buy it from a store rather than from Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"CRAZY SHIPPING!! Think twice!!","review":"I put three of these in my cart and the shipping was $18 !!! I live in the US so it was just standard shipping. This is a complete rip off when you think about it. The shipping on these cards is so inexpensive, seller is padding the shipping to make up for the cost. This price was put up to trick people into buying who may not notice the crazy shipping.Do yourself a favor and buy any other cards than these.

On one level it is pure eye candy and on another it is a valuable tool. Ms. Braun's approach is unique. She uses skills from art, music and a bit of history to help create her unique designs. While one would look at her work and see that it is complicated and difficult, I actually see that she uses a lot of basic piping skills and other techniques. with a little practice one could definitely recreate some of the lovely decorations she has created."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book woke me up!","review":"I have been making cakes and pastry for many years and I have read many great books about it, but this book helped me push my work to another level and thank you Margaret Braun for that!

Would love to see more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Margaret Braun is to cake decorating what Yoda is to a Jedi","review":"Finally a Cake Decorating Book that debunks the idea of cake decorations as cutesy and chintzy. Instead Margaret Braun brings the well trained eye of a designer to her cakes. Each cake is, stunningly more elegant than the one before. More importantly in addition to the book's gorgeous design and great photography Margaret lets you into her design process. With this truly unique book Margaret Braun teaches the reader/ baker to start to see a cake as your blank canvas and allow yourself to create your own masterpiece. She gives you the tools to open your eyes to design elements all around you. If you are like me you will find that CakeWalk does not find its place among the bookshelf with the rest of the cookbooks but on the coffee table as a constant source of culinary inspiration."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm on my third copy of this book!!!","review":"I've read through several of the other reviews that have stated that this book isn't meant for a beginner; however, when I first began to decorate cakes in culinary school (and I mean I had literally NEVER picked up a piping bag before).Was I able to decorate a cake like Margaret Braun from reading the book??? Of course not!I don't think that this was ever the point of the book. The artist, Magaret Braun, tells you to practice, practice, practice!The more experience that I've gotten, the better I've gotten at decorating cakes.If you're looking for a book that you can buy and immediately duplicate, then you're not going to find it in this book.If you're looking for a book that will take you something to strive for, this is it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Planning On Building A Masterpiece . . . ?","review":"Then this book is for you. The author is truly a master at her craft; the cakes pictured are architecturally striking and marvelously beautiful.The book is a large-scale glossy hardbound volume, which might lead one to believe it is filled with pictures of hundreds of different cakes Ms. Braun has baked/built/decorated/bejeweled. Instead, it is a painstaking, precise instruction manual on how to construct a relative few of these matterhorn confections.It's exciting to witness an accomplished chef so willing to share the detailed, step-by-step secrets of her craft. For someone without aspirations of building at least one epic wedding cake, however, this book may disappoint despite the generosity of its author."},{"rating":"1","title":"NICE COLOR","review":"NICE COLOR BUT, IS NO GOOD BOOK JUST BEAUTIFUL PICTURE,I' M SORRY REALLY NICE DECORATION BUT NO EXPLAIN HOW WE CAN MADE IS NO NICE"},{"rating":"2","title":"YES, You Can!!!","review":"I did it, and so can you. Right down to going to the fabulous New York Cake and Bakery Dist. store in NYC, I followed all her easy instructions. The pearlized, powder for painting the icing made my cake shimmer like nothing I'd created before. People gave me compliments on a party cake I made for 3 days straight! I felt almost guilty for plagarizing, but Margaret Braun shares her secrets with such generosity! Reading more like a diary than a cookbook, \\"Cakewalk...\\" is a love letter from her to the cake decorating enthusiast. If you are ready to take your art one step further, then this inspiring book is absolutely for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time or money!","review":"Within 10 seconds of opening this book I realized that I should have first looked at it in the bookstore before buying it online.Most of the designs are just aweful looking with a first and second generational web site approach. I was very much looking forward to using Photoshop for advanced interfaces but this is not the book.If you want to create embossed buttons and ugly textures then by all means buy it! For those people actually looking to design an interface keep on looking."},{"rating":"2","title":"a good introduction to interface design","review":"i found this book to be an ideal introduction to the special considerations that make interface design an art unto itself.

The graphics in the book are almost laughable...they certainly echo the time. I'll probably still look through the book since the basics are probably still the same, but since i'm using CS3, I imagine the bulk of this book will be pointless. I think I only paid a penny for it, though, so I guess I didn't lose much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pheromones are Phony","review":"Pure Instinct doesn't attract anything or anyone.

You can't rely on a happy ending; you can't rely on them not knocking off the hero; sometimes you don't even know who the hero is. That's what makes them such fun. There is a flashback in this movie which makes the whole movie worth watching -- Rudolph Valentino as a 15th century nobleman with women trouble. It's a hoot. \\"Cobra\\" has a surprise ending (at least for me) so at odds with movies of today when you know in the first reel what's going to happen because they're so formulaic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must-see for LaPaglia fans","review":"This isn't the most original plot in the world, but it's definitely a sweet and touching tale nonetheless. The beautiful visuals highlight LaPaglia's tender performance of a shy, quiet priest trying to get by during WWII. In particular, this is a showcase of LaPaglia's wonderful array of sad-eyed expressions, puppy-dog guilty looks, and heart-grabbing sighs. If you dig LaPaglia in emotional settings, you will definitely want to see this movie.The other acting is also quite good.The \\"Italian\\" accents aren't always top-notch and I would have preferred the movie to not have used accents in that way at all, but it's a minor complaint.It was almost six weeks ago that I watched the movie, and I still think about it every day - it moved me that much."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST PLUGS FOR CLASSIC CARS","review":"FOR THE BEST PERFORMANCE THESE PLUGS WORK GREAT I HAVE A ULTA HIGH COMPRESSION MOTOR THAT NEEDS THE BEST PLUGS THESE ARE ALREADY PRE GAPPEDAND THEY ARE INDEXED FOR THE BEST EXHUST BLAST"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality Chair","review":"I sent back this chair due to the saggy leather and poor quality finish.

I was originally an xbox fan all the way, but the small size of the ps2 (a little bigger than a game/dvd case) makes it easy to bring the system anywhere in a small bag or backpack. The silver color is a change from a world of mainly black consoles, and lots of people have commented on mine. In addition, the built in network adaptor is GREAT for free online play. I love bringing my ps2 to relatives or friends houses and simply plugging it into their router allows me and friends to have hours of gaming.Whether you like action, adventure, puzzle, shooters, mmorpg's, sports, or even just watching movies (the slim ps2 makes a great dvd player with a remote), the ps2 has something for everyone, and with a new color and tiny size, its hard to pass up this time around!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"All the power and ability of the PlayStation 2 at its peak plus a sexy silver venier.

Most games that are put out can be played on the PS2, and just about everyone enjoys it. I've loved playing new and old PS1 games on it for awhile now. It has been a lot of fun. The only thing that sucks about the slim ones is that you can't get a 4 player multi-tap for it. That was a dissapointment since I had it still from my PS1 from years ago and wanted to still play the same games, well, in 4 player mode. Overall though, it is a decent system. Can kill a lot of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good buy but cooling issues","review":"It's pretty easy to get your money out of this system, the progressive scan functionality is an added plus. So far, it seems like a solid, compact, and sleek build. The reason why i did not give it 4 stars because it does heat up quite a bit after prolonged use, whether it be a game or DVD. I placed a heatsink over mine which helped noticeably."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Choice","review":"Sleek, slim and looks great!

I didn't like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of My Favorites!","review":"I have had this book for over 20 years (c.1987!) and I return to it often for great baking recipes. The recipes are simple to follow and delicious. When I find myself frustrated by the overwrought recipes in other cookbooks by well-known chefs, I find comfort in my well-worn copy of \\"Having Tea.\\" It's compact, specific, light enough to hold (a rarity these days in cookbook design), and inspires me to make delicious European comfort food. I once thought I lost it after a move and was very uspet, luckily I found it. I suspect that some of the negative reviews may come from people that aren't accustomed to European and British style breads and pastries, ie if you don't like crumpets to begin with, you won't like crumpets from this book. Or Irish Soda Bread or Flan for that matter. If you grew up eating foods like this, or aquired a taste for them, you will love this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite possibly one of the best SNL books ever.","review":"You never see much of the behind the scenes going ons of SNL.

I havent finished it yet and already there is a wealth of things I learned. ...Come out with another edition guys! We want more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasant trip down Memory Lane","review":"I was very happy and somewhat surprised to find this hidden gem in the Kindle Books section. I happened to read this book quite a few years ago, back when the casts and incidents related were fresh and new. I haven't seen the book since so it is nice to once again discover the history and pre-history of one of the groundbreaking series in TV comedy. While it is not a comprehensive story of the many years of this show (Tom Shales oral history is the book for that), it does detail much of the early and classic seasons and casts. This is also an excellent primer on how a live show is written, produced and finally makes it on the air week after week and the toll that kind of pressure-cooker grind can take on those involved. I recomend it to anyone interested in this and the now-familiar personalities involved."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book Full of Great Stories","review":"I bought this book without realizing that there is a newer book about SNL, but this was a truly interesting detailed account of what the early days of SNL were like. I was completely entertained and couldn't wait to read the next page and the next story. Full of great tales of drugs, sex and personalities, this book is really interesting and actually inspired me to buy the newer book that was written by different authors so I can hear about the later casts."},{"rating":"2","title":"very insightful and shocking","review":"This book tells the highs and lows (pun intended) of the first ten years of SNL. Very interesting, it goes through the formation of the original, legendary cast through the horrible sixth season up until '86. A lot of the wounds are still new. Bil Murray was pissed off with Belushi and Aykroyd forleaving him in the lurch to Play \\"the white guy\\" in every scene. He had heated debates with Lorne and forced his sketches. We see how they underused Eddie Murphy, unforgivable in any circumstance, but just ridiculous when he was working with their worst cast up to that point."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trite story, cliche characters","review":"This book was recommmended by a book store employee, so I was expecting a good read. The story was not well developed (even flawed), and while not predictable, it was rather trite. Cliche characters -- a bulemic dancer, an aging independent woman and a single mom obsessed with her baby -- come together, but don't seem to get very far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun hats for creative play","review":"My kids, 2 and 4 - enjoy these hats and helmets, the 2 year old in particular loves to wear them around the house. The police helmet in particular is lots of fun. They are great for promoting creative play. They are plastic and kind of cheap looking but fine for dress up fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"You will want one for each of your friends............","review":"This is a wonderful new book. It is not only good reading for gardeners, but also for those who are not. Each \\"musing\\" is short and straight forward. And each one leads the reader to think about how they contribute in their own community. Each thought brings a smile as a simple observation takes on a wider implication, and gives the reader a clearer understanding of ones own purpose."},{"rating":"2","title":"Giddiyap!","review":"If you enjoy Western music, this is the CD for you.

I don't know what did he do to get his contract, but when i heard this cd, this came to me: He's the William Hung of the Guitar, that maybe learned to play with the AKORDES tuition software.

What a song, what a songwriter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Let Kris Help You Make It Through The Night","review":"Kris Kristofferson didn't blame it on the Stones. He built a castle of poetry in song. A gentleman and an outlaw, he had a touch Schmielson, a belly full of Waylon, and a head full of Cash (the Johnny kind). He saw his friends wasted on the sidewalk, and his girls catchin a diesel out of N'awlins singing up every song that driver knew. I knew Kris and he wrote songs that endure. Listen to this whole album and you'll find out why Billboard's entire music review team had to have 35 albums flown in overnight because the rock music director made them all sit down and listen to the words of every song. You try it, and maybe you'll have one flown in overnight too. Bobby Magee and me both like him, and she was as proud of her young body as a body could be. Listen to these songs when you're \\"Sunday Morning Comin Down.\\"Gypsy Nick Shrode"},{"rating":"2","title":"a legendary album","review":"Kris Kristofferson's \\"Kristofferson\\" is one of the most original and underrated albums of his generation. While his contemporaries were rehashing the same material and ides over and over, Kristofferson offered something new to Nashville. What makes this album so great is how Kristofferson tells the bitter truth. His songs are about drunks and despair and straying away from one's path. Instead of being depressing however, it is uplifting and can be cathartic to people who have been through similar experiences as Kristofferson did. The music is top notch and a great mixture of different genres. The highlights on the album are: \\"To Beat The Devil,\\" \\"Me And Bobby McGee,\\" \\"Help Me Make It Through The Night,\\" \\"Just The Other Side Of Nowhere,\\" and of course \\"Sunday Mornin' Comin' Down.\\" A must have for anyone who likes good and sincere music. I can't even begin to explain how much this album means to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cleaned up and remastered.","review":"Kris benefits more than anyone I know with the remastering of some of his recordings. The origional hits on this album sounded flat but now sound fresh and clean. This is not a greatest hits package of course, yet some of his early hits are included, eg, 'Help Me Make It Through The Night', 'Me and Bobby Mcgee' among others. There are also 4 songs never released before this album all well worth a listen. If you're a Kris fan and have his origional albums, you might want to go for the remastered versions , they're certainly worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"More comfortable than others","review":"Buying a replacement for the Jabra that I lost was an immediate decision. It is the only headset that I have found that is comfortable for me. Others are too big, stuffing or bending my ear or giving me a headache. The small size Jabra earbud fits my ear very well and is much easier to wear.One small complaint: The gels in the set used to be 3 different colors, coding them by size. Now all are clear, and it takes more effort to dig out the smallest ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Gillette Model","review":"Great Product, Great Performance. But can't they make a system that doesn't lose the earbud? I spend all my time retracing my steps looking for the dang things. ...If they fix that I'll give it 5 Stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"nothing but problems","review":"I bought this headset for my husband and he has had all sorts of problems with it. He had to exchange the first unit because the ear piece came apart, exposing wires. With his second, so far, he has lost all but 1 of the EarGels because there is no way to fasten them securely - he even tried gluing one on. He traveled to Las Vegas and, having lost the EarGel on the plane, he went to a cellular phone store to buy a replacement pack. He was told by the store manager that many people come in asking for the same thing for the same reason, but that Jabra is refusing to sell the EarGels separately. They obviously don't realize what a problem it is (or what an opportunity they have to replace items so easily lost)."},{"rating":"1","title":"great ideas - lousy implementation","review":"I have been anxious for a product like this but was dissappointed with the results. The winder, itself, works well, however other aspects of the design are poor. The ear gels are comfortable, but I lost 4 in a week because they got knocked off the earpiece while it was clipped to my belt. The sound quality of the earpiece is okay, but the sound quality of the microphone is poor. The foam covering for the microphone is also easily lost while travelling on your belt. (That happened the first day.) Motorola makes a similar product for their phones and Radio Shack has one for various models, but this is the only product I know of to fit my Nokia 8200."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice desisgn","review":"I bought this to use as a backup for my Bluetooth headset. I was specifically searching for a unit with a cord winder and this was the only product I found with that feature.I like the product. The EarGel works well for me and the cord winder keeps me from dealing with a tangled cord. Sound quality seems to be good on both ends of the conversation.My only problem is that the EarGel comes off easily, especially if I carry it in my pocket. Since I use the same one all the time, I am considering cementing it on."},{"rating":"2","title":"ONE OF THE BEST BANDS THAT ALMOST MADE IT!!","review":"This a terrific movie about one of the best bands from the early 80's that didn't make it big but should have! Forget what Sam Graham says in the product review about them not being very good. These guys were and still are incredible musicians!! What they play is very intricate and difficult to play and they play it well!! They are the godfathers of trash/speed metal. Without them we there never would have been a Metallica or a Slayer or a Megadeth! If your a true fan you have to appreciate the dedication and talent of one of the best but never recognized metal bands of all time ANVIL!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Be prepared...","review":"While this is a great film, don't expect to feel good after watching this. The whole film is mostly really depressing as you watch the lead singer desperately trying to cling to something that just is no longer there. It's interesting, and it's great to see their attitude about the situations they're in, but it's also kind of sad as you realize that this is how most bands turn out, being left behind by the music industry and all but their fiercest fans. As a musician it really pierced my heart even more so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst 80 minutes I can remember.","review":"No entertainment value at all. Just a very slow paced movie about two guys that are now in their 50's and trying to make another record and run into disappointment after disappointment.

Is this supposed to be the new Spinal Tap? If this is a joke -- I don't get it. Everyone likes to root for an \\"underdog\\", but the underdog has to at least have a little bit of talent and a genuine reason why they should succeed. Why has Anvil struggled for 25 years trying to make it? Because they aren't any good. Their playing is mediocre at best and their songs are lame and amateurish. There are a thousand highschool garage bands who are just as good as these guys.At least Spinal Tap's songs were clever and well done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anvil Angst","review":"I saw Anvil on a talk show some time back and wondered (a) whatever happened to them in the first place and (b)what was all the fuss about this DVD.I treated myself to a copy of the movie and was really amazed and moved by their story. This movie, more than any other I have seen, conveys all the emotion, passion and pain living for your art must be about. Anvil endures, without the success of platinum records, awards or the trappings of what we perceive to be the \\"rock star\\" existence.We are taken on an ersatz tour with Anvil and witness the less glamorous side of trains, planes and automobiles. The anquish of less-than capacity (ahem) crowds; the frayed nerves 35plus years of head-banging-turned-banging-your-head-against-the-wall have brought upon our heroes. It's all very powerful and makes a real-life story so compelling.The Barenaked Ladies song \\"If I had $1,000,000\\" comes to mind-- if we did, we'd give it to Anvil...the reward for their endurance."},{"rating":"1","title":"For young children","review":"I am a Physical Educator for Third, Fourth and Fifth graders and ordered this book to use with them.

Not politically correct as all versions are watered down now - so my boys love it (3 & 5). The first 2 pigs get ate by the wolf, and the 3rd pig wins out in the end by eating the wolf. Pictures are AWESOME! My kids love reading along - and we love doing voices for each character. Also - this version is a little longer than the normal story by having the wolf try to trick the 3rd pig into getting outside - which makes the story even better! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"This version of the Three Little Pigs is excellent. The original tale with the actual eating of the pigs and wolf.

In this version two of the pigs get eaten by the wolf, and the wolf gets eaten in the end by the last pig.

I seriously don't recall. DID the first two pigs get eaten and the wolf boiled alive? If so, I guess it didn't bother me!

This anniversary edition, though, has no real reason to be : no remastering (although the sound quality has always been quite excellent) and two bonus tracks that, while fine, can seem a bit jarring following the former last track of a familiar and perfect album. The liner notes (new, by Winston himself) are worthy, but all in all this deluxe edition is no particular improvement and a purchase you can pass on if you already own the original CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful CD","review":"I have had this CD for ages and find it truly beautiful.

George Winston can take you on a relaxing ride through a starry night over the snow, all bundled up and warm. The music evokes a sense of peace and soothing pleasure. It's so simple, and so perfectly melodic and in tune. This is a \\"Christmas\\" album that you can play all year round, whenever you need to relax, clear your mind and unwind.I'm not sure why it's labeled \\"New Age\\" music, other than being acoustical tunes. But whatever the label, Windham Hill found a gem in George Winston, and this is one of his best CDs. Buy this one first, then try his other \\"season\\" CDs.

George Winston is incredible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great stuff","review":"George Winston is fabulous and this December album with the added tracks is perfect.

We promptly fell in love with it, and fell more in love as it served for the soundtrack for our skiing honeymoon. It has been nearly 15 years, and still this album evokes so many emotions in me. I can close my eyes and see the snow falling when I listen to the opening bars of It Came Upon a Midnight Clear. We listen to it each time we ski, as well as from around November through January or so of each year. My daughter played it recently as background for a dinner she made for her fiance, and has asked me where she can get a copy . . . I guess the spell goes on! I agree wholeheartedly with the many other reviewers - December transports me to a place of peace and calm, of mountains and snowy fields, of warm holiday memories, of the real reason for the season. Mr. Winston has used his gift most miraculously in this masterpiece!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Piece","review":"I first heard 'Thanksgiving' on a compilation 'album\\" (yes, an album) in the early 80s. Since then, 'December' has always been, and always will be an importantant part of, not only Christmas, but all of life. I have been playing guitar for about 30 years and I have taken some of these pieces and transposed them on my guitar. I would give up my guitar in a minute to be able to play piano like George.

I listened to it 7 times in a row that day alone and love it more and more each time I hear it---even brought it to work and had my co-workers listening to it. Because of my good PR with people in getting them to 'know' about Enrique, he has gained 8 new fans from this CD alone. It's hard to name a favorite song because every song of his is my favorite!

I blindly bought it because I've seen how Enrique sings/performs with passion and in a deeply felt manner. This one is no exception; I love all but 2 tracks.

The CD can't seem to leave my car player."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing, worth every penny.","review":"This album is truly amazing. I am so satisfied with my purchase of Iglesias's new cd. I never heard the cd before I bought it, except the addicted single which I am not that crazy about. My favorite tracks have to be #4, #6 and #12. I have played this cd twice already today on my road trip and will be playing more. Enrique did a great job and for anyone who likes pop music, I would highly recommend this cd. Thumbs up to Enrique and I will be seeing him for this album tour."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable pop","review":"I must say that Enrique is going a bit downhill lately. At first he was the great latino star with hits like \\"Bailamos\\" \\"Rhythm Devine\\" and \\"Be With You\\" all were a kind of trademark for his style, but the longer he's been singing the less of those songs we hear. This album is just blatant ordinary pop, it could have been sang by anyone. Well it works, he continue to sell albums and he'll score a few hits most likely but it's neither very good or entertaining. Let's just compare \\"Addicted\\" to \\"Hero\\" if that's possible. It's miles away from his last Cd's hitsingle. I Think \\"The Way you touch me\\" is one of the best here, also \\"You Rock me\\" should get mentioned. This album is not exactly a bad record, but it's far from what he can and should archive."},{"rating":"1","title":"No!","review":"\\"Dude,will you just go away?\\" - Taken from my Gazette,and I'm totally for it!I don't understand why I have to give this 1 star."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Few Good Songs","review":"This album is OK. There are a few songs that save it from being a total disappointment. If you're a big fan than I'd say get it, you'll probably aquire a taste for it. The more I listen to it the less terrible it sounds. If you just started listening to him since his last album (Escape) I'd recommend staying away from this one. It doesn't even come close.I think he attempted to become too \\"Pop\\" in some of his songs here and lost the smooth Latin sound he's known for.Gave this 2 stars for the few songs that are really 5 star quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"SEVEN is not lucky for Enrique - simply miserable :(","review":"I went to a midnight release party at my local music store and this was one of the discs I bought. I was excited until I heard it. It is one of his worst and miserable recordings. I bought the CD mainly for \\"Addicted\\", which I LOVE, but I can gaurantee you I will NEVER be addicted to this disc. I have \\"Escape\\", \\"Bailamos - Greatest Hits\\" and another disc of his, so I DO LIKE HIM. But, reviews are written to judge the ALBUM, not the artist.Folks, save your money. I can't stress enough. I should have known something was up when there were two stickers on CD wrap, 1: Fly Away with Enrique promotion game and 2: NEW LOW PRICE sticker. It's apparent now that material couldn't make it on its own without promotions :("},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this a joke?","review":"I am not quite sure how to describe this album. I've now heard it many, many times (or does it just seem like that to me?), and it hasn't started to sound any better to me.The voice is that of a very average singer and the production is rather old fashioned and vulgar. It sounds a bit like Roxette meets Nick Kershaw with a heavy serving of Euro-trash (but it isn't that good!).I am not sure what one is supposed to do with this album. The music on it isn't very interesting and it is hardly great dance music. Let's just say that as a singer, Enrique Iglesias is a great body builder!Verdict? Boring and annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea, but is Enrique stuck in 1989?!","review":"I haven't heard the album, but I could tell from hearing the song Addicted. It sounded like an overwrought 1989 heavy metal band power ballad. Enrique just doesn't pull it off on this song. It doesn't match with the best of his songs either. I heard some of the other songs--it has that '80s feel, but he doesn't connect with the essence of that decade. Has Enrique run out of songs to write long after that Hero megasuccess? He needs to keep up on that pace rather than turn into some retro mode like he's doing now. I don't mind artists taking chances or risks, but don't sacrifice being in 2004 while your mind is stuck in a time warp doing this '80s retro thing. Sorry if I'm rough, but Enrique's idea for the Seven album just doesn't make sense."},{"rating":"2","title":"SEVEN sounds as \\"latin lover boy with mole\\" is out of luck","review":"The CD has several interresting tracks. The musical direction is strong on tracks THE WAY YOU TOUCH ME and NOT IN LOVE (a weak Timberlake-ish attempt at pop).However when scanning Amazon reviews, one will notice this media charmer overstayed his welcome with the public at large. The problem with this CD is listeners focusing on IGLESIAS' vocal talent (or lack of talent).This CD may sell but will never achieved the same level of success as his prior work.To borrow a line from his track \\"BE YOURSELF\\"...\\"Papa used to say that you're just a looser MAMA say the music you play gonna get you nowhere\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"this album sucks!","review":"hey .. this is the worst enrique iglesias album ever .. i totally hate all of his songs ..ther are all boring.. why dont you try buing his first 2 albums ?? ( enrique & vivir ) .. thar are good ones.. thanx bye"},{"rating":"2","title":"SEVEN ROCKS!","review":"Enrique's musical influence is the 80's and nothing shows it more clearly then this latest project which is a Classic Rock album. He blends a fusion of rock and dance sounds with raw vocals to make every song completely unique. He starts out with NOT IN LOVE in which he questions whether or not he is in love. Other songs like THE WAY YOU TOUCH ME, and FREE are anthems to passion and sex, especially FREE which is graphically explicit. BE YOURSELF is a lesson in not letting others destroy your dreams and goals in life. WISH YOU WERE HERE WITH ME and SAY IT are about losing a loved one; YOU ROCK ME, ROAMER and LIVE IT UP TONIGHT are pure upbeat rock songs, especially YOU ROCK ME which has a strong sexual theme to it. All in all he captures the classic 80's sound and gives it a new twist. For those of you who miss 80's rock (the best decade of American music) this album is for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"7 is the best CD ever!!!","review":"I love the new album of Enrique Iglesias tilted 7!!! It is a real good cd, all the songs are amazing, from track #1 to track #14... I think Enrique did a great job not just writing the songs but he sings awesome. The sound in the songs is great, most of them have an 80's feeling.. wow they are all great!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this cd!!","review":"I don't own any other Enrique cds, so I don't really have anything to compare it to, but I love this cd! I can listen to the whole thing all the way through, which doesn't happen very often for me. I usually end up skipping at least a few songs on some of even my favorite cds.

Very pleasantly surprised."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is NOT the Kodaly Missa Brevis","review":"Don't get your hopes up!

This CD actually only contains a single movement from the Kodaly Missa Brevis: The Agnus Dei."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well, I enjoyed it","review":"I gave this CD a 4 out of 5, because (1) it's not a complete album and (2) half of the songs aren't as developed as they could be. It's important to keep in mind that this is a soundtrack to a movie (Burned Negro lol), and I'm sure these songs are perfect for the movie, but, as a CD, it doesn't have much return value.Either way, Svidd Neger is worth listening to, and it is enjoyable. Ulver's sound in this one is that artsy kind of electronic music with an orchestral flavor and the same dark emotional core that Ulver is really good for, but maybe more emphasis on the artsy part. Like a soundtrack, there are many reoccurring themes (so reoccurring that some of the songs are basically the same with structural differences and variations), so it's kind of fun to try and imagine what's going on in the movie at the time without actually having seen the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"A mistake","review":"These shoes were cheap enough so I tried them.Walking on my feet was a nightmare.It was a bad time and I'll never buy a bargain shoe again."},{"rating":"2","title":"this shoe is sexy .","review":"This galvin wedges is so sexy and chick i am just loving it , i am glad that i purchases, i am thinking of buying another color.

She's the agent that the British send in when they want to make sure a job will be done. And she works alone. She has her hands full in this book trying to save the Drs. Tidwell, mother and daughter, from agents trying to get control of a new biological weapon. Dr. Skye Tidwell, the daughter, becomes especially important as she is rescued, twice, and becomes Addison's first partner. The fact that Addison isn't sure that any of this is a good idea just adds to the story. This is one you won't be able to put down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many bad words","review":"I just finished reading this book. It was unecessarily too long. That and all the bad words.

If your idea of watching 'erotic horror' involves grotesque fat feminist Amy Lynn Worst (aka Amy Lynn Best) rolling around in Karo syrup then have at it. Yes, this is her latest insult / exploitation of horror fans - created simply because she isn't attractive enough to be the lead in a proper horror movie (she also nurtures a deep hatred of horror fans over this fact which has slipped out in her interviews). Well known as a charlatan who brown-noses magazine editors and distributors in the underground horror industry (along with her 'director' husband Mike Watt) the woman actually loathes horror fans for being so 'misogynistic' yet turns around and hypocritically releases this! Desperate to exploit horror fans at all costs, here we find her AGAIN trying to rip people off with this ridiculous video that continues to mock the intelligence of genre fans.

And when I listened to the whole cd I thought it was cool.

I recommend it to anyone who is planning to, is currently, or has breastfed - you will connect with the many women who have told their incredible stories.

In public, hours later, I suddenly had trouble speaking because my mouth was full of sticky slime. I've tried several things since and have found a solution that works for me and is ridiculously cheap and easy. Tear off a hunk of regular kitchen waxed paper and fold it until you have a pad as thick as you need -- 4-8 thicknesses. If you use the natural width of the paper, you should get about 4 liners across. Lay your denture on the folded paper, draw around it and cut so that the front edge remains on an uncut fold. This gives it some stability. Fit it into the denture, bite down on it for a couple minutes and it fits even better than the flannel/wax EZO liners. I'm delighted with this, and see no reason why it shouldn't last as long as I do. It's not toxic, perfectly safe, and the wax molds to your mounth and denture. It's worth a try."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do now work as well as EZO's","review":"Bought these for my Mom. She says they are not as comfortable as EZO's, which are no longer manufactured.

I have been visiting it regularly for over 40 years. I have long and enduring friendships there, and relish the welcoming warmth I experience each time I visit.\\" Written by a friend, this unrelenting explanation of how Washington is viewed from Asia -- and why-- is particularly urgent now as America's economic position becomes more dependant on India and China, and political tensions in Asia escalate. Globalization, an unstoppable force for both good and ill, has destroyed any possibility of American isolationism. In spite of overwhelming military might, The United States cannot control the world. In his final chapter \\"The Pitfalls of Power\\", Patwant Singh gives us a unique view of ourselves. This is how others see us; we would do well to take heed.Pamela de Maigret"},{"rating":"1","title":"More bad than good","review":"Wow.

Interesting concept for a Chinese production company to film a martial-arts film in America. This movie could have been very good, except for a few things.The bad: The dubbing was HORRIBLE. The absolute worst I have ever experienced in a Kung-fu film.Also, one of the more glaring issues I had with this film was the lack of attention to detail. This film is supposed to be set in the Old West, but the clothes on some of the Caucasian men in the film, scream mid-to-late 70's. Some of the guys looked like they came straight from a biker flick. Did T-shirts had tags in the back in the Old West? If they did, then I apologize.I dunno. I can't recommend this flick. If you can stomach the bad to experience the good...give this a try.

One of the ship's officers accidentally gets himself doused with the nasty Ravager and falls victim to its horrifying effects. However, what the film never tells us is WHY this Ravager was made, and exactly WHAT its purpose is. It doesn't kill; it just kind of puts people in foul moods.Performances are either histrionically bad (Bruce Payne and Yancy Butler); or lethargically underplayed (Juliet Landau and Stanley Kamel).

She was assigned this book as a class project and she started it like any other reading assignment - hating every minute of it. Once she opened the book and began to explore it, the story, the uniqueness of the main character, and the way in which the story was written caused the book to be so wonderful for my daughter that she couldn't put it down. She is actually considering reading another book - and it MUST be about Caddie! Thank you, Carol Brink, for showing my daughter the wonder of reading!

Then Caddie came along, and she has remained with me to this day. I felt like I had a friend. The fact that Caddie's spunk and spirit were universal enough to surpass all time and regions to capture my heart, made this book my favorite. This is the little girl's answer to Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn. However, I think boys can become just as enraptured with this tale's feelings and experiences through the point of view of Caddie's brothers, Tom and Warren.

When Caddie's mother beat her with a horse whip for tricking Annabelle, her proper lady cousin, we can understand her shame and frustration at being a girl.

Sure, you can send a birthday card to a friend showing you care about them just enough to copy and paste an image you'll print out...but the EULA restricts you from using these images online, for business, etc.4.

Albert Finney gives what I would consider an Oscar worthy performance throughout the film, and both Julian Sands and Matthew Modine played complex and interesting supporting roles. My only complaint of the film is that I would like to have seen these two secondary characters developed more. I would actually like to see this story two more times, with each of these two characters playing the main role and seeing the story from their points of view. I would hardly call this a fault of the movie, however. Like a great novel, often what is not included in the story is as important as what is.

Oversized text and space wasting boarder art notwithstanding, the 2nd Ed boxed set incorporates all of the nonsense of the 'Time of Troubles' trilogy of novels. It also adjusts the Dale Reckoning time line by almost a hundred years for no reason. It gives scant overviews of too large of an area, and almost nothing on the things that really matter, like characters, noble houses, and rivalries between states.

On a more positive note, the large print is _easy_ on the eyes and the burgundy bonded-leather flexible cover is quite attractive. However, I'm returning this Bible and hope to eventually find a parallel KJV-NIV with the red letter feature.Just another observation: It is sad that this and almost all Bibles (and most other books) published today no longer have _sewn bindings_ but mere glued-in pages.

The character Triana is Anne Rice and she mourns the loss of her family and friends on the pages of this book. Every one mourns differently, but I am tired of reading about her dead family. This book has great descriptions of Louisiana and it's architectural history. The book starts out extremely slow, picks up and doesn't satisfy.

Anne Rice may be a more fulfilled person now, happier, more secure, healing from a river of pain. Yet every gain comes with a loss. Too bad this loss is also our own.

If you are the kind of person who likes a GOOD BOOK, not a book that gets good after 5 chapters or so, do NOT read this one. The few chapters I managed to choke down are nothing but meaningless drivel. It seems like Anne Rice is trying way to hard to make this book sound like some great classical novel.

However, the character, Triana, because she was depicted as being an over weight, whoa is me Ugly Duckling, I had a hard time enjoying (or believing) the script with the tender & passionate kissing from Stefan during the part when he was trying to get his violin back. I would get a mental image of Triana and her character description. Just killed it. I felt more sorry for Stefan then I did for Triana."},{"rating":"1","title":"Erg.","review":"As a general rule, I'm addicted to the works of Anne Rice... with the exception of Violin. Her words are like paint on a canvas, but Violin is an inkblot.I allowed hours to be drawn into the plot. With the turn of each page I hoped I'd find some concept to grasp, but I didn't. This one didn't work for me, but I've read several others since that have validated my addiction to Anne Rice."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I could i would rank this book with -5 stars!","review":"This book is just one way boring piece of rubbish. If I ever have troubles trying to sleep I would consider to read this book and I know it would be the right thing to put me to sleep instantly. It is soooo boring I couldn't read more than a dozen chapters. Anne Rice descriptions go over the point of just being a description...she takes pages and pages just to describe the least important objects which make no point to the story whatsoever. I have read some more works of her and I have no doubt she writes more \\"for the money\\" than she does for anything else.So to sum it up, don't waste any money on this book unless you suffer insomnia and pills don't work for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the good stuff?","review":"I am a huge Anne Rice fan, I love the Vampire Chronicles, and The Witching Hour is my all-time favorite book. I was excited to read Rice's newest novel, Violin. The story began all right, and I could see where it was trying to go, it just never got there. I went through the book going, when's it going to get to the good stuff? Unfortunately, I had to finish the entire book to realize there wasn't any good stuff. It was alternately boring and confusing. There's real potential in both characters, but no real resolution between the two. Even for die-hard Rice fans like me, this book was terrible. It was so bad that I haven't read any of her new books after Violin and have gone back to reading her old novels, such as Belinda and The Mummy."},{"rating":"1","title":"I couldn't wait to put it down...","review":"I have been a huge Anne Rice fan for years. Most often I really enjoy her use of history in her books, but this was just some type of lame attempt to - I don't know what. I had to force myself to finish the book and couldn't believe that I was saying to myself \\"This book is just the worst.\\" While I enjoyed Cry to Heaven and Servant of the Bones, Rice is at her best when writing of Vampires, Witches, and The Talamasca."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too superficial Romanticism, Anne...","review":"What happened to Anne Rice? This \\"Violin\\" doesn't explore the deepest meaning of Romanticism. It's too superficial and all the ideas drown in a slow, definetely boring writing. Either Anne didn't understand all the ideal implications of Romanticism or she perverted them. As for the music...Beethoven will curse her from his grave! She wasted a goldmine of possibilities using Beethoven, Paganini and Tchaikovski only to create atmosphere. Stefan? A weak character from every point of view. The best part was the beginning, Triana's mourning, but even that was too slow! \\"Pandora\\" was a little better than this book, \\"Servant\\" was useless and \\"Memnoch\\" partially ruined Lestat and her universe. Anne what's happening? I don't want Armand, my favourite character, to be destroyed!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A real snooze","review":"As a huge fan of the first batch of the Vampire Chronicles and of the Mayfair Witches, well I guess I just expected too much. I did not sympathize with the main character or with her dark companion. I didn't see nearly the development I had seen in Rice's other works. The book had a dark cloud over it that depressed and repelled me. None of the steamy decay of the other novels. Just gross. Play a violin, a little one, and sad music. The creator of Lestat can do better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bored me to death.","review":"I finished this book because I paid for it. Honestly, it bored me to death. If it got any worse, I may have slipped into a coma."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing, Next to \\"Feast of all Saints\\" her worst","review":"I found this book confusing to follow.

Didn't even finish it..therefore I treated it as a ghost and it disappeared!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe I wasted my time with this","review":"I've been an Anne Rice fan for years, but I started having my doubts with The Witching Hour. The ending to that story was completely out of character, and it seemed to me it was just a hook to get you to read Lasher. I yelled at the book when it ended, I was so disgusted.But I've enjoyed some of her other work, so I've read on.Not anymore. This book was wretched. This is my last Anne Rice book ever. I'm giving my whole collection of her works away, to avoid having anyone see them on my shelf and think I might like one of her books as a gift."},{"rating":"1","title":"I couldn't make it past 30 pages, and I'm a big Rice fan.","review":"At the risk of simply repeating the reviews of others, Ann Rice has greatly disappointed this once loyal fan. Although her quality has at times been uneven, I've always spent many a late night finishing her books. This time, I just couldn't get past the first few chapters. The more I read, the worse it got. I became so bored and disinterested that I could no longer even keep the characters straight. I'm going to forget that Ann ever wrote this book, and I'll instead look forward to her next work...but next time, I'll play it safe and wait for the paperback version."},{"rating":"1","title":"UNFINISHABLE","review":"I was an avid fan of Anne Rice books. Lestat, Rowan, the Mummy-great figures in the horror genre. Violin was a burden to read. Perhaps fans who have not experienced the death of a close one cannot enjoy this story. I found it to be a whining story, there is no likability for the characters. I hope her next story is better."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of trees","review":"The vampire Lestat was her last good book. Since then, she's slid farther and farther down hill and \\"Violin\\" is just awful. I couldn't finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rice's Violin - One too many","review":"I was a fan of Rice right from Interview with The Vampire. But have felt that since the Vampire Lestat, she has written nothing worth reading. Violin finally puts her talents into the grave she so often fixates on. This story only further solidifies what I have felt for a long time, the fact that for some reason it seems like Rice's first novels were written by someone else or these newer ones are written by someone else. I couldn't finish Violin, and I hardly ever put down a book. Don't waste your time or money. Reread her first two or three books. Its all rambling from there on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Run quickly from this self-indulgent mess. Don't bother","review":"I've read all of Anne Rice's books and enjoyed them all except the ending of the Witching Hour and the stupid sequels. This book, I couldn't finish because it was a waste of my time. Her self-indulgence is none of my business and should have remained locked in her diary instead of sold to her fans. This is one of the most insulting books and would never have been published if her name wasn't on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely not her best work.","review":"I am a very big fan of Anne Rice, and I love most of her books. However, I found this to be one of the most boring books she has written.

I found the first chapter morbid and the rest of the book offered very little. NOT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Anne Rice does it again.","review":"I have read many of the other reviews on this site, and I am wondering which book the rest of you have read. I did not find this book dull or wooden, in fact I was engrossed from the beginning. If anyone finds this book to understand, it must be because it was approached in the wrong way. This is not the sort of book that can be entered into with preconceived notions. You must simply start it and let it take you where it wants. If you try to rationalize the events OR the characters, you have already missed the point. Just let the over-the-top deliciousness of the language take you on the ride of a lifetime. After all, it is only a book. Don't take it TOO seriously. I thoroughly enjoyed this book, and would read it again in an instant. This is going on my frequent-read-shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst of the Anne Rice books","review":"I have enjoyed all of Anne Rice's books but this one. Not only was it slow, but it felt too personal in a way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love Anne Rice, Hate This Book","review":"I have read every Anne Rice Book Published, And loved them all. But, This book stinks! I am bored, skipping pages, wondering when it will capture me. Did someone else write this book? It's like someone took all the fuffy stuff Anne sometimes writes and filled an entire book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The first Anne Rice book you may not like.","review":"I usually devour her books but this one simply couldn't capture my attention. I spent the whole book from my first meeting with Treana and Stefan wondering where the story line was and I never found it. I found myself skipping pages just to try to get to the heart of the story and the ending just didn't sit well. Where have I heard \\"go into the light\\" before? But don't let this book turn you away from a very gifteded writer's works. Turn your attention to Pandora a book that is all but impossible to put down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes great bathroom tissue!","review":"Oh my, what a horrible piece of trash this one is! Disjointed, rambling... either Ms. Rice was on illegal substances or perhaps it is just the onset of dementia. I would have rated it at best a half star but the scale wont let me. Let's just say that I'm glad I didnt pay full price for it when it first came out. It really isnt worth the paper it is printed on....but that's just my view. It isnt a total waste though. I use the pages to line my bird's cage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Recyled ideas","review":"Anne Rice is one of my favorite authors, but her literary mechanisms are becoming to baroque and repetitive between books. The central plot recycles many of her more interesting twists from previous books: Memnoch the devil, the Mayfair witches, etc. I think Anne Rice needs to take a break and evaluate her plots more carefully.The focal person of the book, Triana, is an unappealing and unsympathetic character. She has few redeeming qualities, and consequently, I could not have cared less whether she lived or died. In the end I was hoping Stefan would suck Triana into hell. When compared to Lestat, the central characters of her Witch books, or charcters from other books such as Cry to Heaven, Triana is a pale shadow of what Anne Rice is capable of producing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and oppressive","review":"All I can say is that, compared to \\"The Witching Hour\\" which I couldn't put down and was sorry it ended, the \\"Violin\\", on the other hand, is one that I can't wait to finish so that I can read something else.... I keep waiting for it to get better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Anne's Worst","review":"This is her most awful book to date. It's uninteresting, and bores you to death.

(don't say I didn't warn you)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I am a great fan of Anne Rice but this book is one of the worst books I've ever read. I simply hated the main character Triana and only kept on reading just to see if the ghost finally gets his violin back. Maybe a short story would have been a better idea and not a complete novel of 372 pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing, hard to follow, definitely disappointing.","review":"I'm a huge Anne Rice fan - read and enjoyed everything else, but Violin is a tough read. It's got hints of Rice, but I found the format so confusing and hard to follow that it was too hard to get into the story. I coudln't even finish it! I got 2/3 into it and just couldn't endure anymore. I just bought Pandora, I'm a bit tentative, but I have to give Anne the benefit of the doubt."},{"rating":"1","title":"I usually like Rice!!","review":"Enjoyed the character Triana, Rice spent too much time on Stephan.

Hope that doesn't disappoint. Sorry Anne. No hard feelings, your the novelest not I.Tish"},{"rating":"1","title":"Grim and Silly story.","review":"It is hard to believe that someone who has written so many great and interesting stories can also write this book. It was a chore to get through it and although I read 80% of it, I realized I did not need to dread going back to it. I could just put it down unfinished, which I did. This book is a vast betrayal to the many Anne Rice fans. Please, Anne don't do this again!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I was bored and disappointed.","review":"I read two vampire books by Anne Rice last year and became her fan. When Violin came out I wanted to read it badly. I checked the online reviews but found that many people didn't like this book. Because I always have a strong feeling about music, I thought maybe I could have a better understanding of this book. I borrowed the book-on-tape and listened for 12 hours. It was very boring. Many times my mind just wondered off since there wasn't much to miss. I don't like any of the characters. I have no compassion for them. I cannot feel their pain. The only moment I feel a little upset was when the instruments were on fire, but the description is flat. I'm very disappointed. I don't recommend this book to anyone, especially those music lovers. That's all I have to say about this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"run don't read","review":"Run, do not read! Do not buy. Do not accept if given as a gift.

The first part of this book is very unpleasant to read, but stick with it. It is basically Rice's supernaturally enhanced autobiography. How she took the pain in her life and used it to write \\"Interview\\" and letting go of the pain...wondering if she could still write without it. She can by the way. Her novels have become deeper and richer, although less accessible to the general masses who read for plot only"},{"rating":"2","title":"Haunting and beautiful","review":"Violin now ranks as one of my favorite works by Anne. The emotion of the novel is so strong that the story itself is almost distracting. In fact, I see the book more as an extended poem rather than a straight work of fiction. Triana's pain, fear, and love are beautifully described, and I could not help but be affected by them.I've felt that Anne last few books have been flat, lacking the depth of character of her earlier novels. Violin is Anne's best novel since The Witching Hour."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Book I've Ever Read","review":"This novel is stunning and difficult to put down. Once I got into the story, I could almost hear the violin music she was describing. Very inspiring and surprisingly uplifting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Last Anne Rice I will ever read","review":"Here is my theory on Anne Rice books. If you were to read every other chapter of the book, you would still get the same experience. Anne is too wordy and she says things in 300-400 pages that could be said in 200 pages. Anne, you bore me."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT one of her best works!","review":"This book does not engross you like the rest of her books.

It's OK if you have nothing better to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"As with some of her last books, I am deeply disappointed","review":"I read all readers reviews before buying it.

Though rich in description and visual imagery, it was repetitiously boring. The reader is treated to an endless stream of unwarrented guilt on the part of Triana and a ludicrous claim to extreme suffering by a talented ghost. The relationship between the two lead characters is never believeable; how they became connected in the first place is unclear. The novel would have been better presented as a short story. If you want to read Anne Rice, re-read one of the Vampire series."},{"rating":"1","title":"very, very dissapointing","review":"I don't like to say this about Anne Rice novels, but this one was just horrible.

I held out all hope that it would get better. It didn't. Utterly depressing and not in all the classic style of Anne Rice. It was all over the place. However, there is hope. I recently sped through a copy of Pandora, a worthy return to the vampire chronicles, and look forward to reading Armand. Forget she ever wrote this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pitiful.Sad.","review":"I do not think that there was one single solitary redeemable character in this book except for the people the main characters constantly whined over who were already dead.

This book stunk!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rice indulges self; readers pay the price","review":"I was not at all surprised to read in the above review that this is an emotionally autobiographical book; it had all the hallmarks of an excersize in authorial self-indulgence. I'm a writer myself and no slouch when it comes to reading \\"hard\\" books, but I can't stand the tricksy, overbearing attitude of the first few chapters (all I could bring myself to read.) It was as though Rice was thinking that every random sensory impression that came into her head was of compelling interest. I suspect that Rice has become a victim of her own success; if you want to see a more fair representation of what she is capable of, read _Interview With the Vampire_ instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"She won't turn around.","review":"Anne Rice is totally written out. She shouldn't be dumping that crap on her readers, but frankly, I don't blame her in the least for continuing to pump it out and collect her money, which she will continue to do as long as people think she's somehow going to turn around - so they keep reading.

I couldn't even manage to finish the whole book, but I skimmed and scanned some pages in the middle and in the end of the book. The beginning was good in the first few chapters, then out of the blue a million characters popped out, and as a reader I got so confused.

I think she is one of the most overrated modern writers. However, I managed to slug my way through Violin and even finished reading it. I found the idea and plot to be solid but Anne's writing style abhorrent, as usual. Of all Anne's books I think I would most like to see this one made into a movie only because I liked it's gothic romance premise. I think it would make a better movie than it was a book.

I dont know why, but I became completely engaged in the story and characters! For three days it became my world. It had such an effect over me, people would stop me during the day to ask if I was okay, because I was so lost thinking about Triana and her life.One must approach Violin as a novel in itself. Don't come into it expecting it to be written like her other books. Perhaps that's what my trouble was. Just go with her, and she'll take you on a journey you will never forget.

Her husband was writing abook about St. Sebastian. She shares hisstory. She points out many tidbits about thegreat composers - Beethoven, Tchaikowsky andBach. Her descriptions make you feel themusic as her ghost Stefan plays the violinin her mourning.

This one drew mental blanks.Actually, the story line is very good. The ghost, the history, the intertwining stories of the Russian prince and the New Orleans Socialite were intriguing. But the excess of words! Rice's flowery writing has always caused her stories to soar. In this one, the prose was a boat anchor.

This low quality isn't typical of her work, and is probably the result of some degenerative brain disease."},{"rating":"1","title":"A fine example of steam of unconciousness writing.","review":"Mrs. Rice has created the most impressive work of directionless drivel I have ever had the displeasure of reading. After the first ten pages I checked the spine of the book to see how much money I wasted. Twenty pages later I realized that the book was a sunk cost and I was continuing to pay with each disjointed sentence I read. The only redeeming quality of this book is that by comparison it lends artistic credibility to pornography and sitcoms."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh my!","review":"Someone told me that Anne Rice was a great writer and that anything written by her would be good. Liar!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not read this book","review":"This is by far Anne's worst book. I have never in my life read such self-indulgent tripe. I am a big fan of her particular style of writing and love her books but I have never taken so long to read such a short book. I was very disappointed to see my favourite living writer was capable of writing such drivel. I immediately reread some of her previous offerings to remind myself exactly how talented she is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly Disappointing","review":"This was my first Anne Rice book, and after reading it, I'm certainly not rushing out to buy another. At least half of the book consists of Triana and the ghost sitting in a room, hurling insults at each other. The flashbacks to Triana's life and the ghost's visions of Renaissance Europe are interesting, but don't make up for the bickering and backstabbing that make up the majority of the story. A waste of time. Given the popularity of Anne Rice's other books, I'm guessing this one isn't representative of her talents."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book!","review":"This to me was a surprisingly good book. I am a fan of Anne Rice's books, and this one did not disappoint."},{"rating":"1","title":"I just didn't enjoy the book.","review":"I was expecting more from Anne Rice book and I didn't get it from this book. I found it boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmm...","review":"I received this book as a gift when the mass market paperback first came out since my aunt knew I liked Anne Rice. I was rather excited, and the start is good. However, the book quickly became plodding. There's a wholoe bunch of characters which really add nothing to the story or plot. Ms. Rice wrote some beautiful sentences and paragraphs and this book did have some good parts. I found the story of the Violin (the instrument in the book) and its origins to be interesting and the best part of the book. However, this book fell flat overall. The premise was interesting enough, but this book simply was not as good as her earlier works.If you're a die-hard Anne Rice fan/completist, you will want to read this book, but otherwise, it's simply not worth your time if you're looking for something worthwhile and enjoyable to read. Without Ms. Rice's name, this book just wouldn't stand on its own."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was disappointing for the most part.","review":"I did finish VIOLIN, but only out of respect for Anne Rice. As a classical musician myself, I expected to be totally drawn into the story, I was not. I didn't dislike Triana and I was fascinated with her childhood and virtually anything else about New Orleans. However, I couldn't really warm up to her. I don't have a problem with Rice's straying from her gravy train of Vampires and Witches, in fact, my favorites are FEAST OF ALL SAINTS and CRY TO HEAVEN. It just seems there was not much point to VIOLIN and it moved at a snail's pace. Also, unfortunately, the heroine was not beautiful or, from what I could understand, in any real danger. I respect the amount of research Rice does on all her novels and I still enjoy her writing style, but this won't be a book I read again."},{"rating":"1","title":"slow, repetitive and boring","review":"This was the first Anne Rice book I've read and I had to force myself to finish it. I kept waiting to get to the part where the story starts to move and it never happened."},{"rating":"1","title":"Her move from concrete to abstract is a disaster.","review":"I have read all of her books and loved every one until Violin. Perhaps because I am a violinist, I sense that she is right out of her depth here and really did not have anything to say to me. I was extremely disappointed and I wish she would write more of her fabulous earlier style of novel. I think that a violinist cannot be duplicated by a novelist however talented. Too many years of solitary practice can make a non-musician really easy to spot as a trespasser. The central core of the book is fog."},{"rating":"1","title":"Every fine author lays an egg now and then","review":"We have seen it a million times: no matter how good you are, no matter how excellent your editors are, no matter what talent you have; every now and then a fine author turns out a loser. Violin is.Too bad. Anne Rice is excellent and her previous books have been image-filled, lush, unique and had that keep-'em-up-at-night quality. Violin, on the other hand, plays much like a concert you didn't particularly want to go to on a Friday night after a hard week. It puts you to sleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"One word-disappointing","review":"I'm only forty pages into this book and I'm already having trouble. I feel as if though I should finish it and get my money's worth but that could be asking alot. Even if I do try and finish it I may not be getting my money's worth. Watching Rosie O'Donnell on Friday I was excited to see that Anne Rice was going to appear. One statement she made was that not one bit of her manuscript is edited before going to print. That's pretty unusual, even for a big time writer. This book is selling due to the name on the front cover not for the quality of the writing. I hope her next book is an improvement or I'm giving up on her."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Sad Disintegration of Talent","review":"Her early books were great...original, luminous page-turners. Then Anne Rice became a \\"famous author.\\" Apparently, she's now so famous that editors are afraid to alter her undisciplined, self-indulgent prose. What a shame. Encouraged to hope by the memory of Interview with the Vampire, Cry to Heaven and other early works, I keep buying and reading Rice's stuff...but this repetitive stew of self-pity (the main character is billed as a vastly intelligent woman, yet ruminates on and on and on over the same handful of incidents in her so tragic life like a lobotomized Guernsey) may be the final straw! What we have here is interior monologue substituting for plot. When this novel finally drags to an end, Rice swiftly and inexplicably ties up a few loose ends in a most unsatisfying way, but at least we're rid of the incessant weepers and whiners who populate this time-waster."},{"rating":"1","title":"hard read","review":"I gobble up everything Anne Rice writes. This book was soooo hard to read. I was bored. I knew that I was not getting into a vampire blood fest, but I at least expected something interesting. This book fell short of even being something I wanted to pick up. I force feed myself this book hoping that it would get better somewhere but it never did."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHY CAN'T I GIVE IT A NEGATIVE STAR RATING??????","review":"YIKES!!!!! What da $)#&%^@. If ever there was a book I would burn this is it. It was horrible. I kick myself when I pass it on the shelf here. I kept telling myself \\" one more page it will get better Anne would never make a POS\\" Geez it was boring, totally unedited, hard to follow, and stupid! The fact that it is semi-autobiographical scares me. It scares me because there are WAY to many ways to have exorcised those demons in words. This was the worst possible arrangement. I honestly would like someone that like this novel to walk me through it and make me see their point of view. I promise to be open-minded. Cuz I just don't get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thanx for curing my insomnia Anne!!","review":"Jumping Jesus on a pogo stick Anne!!!! What the hell happened???? Talk about falling into the Stephen King mode of writing 200 pages without saying anything (and I love King and Rice both) There is only 1 thing that your supposed to do with any story------JUST TELL IT!!!! I am a voracious reader and a huge Anne Rice fan but something happened that has not happened in 20 years. I started a book and couldn't finish it!! Come back to me Anne (SOB, SOB) come baaaaaaaccckkkkk!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"And it sits, half read, on my shelf..","review":"I am normally a fan of Anne Rice, and was excited when this book came out, but as soon as I sat down and started reading it, I was greatly disappointed. I tried to force myself to get through it, telling myself that \\"something interesting has to happen soon\\"; it never did. Finally, I had to set it aside, and now it sits on my shelf, waiting until I have someone to give it to as a gift, someone with more patience for weak characters and dragging, pointless description, than myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"i guess one star is the minimum.","review":"it's too bad that anne rice has to insult us by using her books to draw little maps to her house and all the buildings she owns, or plans to buy once she writes about them. hopefully she'll buy the florist's building she talks about in violin before they make it into a starbucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm taking the book back!","review":"Love Anne Rice, but WOW is this book difficult to get through. I tried twice, and gave up. It drones on and on.... Quality not QUANTITY Anne Rice! Don't sell out like Stephen King did!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Page Turner","review":"I was excited to get two copies of this book for Christmas - a good sign! Unfortunately, the book is a slow read with uninteresting characters. The heroine, Triana, is obsessed with guilt - mostly for things that were beyond her control. This is the worst book by Anne Rice of the dozen or so that I have previously read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunately, one boring & terrible book","review":"I love Anne Rice novels; unfortunately, this book was so boring - it took me weeks to finish it. I usually cannot put her books down and will stay up over a night to finish them. This book was strictly \\"put me to sleep\\" material. The story was so disjointed, I had trouble following what was going on. I hope the next book goes back to the great Rice style I know."},{"rating":"1","title":"Run away!","review":"I can't believe this book made it to print. I love Anne Rice. Her gift is incredible but this book did not show it. Reading this book was kin to riding along on someone elses acid trip. It rambled on. At one point I wanted to fling the book out my window into the rain. If you have never read Anne Rice and want to pick up one of her books.....Don't choose this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacks signature spellbinding character development","review":"Simply put, Violin lacks the beautiful character development of Anne Rice's better novels. I felt no emotional connection to her characters, which made this book a difficult read.If you've read the Witching Hour, you'll be sorely disappointed with Violin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure babble","review":"Have you ever sat down to read a book, read a chapter-full of words, then realized you absorbed nothing? So you yell at the kids to quiet down or turn off the TV. You re-read the chapter, but the result is the same. The Violin is the literary equivalent of someone picking up a violin for the first time and running the bow across the strings aimlessly and incessantly. Pure babble. I have not read her other books because I find the vampire theme boring. I jumped at the opportunity to read The Violin. Getting to the end of the book was an empty chore, not a pleasure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Swimming through 100 Pages","review":"I love Anne Rice just as much as the next person but this book just didn't do it for me. I have noticed that a few of her books have slow intros but this one....I had to read over 100 pages of a 300 page book to get into it. It just wouldn't take off. If you like books that captivate you from the first page this is not the book for you. I would recoment trying one of her Vampire books. Although this novel was rich with music history it lacked the necessary captivating intro to keep the reader interested in what many may consider a dry topic. Hope you enjoy reading this novel more than I did or that you enjoy her other marvelous books."},{"rating":"1","title":"In Defense of \\"avid\\" Rice Fans...","review":"I would like to address the reviews of those who cannot understand why this book left so many Rice fans cold. I have read everything Rice has written, under all her pen names. Some of her best work, in my opinion has nothing to do with ghosts, witches, or vampires. She has a rare gift with the historical novel, \\"Cry to Heaven\\" and \\"The Feast of All Saints\\" are both cases in point. However, \\"Violin\\" (which does focus around a ghost) failed to inspire me because I could not develop empathy for her main character, nor the ghost that haunts her. The mere facts of Triana's life do not in themselves inspire warmth towards her character. If I had read nothing else Rice has written, perhaps I would have enjoyed \\"Violin\\" for itself. But one of Rice's great talents is character development, and in this instance, I felt she failed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blank","review":"Hmm...I can sum this up in a few words (unlike Anne did in this miserable little book)It. Really. Bites!Now I know I'm partial to the Vampire Chronicles, but stiil, even a newcomer can see that is just isn't good! Lev this, me that, Mom this, Lily that. My God, just tell me a story, don't give me a friggin' encyclopedia!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NO NO NO","review":"I am a huge vampire chronicles fan and love them all. therefore I thought this book would be good as well. While it does start off interesting, it goes downhill quickly. I kept thinking that it would get better, but it never did. Very disappointing. Boring boring boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting plot, bland book","review":"Anne Rice is a usually a great author. I very much enjoy her Vampire Chronicals books and overall I think they're well written. Violin however was one of the most bland, uninteresting, uncaptivating books I've read in years. It would have been very morbid and depressing had I any interest in the characters or the situation, but there was no chance of that with this novel and it's writing style (or lack thereof). This was a major dissapointment which I struggled to finish. I would not recommend this novel to anyone who enjoys classic Anne Rice. However, if you're looking for a Rice novel that gets away from her Vampire and Witch storylines, try Servant of the Bones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacking inspiration","review":"Try as I might, this book could not hold my interest. There was so much information of thoughts about everything, I kept wanting the characters to actually DO something! I have been immensely pleased with all of her other books and I love how Anne Rice keeps the reader entranced with the history and plot lines. Perhaps I missed something or it was an off time for me, but I just could not find anything to keep me interested in this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very slow","review":"I found this book to be very slow and depressing. Nothing like her other books, which I loved. This book has taken me forever to get through. I ended up falling asleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING!","review":"Well, I was glad to read the other reviews to learn that this was NOT Anne Rice at her best. It was her first book I ever read and was NOT impressed. I originally picked up the book because one of my children is an avid violinist and the title caught my eye. I knew Anne wrote thrillers and figured I'd give it a go. I was about halfway through the book and found it terribly boring, but was determined to finish it. I thought perhaps it would get better. It didn't. My advice, don't read it. There are better books out there and it is shear torture!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Downward Spiral","review":"Anne Rice's gift of writing appears to be fading. After enjoying the Vampire Chronicles I was saddened that I couldn't even make it past the first 100 pages of Violin. It's a goofy, boring, wordy, pile of --. I keep expecting to find Fabio painted on the cover of her books. 'Memnoch' was pretentious and 'Servant' was passable but I'm starting to lose faith. Maybe she'll redeem herself with my favorite supporting character, Armand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really bad!","review":"I definitely agree with most of the reviewers;I don't know if I can get through this one. It is preposterous! I have read most everything of hers, and I think that maybe she should go back to historical fiction. A Feast of All Saints was her finest moment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!","review":"If you understand the value of money, don't buy this book. It's a waste of time and energy, perhaps the book gets better in the end, but I couldn't bring myself to even get half way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Repetitive . . . Redundant . . . Regretful . . .","review":"Having read most of everything Anne Rice has written in her long and varied career, I am thoroughly disgusted by her last book, Violin. It has taken me more time to wade through one chapter of this book than to read the entire Vampire series. Is this just a filler (for her bank account) until she can become inspired again to write something more to her standards? Please, if you have nothing better to write, leave the page blank."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why was this book published?","review":"I am an Anne Rice hardcover collector & thus had to have this book when it came out. But to tell you the truth, I haven't even finished it because it's so bloody boring! Memnoch was bad with a capital \\"B\\", but this one is POINTLESS! Why Anne, why?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointing Read","review":"While I am a big fan of all of Anne Rice's other books, I was very disappointed in Violin. I just could not develop an interest in any of the characters. I didn't give a hoot what happened to any of them. The story seemed limp and it struck me that Anne had no idea of where she wanted to go with the story. It is very rare for me not to finish a book once I have started it, but I gave up on this one about 3/4 into it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Full of fluff and adjectives without a good story.","review":"This is, in my opinion, Rice's worst work. Although I love her descriptive writing, this is too much. The dialog is totally uninteresting and the characters are weak. The ghost character is a pathetic clone of Lasher. A very difficult read. It felt like drudgery rather than enjoyment. Thumbs down -- way down."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is Anne's worst","review":"Most of the reviews here that give this book a rating greater than five begin something like this: \\"I can't believe you people who wrote these reviews read the same book that I just read - you just can't handel the fact that Anne is breaking new ground\\". Look, bad is bad. I'm a big Rice fan, and I say this book is a hastily written sketch, and appears to have been more of a personal exorcism for Anne that anything else. She should have shelved this one. To bad she doesn't use an editor. She could have used one this time."},{"rating":"2","title":"The repercussions of a moral secret","review":"You'll either love this book, or you won't like it at all, at all. It's just that kind of story.Put me down as having loved it. And it's short, but it's not a book to be gobbled up too quickly. Take your time.A well-liked man in a small Irish town has died, and his deathbed confession has hurled the village priest, Father Declan, into a moral dilemma. Turns out Enda and Kevin Dennehy lived a lie for 50 years by pretending to be married. Kevin refuses to marry her at the end, and also refuses to say why. So it's left to Enda to tell Father Declan \\"the all of it,\\" and tell it all she does. It leaves you pondering the question: What makes a moral life?Don't miss this one - in fact, buy two and give one as a gift to some thoughtful reading friend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like an artichoke there's not much there","review":"At 149 pages, with wide margins and large type, this is hardly more than a long short story. The current selling price of $4.80 is as much as it is worth. I wouldn't pay a penny more than that.It is not a bad story, a sort of homey Irish tale that meanders along, although I could have done without the lengthy description of the salmon fishing at the end. If that was supposed to be some kind of allegory,I didn't get it. If it had been part of a larger work about the priest or about the town I might have even liked it somewhat but standing alone it required an investment of time and effort (albeit short) that I didn't feel paid off.I would advise others to be wary of being swayed by the praise of other reviews. This book may be to some people's taste but I would think not many."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Disappointment","review":"This book was SUCH a disappointment! I'd read a glowing review in a book catalogue and ordered it from them - something I rarely do. The \\"big\\" news came too early in the book - before I had a chance to care about the characters, and it wasn't shocking in the least - contrary to promises from the back cover and the book catalog.

I love a book with a message, but this one's was just too vague for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"a moving story","review":"This was a very affecting book, written in a way that made it hard to put it down. It is a simple story told in a straightforward way, though there are a couple of ambiguous points that the reader has to fill in. Or I could say, that keep the reader wondering.The book is subtle, and I'm not, so it's hard to describe how good this book is, except to say there is an underlying complexity and restraint in the relationship among the characters that makes me care about them very much. I wish the story would continue to reveal what happens next, but that would erase the ambiguity and mystery, so I know it will never happen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snooze","review":"Uggh.

Choppy, confusing, ridiculous, and done! The story is simple, a young guy witnesses a murder on a webcam site, which leads back to a group of millionaires, who pay to witness real murders on the web. That we know, but the big question becomes whose behind it? Who cares?! By the time you get to the \\"who done it\\", you're head is spinning and you don't know what is going on anymore! I rented this thing, for one reason, Edward Furlong. He is one of my favorite actors. When he was younger, he was in huge movies like Terminator 2 and American History X. Since then he's flown way under the radar, doing mostly direct-to-video films, many of them winners. While Eddie was great, the writing and directing of this film is such that you're bored, confused, and finally just fed up and frustrated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Three Blind Mice **SPOILER**","review":"I agree with Dustin B - shame not to see Edward Furlong in T3 - this movie had so much potential (in the realm of Hitchcock) but went wrong in so many ways - it insulted the audience several times (old-fashioned cops and a hacker with a knack for buggin whose place is broken into and he doesn't check for bugs or wonder why someone was even there?) The ending fight was pretty lame tho the twist wasn't too bad - the older actors weren't very good - too stereotypical and one dimensional. It had the strangest clash of a 1940's/2004 that didnt mix. And yes, Furlong did seem too tired too much of the time (there were actual scenes where it looked like he had a good night's sleep). If you want to see something not so technical but along the same lines - rent 8mm"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just plain bad","review":"Two things struck me about this film:1. Ledoux clearly didn't bother doing his research into computer experts. Or people who didn't just buy a ready made PC from a chain store for that matter. Maybe he decided all the experts should use XP so 85% of the viewing world could relate to the computers but, damn, how many hackers/programmers would be using that ghastly piece of over priced bloatware commonly known as Outlook? So, the characterisation was bad with only stereotypes.2. Is it just me or did it look like a cheap version of an English cop drama? We already know the characters are clichés, but so is the plot and dialogue. BTW, I like British cop dramas, well, Murder City at least. But TBM looked like it had a smaller budget than those shows. Ledoux could've at least overcome the look by spending money on a writer who'd graduated high school.Don't watch this unless it's on TV and there is absolutely nothing else to do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read but short on examples","review":"I found this a good read but was disappointed more examples weren't given.

I found them to be well-produced, great rhyme and beats and overall well written and very tounge-in-cheek. As a woman and a gay one at that, I could still appreciate the musicianship and talent Eminem put forth on his prior material, forget about the need for PC-values if the material is good enough to be incendiary.In this case it isn't worth not being offended - it's just creepy, insulting and frankly not clever at all. I received this disk on release day and was horrified at how bad it is - this album blows and I can't wait to ditch it. Gone is the musicianship in lieu of hate-rap - and the thing is that I don't see anything but a millionaire trying to shock with this \\"effort\\". Let him play with Elton John, etc. Eminem is the true ... and I think, given his current lyrics, that he knows it. \\"Without Me\\" is the only song on this album worth listening to.

This album could have definately gotten more time put into it to make it better, but its good how it came through.

The difference between Eminem and other rappers is that his lyrics are sophisticated and witty, almost like poetry. Sometimes i cant help but wonder if Eminem is really a scholar in disguise. In my opinion, this CD is oriented more towards his life experiences with his mother, father, ex-wife, and daughter which make it deeper and definitely worth the money. he even tries to sing in this album, and it doesnt sound half bad!p.s. this album will take the \\"album of the year\\" grammy, and dont expect another Steely Dan upset!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!","review":"This is just fast talking and rhyming with bad beats and rhythmns in the background.

I would recommend this to anyone not afraid to know what REAL musicians think!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Like wine, Eminem gets better with age.","review":"Eminem is at the top of his game.Now that he's focusing more on making music than shocking people, he is much better.His first song, \\"White America\\", is a sort-of Hard Rock rapfest.Em lays it down thick on, \\"Buisness\\", but for some reason I find my self getting bored with it.\\"Cleaning Out My Closet\\", is a sad little song you will probally like, if you don't mind violins.\\"Square Dance\\", is OK, but I find it a bit dull and repettive.\\"Solider\\", isn't too great,but worth a listen\\"Say Goodbye To Hollywood\\", quite good.Uh-oh here comes the awful, \\"Drips\\", Please, kill me now!\\"Without Me\\", is EXCELLENT!\\"Sing For The Moment\\" has a pretty good Chourus going for it, but thats it.Ah, The Amazing, \\"Superman\\", I am not worthy!\\"Hallie's Song\\", is sheer brillianceThen there's 3 OK songs that you ought to give a chance.And Lastly, \\"I Think My Dad's Gone Crazy\\" Is very good and a little funny.So you see, while some songs are not too good, The good ones are THE BEST EVER!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"same old eminem","review":"If you enjoy hearing someone talk about things that they have NO clue about then you will like this cd. Eminem can't be brilliant. Eminem has no clue, and never will. Eminem makes money by selling out on his family, and introducing explicit lyrics and stupid ideas to children, which will inevitable hear his tracks regardless of stickers. Why do we support a man that is so obviously bad for our kids, the very future of our nation? Eminem doesn't belong in national recognition. Let's see some originality in the direction artistic ability and not shock factor before we support this mans music."},{"rating":"2","title":"simply great","review":"I was blown away with his talent!! Being a white, middle age woman, I'm probable not someone who you would classify as a \\"typical\\" Eminem fan. This was my first rap CD and I was hooked from White America on. I heard \\"Cleanin Out My Closet\\" on TV and had the desire to buy this CD. I am now definitely one of his fans. I won't rate every song like some of the other reviews but I will say if you are open minded and want to hear some great \\"stories\\" with great music to back them up, I would recommend this CD!! I loved every song, a few more than others.....I'm hooked and you will be too!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not black music, not white music, still fight music","review":"After the Marshall Mathers LP, I had a suspicion that Shady might be the world's greatest rapper; after the Eminem Show (and relistening to the Slim Shady LP) the hunch is confirmed - he's the illest rapper to ever walk the planet. A lot of people will argue that and say Biggie or Tupac were better. All due respect to those legends, they just were not as talented as Slim. As an English teacher and very occassional writer, I'm truly impressed by his insanely poetic lyrics and ability to connect with people like no artist has in a very long time. Who was the last one to do it? Dylan, probably. But honestly, Shady's music is far more fun to listen to than Bobby D's. One day he may just get, \\"the props he deserves.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"An album that insult what music is","review":"How can someone says that this is one of the best albums they have heard?

(Aerosmith should [take action against Eminem] for butchering their classic \\"Dream On\\".) As for the lyrics: am I supposed to be offended? Am I supposed to be scared? Am I supposed to feel sorry for this guy? Sorry, but I don't feel any of those.

The only thing is that you should ask your parents if you can get it because I know somone who got in big trouble because their parents wern't too happy with the explicit lyrics (explicit lyrics are lyrics with bad words in them. If your parents don't wan't to get the edited edition. Otherwise its a great CD :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Guess Who's back","review":"This is one of the most complete albums ever put out on the market. Martial Mathers busts out some of his best stuff for his follow up to the highly succesful LP. He has a great mix of talent on this cd. Here are the best 5 songs on this cd.1. Say what you say(feat. Dr Dre)-this is a tight song with a great beat and the eminem and Dre combo is [great].2. Til I Collapse(feat. Nate Dogg)-some great vocals from Nate Dogg who just does his thing along with a great beat and some great rhymes.3. White America-this is not a song I would recomend to my Afro-american ballin bro's, it's a shout out to all his white fans.4. Sing for the moment-this is an amazing display of eminems talent. Amazing vocals and backround to get you into the song.5. Cleanin out my closet-no explanation needed.So, I would recomend this cd to any hip hop fan who wants some quality beats and amazing combos."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eminem does it again!","review":"If you liked Eminem's first two albums, this one won't be a disappointment. There is a definite difference, however. This album shows much more of Eminem's emotion and perspective on life and less about drugs and violence. It gives a different view and a new understanding of Eminem and the things he has been through...I think that is why it is called \\"The Eminem Show\\". Some of the songs even gave me goosebumps the first time I heard them.This is definitely another Eminem masterpiece...I hope there are many more to follow."},{"rating":"1","title":"No wonder there are so many protests...","review":"Eminems getting old.

After the Marshall Mathers LP, i didn't think that he could get any better. But this album proves that he has. Eminem talks about the 3 women in his life (mother, ex-wife, and daughter), the media, etc.. But this time he is very serious. The whole CD is excellent, the stand out songs are \\"White America\\", \\"Business\\", \\"Cleanin out my Closet\\", \\"Square Dance\\",\\"Hailie's Song\\" and \\"Say What You Say\\".

This proves that Eminem is truely a great lyricist. Best tracks:1. When the Music Stops- Excellent track done with D-122. Say What You Say- Eminem and Dr. Dre come out with a diss track nearly as good as Nas' Ether3. White America- Talks about being the \\"spokesman\\" for white Americamy list could go on until i name all the tracks. this is truely a great album. The only criticism i have is that he raps to much about his personal life.

Without me is a catchy track with a good beat. Sing for the Moment isn't really like Eminem's other tracks but it's good. Business is also another good track, with a catchy chorus. But my all time favorite song on the album is Hailie's Song, which is basically about his daughter. Very sweet song. I don't really like the skits, it's waste of space. The other songs on this track is good.

Its the same thing as all the other cd's when the first came out they were different and many people liked them but now its the same songs almost with a incredible amount of curseing. It wont surprise me to see his next album say \\"Now with 40% more bad language FREE!\\" His songs lack any writeing talent. His main audience is white kids from like 13-20. Theres so many other rap artists better than him. Although all rap has bad lyrics his are perticullary bad talking about how he hates his wife and how he hates certain races etc. This cd is a embarrasment to music."},{"rating":"1","title":"good reason to hate america","review":"No wonder most of the world thinks we are debased, filthy heathens when we treat scum like Marshall Matthers as royalty for being a tasteless, classless, faithless, shameless deviant. \\"It'd be so lovely Without You\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap Rap - F**king up hiphop","review":"Today's youth only know a few rappers: Eminem, 50 cent, she-12, etc., all f'd up commercial \\"rappers\\" who think they invented rap.

He's great!... and more of that bulls**t. The eminem show is a CD purely created for one purpose: Selling. (and screaming he's gonna kill his mother and cut the head of his ex-girlfriend off).

But this album is a BIG step in the wrong direction for Eminem, just when things were looking up for him, he had the rap world at his feet and blew it with this album full of songs containing nonsense and meaningless songs which appeal to the younger generations, the only plus's on this album are 'Say Goodbye to Hollywood' which he does show the potential of his talents, and the song 'Till I Collapse' which relies heavily on Nate Dogg's chorus to keep the listener's interest.

In, \\"Halie's Song,\\" Eminem actually sings in a nice falsetto. \\"Drips\\" is a sex romp with D12's Obie Trice.This CD shows a matured man, not necessarily a matured rapper.

SO IF I WERE YOU I WOULD ONLY LISTEN TO THIS CD WHEN I COULD GET THE CHANCE IF MY FRIEND HAD IT BUT I WOULD NOT BUY IT FOR MYSELF BECUZ IT WOULD JUST GET ALL DUSTY SITTING AROUND."},{"rating":"1","title":"What has American mainstream come to?...","review":"Think about it. How low has mainstream America gone for Eminem to win a Grammay, something for people who work for it. What does Eminem do? Rhyme over other people's music (which is basically repeatitive beats looped over and over). I mean, rock musicians spend the majority of their time learning how to play instruments, something Eminem does not and cannot do, and also learn to sing instead of talking in the same voice really fast throughout the whole track. The only thing Eminem's good at is rhyming, but Dr. Suess can rhyme, so that's not really a big achievement there. Did you know in Norway, at the Norweigan Grammays, bands like Kovenant and Dimmu Borgir have been nominated (and Kovenant actually won one) Grammays? God, their music is so much better over there... oh well. Rap's just a fad. Soon, we'll make way for a new mainstream."},{"rating":"2","title":"NICE ALBUM","review":"eminem can really spit and he shows it on this album. Favorite songs are till i collapse, white america, and square dance. WORTH THE BUY!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not like it was","review":"I'm sorry but this cd isn't good. It not bat or some thang but eminem ain't commin hard, know I mean. On the The Marshall Mathers LP he came raw, with songs like B Please II, Remember me and so on. So ya'll betta gon' cop cd's of Tha DPGC'z (Snoop Kurupt, daz) and of dr. Dre (NWA) that's all better. There 's only 1 real good song on this album: 'Till I Collapse . O yeah: Dre is also commin weak on this cd.Peace!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Rhymes but Horrible Production","review":"Eminem can rhyme no doubt, but his production is horrible...Only when he leaves the beats to Dre does this album pick up steam.Worst Em album ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stellar Rap/Rock Album","review":"I deem this album to be a classic if not one of the best album I ever heard. To the casual observor, the album may seem albeit angry cry for attention but it's actually a deeply personal tale of his trials and tribulation after the Marshall Mathers LP. Thankfully, his passive aggresive ego and megolamanic attitude shines through the whole album which he should do more. I was suprised at how well Eminem produced the majority of the tracks. I'm convinced he spent sleepless night perfecting and editing these tracks especially \\"Hailie's Song\\" and \\"Sing For the Moment\\". The DVD is a big plus, it should've cost [money] alone but good old lads at Interscope gave it to us for free. Purchase this album if it's the last thing you do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother.","review":"I really enjoyed the last two Eminem CDs. I found them to be well-produced, great rhyme and beats and overall well written and very tounge-in-cheek. As a woman and a gay one at that, I could still appreciate the musicianship and talent Eminem put forth on his prior material, forget about the need for PC-values if the material is good enough to be incendiary.In this case it isn't worth not being offended - it's just creepy, insulting and frankly not clever at all. I received this disk on release day and was horrified at how bad it is - this album blows and I can't wait to ditch it. Gone is the musicianship in lieu of hate-rap - and the thing is that I don't see anything but a millionaire trying to shock with this \\"effort\\". Let him play with Elton John, etc. Eminem is the true ho and I think, given his current lyrics, that he knows it. \\"Without Me\\" is the only song on this album worth listening to. Save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS IS THE ONE!!","review":"No doubt, this is the best LP released from him yet. Jay-z, Nas and any other so called \\"REAL\\" rappers got nothing on him. You can feel him with the lyrics he spits, and tell he put alot of emotion in this one. He tells the public that he does'nt get the respect he should and I agree with him, he IS the BEST, most VERSATILE rapper we have ever seen, who else can pull the stuff off that he has?? BIGGIE and PAC, they were great but NO, can they pull off something like Hailie's song?? I don't think so. Matter of fact I know they can't!! And I know you agree with me, have they ever did something like that?? Nope. If you had to buy only ONE cd this year, THIS IS THE ONE, even if you like him or not, after you listen to this album you will respect him not only as a rapper but as a individual."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Album!","review":"I've always been impressed with Eminem's incredible lyricism and rapping skills and this album is just more of a reason why he is one of the best MC's ever. Every track is different, unique, and creative. You also see a different side of Eminem, Slim Shady, Marshall Mathers on a few tracks. I definitely recommend this album...it's fantastic! You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Previous albums","review":"OK the \\"MARSHALL MATHERS\\" was a stupid rap album ever.

The raps were justa as good if not better but it was dr dre who couln't make up those cool beats this time. There werent as many swears (thank God) last album edited u couln't even hear him. The skits were horrible. but o well great cd, thanx Em. ill still buy his next album.

It's a good record, that's for sure - but it's not as good as 2000's phenominal \\"Marshall Mathers LP.\\" Eminem's lyrics are as sharp as ever, but too many of the beats sound similar. Don't be fooled: Dr. Dre may be the \\"executive producer\\" of the disc but he only gets behind the recording desk on 3 of this album's 20 tracks. This is not a groundbreaking album, but's still a pretty good one by one of today's top MC's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated disappointing effort","review":"I was never a very big fan of Eminem. [I think] He is terribly overrated for an MC with basically only one style of flowing. While his first two albums were bearable, at least the first few times you heard them (except for the singles ack... Without Me sounds like he is trying to clone the success of the Real Slim Shady and of course the masses loved it. Then \\"ohh what else would sell albums??\\" how about a few sensitive songs so people could feel sorry for me, hence the tracks Cleanin' Out My Closet and Hailie's Song. Stay far far away... peace"},{"rating":"1","title":"One word: CONFUSING!!!","review":"Eminem is a terrible white rapper that wants people to have a laugh and feel sorry for him. Screw you man! He tries to make a concept album mixed together with his childhood life which is mixed with some poor parodies on celebraties. The one thing to describe his little \\"stories\\" is that they're confusing as hell and have some sh**ty skits! Not to mention Eminem is the master of filler! Thanks to the skits and some stupid acting sequences during songs, you damn sure do a poor job of artifically lenghtining albums! Modern rap in general sucks and DO WE REALLY WANT A RAP ALBUM THAT'S 80 MINUTES LONG YOU FU**!!! The only good white rappers are the Beastie Boys(not their new album which sucked) and Zack de la Rocha from Rage Against the Machine. Avoid this album and you'll have a better life!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for non rap lovers","review":"In listening, you can really get a sense of Eminem's life experiences.

Nice beats."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly Good","review":"When I ordered this, I fully expected it would get three or four stars. That is the way most follow-up albums go. The first was best. The second was great (and awfully popular). Not much hope for the third, but it is a surprise. Yes, Marshall has grown up. His lyric roll, like, non-stop (mix of Dr. Dre and David Lee Roth). The album is full at 77 minutes. Much pain shows, more so than anger of the first two albums. Actually sounds like he will make a good dad. Be fore-warned, \\"Drips\\" is probably one of the most sexually explicit songs on the charts (and probably one of the worst on the album, unfortunately). I really like \\"Sing for the Moment\\", \\"Hailee's Song\\" and \\"When the Music Stops\\". Much like David Bowie and Elton John, there is more there than you hear at first."},{"rating":"2","title":"AN AWESOME CD","review":"I HEARD \\"WITHOUT ME\\" ON THE RADIO AND ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT!

We get it OKAY? No need to give us a history lesson on each album.My biggest problem with the songs on this album is that the \\"music\\" is little more than a few loops tossed together. Take away his rap voice-over and there isn't much there.This is more like a humor album, since Eminem whines about the price of fame and how it's ruined his life; so he puts out another album that's probaly going to sell several million copies?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Moronic","review":"What do we have here?

A 33 year old guy that pitches fits likea 16 year old teenager. My gosh that takes real talent.This poor sap believes in his own mind that he is somesort of tough guy.. However, you can tell he would beunable to hold his own in a real fight. Got to admit,he isn't as bad as Vanilla Ice...

At first it was interesting bashing his mom, being angry, saying how he would kill you and all that gang-sta garbage. Now, it's pathetic. This man has more money than he could ever dream of aswell with success and yet he's still trying even harder to do it again when there's no need to. Besides, it's an insult how he could take Aerosmith's \\"Dream On\\" and flip it around like he did, converting a classic tune into a real waste of plastic.Unless you're 13, wanna wear P.

When it was first released it was a really big deal but I don't see what's so great about it. I borrowed it and listened to it but I coldn't stand to listen to the whole thing. The song white america is basicly a disclaimer saying that he can't help it if white people listen to his music.

People, this is not music, because music requires talent. Talking fast is not talent. Does Eminem actually play an instrument that could create some form of music?? NO.I am especially disgusted with \\"Sing for the Moment\\" which completely rips off Aerosmith's \\"Dream On.\\" Most of the people I know listen to this self-congladulatory, unoriginal music and say that this version is better than Aerosmith's.

I sujest without a dout by this.........NOW!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Different, but that doesn't mean worse","review":"This CD is pretty good. I think it's a lot better than The Slim Shady LP and The Marshall Mathers LP. For one, there's a lot less unnecessary cussing (which I like). And the songs are much deeper. For instance, \\"Hailie's Song\\" (my favorite) is an ode to his daughter, and for those who have been hit close to home by divorce (as I have), this is a song that we all could relate to. \\"Without Me\\", while it disses plenty, as always, it also is a very fun party song and is a major hit. If you like hip-hop with a beat, humor and a message, this is the CD for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"By Far Eminiem's Best Yet","review":"This CD is so brutally honest, even more so then his others, from \\"White America\\" to \\"Say Goodbye to Hollywood\\" to \\"Without Me\\" he examines his career and how he got to the top, hating every step of the way.

Sure, there aren't many Billboard- or MTV-bound hits on here like there were on his last albums, but that's the point. This is for his real fans, not those mainstream cats. So don't expect to see any song besides \\"Without Me\\" being played in the jukebox of your favorite bar. And \\"Without Me\\" is the worst song on here, but you know that Em always makes a goofy commercial track like that just to get mainstream appeal so folks can buy his album (remember \\"My Name Is\\" and \\"The Real Slim Shady\\"?).

There are pleasant surprises on this CD and the DVD makes it worth that much more. Even Steve Berman liked the album lol. Marshall takes a few shots at Canibus in retaliation to practically half of C!: A True Hollywood Story where Canibus mocks Eminem impersantes the slain stan(and brings back to life. In closing any of you Shady heads who didnt like Marshall MAthers LP but loved Slim Shady you will not be disappointed.

This is a very popular-press treatment of the field as it stood in the late 1950s, with a \\"Popular Mechanics\\"-style illustration on almost every page, with a few pretty general paragraphs of explanation to accompany each picture.Even as \\"collectible\\", this has little appeal. The real audience for this book was limited to types like the Class-of-1960 nerd who ran the high school rocket club in the movie \\"Peggy Sue Got Married\\", and maybe a young pre-\\"Cheers\\" Cliff Clavin. Reading this book may once have been really helpful in getting a Boy Scout merit badge."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another useful volume in an excellent series","review":"Like most volumes in the Loeb series, the emphasis is not on word-for-word precision in the translation, but on acheiving greater readability in broader terms. Since the original text in ancient Greek is provided on the facing page, the editors assume that anyone with a little knowledge of Greek can supplement the looseness of the translation by referring to the original. And in general, the compromises made in this way are good ones throughout the series. In this case, Lamb's translation remains sufficiently faithful to the original, especially in his Protagoras and Meno, to allow this volume to be used by the serious scholar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Academic writing gets in the way of clear communication","review":"This is a classic case of academic writing getting in the way of clear communication. This book may have many interesting things to say, but as a reader who holds two master degrees, I still couldn't make out most of its content. The writing style is unnecessarily complicated and exoteric. It is also full of vague and high sounding language. It is a very frustrating book to read. I am able to learn a few useful concepts here and there from the book, but I'm confident that there are other books that can teach you the same things with a lot less money and time investment on your part."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely not worth the price","review":"Lots of technical words and a few exercises and examples make this book absolutely not worth [the money]... if you want to learn the basics of the singing voice and technique look somewhere else!

If you have to choose only one (for they are not cheap), this is the one to have. It is not a book to read at one sitting, for much of it is technical and difficult to understand at first, but it will repay careful rereading and study over many months and even years. It is as much a reference book as a practical manual. My only quibble is the unattractive typesetting and the poor quality of most of the illustrations and photographs, which is why I don't give it five stars. It frankly looks like something from the 1950s. It deserves a decently produced new edition with sharp, detailed colour photographs. The technology exists to do this easily and comparatively cheaply, so there is no excuse not to upgrade a book that must surely find a sale in every conservatoire music library and vocal studio in the world."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was terrible","review":"I almost bought this to complete my Night of The Living dead Collection. I am so glad I didn't. The 2006 version of this was okay, although some things were changed. This version is just downright boring, and has a thin plot. It's all about zombis living in the crematorium. I honestly thought this movie would be good, and I really tried to like it. I am glad i caught this on netlix for free before i purchased this movie. I would buy this movie to complete my collection, but it better be in the $5.00 bin first. It really is that bad. Watch it on Netflix, and then decide. I can't imagine anyone liking it.

But I figured, Wal Mart was selling it on the $9.00 bin, so that is all I'd be out. One single zombie moment was a true visual treat for the extent of make up, the rest was - um, er, yeah.

The actress from the Asylum movies, Sarah Lieving is also really good in this too. She's been good in mostly bad movies up until about now and this flick shows just how good she can be. As zombie movies go, this one's a little weird. But at least it's different. Just read on the official Facebook that it may get a limited release in theaters.

Worst ever acting, staging, cinema-photography and script. Several shots (actually many) are computer generated that do not need to be. So I am wondering, is this bad editing or did the crew re-film stuff after the production. Zombie reanimation from chemical laden body bags are now reanimating the recently and not so recently departed. The main character has stored bodies that were due for cremation \\"the oven\\" in a room, (computer generated scene room???) at his mortuary and now they are reanimating, some took a long long time and some come back sooner and slower.

There is quite a lot of fetish type photographs, as well as large amount of lesbian depiction.

If you are looking for something classily erotic to share with the love of your life, this is not it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mostly fetish. With a few good photos mixed in.","review":"I agree with the feedback provided by other reviewers. It is not a book for couples depicting conventional love, lust, and desire. Instead, it is heavy on various types of fetishes. Some pictures were good, some had potential, and others I never ever wanted to see again. Generally speaking, the images were more designed for shock appeal, to portray a scenario, or to creatively express a feeling than anything else. Nearly every image had something extra added to make it over the top - hoods, shackles, leather corsettes, etc.I rated it as two stars because I was able to find it useful for my purposes. I was looking for useful art for creative ideas at a low cost. So, I tore the book apart, kept the images that I liked (or would if they were toned down a notch or two), cut out the images with sections that had potential, and tossed the rest with no regrets."},{"rating":"2","title":"a band collar?","review":"An entertaining and informative read about a time that will be remembered right along side tulip mania. No Collar differs from many business books because it gives valuable insights through the use of the powerful medium of story telling. The writer spent a good deal of time inside the company he focuses on and gives a compelling first hand account.The lessons and ideas to be learned from this book are not spelled out like in many management books. The reader must read between the lines and come to his/her own conclusions.One essential lesson to be learned from this account of a company during the inernet explosion and subsequent implosion is the necessity of corporate values and a vision.(built to last) While there is nothing wrong with striving to construct a workplace utopia, clear goals and direction are essential for any company. These ideas are not mutually exclusive from optimum working conditions and do not have to come at the expense of creativity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Artist","review":"Arrived on time.

It won't matter about the 10% though, because it will dry out within a couple of weeks, and you'll need to replace it. After 4 months, and two dried out 10% markers, I stepped up and bought the other leading brand (see my other reviews).

However, close examination of her performance reveals a less-than-charming characterization and what seems like her need to finish her lines as quickly as possible... most likely before she forgets her next ones.The simple fact is that Shepherd was cast because she was sleeping with the director, Bodanovich, at the time. The camera lingers on her boring smiles far too long. Perhaps the only remarkable thing about this film is that is adapted from a nearly unadabtable novella by Henry James. Yes, I read it, and it was considerably better than the film adaptation.Simply enough, the film was boring and I would never care to waste time with it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth your time....","review":"Let me start by saying that I LOVE films like this. I watch them all the time and rarely dislike one. This is a time though. This movie was about as annoying as a movie could get. Daisy (Cybil Shepard) is rambly, talks too much, is disrespectful, flirtatious, and hasn't one bit of class. With no disrespect at all to Henry James, the story has no substance. He kills her off in what seems like an effort to avoid letting us know if she actually is a wild one or is innocent, as Winterbourne wants to believe. I guess we will never know... not from this version anyway! It is just an annoying film and Ms. Shepard does nothing to make it better.

Regarding the essays, some are very good and enlightening, while a few are obtuse. That is to be expected, as the authors address a variety of themes but I would recommend reading through them, as I did with, for example, Allen Tate's thoughts on religion, which were hard to follow in places but full of keen insights. In particular, I liked John Crowe Ransom's discussion of the ideology of Progress, which I think explains a lot of the inconsistencies and blunders of today's progressives. I have a business background, and graduated some decades ago, so for a while I haven't used some of the thought processes necessary to follow these essays.

Unfortunately as I delved into the book I found it to be really boring. I didn't care about the demon or what he was going through because the writing was so bad. Once Samantha Yale receives the scrolls and starts to read them it never cuts back to her. The writing of the scrolls is childish and hardly what one would expect in a written format. I found myself putting the book down for days at a time and only picking it up for a few pages at a time. I so badly wanted to like the story but ended up stopping about 2/3 of the way through.

She suggests through her writings that the story and timeline of creation did not go exactly as the Bible says.

It is filled with earthy, violent and sexual images, but then again so is real life.

Frist was also known to have said after the death of Robert Stevens in Florida that there would never be another death from inhalation anthrax in America. Wrong - there were four more within a few weeks, and there might have been even more if some had not taken additional antibiotics and/or the anthrax vaccine (something Frist irresponsibly advised against).

Larissa finally agrees to let Anna tutor her when she finds out that the girl who won the lead role Larissa wanted so badly, Bianca, also had slipping grades and was being tutored. I thought Larissa was being a stuck-up brat because she was so stubborn to accept that she needed help in her schoolwork. Read this if you like, but it isn't on my highly-recommended list."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good book","review":"When they first introduced Larisa, I thought, \\"Who cares?\\" but this book focused on her, and now she's one of my favorite characters. If you would like to discuss these books, e-mail me at the above address."},{"rating":"2","title":"Affirm your musical tastes...","review":"Affirmation is absolutely, spontaneously fantastic. It has the perfect blend of love songs and fun songs.\\"Affirmation,\\" the title track, is a wonderful self-affirming song. It's also kind of funny, too. It basically states, this is what I believe and you can't really change that.Then, there's \\"I Knew I Loved You\\" which is such a touching love song. I swear, that song has got to be about total soulmates who know before they meet that they're destined to be together.\\"Crash and Burn\\" shows that even if you are having a hard time, there is always someone who cares. It kind of makes me think of how you can just crash on your friend's bed and spill out all of your problems and he or she will listen and help you out.Affirmation is incredible!"},{"rating":"2","title":"pop at its very best","review":"Its a shame these boys have split up seeing as they made this piece of pop perfection now all we're left with is n'sync.full of heartwarming love songs and sopme rather suprising moments('gunning down romace' a true addition to the dark side of pop).this albums does seem to be more about the lyrics than about the look of the band.shame to see them go really."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good album; lots of ballads","review":"One of their biggest strengths are ballads so it's not surprising that they included alot of them in this album. Love the songs but wish they added more rock stuff. Love the singer's voice!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME","review":"This is the best cd ive ever heard they are an amazing duo and Darren is an amazing writer. I recomend that if you don't already own this you should buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have","review":"If you liked their first Cd, this is a CD for the collection. This music builds on the last album, but also makes way for a lot of new things. The songs are catchy, and they make you wanna get up and dance. Others are wonderful ballads, about the things that we need in life most. The song \\"Crash and Burn\\" is a great example of this. For anyone who likes to listen to good music, this is a must have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Savage Garden is #1","review":"Over a year ago, I got their self-titled debut album and SG instantly became one of my favorite music artists! Their new AFFIRMATION album is a beautiful sad album, about the gaining of love, the loss of love, and the aspects of real life. I LOVE all their songs, but some of my most favorites are Affimation, I Knew I loved You, Crash and Burn, Chained to You, The Animal Song, and Don't Know you Anymore. Their songs really touch my heart and soul with their lyrics giving true meanings. Darren Hayes' voice is beautiful and of course the construction of the music is excellent! This is an album (plus their other album) that I HIGHLY RECOMMEND to everyone. It gives you a meaning of love, life, and friendship! The one word I could describe this album... well, it's BEAUTIFUL!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the best CD I have ever bought","review":"I have bought a lot of CDs but out of all of them so far this is the best. The music on this album moves me like no other music has ever done. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Super CD","review":"Savage Garden has done it once again! This sophomore album is a must-have for those who love both upbeat dance songs and slow, emotional ones. Affirmation and Chained To You are fantastic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Savage Garden in full bloom","review":"I became addicted to Savage Garden after their first CD and eagerly awaited their next album.At first I was disappointed in Affirmation. All the songs seemed to blend together. But after I had listened to it a few times, each track stood out on its own and I fell in love with this CD too.Some songs tend to drag a little, a some are a little too saccharine, but over-all this album is wonderful! It all depends on your mood really. Affirmation speaks to the lonely little child in all of us.So do yourself a favor and buy this CD. I highly doubt you'll regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"SG strikes gold yet again","review":"this cd, far differant from the debut still strikes gold. the lyrics and melodies on many songs on this album hit emotional spots. unlike the debut, many songs are slower. not only are the songs differant, but in the lead singers voice, darren hayes, there too is a dramatic change. not a bad change, just more soothing and relaxed you could say. actually, the sound and all of the songs are unbelievable and are indescribable for words. the moment this cd came out i had it, and i highly recommend you get it to. darren hayes and daniel jones (the guinesses behind savage garden) should recieve much deserved credit for this brilliant work of art."},{"rating":"2","title":"tear jerking","review":"the songs on this album are deep and meaningful. when you feel down you listen to the words and it instantly puts a smile on your face. i was brought this as a birthday presant and it was the best ever. thankx mom! xx"},{"rating":"2","title":"A song for every day of your life","review":"Really amazing album, both musically and in interest. The lyrics are smarter and more meaningfull than most of the songs out today, and you can really relate. There is such a wide variety of songs that there really is \\"something for everyone\\" mostly, they are heartfelt and moving. They're also just nice to listen too, really pretty but with a beat behind it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just get the single...","review":"There is no doubt in my mind that Savage Garden has one of the best voices in today's pop scene. When I first heard \\"I Knew I Loved You\\", that song touched me in so many ways. I expected Affirmation not to be nearly as good as the single. It was WORSE than I thought. That is the only good song in the whole album, and in distant second is the title track. The rest of the songs are horrible, unless you like \\"The Animal Song\\". I would advise you not to get the album, but rather get the single. The two stars that I give are only for the single."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its just about 'ok'","review":"This cd has a few good songs but the majority doesnt quite hit any decent points. Not much depth to it, and they try for the whole teen-young adult crowd a little much. Ive listened to te cd a few times through and it just doesnt impress me. If theyd tried a new style or ANYTHING different then their first album...then maybe itd turned out better."},{"rating":"1","title":"....","review":"... it is the worst piece of music(if i can call it that) that ive ever heard. I heard the cd in a store and jeez.... I mean i will respect the artists and everything but this cd is very un original. The lyrics are the same that Nsync sings and the music is like any other Teeny Band. If u want some REAL music with depth, thought, and emotion try The Deftones, Korn, Fuel, Creed, Alice In Chains, DMX, Disturbed, or Incubus. Why dont they have O Stars!!!!!????!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"YAAAAAWWWWWWWWWN! THIS CD IS A SLEEPER.","review":"I am sorry to say that Savage Garden whos debut selftitled CD was perfect pop, shows they have sold out to America's radio industry with \\"Affirmation\\".\\"I Knew I Loved You\\" is just another watered down safe bet ballad....If songs like \\"To the Moon & Back\\" and \\"Tears of Pearls\\" were gigantic hits then this group would be putting out more true perfect pop....Instead \\"Truly Madly Deeply\\" was their #1 smash, and now they are coming out with carbon copies of that....for true, and safe chart success.I will roll up to this - by your self the 12 inch version of \\"Truly Madly Deeply\\" and save your self a few bucks and NOT buy \\"Affirmation\\".Though this CD is not bad, it is just middle of the road....Savage Garden you obviously sold out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Contrived and Insipid","review":"Savage Garden's new album is vapid and calculated. This album was made to pay their house notes. No artistic effort was put into this album. It's clearly corporate and pretentious."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT CD!! UNFORGETTABLE","review":"This is probably the best cd that I have ever listened to! My favorite song is Two Beds And a Coffee Machine. It's gorgeous, and I know all the words to it. I'm listening to the cd now! One question... is the blond one Darren or Daniel, because he is *HOT* and I wanted to know."},{"rating":"2","title":"all part of the pathway","review":"The sophomore album from Savage Garden is the perfect follow-up their 1997 self-titled debut. The songs here evidence their growing maturity and decreasing wide-eyed innocence. While the debut album showcased peppy, lovey-dovey tunes, Affirmation delves into the dark side of lead singer Darren Hayes' love life, with extraordinary results. This CD is a rarity in the pop world: honest, painful, yet wonderfully entertaining and uplifting. Songs like \\"The Best Thing\\" and \\"Chained To You\\" celebrate the headiness of a new love interest, while \\"I Don't Know You Anymore\\" and \\"Gunning Down Romance\\" positively drip with emotion and pain. \\"Crash and Burn\\" and \\"Affirmation\\" are wonderfully therapeutic, with catchy choruses that you're sure to find yourself singing in random situations. Affirmation puts Savage Garden right where they should be on the pathway to superstardom; growing and experimenting with each new album, and improving exponentially each time. I cannot wait for the third."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quite Savage...","review":"A Savage Garden fan after their fantastic debut album..I didnt hesitate before I bought this CD, also considering it had hits like \\"I knew I loved you...\\" , \\"the animal song..\\". HOWEVER..I was kinda disappointed with this album..sounds really watered down and needlessly mushy.Perhaps its their new producer(same as Micheal Bolton) ...the lyrics are nowhere close to the first album. Its one of those B side hits albums. The album kinda picks up towards the end with some better numbers...but all in all..was not quite \\"savage\\". Borrow it from a friend before you go buying it! I think its watered down..and lyrical content is low!"},{"rating":"1","title":"dont bye this CD","review":"This is one of there worst CD's ever. They sing way to high, they sound like girls. Don't waste your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dismal Tripe","review":"Can you say trite? Syrupy drek designed to wow unhappily married women. So bad it's self-parodying, you will pray for silence. Listening to this album nearly killed me."},{"rating":"1","title":"They were okay to listen to ocassionaly on the radio","review":"That's when I got interested in them. I liked their ballad songs especailly. But when I had a chance to listen to Affirmation in a CD store, I passed on it. It just had too many songs that sounded like really bland filler. Something also just bothers me about guys who use falsetto the whole time. When I first heard some of the songs, I could've sworn it women signing it. Just looking at the guys (really effeminate looking) and also knowing they use falsetto makes you obviously think they are gay, but of course I can't prove that. If they are, they should come out about it so it wouldn't make people ask embarassing questions about them. People would say they're in love..."},{"rating":"1","title":"4.7 STAR RATING??!??!?!?!?!?!?!?!","review":"Everything about SG sucks. SG blows! Instead of this p.o.s., buy \\"Hate Crew Deathroll\\" by Children of Bodom!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just as good as the last one.","review":"I seriously enjoyed Savage Garden's first cd and i find Affirmation to be absolutely lovely, but i must admit that a few (perhaps three) songs just haven't won my approval. The best songs are easily the first 8, while the rest of the cd, while good, is not quite as convincing. I would still recommend this cd however as i do enjoy more than 3/4 of the cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"Wow! I didn't think it could get any better than Savage Garden's first self-titled cd, but it has. Savage Garden show a new side of themselves in this wonderful cd titled Affirmation. Affirmation is full of all different songs that make you want to get up and dance and sing along."},{"rating":"2","title":"This album is \\"The Best Thing!\\"","review":"I have to admit that up until I heard this album I was not a huge Savage Garden fan. Their first album was reasonable with varying tracks from the classic \\"Truly Madly Deeply\\" to the forgetable \\"Promises.\\" However, despite this I bought their second album \\"Affirmation\\" and since then I've been obsessed...! There is not one track on this album that I couldn't relate to - this is one emotionally charged album! Highlights include \\"Two beds and a coffee machine\\", the up-beat \\"Chained to you\\", and my personal favourite - \\"I don't know you anymore.\\" Darren Hayes' beautiful vocals will carry you through an emotional rollercoaster, which will leave you wanting more. Such captivating music will not be found anywhere else..."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Dynamic Duo Has Done It Again!","review":"Well, I have to say that Darren & Daniel have won my heart again. Affirmation is a great album. It's very diverse because of all the lyrics & all the music has a great beat. You could hit the floor with the album title song \\"Affirmation\\" which has very good meaning & in-your-face dance beat. You could serenade your significant other with \\"I Knew I Loved You\\". You could listen to \\"Two Beds & A Coffee Machine\\" & remember the horrible fight you had with your loved one. This album says it all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rip off","review":"This was supposed to be a new CD but was scratched so bad it won't even play. Live and learn I won't bye anything else from this site."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful music with great hooks","review":"This music is extremely infectious and just wonderful to get in a good mood. If you loved their first CD, you need this one. It is really great. They have a great knack to make extremely memorable hooks and tunes. They are impossible to ignore (or get out of your head!) but with tunes like this, that's a good thing. After all the dark heavy metal and rap out there today, this is a breath of fresh air...and melody."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow! Awsome C.D","review":"I bought this cd not knowing what to expect but was very pleasently suprized. The lyrics are beautifull as are the beats and the whole feeling of the cd is terrific! I highly recomend the cd to anyone who likes good music!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"Savage Garden has certainly outdone themselves this time... The lyrics are haunting... the music heartbreaking.... I loved the CD..... \\"I Knew I Loved You\\" was my favorite, though, because of the way I was moved when I heard it... the lyrics were spectacular, and very meaningful."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW! Such a Variety of Sound!","review":"I bought this CD for one song and was surprisingly pleased to like almost all of them. They have such a mix of music and lyrics that it is hard not to relate to most of them. I want to order this CD for all my friends. It really puts you in a good mood. It was definitely a great buy from Amazon.com. I hope you all decide to buy this CD and enjoy it as much as we do!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely wonderful","review":"I was almost afraid to buy this album because I love Savage Garden. I was afraid that if it was a really bad CD, I would start to hate them. On the contrary, I like Savage Garden more than ever. I loved every song on the album except \\"The Animal Song.\\" I cried when I heard \\"Two Beds and a Coffee Machine\\". I absolutely love \\"Crash and Burn,\\" \\"The Best Thing,\\" and \\"Gunning Down Romance.\\" The vocals are awesome and the music rocks. This CD is a must-have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even better than the first!","review":"I love this CD - I think Savage Garden has gotten even better with this second CD than their first attempt. Their music is so meaningful and melodic - very well written. I could listen (and have listened) to this over and over again without getting tired of it. Also very easy to sing along with. If you like to sing and you liked the first Savage Garden CD, you'll love this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What's not to love?","review":"Another great CD from Savage Garden.Affirmation is truly one of the most positive songs I've ever heard, in a non-We Are the World-way. A permanent fixture on every workout CD I've burned since this album came out.I don't think I need to go into a song-by-song as my rating speaks for itself.. the only song I didn't care for was \\"I Knew I Loved You ...\\" I think it was the range of the song vs. the range of the voice behind it - not a great match.Other than that - don't listen to the words about it being depressing. Truly good CD's have songs that can play to whatever emotion you may be feeling at the moment.. those of us with a pulse feel many, so a diverse CD such as this one is a great soundtrack for everyday life. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful album","review":"This is among the best cds i own. Each song expresses an emotion. In Crash and Burn, it shows that you always have someone to support you if you feel down. I Knew I Loved You is the romance anthem of the new millenium. Affirmation teaches about 25 lessons all in one great song. The Animal Song expresses a feeling we all get sometimes: the craving to live like animals and be free to do whatever we want. Overall, I reccomend this to anyone who likes great music."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Music fan from WI","review":"This is da CD for ANY and ALL Savage Garden Fans! Whether you have their 1st CD or not, it's worth getting this one! Your money will definitely be well spent! All the songs are awesome and the guys are HOT! ~ :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, no cigar...","review":"Actually... The lyrics and songwriting here aren't bad. They aren't bad at all.Fact remains I don't think his voice is soulful enough to lift this music up to appropriate heights. He sings \\"correctly\\". It's musically \\"right\\". He's not off-key. It's just... flat. You want my standard for empathic and soulful singing: listen to Otis Redding's \\"These arms of mine\\" and then listen to this. You'll see what I mean by \\"flat\\".Also I hear: drumcomputers, synths and I suspect even the guitar sounds that pop up here and there come from a keyboard. Where are the instruments?Put these songs into the hands of a better vocalist and add a real band (not a band in a box) and you'll come up with a much better album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Geez, what's with all the 5 stars?","review":"People, people, please! Are your lives so on edge that you can be so uncritically accepting of this musical version of prozac? Sure these guys have okay singing voices, but that's about it. The lyrics here are more or less at the Hallmark card level of profundity, the melodies are unoriginal, and the production is slick, glossy, and bothersome. All in all, this is nothing more than an occasionally pretty bundle of schlock."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not their best work","review":"Savage Garden return. AFFIRMATION is not their best work. I was surprised at how much whining Darren did on this album. AFFIRMATION begins with the in your face \\"affirmation\\", where Darren runs down his list of \\"beliefs\\" over a synth dance beat. There's sort of an annoying quality to that song. The rest of the album isn't that much better either. The only song that struck me as truly great was the hit \\"I knew I loved you\\". That ballad is so light and dreamy, it just makes you feel good. The rest of AFFIRMATION deals with the heartbreak of getting over an ex. The mood is not the reason that this album is kind of dud, it's the delivery. The beats are pretty basic and it sounds like it could've all come from a casio keyboard. AFFIRMATION tries too hard with not enough steam behind it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good when taken with a dose of depression.","review":"Let me first say that I loved the first album. It was more of a dance/techno thing that made me surge with energy. AFFERMATION is nothing like the original. Instead of having an up-beat rythem and fast lyrics, this album is focused on \\"Someone to watch over me.\\" This album is not for the average good mood, however, if your boyfriend/girlfriend has just broken up with you, if your parents are divorcing, or if everybody hates you and you have to eat worms, this is the album for you. Those who love self-pitty, this is your lucky day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet and Easy to Listen to","review":"I love, love, love this cd. I have listened to it so many times that I'm suprised the cd isn't worn through...Affirmation is a perfect blend of Darren's voice and some beautifully written songs. The lyrics are sweet, simple, humane, and easy to realate to. It's also such a great mix of songs. It's so mellow and yet danceable. I listen to this album whenever I'm having a bad day...it always cheers me up!Recommended strongly!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"If you liked Savage Garden's debut cd, then you will definetly enjoy this one. I loved their debut cd for it's catchy songs, beautiful ballads, and unique sound. Their second album has the same elements from the catchy Animal Song, and Affirmation, and the beautiful ballads I Knew I Loved You, and I Don't Know You Anymore. The only reason I give this cd four stars is that it sounds just like the first one, but I still loved it and continue to listen to it over and over again just like I did with the first one."},{"rating":"2","title":"......","review":"i *love* this cd. i bought it the day after it came out, as i have no car & couldnt get to the store meself.. it's wonderful, i listen to it almost constantly. my favorite songs are probably \\"the animal song\\", \\"the best thing\\", \\"you can still be free\\", and \\"crash & burn\\" is the BEST song i've ever heard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Savage Garden","review":"I think this album by Savage Garden is one of the best ones I have ever heard. I like them a lot and I fanyone wants to chat with me about them tehy can e-mail me at Discmanwil@aol.com or use AOL instant messenger at Discmanwil."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best CD's ever!","review":"This CD is wonderful! It has some fast songs and some slow songs. Also this CD has more good songs than Savage Garden's self titled original CD. Some of the best songs are \\"Affirmation\\" , \\"I knew I loved you\\", and \\"The Animal Song\\". With the old Savage Garden style. This should be a hit for all pop or Savage Garden fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"loved it!","review":"I so loved Savage Garden's new cd AFFIRMATION. In fact I loved the words to the title song, that I typed them up and framed them. The ANIMAL SONG is great that I had to play it over and over again. I KNEW I LOVED YOU was the reason I bought the cd in the first place. And I'm glad I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"And the Grammy for ALBUM OF THE YEAR GOES TO:","review":"Affirmation is easily the best album that I have ever listened too. One of the only albums that I can listen to the entire way through, it has some incredibly moving lyrics. Two Beds and a Coffee Machine moved me to tears, reminding me of a friend who grew up with an abusive parent. Being there for the one while being completly honest with that person was the general feeling that I got from listening to it. The song Affirmation is a song which I feel ANYONE can relate to. With all of the presures that society puts on us, it is nice to hear a song that says \\"It's ok to be who you are\\", and if that itsn't good enough for someone then you don't need them. Thank you to Darren and Daniel for writing this album and helping me get over a very painful time in my life."},{"rating":"2","title":"affirmation of Affirmation","review":"I loved Savage Gardens first release and have been eagerly awaiting the next effort. When I heard the tracks released last summer I rushed down to the record store to find the cd was not available. Well it's here, and I think it was worth the wait. I love the magic of lyrics and vocals that Darren and Daniel make together. The song affirmation is sheer genius. The lyrics are incredible, modern poetry with humor and depth.The remainder of the tracks are well balanced, and equally blessed with the magic and wit of these two post modern giants. I enthusiastically recommend this cd to anyone who has ever thought deeply about life, love, sexuality or the human condition. Thanks guys for this gift of the soul."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful album","review":"This CD is great! I bought it because I liked \\"I Knew I Loved You\\" and some of their previous singles, like \\"Truly, Madly, Deeply,\\" and I discovered that all the tracks are great. I love every single song on this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD is EXCELLENT!","review":"I loved the first savage garden cd and this one is even better. Crash and Burn is the sweetest song and Two Beds and a Coffee Machine is soooooo sad. This is a definate must-buy for any savage garden fan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Solid Follow Up","review":"They are a good duo. Maybe not fantastic, but at least they write and understand their own songs. This is a decent album, and I Knew I loved You is a pretty darn sweet song. Good work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very, very, very good","review":"The album is great, but be careful because once you start listening to it you just can't stop. Very adictive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy It","review":"The first time I've heard this album I was like WOW. It's so good. I love all the songs but my favourite are \\"Affirmation\\" \\"I KnewI loved You\\" \\"Chained to You\\" \\"Two Bed and a Coffee Machine\\" \\"You Can Still Be Free\\" \\"Gunning down romance\\" and \\"I don't Know you anymore\\". Buy It!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This doesn't sound very Savage Garden","review":"When I first heard the CD, I must say that I was rather disappointed. Most of the fast tracks, unlike those from their debut, sound like watered down versions of those from their debut. But the lyrics , as usual, are extraordinary. However, I was pleasantly surprised by some of the slower tracks in the CD, especially \\"2 Beds and a Coffee Machine\\". Check out the haunting cello, my spine tingles whenever this track is on. I think the 2nd half of the CD sounds more like the Savage Garden I expect. Really hope they can find the sounds of their debut again, for I feel that there is something missing in this album which prevents it from standing out from the rest."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent variety, good buy","review":"I've always been impressed by the variety of music that comes from Savage Garden. At least based on their radio singles, every song has a unique feel to it, and were it not for Darren's standout voice, one might even think each song was performed by completely different bands. The same cannot be said for this entire CD, but there is still a nice mix of upbeat and slower songs. I always think it's a big plus when a band writes their own songs, and none of these appear to have suffered from the pitfalls of trying too hard to rhyme in the right place, and many of them really do inspire you to think a little. Or at least ponder just about everything in life (i.e. the song, Affirmations). One other note...don't be fooled by the apparent \\"boy band\\" style in I Knew I Loved You. While I personally think this is still leagues above any boy band song, it's got the same kind of feel to it, and it's really not typical of any of their other songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unexpected Poetry","review":"The name of this duo gives a very different impression than their music does. They are truly poets. The music is melodic and rhythmic. I thought I was too old to get hooked on a new pop group, but these guys are great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extraordinary Talent.........","review":"Having heard \\"I knew I Loved you \\" on the radio, I was compelled to go buy this album. It certainly was a great buy. A marvelous album.......and I mean that.....Truly, Madly, Deeply."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD will not \\"crash and burn\\"!","review":"Savage Garden is a remarkle group with raw talent and to put mildy \\"breaks the mold\\". Refreshingly not a cheesy boy band, or a depressing gothic soundtrack, Darren Hayes fits somewhere in between. I'll admit I wasn't crazy about their overplayed hit single \\"I Knew I Loved You\\", but the CD is a great buy. I admire the fact that they write some of there own songs, because I realize how hard that is to do. Something else I appreciate is the band duo don't just try to play pretty boy to impress their younger female fans and seem real and unique. Great alternative music sung by the voice of an angel. Please listen to this, if not buy it. This CD is worth every penny of your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Magic!","review":"This is my absolute favorite CD in my collection! All the songs are simpley marvelous, including the one sthey haven't released, such as \\"Affirmation\\"\\"Chained TO You\\" and especially \\"Gunning Down Romance\\". If you have their first album, you HAVE to get this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Album","review":"I love this CD! Savage Garden has quickly become one of my favorite bands after listening to this album. These songs can make me dance, laugh, and cry. All the emotion in Darren's voice is incredible and can put you in so many different moods on each song. Anyone who loves music will appreciate this emotion-filled CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Once again an Amazing CD from Savage Garden","review":"I absolutely loved their debut album, and could not stop listening to it. Affirmation is just as good, and now I cant quit listening to this one. I wonder how they can continue making albums where all songs are just great. Amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"This one is a definate buy","review":"I have never been so pleasantly surprised by a CD! I bought this for one song on the CD and found that every single song was wonderful! I have never had such a great collection of songs on one label! I hope these guys will get it together and keep writing music! Leave if to the Aussies to produce such a great album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Positive Affirmation","review":"Kudos to the boys from Brisbane. Their latest offering, \\"Affirmation\\" is one of the best albums I've purchased in several months. The selections range from sentimental love songs, to upbeat dance tunes. The lyrics won't blow your mind with depth, but at the same time, they offer a quiet innocense, and a subtle, but usually possitive message. Frankly, there isn't a bad track on the entire album. This is a cd that will make you smile. If you're looking for something to vent your aggression, go somewhere else."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best thing","review":"This is my favorite album along with All Eyez on Me and Seal(1994)1. Affirmation- I will never grow tired of this song2. Hold Me- very decent3. I Knew I loved you- This has to be the #1 song played at weddings4. The Best Thing- Great dance song and very catchy5. Crash and Burn- First song i heard off of Affirmation and its awsome6. Chained to you- another great dance song7. The Animal song- awsome8. The Lover after me- Perfect song for a break-up9.

I must admit the album has its moments (some of the ballads are kind of touching), but I find it's also chock full of super-cheezy cliches and silly lines (primarily found in the \\"Animal Song\\"). Many of the songs are in the same key and use the same chordal structures (almost a'la Britney Spears). Also, the lead singer uses an irritating switch to falsetto, which gets old real fast. These little annoyances are making me want to start working out with earplugs in. Two stars for effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really Sad...","review":"I have to say that I REALLY loved Savage Garden's debut album, but \\"Affirmation\\" does not stack up to the competition. All they have written are songs that are guaranteed to be hits. They got makeovers; it seems like they're selling out. I really thought that the second album would be as good as the first, but I was really disappointed. All the songs on \\"Affirmation\\" sound pretty much the same. They all mush into one entire song.

Its almost crazy how well Darren Hayes can lure you in with his lyrics. Call it sappy. I call it music the way it was supposed to be made. Beautiful lyrics with a wonderful voice and instrumentals. I love this CD and I really wish they were still making music together. \\"The Lover After Me\\" is the worn ou track on my copy. So beautiful you will cry and then ant to hear it again.

I asked a good friend who knows a lot about music(about 4,000 cds). He told me MADACY is a company that puts out a lot of these kinds of compilations and for whatever reason get one member of the original band to do a new version.

I was very disappointed. It is very \\"70's\\" looking (and sounding) and has little value as a supposedly erotic film. Outside of a few visually interesting scenes (i.e. an older (ugly) guy and a young (very attractive) woman rolling around on a floor covered with what looks like giant pages out of a dictionary, with definitions of sexually oriented terms). Most of the film came off as pretentious, boring, and outdated. I have seen one other Metzger film to date, \\"Therese and Isabel\\", and that one was slightly superior."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it.","review":"Clumsy attempts at eroticism usually come out vulgar, as did this.

Life is too short for this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredibly Erotic, Pleasing, Interesting","review":"\\"The Lickerish Quartet\\" is what I always thought pornography should be, but never is. There is enough sex in the movie, but it's all very real-seeming, without being vulgar (no close-up entry shots, etc.) The settings are evocative and stylish, the story line is OK, and the individual scenes (even besides the sex) are extremely interesting and intriguing. Expect some subtle eroticism, and a lot of not-so-subtle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breathtaking","review":"I once wrote a review on \\"Wildflowers\\" (2000) suggesting that it should have won an Oscar for cinematography. Same thing applies here. Anybody who has been captured by (or curious about) the mystical splendor of Europe's old castles doesn't want to miss this 1970 movie. Whether it's erotic enough (or too erotic for an art film) is another story. Cinematography alone defines pretty well the difference between \\"Lickerish Quartet\\" and thousands of sleazy flicks out there. (P.S. I first gave it 3 stars then realized Sylvana Venturelli's stunning beauty deserved another one)."},{"rating":"1","title":"clever rather than erotic","review":"I was new to this director, already known for a repertoire of naughty pictures. The idea as expressed by reviewers made the plot feel like one that was ripe for erotic situations. However the director was so preoccupied with engineering his clever plot twist, which i wont spoil here, that the story is quite bland and the chemistry between the actors very flat. An opportunity missed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheesy","review":"The Lickerish Quartet, though tame by today's standards comes from an era when for a movie to have some explicit content would have to be deemed \\"to have political, social or artistic value\\". The \\"experimental\\" aspects of The Lickerish Quartet are weird or don't make sense like sudden cuts to Bosch paintings or a couple making love on a floor with words written on it as from a dictionary that suddenly happen to be words relating to sexual terms. The whole \\"was it real or just a dream?\\" plot barely pieces together. It is a relic of its time. Radley Metzger, unlike Russ Meyer (Mudhoney, Vixen) the other \\"auteur\\" of this genre puts together a film that is fun to watch as a camp classic but otherwise will have you scratching your head one minute and laughing the next."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chills and thrills abound when you hear the Legend...","review":"This is a wonderful rendition of this classic horror tale.

The guitars work well together. Everything is played to the hilt, and invested with a passionate intensity. The tunes motor along with quite frenetic energy and occasional use of odd time-signatures to keep you on your toes.The album gets off to a blistering start - with the wonderful \\"I'll Find You\\" - and just keeps on going. Highlights include \\"Falter\\", \\"Silver\\", \\"Dissolve\\" and \\"If I Coluld\\".I coluld hardly disagree more with the previous correspondent, whose head appears to be where the sun don't shine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes Me Proud To Be English","review":"Ok, so I picked up this album after one of my friends was hyping them up. I quite liked it, but only really listened to \\"Silver\\".A couple of months later, I saw them live. I absolutely loved them. I came back, and I loved their album. Colin is quite literally the best UK vocalist by a mile. I cant really think of how to insult him to be honest, he is fantastic.\\"Silver\\" is the song you will first get into, that or \\"Ill Find You\\" but other standout tracks include \\"Answers\\" with a sick drum beat, \\"Falter\\" the better of the two slower ballad-like songs on the album, and \\"If I could\\".It took a little listening to, as it may do for you, but pick this up, and you wont regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"You won't find a better debut...","review":"Well, what can I say. You won't find a better debut album this year. Most bands just sign to a major label, slap together a few half-arsed songs onto a CD and call it an album. But not Hundred Reasons. They waited. And waited. And waited - and it shows. They've given themselves time to develop their sound to perfection, and as a result they've made a blinder of an album.I can't tell what this is supposed to be - I've heard it called new wave punk, soft rock, nu-metal, but it is blatantly one of the best emo albums of recent times. Colin's voice can provoke many emotions - from the sombre 'Falter' to the happy 'I'll Find You', he manages to cover every aspect of the emo spectrum.Overall, this a mighty fine emo album - even if you dont particularly like the genre, you will be taken aback by the sheer quality of this album.Can't wait for the second."},{"rating":"1","title":"Urgh...","review":"This month has its fair share of disappointments, but this one surely takes the biscuit. This is guitars by numbers: rock bluster pasted over a canvas which has no innovation and with the exception of the singles, no tunes either.

Hundred Reasons aren't ready to be a rock band for the masses: hell, they're not ready to be a rock band for a couple of their mates."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious and Fun!","review":"This movie although ripped by critics had a few laugh out loud moments, but otherwise kept a reletively upbeat mood making it an enjoyable film with an especially good performance by Annette Bening."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh my goodness what a shocker!!","review":"I cannot for the life of me understand why people are giving this film more than 1 star. It is truly one of the worst films I have ever seen! Why a stellar cast such as this would come on board this project is beyond me, and how such a great director (or so I thought) managed to make such a bad film is only explained by the woeful script. It's a stinker. Really. PS - and what's with Garry Shandling? Who thought it was a good idea to cast him in a leading role?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great movie for those who still have a sense of humor.","review":"This movie is about male/female relationships. It is light hearted with no \\"serious message\\". The acting is great. The humor is in a sophomoric male vein just like Son of the Beach. Not recommended for those who take themselves more seriously than their friends do."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste.","review":"I think that the film flounders just because it was made in a haste. It's definitely half-baked. It jumps and jitters from one track to another quite unexpectedly. The fact that there are some good jokes told by good actors only adds to the overall confusion.If given the time to shape inside the director's and scriptwriters' heads that movie could be one of the funniest offerings of the year. Instead in just stumbles to the ridiculous and utterly unfunny finale.Annette Bening is the ex-alcoholic of Mars Attacks! and the realtor of American Beauty. Linda Fiorentino is her usual maneating self. No surprises here. And Garry Shandling's face looks paralyzed.Just as the movie's baby, the film was born much earlier than it was due."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Planet Is This Movie Funny On?","review":"I cannot recall a movie in which more talented people, folks who have done such great work in front of and behind the camera, have all failed so miserably. There is not one laugh in this movie. And the story itself is inane to the point of utter tedium. Garry Shandling had better come up with a vehicle that suits his talents very, very soon. A leading man he ain't. Even if Adam Sandler cranks out three movies this year and they spin off a few SNL characters into feature films, you'll be hard pressed to find a worse comedy this year."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't bother","review":"what a waster of my time...the whole movie is so predictable and boring. i've spent better time in the can than watching this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"I beg to differ","review":"On a recent airplane trip from England I watched this movie and found it so funny and clever that I watched it a second time. When I got home I told my wife about it and a couple days ago we watched it together (my 3rd viewing in less than a week!) She also thought it was wonderful. Wondering what film critics thought, I checked out their reviews on the web. Wow, this film was almost universally panned. Now I am perplexed. Other than liking Ishtar my tastes are pretty mainstream. So how can I feel that this is one of the best films I have seen this year, while most critics have questioned why it was even made? You may want to rent this one before you buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amusing film","review":"A hilarious, but also moving, film with some great stars.

From solisbury hill(peter gabriel), make me smile(harley and rebel), when will I see you again(the three degrees), can't help fallin in love(Elvis) to you've lost that lovin' feeling(The Righteous Brothers). I would have liked them to have released new material instead but this album is still good anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow. Yuck.","review":"I'm terribly disappointed. I don't know what else to say, really. The worst crime for me, with a band that I love, is to be BORING. I'm bored by this album. And, I just plain don't like half the songs to begin with, so why would I enjoy covers of them? I don't think their creativity has dried up, as some suggest. They just wanted to try something different. Now they should go back to an original studio album for their next attempt.If you are an Erasure fan, you should probably skip this one. I'm going to purchase \\"Loveboat\\" because I enjoy what I've heard of it so far.Go buy the single versions of \\"Solsbury Hill\\" (which of course if different ---and BETTER, more souped up--- than the album version) and \\"Make Me Smile\\" and skip the rest of the cd. Phooey!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this","review":"I stumbled on this travesty while seeking a version of Video killed the radio star, and found the selection of songs intriguing. I love versions of good songs and erasure had chosen some excellent songs to cover.Unfortunately, their mechanical synthpop approach to this classic material is worse than annoying--it is slapdash and heretical. Particularly, their Solisbury Hill tackles one of the finest songs of the rock era and facemasks the profound meaning of Gabriel's original--one suspects the group didn't even understand the mystical meaning of the song! If an appropriate group of pop music mavens convened in a college and appointed a theologically correct pop music pope(is Paul McCartney available? He isn't doing anything except battling messy divorce cases.), he would excommunicate erasure and condemn them to the Muzak inferno.Just seek out the originals of these songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"erm...","review":"Erasure is the poor man's Depeche Mode. Funny since Vince started that band too...maybe he should've stuck around."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT THE HELL IS ERASURE DOING?","review":"It surely breaks my heart that Erasure, who has the best male singer in the world, could make such an effortless piece of work. Solsbury hill is quite possibly the best cover tune ever but that is just about where it all stops. The rest of the album is just silly and boring. First of all, I'm not sure if Erasure's fan base is even familiar with the material they're covering on this album. Yeah, my Buddy Holly records are sandwiched right in between my erasure cds. But, this is how it is in erasureland these days. Up and down, up and down, and so on. Buy chorus. Buy the circus. Buy all the box sets of singles. Other people's songs is their worst effort ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Go WILD with Erasure!","review":"This is officially required club music. THE soundtrack of the night and the high life.Put on your short-shorts, wax your chest and get down with this album!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yet Another Disappointment - Don't Waste Your Money","review":"The art of a great cover is the selection -- the ability to retrieve a song from the graveyard at precisely the right time for ripe nostalgia. Erasure wins with the single, Solsbury Hill, but falls flat on its face with the rest. I can't think of a more annoying collection of songs than When Will I See You Again, Can't Help Falling in Love, and You've Lost that Lovin' Feeling. Gagggggg! Aside from perpetuating the poor judgement Andy Bell and Vince Clarke have shown since their last admirable effort, Chorus, the fact that they are performing 'Other People's Songs,' is verification of a continuing trend of writers block. These guys have sadly lost touch with the remarkable talent they possess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looking forward to another original","review":"Sorry guys, but, you're waaaay too good to be remaking other people's songs. Strange that I don't really like the originals of any of the songs either, so, perhaps I'm a bad judge for this CD. It's upbeat, but, the songs are just terrible. 'You've lost that lovin' feeling'....No! No! No! I'll just have to look forward to your next original release of new, new, new, new lyrics and music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what i've been waiting for!!!","review":"I'm a total die-hard fan of Erasure, i have all their albums and singles and may I say this album is just as i escpected: VERY GOOD. To me one of the best songs in this album is \\"Goodnight\\" a love song that's too much fantastic to describe...Obsviously \\"solsbury hill\\", \\"make me smile\\" and \\"ebb tide\\" are great as all the reviewers had written. There's only one reason not to give it the full five stars: THE COVER FACTOR....Please give us a full original album in 2004!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"TONIGHT WE'RE GONNA PARTY LIKE IT'S 1986!","review":"After the dreary misfire that was \\"LOVEBOAT\\" one should be happy that Erasure have returned to their roots. One should-until one realizes that it's 2003. There is not one synthesized beep or swoosh on any of these songs that we didn't hear on countless Erasure albums since the early 80's. Granted, they are taking \\"Other People's Songs\\" and making them their own, but in this case it's not really a good thing. Pointless, who asked for it? cover versions that can be done by anyone and merely come off as a filler laden vanity project by a band that sadly seems way past it's 1989 expiration date. Wake up, Rip Van Winkles-it's the 21st century. Even Bananrama and the Pet Shop Boys have managed to stay more current. A real tragedy that's for completists only and even though may only open it only once."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh More Lame","review":"As a long time Erasure fan I bought this the week it came out.Needless to say, I wish I didn't.Erasure cover songs are usually great - as seen by the Abbaesque album.But these songs all seem like they were banged off in a spare week of studio time because the boys needed some cash.All in all - I say skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The New, \\"Steve & Edie\\"!","review":"The only thing that kept running through my mind listening to this garbage was, \\"How bored were they...really?\\" Not only do I find this \\"disc-CARDable,\\" I discovered that it actually has an audio medicinal use...inducing vomitting! I used to be embarrassed for my parents when I would see them all \\"a-glow\\" watching/listening to ANY Steve Lawrence and Edie Gormet piece.

C'mon folks...are we so wiped out of any original ideas?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck!!","review":"Let me start off by saying I'm a huge Erasure fan. I have all their CD's and even the boxed singles sets. I have yet to come accross an Erasure CD I didn't like...Until now. I can't make it past the first song (Solsbury hill). Vince sounds like He's playing on a cheap Casio key board and Andy just sounds tired. I don't feel like they added anything or brought anything unique to the covers. Could have been so good and it's just not."},{"rating":"1","title":"...are best left unrecorded by Erasure","review":"This collection of poorly chosen and recorded songs really shouldn't have been released as a bona fide Erasure album. Save a track or two for b-sides to GOOD Erasure singles, but leave this glop in the dust. I will say that their versions of \\"Come Up And See Me\\" and \\"Ebb Tide\\" managed to win me over, but the rest is just awful. Here's hoping Erasure never attempt to release anything like this ever again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting take on music Erasure was born to cover","review":"While I am in agreement with a few other reviews that call for an Original Erasure album as necessary, I found Other People's Songs to be an altogether refreshing concept and album. The arrangements are absolutely mystical and are untouchable by any other duo or group on the market today. Erasure has held fast to a unique blend of music they helped originate and are continuing to improve as a collaboration. Other People's Songs has the feel of their previous album's \\"I Say, I Say, I Say,\\" and \\"Cowboy\\".Rather than see the songs as \\"remakes\\", critics should take a step back and consider how well done each effort comes across. \\"When Will I See You Again\\" and \\"Can't Help Falling In Love\\" ARE INDEED songs that should be remade, their timeless classics and Erasure puts their own staple on them that only THEY can.

I was really looking forward to this release, but was really disappointed when I listened to it. It would be like Dolly Parton releasing a rap singles album putting her own twist on it. Needless to say, the Album jacket is the most interesting part of the whole disk.Sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tripe","review":"I will not waste many words here.Easily the worst Erasure album ever. This is quite a surprise, as \\"Abba-esque\\" over ten years earlier was a tour de force.Recording landmark songs by others was always likely to be a failure: they would have been far better advised to pick songs which lent themselves to new interpretations rather than just imposing a style upon the original concepts.The only good point regarding this album is it reminds one that Erasure are good composers. Without their own songs, their production and vocal skills are not nearly as impressive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Erasure does Other People's Songs with perfection!","review":"I am a HUGE Erasure fan. I consider them my favorite group of all time! Other People's Songs continues the trend of Erasure and excellent albums. From start to finish the album is great. Vince Clarke once again shows why he is the true god of synth and Andy Bell's voice is as perfect as ever. Some of my favorites are Everybody's Got To Learn Sometimes, You've Lost That Loving Feeling, Solsbury Hill, Video Killed The Radio Star and Make Me Smile!

Del principio al fin, todas las canciones son fenomenales. Mis favoritos personales son \\"Plastico\\" y \\"Buscando Guayaba.\\" A traves de este album, Blades explora temas importantes no solamente en los anos setenta pero ahora tambien, como la necesitad de unificacion en latinoamerica y superficialidad en nuestras vidas. Se dice que este album ha vendido lo mejor en la historia de la salsa y al escucharlo, comprendera por que. He escuchado este album miles de tiempos pero siempre lo encontrara en mi CD player porque es un album sin edad y sigue ser clasico en todos sentidos. Gracias, Ruben y Willy Colon por haber producido un album tan precioso e importante en mi vida musical."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clásico de la Salsa","review":"Todavía recuerdo la primera vez que escuché (por radio) a \\"Pedro Navaja\\".

Los otros números también \\"pegaron\\" acá en Puerto Rico, y a Rubén Blades se le admira y quiere como \\"Panamariqueño\\". Los arreglos y la banda de Willie Colón: impecables. Este disco es sencillamente una joya que no debe faltar en la discoteca de ningún hispanoparlante que sienta admiración y orgullo por la música latina, lo que hoy se llama \\"salsa\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"el mejor disco de la historia de la salsa","review":"Todas las canciones estan buenas, todas son clasicos hoy en dia. Si no lo tienes no eres salsero. Personalmente la que mas me gusta es Buscando Guayaba, sabrosisima para oir o bailar.

Absolute ear candy.","review":"I first caught Oskar Cartaya and the Enclave at a festival gig a couple years ago and was hit immediately with the thought, \\"Man, what are you doing here?\\". It hits me when I see BIG talent on a small stage. These guys are destined for great things. Oskar has a command of the bass akin to Joe Satriani's on guitar...Both players make the impossible look effortless. I wanted to come home and smash my bass after seeing Oskar the first time but it's a nice one so I didn't. I did, however, eagerly await this CD and I am not disappointed. You won't be either.

I've written to the label asking for a refund, because the CD is not (technically) defective and thus I have no cause to blame Amazon.Amazon allows 1 star as the minimum. I would give this zero stars for false advertising."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really?....","review":"If you are looking for synthesized music then you have found your album.

Hans Urs von Balthasar was, without a doubt, one of the most important Catholic systematic theologians of the 20th century. This is the first book (of seven) of the first part of his \\"trilogy\\" which outlines and describes his systematic theology. As an introduction to his systematics, it is an essential read. To those not familiar with von Balthasar, it's a wonderful place to start.Unsatisfied with Rahner's \\"transcendental Thomism\\" and his method of \\"doing theology from below\\", von Balthasar begins with the revelation of God. The entire systematic theology is structured around the ancient philosophical transcendentals \\"Beauty, Truth, and Goodness\\". In this first volume (and throughout the first part of the trilogy) von Balthasar discusses the Revelation of God to humanity through form and beauty.Truly a remarkable book, and a good introduction to a remarkable man."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pioneer DVD-AUDIO","review":"To: Tom Ferguson,Music enthusiast:If it's the Pioneer 563-A you own or a similar player you will need the firmware upgrade to correct this problem.

I LOVE this set, the remastering job is top notch, the box that hold the discs is quite sturdy, and I have not had any problem with the fact that they are DualDisc albums.

But, I was able to use my the setting menu of my DVD player to have it read the video portion so I can access the mixes in Dolby Digital.The DVD-A presntation is fantastic. The menus mix in with the art concepts of the album, the sound is amazing, and having all eight albums in one ultra modern looking box is very conveniant.Linernotes are well and work in great with the long overdue remastering of the catalog.Since I have the \\"Once in a Lifetime\\" box I was a bit dissapointed with having the videos on the DVDs....but the 5.1 mixes are on them and it's splended.

They let me try it out next day on mine, & sure enough, the multichannel mix would not play on my player (their's was a Denon model). I have many SACD's & DVD-A discs, all which have worked perfectly. Perhaps this is a marketing ploy to get us to buy yet another unit to play yet another format?

It would usually fail to read the disc, or if it did, it skipped horribly.o When played in my Sony DVP-NP685V unit - a player that would probably read the letters off a tire if you could find a way to get it in the transport - the 5.1 layer played stereo only, and the stereo layer played intermittently.The ONLY player that succeeded in playing these discs was my Bose Wave radio.

These letters show the attitudes, morals, mindsets, goals, worries, and daily lives of their writers, and seem at once both modern and dated, universal and unique. What one reads here also shows how, arguably, the English language reached its height during this era. The beauty of the wording of so many of these letters, even short chatty ones from one family member to another, have much to teach us, and should dispel any residue of belief that those who lived in eras before our own were unlearned and intellectually inferior to us. It is particularly interesting to read along from the position of hindsight and see how men and women who lived through momentous times regarded them as they were about to happen, as they were happening, and in the days that came after the events. These letters are not only educational, they are also, as a bonus, very interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"my personal favorite","review":"this is a must read for anyone who loves history. the story is told by the letter writers themselves. the letters were simply put in order by the date written. after reading the unabridged version many years ago, i was compelled to visit Midway, Ga., where i visited gravesites and the museum.

A couple of filler tracks which are listenable but not brilliant, but overall 4 out of 5 sums this up.

Band name came from the concept that great rock legend has been handed down to younger generation. Toby Hitchcock has brilliant voice some of the greatest legendary male vocalists combined. What's good about him is that his voice comes smooth no matter how low and how high the tone. Given such flexible voice Jim Peterik's song arrangement became much aggressive and brilliant than anything else he has done so far. It includes excellent songs such as Sound Of Home, Gone, and Interrupted Melody. Hard-edged Unbreakable and It's Criminal reminds me a bit of Survivor. Last Safe Place can be made into excellent duet or could well be covered by some of the excellent female vocalists such as Avril Lavigne, Amy Lee(Evanescence) and Michelle Branch.It is highly commercial and wild responce in US is much anticipated."},{"rating":"1","title":"More expensive than the product site price","review":"So I sometimes come across those who are selling a certain product more than the actually company's pricing and this is one of those products.

I was pumping myself full of 400 mg of caffeine. These pills are not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eat Less, Move More...","review":"That is truly the key to successful weight loss. I decided to take these as a supplement to se if they enhanced my performance (I exercise regularly and eat healthfully). I honestly can't tell if they helped, but I can say that after a few months of taking these pills I began to suffer from the most painful pressure headaches that would last anywhere from 2-8 hours. Essentially all this pill has to offer is sleepless nights, painful headaches and minimal if any healthy weight loss.

Whenever a name comes up, you can usually find it somewhere in one of the geneologies. Mr. Bishop didn't miss too much. There is some evidence of bias on the author's part, but I think some of the men he interviewed may have been a little \\"cagey\\" with him too, as if he was invading their privacy. All things considered, I think this book is an excellent starting point for someone who wishes to study karate history. Ther are some \\"secrets\\" that we'll never know - otherwise they aren't secrets!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the paper it's printed on.","review":"This book has so much biased and erroneous information, I would highly recommend anyone who is REALLY SERIOUS to consider \\"The History of Karate\\" by Tetsuhiro Hokama.

It details the well known stiles, interviews with the responsible masters and so on. It also includes valuable information on some rare styles. But if you are looking for the \\"secret techniques\\" they are not here, of course (try training with your Master for 20 years ;-) ). Very good and recommendable book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent overview of Okinawan styles of Karate","review":"Wow, I felt as if I visited the dojos addressed in this book. It did serve to demystify Okinawan Karate, which I found a mixed blessing. As they say, \\"ignorance is bliss.\\" Oriental culture tends to venerate ancestors and \\"those that have gone before.\\" While that is a noble practice, it can also be maddening for the Westerner that is not adept at reading between the lines to get to the truth. Mr. Bishop does a wonderful job at calling it like he sees it. In the end, this is an excellent overview of Okinawan styles of Karate. It contains a very detailed look at many different styles including philosophies, training methods, history, current conditions, and personalities. Although it didn't address every style of Okinawan Karate, I would recommend this book to assist those interested in picking a style, and I would certainly recommend it to anyone already interested in Okinawan Karate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great First Book","review":"I think this is the best book about a homicide detective that I have read in a long time. This book reminds me of the way that J A Jance writes about J P Beaumont. Jack seems to be a homicide detective with problems like the rest of the world. He is divorced and has a son he doesn't know. This is a story about Jack trying to solve a double homicide and also his relationship with his son that is 23 years old.

My stomach was bothering me and I was hot and cold. A couple hours later, the side effects became really bad. I layed in bed the whole rest of the day because I felt so crappy. I was tired and was so cold that I was covered with 2 comforters and a quilted blanket and still shivering.

That's just a personal thing, though.I fell in love with Basic Taebo, and this is such a departure. It's too dancy, too many complicated moves and steps that I just couldn't get."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gets your heart rate up!","review":"I'm new to TaeBo, so my review may be different from seasoned TaeBo users. I love this DVD. It really gets my heart rate up. I like that he changes moves often....you don't get bored that way. I do find some of the choreography difficult to follow, but after doing it a few times, you gradually pick up on it. I think this is a great way to get your heart rate up and challenge your body to push itself.

As mentioned in another review, it is so fast that you are unable to keep proper form. You will be huffing and puffing from jumping around so much (thus the 2 stars), but I do not think muscle toning of any sort is possible. I have lots of TAE BO DVDs and consider myself fit, but I actually think I might hurt myself moving at this pace. It is also disappointing to see how poorly edited the video is, not that any of Billy Blanks videos are perfect -- but man! Not sure if I am buying any more Tae Bo unless I get to preview it first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheesy","review":"You get what you pay for! This video was totally cheesy and not choreographed very well either. Billy kept messing up the routine and I barely broke into a sweat. Don't waste your time.

I don't mind him slowing down to show a new combination because it gave me a minute to catch my breath. I did notice he messed up a couple of times and there was one leg he never got to on a certain move, but I wasn't too bothered by it. But the last half of the workout involved some pretty tricky combos that I found hard to follow. It will probably take me several run-throughs of this workout to start getting the steps correctly. If you are really coordinated or pick up combinations quickly you might not have a problem.At the end, I am still much more satisfied with the Cardio DVD as I consider it more the perfect length and I was able to do it from start to finish without really getting noticeably confused on any of the combos. The Celebrity DVD seemed too long too me as it was beginning to get repetitive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tae Bo Celebrity Fit","review":"I have been doing Tae Bo for years and I love it.

He keeps it at a faster pace throughout the entire video. It felt like I was flying through the workout. I didn't get bored with it. No floor work.

I was disappointed at the lack of variety. The people doing the exercise along with Blanks were out of sync and Blanks himself would forget a step or two. Since getting the video I have used it twice. It does not motivate me to work out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tae Bo Fan - but this is not good","review":"I LOVE Tae Bo and have been using it since 1997. This workout is more of a 'beginning' workout. Some of it is fun but he does WAY too much explaining and I think by trying to mix it up - he makes it complicated and you're so focused on watching/learning and then by the time you actually get to the 'workout' part - you're bored and your heart rate isn't up so it seems pointless. There are some good - heart pumping parts - but you get slowed down in the middle by the 'directions' he is giving instead of the workout you should be doing! Save your money on this one and buy the Get Ripped Series."},{"rating":"2","title":"great workout -fast-fun-no equipment needed-easy to follow!","review":"This is the best one I think. I did my first Tae Bo video on VHS and I have done most of the ones he's put out. It's fast- the moves are easy to pick up and it really gets your heart pumping. It's a great workout that is a good combo of high intensity then a tiny bit of slow so you can catch your breath. When I started it I had quit working out for a long time- I could only do 10mins but I quickly worked up to being able to finish the video. Also has a bonus clip of Billy talking about how he started out. Don't expect perfect cuing but it really gets the job done. I own a ton of workout dvd's and I always go back to this. It's so cheap just buy it and push play every day-you will see results if you stick with it you won't be sorry!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Taebo Celebrity Cardio Bummer","review":"I was disappointed.

This dvd was so boring. After 10 minutes I was like \\"you're kidding right?\\" I did not even breaking a sweat.Lot's of toe stepping and punching in the air= yawn.

Unfortunately, The Darkest Hour, which follows a group of tourists in Russia trying to survive an extraterrestrial attack, falls squarely in the company of the latter. Emile Hirsch and Max Minghella play Sean and Ben, two social networking entrepreneurs looking to market their software in Russia when strange lights in the sky descend up on Moscow and begin vaporizing humans. It's probably easy to guess what the problems were with The Darkest Hour: I found the plot devices trite and contrived, the special effects lazy, and the characters wholly unremarkable.

On the plus side, it does cover most of the tourist areas in case you ever wanted to visit Moscow. On the minus side, it's really a cut sequence from a video game but with even less character depth, logic and plot.Many reviewers here have done an excellent job in detailing the failures of this film. If I may be allowed to add a crowning failure to trump them all, it would be that the audience does not care about the characters at all. This film reminds me that although I didn't like Spielberg's War of The Worlds or Abrams' Cloverfield, they are basically much more professionally executed in every respect.There are some talented folk in the cast here and they wasted the opportunity. This film is flat-out boring, ridiculous and a repetitive version of better versions that have been before."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfinished - sort of OK","review":"This is an unfinished film with a few bright spots. If there were such a thing as 2.5 stars, that is where I would rate it. It is just a bit below average. This is an unfinished film it is as though they just ran out of money before they could finish the story. The story doesn't conclude - it just stops in mid stream (quite literally in a sense). I did not feel too robbed at the 3.99 I spent, I was very disappointed at how they just dropped the story at the end, but it is not without some entertainment value. This movie is much better than say a typical Syfy channel production. In fact that is how I would describe this movie - as a bigger budget SyFy Channel movie.

Different take on the alien invasion theme. We have our HD movies run thru our Sony to our big screen tv.

The overall concept of the movie is nothing new: aliens invading planet to take over. Even with that however, the aliens themselves and the location being set in Moscow separated this title from the rest. The actors were all fresh faces, adding to the \\"realism\\" for lack of a better term. Their performances were surprisingly good despite what some reviews have indicated.To summarize, it's definitely worth the hour and a half of your life that you'll spend watching it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Moderately lame","review":"Whoever did the CGI for alien killing graphic did a great job.

I don't know why it is receiving so many negative reviews. I honestly didn't read them because when I watched it, I loved it. It wasn't gory and overly violent (well, many people are killed by aliens but they turn to dust. There is no blood.) and the special effects were more than decent. What I really loved about it was the location: MOSCOW! You are taken through so much of the city -- there's a great scene or two in Red Square, one of the Cathedral of Christ the Savior, a couple of Metro stations, the Russian State Library with it's statue of Dostoyevsky out front and the inside of GUM. Having been there more than a decade ago, it was great to see so much of the city on film. The acting wasn't Oscar-worthy, but who cares? That isn't the point of the film. It was a suspenseful, interesting movie that showcases a beautiful city. I know I would watch it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"A BIG disappointment, considering the cast ...","review":"Love alien movies, really like Emile Hirsch, REALLY like Max Minghella ... and can even check my brain at the door and just enjoy a fairly stupid action or sci-fi flick, when need be (see 'Cowboys & Aliens') - but this one strained both credibility AND my nerves. Weak writing and performances - along with a very rushed film that took no time for either story or character development - make for a tough watch, even at barely an hour and a half."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better if its free than to Pay for it","review":"The story has potential, but never took off in the movie. The acting was not great and the movie just has too many sterotypes in it that makes it lose any credibility. I was disappointed watching this in the theaters. Better to watch it on cable than to pay for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Darkest Hour.","review":"All good with the Seller, no problem there. but the movie we watched last night and it sucked, terrible movie, story wise, 3D wise was fine, they just needed to put in more action, actually, our company fell asleep on the couch and it took everything we had to sit thru the movie and watch it awww it was an awful movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good start and got worse.","review":"Bad start of a dumb, factually incorrect, and doesn't make a bit of sense opening scene of a star map with little Pacman dashes moving across it and making 2D 90 degree turns. Another cheap ripoff of the recently popular scenes of aliens slowing descending in mass numbers onto Earth to wreck havoc. Another cheap ripoff of the vamp movie genre CGI showing people disintegrating into swirling ashes. Dumb physics that would embarrass a high school science student. A cheap prop of something called a microwave gun that was probably borrowed from '50s scifi. Surprisingly, the quickest/easiest solution in killing the aliens, shown at the beginning, was to throw some booze on them - specifically it's the alcohol, and they self immolate. The usual scattered cars and other trash on the streets. The usual small enclaves of humans fighting to the end and the usual submarine waiting to rescue some survivors.Overall - bad acting, bad dialogue, cheap knockoff writing, bad CGI."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak everything","review":"This film was a terrible disappointment, mainly as I expected much more than what it was.The story itself is probably passable for a movie. Some Americans in Moscow are caught up with aliens invading Earth for its mineral. Nothing terribly original in the story. Although I thought some of the lines of dialogue were interesting.So it is all up to the characterization, acting and the filming to make the movie something. Unfortunately, nothing like this happened. I did not think any of the characters were particularly interesting.

They make dumb choices throughout the entire movie that people facing actual extinction would definitly not make. It is VERY predicatble and about 45 minutes in, I was checking to see how much longer the movie was... I mean, another issue was the guy and his girlfriend fall into the water, and when he comes up he cannot find her, then when he climbs onto the submarine, a flare comes up, and she is ten blocks away on land...What the heck?!?!?

They encounter aliens from outer space. As the aliens power down everyone they start to power up our essential minerals. They are electric by nature and want our copper. The world is now without electric power. Our two Americans, along with two young women, one American and one Australian, find themselves racing through a deserted Moscow trying to stay alive. The Darkest Hour is essentially brainless fun with three reasons to watch. Emile Hirsch is the lead and he's a fine actor. Two Russian actors almost steal the show. One plays a big raggedy electrician who comes up with a microwave gun and the other plays a big, tough cop who uses it (and who also protects the youngsters). The third reason is that The Darkest Hour is a Russian-American production. The movie was shot in Moscow. For those who have been there, Moscow's streets and sites will probably bring back memories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didnt keep my attention","review":"I have to give it to them, the action was good at the beginning of the movie.

The key in that phrase is \\"good.\\" This one is garbage--nothing unique in a niche of the genre that is growing a little tired (the post-apocalyptic stuff). This wants to be a nuanced Independence Day, but it's nothing even close--forgettable characters, forgettable aliens, nothing compelling about the plot, and cheesy dialogue at every corner.

The rest is not good at all, and the opener \\"See me burning\\" is just awful. The cover of Sex Pistols' \\"God save the queen\\" is forgettable.

Nobody roars and growls like Lemmy, and to paraphrase him from some years ago: when you play this one loud your neighbors' lawns will die.

I would rather the thing had a cap and a normal USB plug rather than having to use a cable to connect it, the font on the display is pretty small but not unreadable, the menus can be kind of byzantine but you get used to them pretty quickly.I gave it five stars but it is really a 4.5ish (mainly because of the tiny font)... but for $50 it is a very nice little player with lots of extra features."},{"rating":"1","title":"TrekStor i.Beat sweez does not work","review":"I ordered this device looking for something small for the gym and easy to use.

I also greased the post with anti-seize oil before sliding down the tubing to prevent them from locking up. They don't make bikes like this anymore!

About every FIVE pages there was a word missing in a sentence, a word spelled incorrectly, or a punctuation mark missing or incorrect. It ruined the reading for me and I spent $7.99 on it - what a waste. When I contacted Amazon about this they asked me to point out all the errors, which would have required my to go through the excruciating experience of editing the book myself because there are no page numbers!

Her power to start fires sends those who seek to control her on a road to ultimate destruction in their pursuit to harness her talents for their own ends. All this is going on while her only surviving parent, her father, tries to save her from those in pursuit of her and give her a normal life.

I've read most of King's work and really enjoy the innovative ideas as well as the writing techniques he employs to keep his well from drying up. This novel skips around a bit in time but King handles this better than most. I had a problem with the ineptitude of the government agency known as the Shop. Their inability to track down and capture a man and his young daughter was stretching things in my mind. Read Ludlum to see how it can and should be done. The ending seemed to me like King couldn't decide on how he wanted it done. He seemed to be almost wrestling with the idea of whether or not to kill off the little girl. I am being tough on King here because he is such a talent and this novel, while very good reading, just doesn't quite make it up to his excellent standards."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle version has big problems","review":"The Kindle version of Firestarter is the sloppiest print-to-e translation I've seen so far.

This ebook contains so many uncorrected \\"typos\\" that at times it's hard to read. Some examples: cata instead of cars, wooda instead of woods, hone instead of horse, itay instead of stay, capital L at the end of a sentence (the scanner sees the small l plus the period as a capital), and random periods in the middle of sentences or words.

It's one of Stephen King's earlier novels and I think it's not one of his best written books. I look forward to his later books, but this will probably be the last of his earlier books I read. In 'On Writing,\\" King says that the books written earlier in his career are the ones he's embarrassed by and after reading Firestarter I can understand why.

But Amazon should be ashamed for selling this given the number of mistakes in the kindle edition. I'm about a third of the way through Firestarter and I've lost track (probably over 20).

I am not sure if the original source materials used to capture the Kindle edition contain these errors but I feel as if I am reading an unproofed manuscript or the OCR scan was not looked at. There are spelling mistakes, misplaced words and characters switched, like \\"1\\" used instead of \\"I\\" (1F).If it happened once or twice, I wouldn't write this review. However the amount of typos really detracts and pulls me out of King's universe. Very frustrating to read. Save yourself some trouble and skip this one for the Kindle."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Pretty Good Read","review":"Firestarter is an exiting thriller by Stephen King. This is not his best work but it is fun to read. This book follows a father and daughter that are escaping a government organization. The daughter is the \\"firestarter\\" and can create fire just by thinking about it. I suggest you read this book because it's a fun read and a relatively quick one. There are a few slow points that I wasn't interested in. Overall, I recommend this book to anyone that is thinking about reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic King","review":"Unlike It or The Stand this is not an epic Stephen King novel and can easily be read in less than a week. Its a straight up action chase thriller about a man and his daughter (Andy and Charlie) on the run from a \\"secret\\" part of the government called The Shop. Most of the other reviews have pretty much summed up the plot of the novel. I just wanted to comment on how well King describes the love between father and daughter. I really felt for the characters and their connection to each other. I was rooting for Andy and Charlie all the way to the end. An often overlooked King classic, Firestarter is definitely a worth while read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Stephen King but Kindle book is full of typos","review":"This is a classic Stephen King novel and in my opinion, one of his best, along with The Dead Zone and The Stand. As others have noted, however, the Kindle version is full of typos, and it really diminishes the reading experience, as interpreting the typos breaks the reading flow. For example, there is a character in the book named Al... except in the Kindle version he is usually referred to as \\"A 1\\". Annoying.I read a lot of self published and public domain stuff on Kindle, and both of those types of ebooks are full of typos and formatting errors. The Firestarter problems are the worse I've seen, and that's particularly disappointing in a Stephen King book. King has been a big supporter of alternate format books (and \\"UR\\" was a great read on and about the Kindle) so you'd think his Kindle books would be better quality. Four and half stars for King's writing, and a negative star for the formatting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Firestarter by Stephen King","review":"Do you like sci-fi books? If you do then you'll love Firestarter. This book is about a medicine test that went terrably wrong, causing a family to be chased by the \\"shop\\" a goverment organization. The medicine is supposed to allow telekinetic, but it causes the test subjects to have other powers and go crazy. Two of the subjects get married and have a daughter that has pyrokineses, which is the ability to make fires with your mind. the reason I like this book is because it was full of suspence. I also liked the way he used different points or veiw lik he did in Salems Lot.

I liked the idea of it and I liked Charlie McGee, but the characters in IT were a lot cooler and more realistic.You know how in IT this thing had been going on for a long time, and that made it this huge war for the future? Well, firestarter wasn't like that. It was like- oh well, if Charlie and Andy die, they die.

I could harly put it down at any point. Steven King has out done himself with this one. The bad guys get every thing they deserve!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT PAGE-TURNER!!!","review":"Firestarter is classic King: original, scary, thoughtful and totally engaging. The great thing about King is the way he creates characters that just jump off the page. You can see them so clearly: Charlie's bear-ish father, Juice; the psychotic Shop agent, Dr. Wanless. And most of all John Rainbird. I think he may be King's greatest (human) villain. Totally monstrous and yet somehow magnetic. Many of this book's strengths lie in the little details and tangents King throws in: Wanless's habit of shredding his cigarettes, Rainbird's horrific experiences in Vietnam with his peyote chewing commanding officer. What can one say? Great imagination. Great book. although, as usual with King, don't read it if you have a weak stomach or are easily upset by descriptions of violence. Some of the book is quite disturbing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Transcription Errors","review":"Oldie but goodie :) I would have rated it higher if not for the SERIOUS Kindle transcription errors...spelling, missing and incorrect punctuation, missing capital letters, whole sentences misplaced or out of context. For a constant reader, constant errors like these are like brick walls thrown up on a freeway. Publishing on Kindle DOES NOT excuse the proofreader. Mr. King has never disappointed me before (okay, once or twice, but not for the same reasons), but he made his dime off of this edition and he let the publisher get away with producing the poorest quality reproduction I've seen on Kindle so far. I've reconsidered replacing my paper Kings with Kindle editions and I kind of want my money back for this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Typo's","review":"Firestarter is the only King book that I hadn't read yet. I've seen the movie many times but the book is so much better. It's classic King; engrossing from the very beginning. But the Typo's on the Kindle version are just terrible. I'm finding one on just about every page and it's really becoming distracting!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Baby, light my fire!","review":"Firestarter is one of stephen king's most underrated and overlooked novels. The stand and the shining tottaly stole the spotlight from this story which is told brillantly. Firestarter has it's own special power that stands apart from king's other novels.

There are several awesome parts in the story, but wait until you read the exciting ending. That was the best part in the whole book. If you've seen the movie, don't think that's all there is. The movie skips several parts in the real story, so If I were you I would read the book also. It has many parts the book does not have in the movie. Take my advice. Read the real thing.

Isn't that funny? It has all the characteristics of a good inspiring story for them - an insurmountable difficulty, a heroic effort, many saved by the efforts of the small and weak. Heck, there isn't even any Holocaust, so it can't run into the same difficulty as many WWII era picture books.This book is from the viewpoint of a young girl whose older brother is at war, and who helps ferry people to safety on that day. It's simply told, and while the horrors of war aren't overlooked, they're not actively shown in the pictures or dwelt upon. This book is a good one, I think, for the older reader of picture books."},{"rating":"1","title":"My fault!","review":"I must have been not paying attention, for this is a silly children's book!

But this book is about regular people responding with all their knowledge, strength, courage, and skill to help out in desperate times.Told in free verse, which detracts from the text. The illustrations are high-quality, detailed watercolors. I've never read a better story about a military retreat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useful, up to a VERY limited point","review":"As a seminary trained theologian I can appreciate the value of reading Daly's book. In its day 'Beyond God the Father' inspired many religious folks to critically engage several of the accepted tenents of Christian theology. But this positive contribution notwithstanding I am afraid the book is finally little more than a self-righteous and self-indulgent tirade. Indeed, rather than engaging in some critical (and historical) thinking of her own -- grappling with fact that many women have been able to buttress their liberation struggles through their Christian faith, Daly assumes that hers is only authentic feminist perspective. This makes for an ultimately tiresome and intellectually unsatisfying read. I wouldn't encourage anyone to avoid this book altogether, but there is certainly more important and creative feminist theology out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give me a break","review":"The only thing that I find at all interesting about this book is that so many people take this bad philosophy seriously. Daly seems to be saying more about her own fears and feelings instead of getting closer to any type of truth. She searches, just as the supremacists she so hates did, for the answers that she wants. But not to worry dear souls, until such work is built upon substantial evidence instead of psychofantsy, no one will really listen or care."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible","review":"I love Korean Drama but this was the worse i ever seenso bad i skipped many DVDs to get to the endingthats how bad this drama is, and so fake, how someone in coma can come back to life normally without any lose of brain functionshe was a vegetableplus how can a husband who drove recklessly, endangered his new bride leave his bride for another womenthis is a drama i would not put on my resume if i was an actor in this drama and deny involvement if i was in itits pretty bad if someone like me who loves K-drama cant watch the entire thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very average singer","review":"Bertie Higgins is just a very average singer with a limited vocal range.

I hope some day he will come back to Atlanta for a concert.

Mainly because of the intense floor exercises, that workout got me in the best shape ever within a few months.

It was too easy, I didn't even break a sweat doing both workouts. It's probably a good workout for beginners, but not for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed","review":"I found this DVD to be too similar to TaeBo Cardio. Although he does some dancing moves, he mostly does the same moves he does in TaeBo Cardio with much less explanation and he's moving much faster between moves in this one. I found myself bored within the first 5 minutes. It also seemed like Billy was just playing around a lot and the girl to his left kept having to tell him the right moves. If you're not in shape, this may be challenging for you, but I was dissapointed to find this workout too similar to another one I already own. Also, this is probably me being a nitpick, but Billy uses most of the same people in his Cardio workout, but I found that the outfits they wore in this one were not flattering. It's like the outfits were too small and they made some of the girls look heavier and in not as good shape as they look in the Cardio video."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great","review":"THis is the worst Tae Bo video I've seen and here's why: A. To actually do half the video, you need to have at least 15 feet of open living room space, and who has a living room with no furniture? B. The music is terrible. It is essentially songs that the producers or Billy wrote sung by a machine to a beat background. The lyrics are also all about God and Jesus. Not into that during my workout, but maybe you are. C. The combos are silly and the workout isn't hard.

She keeps shouting... and i felt like i wanted to kick her to make her quiet.ALSOa couple of the combinations he does towards the end are a little challenging to keep up with, but im sure with the more that you do it, the better you will get.Overall, this is a fantastic exercise dvd for those who like to kick some butt and sweat hard!! :-D"},{"rating":"2","title":"exactly as expected","review":"I am a Billy Blanks Tae Bo fan, and this was one of his toning videos.Just what I wanted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yet another excellent workout DVD","review":"This is yet another excellent workout DVD.

I have several Billy Blanks' Tae Bo videos, and know the exercises. However, this one has hip-hop style music and Billy tries to sing (or rap) along with the music, which I find very annoying. He also added a few dance type moves. Maybe he's trying to appeal to a younger, more hip audience. It just doesn't work. I even tried watching it with the volume turned off, but I can't even stand it that way. I think Billy should have stuck with the original style of work-out videos, where he talks us through the exercises, rather than trying to sing and dance. The \\"Boot Camp\\" series of workouts are better."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Cardio than Sculpt","review":"I have 10+ Billy Blanks DVDs and many of them kick my bum. I found Celebrity Sculpt to move to be more cardio based than sculpting based. In the last 10 minutes it picked up with some fantastic sculpting/resistance moves but it made me feel like the first 35 minutes were wasted. Billy moves rather quickly from one move to the next and doesn't spend enough time to really get your muscles tired in that move. Personally I found myself spending more time trying to keep up and learn the routine than really focusing and burning muscles.

I highly recommend using it as a jumping-off point to investigate more music, particularly that of Lucinda Williams (there are other songs by her on the L Word, which are found on her newest album), The Be Good Tanyas (a Vancouver trio that is absolutely phenomenal...go buy \\"Chinatown\\" today) and Rufus Wainwright. And to correct the review two down from this one, everyone knows that Leonard Cohen, Rufus Wainwright's fellow Montrealer, wrote and originally sang \\"Hallelujah,\\" not Jeff Buckley. The idiocy is shocking. Don't sound all snide and priggishly dismissive about something unless you actually know what you're talking about."},{"rating":"2","title":"A comment","review":"I read that people keep complaining about the \\"Francis and her friends\\" song, wondering why it's included. Actually, if you are a fan of the L word, you can easily see that this song is what the show's about. It's all the random acts of you know what portrayed at the beginning of every single episode.

Can't wait for the L word to come out on DVD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Agree, with caveats","review":"Came here looking for several particular songs I thought I'd find. One is the opening sequence song for the last episode of season 1, I believe by Portishead.

I love this album. This album proved to be a worthwhile excursion, encompassing all the elements that have made them radio and video favorites thus far: chilled-out Twin Cities-styled harmonies, plush R&B arrangements, energized hip-hop party beats, all put down with the most suggestive of lyrics. Even first-time exposure to this album reveals that the guys are in rare form, letting loose a multitude of flavors. It seems they have taken everything we loved so much from their debut and musically expounded upon those ideas.

Newitt's history of Mozambique clearly is an illustration of this: the author's view of Mozambique's history is one in which the portuguese play the villain and african's play the innocent \\"bon sauvage\\". Things are not so clear-cut however as our recent history has shown: mozambican history didn't begin with alien occupation and alien forces certainly aren't responsible for all evil we suffered in the past and still suffer in present times. For sake of intellectual honesty the least an historian of Mozambique should do is probe into the crimes, absurdities and mistakes of our socialist-era leaders. Not to do justice to colonialism, but to do justice to the thousands of mozambicans who died at their hands. That however is a chapter which does not figure in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Required Reference on Mozambique","review":"This book is packed full of great detail and insights into pre-colonial, colonial, and briefly post-colonialism. It is one of the best single volume history references on Mozambique. Remember it was published in 1995 so I disagree with the earlier review about Newit blaming all the country's evils on the Portuguese and colonialism and forgetting errors of the Frelimo regime in the aftermath of independence in 1975. There is always a challenge in writing \\"modern history\\" so this criticism about the lack of attention to more recent events is inevitable. The real strength of this book is in how it transcends centuries of Mozambican history to identify and highlight key trends and themes and how they impact the past, present, and future. Understanding this aspect of history provides an excellent basis for understanding more recent events and current challenges."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious","review":"This book is so pretentious I found it hard to believe anyone would publish it.

I followed all of the instructions, mixed the product well, and left it on for the correct amount of time. There is no reason this should have happened.

The Two Towers was the most time-consuming of any game for set-up alone. Game play is COMPLETELY guided by the cards from which you draw every turn. This game can only be played once (maybe twice) after that, there will be little variation left in the outcome. The pieces (towers) themselves are made of a slightly thicker card stock with a myriad of tabs that must be assembled and disassembled every time the game is played due to the fact that they won't fit back in the box otherwise. This will cause excessive wear and tear on the pieces over time. We had very high hopes for this game after playing LOTR Risk, which we love! However, The Two Towers Board Game just isn't worth the time or money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun and Educational IF you have't see the movie","review":"A group of us have game night every week, and last week we tried this game.

It's about Tarzan's boyhood. Like I said, it's not too bad, but it's not very original either.This is one of disney's first so called \\"midquels\\" that later spawned nightmares Bambi 2 and Fox and the Hound 2. I know that some don't feel that way (especially about Bambi 2 apparently), but, if you ever ask those that do like them, the answer is usually that they would have preferred a real sequel.

That's just the way it is. Think of the money you spend on 35mm film, and then seperate processing. That's why Polaroid film costs more money.This Spectra takes sharp focused pics at all distances. It's a far cry from the old fixed focus, or manual focus Polaroid cameras. The minimum distance from the object is something like 2 feet, which means it can't focus too close, which is a shame, but Polaroid also makes the Spectra 1200FF which is a fixed wide-angle focus, so it has some macro features.Good camera, very versitile.

Diorama was a peak of potential, but this is by far the most comercial and polished I have ever heard this band. They don't have their angry young feeling anymore, and are hunkered down on just playing moderate rock and roll. It is almost as far of a departure as what Megadeth did with Risk, but I think silverchair pulled this off with a milder transition.This has a lot of synths on it, along with no real hard rock edge. Straight lines and Strange behavior are two better tracks, but this is still and album that i'm going to have to grow used to. Overall it is worthy of the four stars, because this album is just solid songs all the way through.

That said, I was quite let down by Young Modern. I can respect some experimentation, as was the case with \\"Neon Ballroom\\" and \\"Diorama\\" and was quite impressed. But, there are 3 tracks on the whole \\"Young Modern\\" CD that I actually like. I've loved the chair since \\"Tomorrow\\" first came out and really like \\"Neon Ballroom\\" and \\"Diorama\\", but this latest CD doesn't even sound like Silverchair. Half the songs I can't even tell what Daniel and Chris are playing behing the orchestra and strings on most songs. I've always loved Daniels lyrics, but those just aren't enough to keep my interest in \\"Young Modern\\". I'm all for a band growing and changing, to a point. But this drastic change is just too much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good!","review":"My other Silver Chair CD is Frogstomp, bought about a decade ago. That album like this one relys on one good song to promote the album while the rest of the cd has subpar music. I wasn't too impressed with frogstomp due to it only had maybe two songs I liked, and I am not at all impressed with this one because it only has the one song I like being played on the radio. Listening too it twice over is enough for me to say I should have just download their hit and borrowed the cd later on to see if I liked it.

Even the tracks with the orchestral arrangements are uninspired.Overall, their weakest album by a mile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dear God what happened?","review":"I've always LOVED the heavy, grunge side of silverchair. When Diorama came out it took me by surprise with the new sound and it was hard to get used to but after awhile I thought it was GREAT..definitely a more mature album. But Young Modern..? They've officially gone way too far. This album isn't just NOT GOOD, it's downright annoying most of the time. Straight Lines is just OK, not good..and the rest of this is utter garbage. It makes the new Hoobastank cd look good, and that was up until now the worst rock cd of the decade."},{"rating":"2","title":"Old fans shouldn't be surprised...","review":"Silverchair have been one of my favorite bands for years and I was eagerly anticipating this album. At first I had the same reaction I did with Diorama, didn't really care for it but it was a ok.But after a couple of listens I started to get it, and it showed the same process as the last couple of albums. Even in Freak Show you saw little hints at where Neon Ballroom would go, and Neon Ballroom showed where Diorama would end up.The jump from Diorama to Young Modern is probably one that will shock longtime fans, but it shouldn't. If you follow the progression from album to album it was pretty obvious that this was coming.

This is their worst work to date. Pretentious is the word that sums it all up. It's clearly Daniel trying too hard to impress, and instead he sounds like an idiot. I love a lot of experimental music and admire it when a band progresses but this is Daniel trying to be experimental and failing miserably. You could see Daniel progressively getting more and more over the top after each album, as he desperately tried to make a reputation for himself instead of being \\"remembered as the guys that put out that album with the frog on the cover\\". If Daniel let this go, I am sure he would make better music. And it gets worse. Their album cover that blatantly copies the work of the De Stijl. Diorama and actually any previous Silverchair album is far better. The songs are real. Even Frogstomp is better and that is saying something.

It is nothing more than a familiar name. If this album was released under a new name, nobody would buy it... BECAUSE IT IS GARBAGE.

The worst part is that this isn't even GOOD wimpy electronic teeny bopper pop music!!! Daniel's \\"bandmates\\", Ben and Chris, contribute about as much to this album as Daniel's guitar.

I was too old to appreciate the musical genious of Daniel Johns the first time this group was successful in America but thank goodness they have returned to the USA and I didn't miss the boat this time. In a age of lip synching, non instrument playing, non musical writing groups this band comes through and reminds me that every now and then the \\"real deal\\" still exists and boy are these guys it!

I have been a HUGE Silverchair fan since day 1. I still listen to their first 3 albums almost religiously. Their \\"Diorama\\" release marked their downfall [even though everyone seems to think that Diorama is a classic].I love seeing a band change and evolve, but this is just not the case for Silverchair. If you're looking for brilliance in musical advancement, look at Radiohead or the Deftones.I mean, tell me they don't sound like the Wallflowers or The Sleepy Jackson with this album! It literally hurts to see a band that I had the utmost respect for move in such a dissapointing and pathetic direction."},{"rating":"2","title":"more emphasis on piano and vocal melodies","review":"When Silverchair debuted here in the U.S., it was as if they were trying to become the second coming of Nirvana. With their latest album, it seems that the group is trying to be the second coming of The Beatles. Fortunately for them, they pull it off with great ease. Less guitars and more emphasis on piano and vocal melodies is what sets this album apart from the group's early beginnings. For those not in the know, Young Modern really begins where 2002's Diorama left off, and takes it to another level."},{"rating":"1","title":"eh...","review":"My least favorite Queers album. The Queers are probably my favorite pop-punk band and when they are at their best, they are a perfect middle-ground between the Ramones and The Beach Boys. This album has none of the charm, wit or fun of the Queers' other albums and crashes right over into crass, offensive, juvenile punk rock. It's angrier and darker than any album released prior or since, and angry and dark isn't something the queers do very well. As this is the first release following the death of long-time bandmate Hugh O'Neill, this is understandable, but it doesn't make me enjoy this album any more.\\"Beyond the Valley...\\" is the kind of record you would expect from unexceptional bands that think playing really fast and saying F**K a lot makes them punk.

Other than that it was an very enjoyable film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing...","review":"\\"Work with what you've got\\" I guess was the mantra during this one. I really expected this to be better. (Colin Firth? Minnie Driver? Mary Steenburgen? Please.) It's never a good indication of \\"good\\" when I can stop a movie umpteen times and do whatever I just thought of because \\"now seems like a good time.\\" What a shame. I wouldn't say this was a complete waste of time. It was interesting. Somewhat unbelievable, definitely, but interesting. And it got a little better as it went on. But not much. One very sweet 3 seconds and an actual moment warranting genuine laughter. I guess you can't expect everything to be stellar. This was quirky and a bit weird. But watch-able.

I was so excited to learn there was a Colin Firth romantic comedy that I had not seen. I have loved Colin since I first saw him in Pride and Prejudice in high school. (now my fav movie).This movie was such a disspointment. Heahter Grahm is just insipid in this role, and absoulutly does not fit with Colin's character. There were a few funny scenes, but in general the plot made no sense. Their was no explination for most of the events, and no reason for half of them. Skip this one and watch one of his better movies (I suggest a period peice"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hope Springs","review":"At first I didn't think I was going to enjoy the film, but it was very humorous. The cast was great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad bad bad movie","review":"Imagine you are trapped in the most boring day of your life, with Colin Firth and Minnie Driver and Heather Gram. This movie gives you a good idea what that day would be like. I got this because it looked good, but the story was pathetic. I couldn't under stand 1/2 the motivations for the characters. For instance, the night after meeting firth for the first time, Gram's character strips and jumps into bed with Firth. Um ok? Isn't Firth in Hope because of devistation over Driver? I guess men need only to go to the suburbs to find super easy women. Wow.Firth's character, if you can call it that, is so boring I couldn't imagine what any girl would see never mind 2 of them fighting over him.Stay clear of this clap trap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unexpected Gem","review":"This turned out to have been written by the author who wrote The Graduate. It is a funny movie and Colin Firth is great as always, Heather Graham was at times annoying and I kept thinking she's too young. Minnie Driver was ok and in an unexpected comic turn. However, Frank Collison and Mary Steenburgen absolutely steal the movie - they are so funny and their comic timing is impeccable. Even the man in my life laughed at some of the antics Firth & Graham got up to especially the driving scene. It's clever and very witty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid","review":"No plot. Meaningless. Silly. Embarrassing to watch. I have no idea why these actors wanted to be in this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Movie","review":"This movie is slow and boring considering the star power of the actors.

This was much slower-paced and more serious than I thought. But I did buy into the characters, and that goes a long way toward the making of a good movie. Can't give it five stars. It was a little plodding at times, but a solid movie. Just don't go into it looking for belly laughs like other romance movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away from this movie","review":"Do not waste your money in this movie. The story is flawless, there is no chemistry between the main characters and their acting is terrible. There are gaps in the story and the viewer just can not find any interest in any character main or secondary. Minnie Driver's acting is decent but she can not save the movie by her own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utterly boring, pointless movie","review":"I recently rented this DVD, assuming that with Colin Firth and Minnie Driver, it must be good. I wondered why I had never heard of it, and now, after watching it, I know why: it's terrible. It's incredibly boring and full of cliches. The characters are unremarkable, and I didn't care enough about any of them to be at all entertained by this worthless waste of my time. Don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"A poor movie ...","review":"I like Colin Firth and Minnie Driver .... in other movies.

Watch something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"An awful movie.","review":"Like many others who have reviewed this movie, I can say that I am a huge fan of Colin Firth and Minnie Driver. Why they are in this poorly written, poorly edited movie is beyond me. Heather Graham is perfectly cast for this B movie; her acting abilities are on a par with the rest of what is going on here.The characters are flat, many of them are just poor characterizations (Mary Steenburgen is just embarassing as the hotel manager with the fake Maine accent....painful to watch.) and they are all unbelievable.I watched it all the way through and wished I hadn't.Save your money and get this one out of the library if you have to try it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!","review":"This film was incredibly painful to watch. Boring, boring, boring. The storyline was ridiculous and the acting was contrived and terrible. What a waste!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazingly bad--- don't buy it, don't even rent it!","review":"This film is unwatchable-- and the only question is what talented actors like Colin Firth and Minnie Driver are doing in this insipid hack job.When it comes to dialogue, not a single word rings true. None of the characters make any sense at all. They are reading lines and getting into situations that are so dull, and so ridiculously unbelievable, that one wonders if the film were written by a group of typing monkeys who happened to hit letters that formed words, rather than a cognizant human being.We couldn't get through it, as it was clearly outside the realm of possibility that the clueless writer-director could ever have his characters do anything that anyone else on the planet would care about. I see that view validated by the other reviewers with more persistence who watched this thing until the end.It's amazing he ever got funding for this ultimate turkey!"},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible","review":"Going into the movie, I expected more than I received. I like Colin Firth and Minnie Driver, but they seemed miscast along side Heather Graham. Nothing really fit with this movie. The storyline was lame; Heather's character did not make sense, nor was she any good; there were too many holes in the storyline. Those are only a few of the problems. This movie was just plain awful. One of the worst I have ever seen. Save yourself the anguish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this some kind of a joke? Romantic Comedy my foot!!","review":"My Gosh! the movie is bad - I mean really bad! The lead female role is someone you would want to run from. All through the film she jumps up and down like five year olds. She reminds me of the heroins of badly written, cheap romantic paperbacks. Ugh! And, what were those innocent - non-innocent clothes shedding?! She is an ideal example of \\"how to loose a guy in 10 (read one) day\\". The less said about the second lead - Minnie Driver the better.Colin Firth - I implore you to choose better next time - you are worth better."},{"rating":"1","title":"colin stop doing american films!","review":"Massive Colin fan but he needs to stop doing american films. They are ruining him as an actor and he deserves better than the junk they throw out. The movie was horrible. I was so bored. Don't waste $4 on rental - don't waste 50 cents at a yeard sale. it's garbage. He looked hot as usually but I can't sit through a bad movie even if it stars Colin. Colin please stick to real cinema, to smart cinema, to british cinema........or anything not american. Same with Minnie Driver, she's too good for them as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was that?","review":"Oh dear Lord this is bad. Everyone but Heather Graham is mediocre, and she's terrible. I am fully able to suspend my disbelief in order to enjoy a movie but this train wreck didn't let me. It was ominously awkward from minute one. I'd recommend another film instead but thinking about this one has left me tired. I must lie down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth renting","review":"I honestly believe this is one of the worst movie that I have ever seen. It is not worth seeing or renting.

I found all the leads appealing and convincing, and the character actors delightful. If you'd like to watch something light, cheering and well acted, I'd recommend this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hope Springs","review":"I saw this movie when I was on a 11 hour plane trip and this was one of the only two things worth watching. I liked it a lot, it had many cute lines and I was able to watch it twice in a row. I don't know if it would be so good in a diferant setting, and clearly many people didn't like it, but I think that it's worth seeing. If it helps anyone I am female and 18 y/o."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste!","review":"I needed a \\"feel good\\" film tonight. This one triggered a number of emotions but \\"good\\" was not among them. Embarrassment. Impatience. Frustration. Disappointment. Anger. Boredom. Yes! This farcical romantic comedy was neither romantic nor comical. I never cracked a smile. Nevertheless, I was determined to endure it to the end - all the while hoping against \\"Hope\\" that the dashing Mr. Darcy would eventually make an appearance. He did not. Instead, this impostor develops a midlife mismatched infatuation with a ditz no where near his equal in gravitas. Even the conclusion is ponderously tedious. The next time I notice that 30 percent of the reviewers give a film just a single star, I'll save my time and my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"British dvd...can only be viewed on a 'Region Two\\" dvd player.","review":"The seller failed to mention that the dvd's he sells are British and can only be viewed on dvd players set to Region Two.

Remember when bands like Obituary did 2 great album, but then by their 3rd it was clear it was over? This is the case with Exhumed. Basically, this band is now trying to take themselves \\"serious\\" as musicians and that's not the point of this style of metal. Also, getting some hyped up \\"producer\\" does nothing for this band. Whatever happened to death metal bands wanting to play raw, dark, and ugly sounding music? Like Autopsy, early-Carcass, Impetigo, etc.? Does Exhumed think they are impressing people with a clean and totally digital sound? I'm embarassed to have ever been a fan of this band after this atrocity. Latest on the band is that they now only have 1 original member left. That's another sign it's over for this band..."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Coop's best","review":"Zipper Catches Skin was far better than many of the reviewers here seem to think. If you're stuck in the early 70's-or bust mentality of Cooper-fandom, then this album isn't for you. But ZCS is strong from beggining to end, with catchy tunes and interesting lyrics which at times border on the hilarious. \\"Adaptable\\", \\"I Like Girls\\", \\"Remarkably Insincere\\", all rock and stay in your head long after you listen to them, mainly because of the lyrics. This was the third of a strong trilogy of Alice's \\"80's\\" albums, the others being Flush the Fashion and Special Forces. All three, while they don't match most of his 70's albums, deliver the hard rock goods, while drifting away from Alice's horror personae in favour of Alice the stand-up comic. It works. The one weak moment for me is the painful Theme from the Class of 1984, \\"I am the Future\\", which should have tipped us off to what was to come- namely the dreadful DaDa album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thank Goodness He Got The Zipper Unstuck","review":"This is my least favorite Alice studio album. The early 80's albums defied the mainstream and it is a shame that albums like Dada and Special Forces were overlooked. However this in my opinion is a poor effort. Listen to stuff like No Bologna Homosapiens and you'll see what I mean. The album goes all over the place and just can't seem to decide what it wants to be. If you are purchasing the early 80's albums buy this one last."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best CD I have ever heard","review":"Zipper Catches Skin is my biggest guilty pleasure ever! I can listen to it at anytime, well unless other people are around who just don't understand the album. If you're familiar with 70s Cooper and maybe 90s and onward, you have got to check this out because you will have no idea what Alice Cooper was thinking but you will find yourself loving the tunes! Zorro's Ascent, I Like Girls, That Was the Day My Dead Returned to Save My Life... all hysterically funny and damn catchy!The album even spawned the greatest swear phrase ever... \\"Boink Off!\\" Yes it's actually used on the album and how no one laughed on the recording is beyond me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"NO BALONEY, THIS ALBUM IS BRILLIANT!","review":"This is one heck of a cd! It's Funny and excellent at the same time.Here is a review for each track.1. Zorro's Acsent - Great Music & Lyrics 5/52. Make That Money - Great Song 5/53. I am the future - One of the more synesizer tracks but still great. 5/54. NO BALONEY HOMOSAPIENS - Easily the best track on this cd! I don't know why everone sais it's bad. But it's got the best lyrics and music on the whole album!!! 7/55. Adaptable - Another great song 5/56. I Like Girls - A funny song 4/57. Remarkably insincere - Good Lyrics 4/58. Tag Your It - Another Brilliant Song. 5/59. I Better Be Good - Good Alice Lyris. But I'm not really a fan of the 80s back ground vocals. 3/510. I'm Alive - Another very funny song 4/5Overall Highly Recomended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Welcome to his nightmare","review":"I have a vynil copy of that album, and won't buy the CD, cause there are much better options to waste money! \\"Zipper\\" is a strange album of an artist that was a great star during the early-mid 70's, but during the Disco and the \\"New wave\\", turned to be irrelevant. His worst album \\"Lace and whiskey\\" and \\"Zipper\\" are strange experiences to make a come-back, but he had to wait few more years. \\"Zipper\\" reminds us sometimes the classic Alice of \\"Love it to death\\", \\"School's out\\" etc., but it's far from being on the same level."},{"rating":"1","title":"The real Trash","review":"This is easily the stupidest and worst album that Alice Cooper would ever release, and that's against some real strong competition.

Alice appears to be going for humour again, and it fails on that level. The only even mildly amusing cut is 'Make That Money'. Such the-title-says-it-all tracks as 'No Baloney Homosapiens' and 'I'm Alive (That Was The Day My Dead Pet Returned To Save My Life)' will not make you laugh, at least not in the way Alice intended. There is the fine song 'I Am The Future' and a well- performed sendup of the slasher film genre 'Tag You're It', but nothing on this cd justifies buying it unless you're a Cooper diehard. For a far better look at his strange early '80's output try \\"DaDa\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bloody Quirky Mess","review":"Alice was far too lost by this point to make a comeback record, and it shows.

This book has all the Mowgli stories, plus other favourites like \\"Riki-Tiki-Tav\\", \\"Toomai of the Elephants\\", and many more. Reading these again affirmed my belief of Kipling's great skill as a storyteller. These stories had appeal for me when I was younger, but they have a different appeal for me now. Kipling's descriptions and characterizations are wonderful, and they put the reader right there in the jungle with Mowgli and Bagheera, and all Mowgli's other friends.

However, after time I've found that they just can't be used for all spices. Due to their inferior production, they are far from air tight.

The containers have a small pour spout that I use more often than the sprinkle holes as they are a bit too small for most dried herbs. The included labels are limited so, if you have a large collection of spices, you will need to create your own or buy a more extensive label set. I'm not sure why they bother to include same 6 spices in each package. They should leave those out and charge less money! Overall I would recommend this spice rack system for anyone who has a large number of spices to store and likes easy access."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I am totally about beauty AND function.

A must-have for all Nick Cave/Birthday Party/No-Wave enthusiasts."},{"rating":"2","title":"they'll never reunite so buy their albums and own some history","review":"rating 4.7/5ok. what you need to know. Nick cave was originally the lead singer from birthday party. he later went on to solo stardom, as well as acclaim with his band the bad seeds. this is one of the coolest albums of all time. nick and the rest of the party slam through songs with psychotic abandon while nicky boy shouts poetic maniacal stream of consciousness lyrics describing venomous acts of spite and mayhem. this is one of the best \\"art punk\\" albums of all time. if you think you might like it then you will. get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"I bought this for my 3 year old nephew for Christmas, so he hasn't had a chance to use it yet. But my 28 year old boyfriend insisted we open it to make sure it worked. He played with it for about 3 hours.... :o) Highly recommended for mom's or significant others who need some peace and quiet to get a few things done! :o)"},{"rating":"1","title":"It did not engage my 5 year-old","review":"Dispite the excellent reviews of this toy (which I gave my son for Christmas), it did not raise the slightest bit of interest from my son. Once I received the Leap Pad and saw his reaction to it, I figured out why. Essentially, this toy does the same thing as any number of learning-oriented CD-Roms such as Reader Rabbit, etc. However, it is ultimately a lot les interactive and exciting than the computer. Therein lies my son's lack of interest. Compared to the computer, the Leap Pad is clunky and less fun to use. Maybe I'll take it with us on vacation and see if it interests him once we're away from the computer, but if you have a computer at home and your child has some reading oriented CD-Roms, I'd save my money on this and buy another toy instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a piece of JUNK","review":"I rated this item a 1 because that is the lowest rating available. It should be ZERO. I bought the LeapPad for my grandson and could never get it to work properly. When I could get it to turn on all it would do is throw out words a random and make a krackaling sound when we moved the pen. After changing the batterys and cleaning the contacts with alcohol as sugested in the instructions it worked for about a minute, reading half a page then jumping back to the start instructions. At the price (I spent almost $100.00 on the pad and extra books) they charge for this item this is uncalled for. VERY DISAPOINTED after reading the reviews of others. This piece of crap is going back to the store in the morning!!I had a very sad little boy on his 4th birthday.DON'T BUY THIS PIECE OF JUNK!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Learning","review":"Purchase this product and your child can learn to read without Parents. Thats right, give this to your child and then you can no longer be apart of their childhood memories. Buy a book from Amazon and read it to your kids at night, during the day, on your lunch break.....read together. LeapFrog is creating new ways to isolate the child and create a lonely environment with an animated voice. Don't buy this with the notion your child will pronouce their words better, or make reading fun. You make reading fun, the parents. Its just a fancy toy not a tool."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was disappointed","review":"My mother bought this system for my 3 yr old . I we have had problems since . The voice sometimes doesn't come on or it just makes a humming noise . So I finally threw it out. I will never buy another leappad product again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Toooo sloooowww for my boy","review":"My boy has the attention span of a 4 year old. Why? Because he is 4 years old. He has no patience for the slow pace of age-appropriate leap pad materials. The learning games are too short, too slow, and too repetitive for him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck. Please. Buy some books instead.","review":"Played with this at a neighbor's house. The ads promote it as portable...please! It weighs three pounds! It's uncomfortable to have on your lap. It can only \\"read\\" a few select stories, unlike the million-and-one stories an actual live human can read to a child. As for \\"teaching at the child's pace,\\" that's something a good teacher will do, at school (or home-school) when the child is developmentally ready. Where will this glitzy toy be in a few years? In a cardboard box, in the basement. Buy a nice copy of Good-Night Moon; that'll still be around for your grandkids.As for the [money] you'll spend...well, a library card is free. Cuddle the little one on your lap, and read, and read, and read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"How do I rate the service","review":"My dauther loves Leappad toys. They no longer sale Leap Pad Learning system so I bought it via you. When the toy came, it was on a box without any pacaking to protect the toy. Also it was dirty( had brown stain on it, so I had to clean it before using. After three and half week of use it started to have problem with the sound. We change the batteries but it is still acting up. This is the first time I had problems with Leappad products. I would never buy any futere product from this vender?saler. Very dissapointed"},{"rating":"2","title":"My kindergartener loves Leap Pad","review":"We have Leap Pad for our kindergartener. I was very concerned that Texas kindergarteners are not pushed to read so I purchased the Leap Pad, the Reader Rabbit complete reading system and the Scholastic phonics book system. However, the Leap Pad is my daughter's favorite. She loves to take Leap Pad with her in the car, to babysitters, etc. She can't do this with her computer programs. Leap Pad keeps her attention. And, she can do it all by herself, not like the computer programs where I need to help her. Leap Pad comes with one book. There are other books that can be purchased. There is a series by Richard Scarry and another series by Whoopi Goldberg. There is also a Pooh book. You and your child will not be disappointed with the Leap Pad. It is an exceptional educational toy. I highly recommend this toy for children in Pre-K to about 3rd grade."},{"rating":"2","title":"this one is a real keeper!","review":"For my money, this should be toy of the year. Don't shy away from it if you have younger kids -- my 4 year old LOVES it and has memorized lots of the information already that comes in the standard book (the states, instruments, etc....). It's really cool! Plus, it's very portable, great for the car, great to teach reading and just neat. I think it's fun to play with too. As your child gets older, you can buy more advanced books and your child can use the magic pen to sound out difficult words. For younger kids, they'll want to point at everything. I bought the leap frog PRO at my local store which is the best platform to get if you're going to buy several books. It comes with The Secret Garden which is a bit too advanced for age 4. I'm about to buy more books. Makes a great educational gift."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great education in ... frustration!","review":"We will not buy any more Leap products unless they improve their products and their treatment of customers. My kids love the my first leap pads and the regular leap pad and want the new Leapster but I refuse to invest more money. We only allow these pads to be used while sitting next to an adult on the sofa, but we've still encountered numerous problems with the pen/stylus, cartridges \\"wearing\\" out, etc. The company doesn't want to fix or replace anything so you're stuck with whatever you spent. I would love to see a system that uses mini discs or some other data source that doesn't stick out of the system and uses complete touch screen or game pad technology. Since nothing else really has the great educational software, we'll be sticking to the computer and getting a game boy for entertainment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Leappad for under two years","review":"I purchased this for my grandson, 20 months old. Even though he needs help with it, he enjoys it enough to ask to play with it. His skill level in handling the pointer has increased rapidly. The level one materials are not too advanced for him. I bought this for him because he loves books. I would definitely recommend this for younger children if a parent can supervise or play along with them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Durability is poor","review":"While the educational value of this toy is OK, the durability of the pens is so poor that the product is not worth buying. If the pen breaks after 90 days, you have to buy a new one (only a few dollars but still). Many people are frustrated and do not understand why their leappad is acting strange, well it is probably the pen."},{"rating":"2","title":"3 years and still going!","review":"My daughter received a leap pad for christmas when she was 4 years old. She is 7 1/2, and she still uses it. I just keep buy new books, 2 or 3 a year. She loves it. I am impressed that the company continue to support the orginal leap pad with the newer books and the more advanced format books. We also have a leaplink for a turbo twist and hope they will continue to support it also. Great products, very durable. She also used the writing desk and phonics desk for 2 years. Now her cousin ( 16 months) is already showing interest in them."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Educational Toy","review":"I purchased this Leappad for my daughter a few weeks ago because her teacher said she was having problems with her phonics sounds. I am glad she recommended this to me. Not only did my daughter learn her phonic sounds quickly, she is learning to sound out letters in words she doesn't know. I have no regrets about buying this for her. I would recommend this to anyone with a small child."},{"rating":"2","title":"Leap Pad is great!","review":"My daughter loves this toy/learning device. She thinks its a toy, but I know better! It's great... there are so many different books you can choose from. One of her favorites of course is the Disney Princess Book. We are planning on buying more of these books from Santa for her for Christmas. This is a great toy, and I prefer this over the new writing one. Plus, I've only seen 2 books for that one advertised."},{"rating":"2","title":"My grandkids love it.","review":"I bought one for each of my grandkids and they love playing with it. It is very useful and has increased their level of learning quite a bit.I can not recommend this highly enough. A good variety of programs will eliminate any boredom.It is nice to have something that is fun and educational as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Non-durable toy is worthless","review":"A toy is worthless when it is poorly designed and not durable. My son got this toy six months ago. Although, he has not played roughly with this toy, it no long works properly because of the pen's broken cord. If my child cannot play with the toy, it has no educational or fun value. As other raters have pointed out the stylus pen's cord easily breaks. Leap Frog and the stores that carry it should stop selling this product until the design is fixed. Apparently the pen's cord breaking is so common that replacing it is on the Leap Frog's FAQ list and also a main item on their telephone system menu. After investing in buying many of the Leap Pad books, it is hard to believe that the toy breaks so easily."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't last very well","review":"It's a reasonably educational toy, but be careful because it will break quickly... and if it does, you only have a 3 month grace period! We used it carefully and it still started working erratically after only about 6 months... that's $15/month! What a waste."},{"rating":"2","title":"Did you know all 50 states when you were 4?","review":"My son Kaha'o recieved his leap pad for Christmas this past year and absolutely loves it! In fact, the only book he has is the book that came with the leap pad and he's still learning new things everyday and never tires of it. He's already learned the 50 states and he's only 4 years old! He is beating his aunts, uncles and cousins with the \\"find the state game\\". Now he's learning the state capitols and doing well at it. the USA only takes up 2 pages in his leap pad book....the rest of the book is filled with subjects such as music, phonics, reading, foreign languages, etc. my son knows how to say play the computer in 4 different languages. imagine the possibilities! I definitely recommend the leap pad."},{"rating":"2","title":"leappad - leapfrog","review":"My six year old received this as a christmas gift in 2000. He enjoys it very much because he can use it on his own most of the time and its always there for him when he is bored. My son has composition, math, science, music and game books with characters he's fimilar with. So far ten altogether, and all with a main focus on reading. He can get fustrated with at times but, when he finally does get it he wants to keep going at it even longer. Sometimes he can spend more than an hour on one book because they are all back with so many little suprises and games to play. If you have a kid that can't read or doesn't like to read the Leappad is worth the money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Read your child a book instead","review":"Over the last few years, these Leap Pads have come in and out of my house via various garage sales, gifts, etc.. The kids play with them for a very short time, then tire of them, and off they go to Goodwill.So my kids like them for like a day, and that's it. It's just another electronic toy. The little cartridges get lost very easily and then you're stuck with books that won't work.My kids will cuddle up with me and a book everyday, for long periods of time. That's what little kids books are about: bonding with those who love you while learning. Read you child a book instead of plopping them in front of this thing. Teach them the words with your fingers and your voice, not a stylus and a computerized talking box.We don't need batteries to teach our kids to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for my son with Autism","review":"My sons have autism, this product is conducive to their learning to read fluently. The only down side is that the stylus is sensitive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumb Down","review":"Just know if you buy this that if the game cartridge reads 6 to 9 yearsit should really read 3 to 5 years. My 7 year old found them in her own words to be to \\" to babyish \\" I would say she is an average 7 year old child. Games and pad 200 dollars wasted. Not for kids over 5.Also customer is worse than a joke."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great product but major quality overhaul required","review":"I have now purchased three separate models. My 5 yr old son absolutely adores this toy. He calls it his \\"Computer\\" and I was really impressed that he began playing the spelling/decoding game and actually learning how to spell. After a month of the first one, the product failed to turn on. We bought new batteries, followed the trouble shooting directions to no avail. So, we ordered a new model. This one didn't even work the first time we tried to turn it on. We sent that one back and ordered another one. Again, product failed to work on start up. It's a real shame. I would have given this 5 stars if only I thought I could count on the thing to actually work!"},{"rating":"2","title":"replacement stylus","review":"My daughter loves her leap pad. We had to buy a new pen. You can order them at leapfrog.com, look under find an answer. They have and order form you can print and mail to them.

Still better than buying a new leap pad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy Mom","review":"This is the best money ever spent on a toy.

She learned the states of US in a weeks time without anybody's supervision. The toy is amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth the money","review":"I bought one when they first came out, My three kids loved it. They fought over it, dropped it,stood on it, threw it and it outlasted many other toys.The last game of tug a war did it in. Yes it did break but, after a couple years of hard use. I just purchused three more for christmas, two leap pads and a quantum leap pad. That way they can not fight over them. I homeschool and it has been a useful tool in their educational learning. Well worth the money. I do not buy many toys, This is the first time I have ever bought three of something. My oldest is ADHD and it really holds his attention. My 3 and 5 year old love it so much there was no way I could buy the my first leap pad, I even was able to get then in diffrent colors so they know which is theirs. Best money I have spent. highly recommanded!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Leap pad is a good buy","review":"I bought this toy last year for my 2year old daughter, I wanted to get this version so she could grow into it. She never really got interested in it the first year, so I thought it was going to be a waste, BUT recently she has been using it everyday, the only toy in the house with so much recent use. We only had the book it came with since I didn't want to get more until she actually could use it. But now I have bought another book and the other day I caught her singing along with the songs, she is still too young for some of the concepts but she sits with it for long periods of time. It is very durable, it has been thrown around alot and been carried around by the pencil string, and no problems never broken. The batteries last a really long time and the volume is just right. I wish the books didn't cost so much, but there is a good selection. Overall this book has turned out to be worth the money I would recommend it. I have other Leap Pad products and I like those too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!!!","review":"I purchased this toy for my kids 4 years ago.

You get soooo much for your money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the best investment","review":"I would have to agree with many others on the pen issue. If you have little ones at home-- forget it, if they get a hold of that pen-it'll mess it up. The pen is very sensitive. We are on our third one. I wish I would of known about the problems before buying it. The LeapPad will keep interest for a while, but once they've discovered everything in the book, it's old news--for 15 bucks a book, I'm not sure it's worth it. Also, the cartridges are also easy to misplace, because of their size. My advice--Stick to the old fashion books and computer games at the library!"},{"rating":"1","title":"My son has never cared much for this toy","review":"We bought this for my then 4 year old son last Christmas and he has barely looked at it. It will hold his attention for about 10 minutes and that's it. I've bought 2 additional books for it and I still get the same response. He is almost 5 and learning to read so perhaps that will change but for the \\"pre-reader\\" set, I'm not sure a regular leap pad is worth the money if you have a child that would rather play with trucks, lego's and the like instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"What about the PEN!","review":"Ths was a great toy. I purchased it when my daughter was 3 years old. It lasted for about 6 months before the pen stopped working regularly. Now we have about 100 dollars worth of game books.

I won't buy another leap product."},{"rating":"2","title":"From a teacher","review":"...My daughter (in Kindergarten) wouldn't put it down that day and plays with it constantly. Upon going to a Teddy Bear clinic, the Nurse running the clinic held up an x-ray of the head and asked if anyone knew what it was.

The United States map is teaching her where certain states are; of course when she hits Washington, D.C. she says \\"that's where all the bad people are.\\" But you take the good with the bad!

Not realizing that they do not work w/ my daughters system. They are for the \\"my first leap pad\\" system. Selling online for $145.00. You have to really watch what is suggested by amazon on the toys you sell. What is suggested does not always work. At christmas time, it is hard to know what works and what does not sometimes. I recommend they add model numbers to thier items to know what will work with what, not just the name."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the toy, not real sure of durability","review":"My 4 year old received this for a birthday gift and loves it. She plays every day with it for at least 30 minutes. It is now 5 months old and started acting erradically. I changed the batteries and cleaned the battery compartment as instucted by leap pad staff. It still didn't work. On the second call to Leap pad the staff listened to what it was doing and said that the pen was bad. And, of course, out of warranty. They are sending a replacement pen, this time free, but a warranty on a toy this expensive should last longer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kid Friendly","review":"This Learning SystemLeapFrog LeapPad Learning Systemmakes the perfect gift. It has provided hours and hours of enjoyment. The books are age appropriate, not too easy but not too hard. It is very user friendly. A child can make his/her way through the books with little or no adult supervision. The book format is not cumbersome or awkward, making it easy to follow and understand. It can be purchased with or without a carrying bag, which is big enough to hold the system and several game books. The entire system is sturdy and will hold up under lots of kid use. I definitely recommend the Learning System."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"My daughter got this toy for her 4th birthday, she's thrilled with it and continuously finding new ways to learn.

She is in 1st grade and was behind in reading. She would get so discouraged when she couldn't finish a book. With LeapPad if she got stuck it helped her to sound out words. She is so proud of herself. It is also very durable it has been left in rain, her little brother has dropped it a couple of times, and it still works like new.

The comes with the leappad is a sample book you have to buy another book and make sure you get in the correct leap zone otherwise it will be frustrating to the child. I ended up driving to the store and buying another book since the sample was not age appropriate. Overall this is a great toy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Save your receipt","review":"While this toy is high in educational value the durability is poor. I have two of these for my kids and have had to return 3 of them, two the pens went bad and one would not read the cartridges for the books.

Even with these negatives they still work well as a learning tool for children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dissappointed with the durablility","review":"When we first bought the toy, it came with a bent book which the company did replace. The toy was used supervised by adults as a family interaction game. It now stutters, and the pen does not work. I did what Leap Frog said to do and it still did not fix the problem. I'm very dissappointed.

I have two girls ages 4 and 8. They both will sit and play with the leap pad alone for at least a half hour. I have fun playing along with them, too. The cartridges are easy enough for a very small child to put in. It is also great in the car as there is a headphone jack that the kids think is neat. (so do I!)The books can be hard to find,(because they sell quickly) but they are inexpensive and there is so much to do in each book that it will be some time before you need to buy another.It shuts off automatically after being idle for a short while, so there is no concern of wearing down batteries. The leap pad is really the perfect toy."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best toy ever","review":"I have a boy who just turned five and has been using my computer almost with no help for well over a year. I spent many hours looking for that educational and yet fun toy for his 5th birthday. He has many educational programs with no appeal so they don't get much use. I found the LeapPad at some friend's house and I knew my search was over. I...purchased the LeapPad, backpack and all the books available. My son hasn't stop playing with it since he got it.

If it would just work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the Money","review":"The Leap Pad is a great gift for a variety of ages. You can buy books at different age, interests, and ability levels, so a child won't outgrow this toy. It's very portable and handy to take in the car.

It says 4 to 10, but he does great with the \\"Leap Start\\" books. The only problem I forsee is him taking care of the books. They can tear easily. I keep the books in a safe place and only mommy or daddy can change out the books and we supervise his playing to make sure he doesn't tear the pages. Also, if you buy it, be sure to buy a couple of books. The one that comes with it is just a demo book. Thank goodness grandma bought a couple of books for him or we would of had to make a mad dash to the store!! Overall, this is one of the best toys I've ever bought my son!

Does anyone know if that's replaceable?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Caution! Boring story!","review":"The concept of Leap Pad is wonderful. I like the interactive nature of the reading, where the child can control pace and focus. BUT the STORY is BORING and very strange, language-wise. Because the writer has limited herself to a very controlled vocabulary selection, using only limited vowel combinations, the language sounds very contrived. For example, instead of saying \\"My tooth is loose,\\" the story says, \\"it TIPS\\"! Whoever talks about a tooth TIPPING? Given that the child can listen to the story over and over again, controlling the vocabulary that way isn't necessary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never got past putting batteries in!","review":"After the second Leap Pad I've purchased (the previous one I had to return to the store yesterday) that is broken and doesn't work, I've decided that this is NOT the toy for my child. We didn't even get past putting the batteries in!The first one's battery compartment screw and bolt were broken, so the compartment wouldn't stay closed. Hence, I took that one back yesterday and exchanged it for another. The second one worked okay for about five minutes after I turned it on for the first time, but the second time I tried turning on the machine, it wouldn't work, no matter what I tried. BACK TO THE STORE with this one, too! Very frustrating!! Would've been a wonderful toy for my child, who loves books and would've been delighted with one that is interactive. But I cannot imagine that a toy that's this unstable would last for very long with a small child.I'm on the lookout for something similar, but certainly from a different manufacturer..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad","review":"My son loved his LeapPad. When it conked out for the second time we decided to purchase another one, thinking the first two times were a fluke. Just because he chewed the cord on the first one, and the second one just went haywire. Well, we hadn't had the third one for more than one week and it started to act up. So now his LeapPad doesn't work anymore. What a waste of money! And it's just so sad for my son. We have all kinds of games for it that are just going to sit in his closet and take up room. I didn't want to believe the previous reviews, but I can't deny them now! When it did work, it was fantastic! My son could be on it for hours and he did absorb the things that the LeapPad was teaching. Plus it's done in a fun, interactive way. So I rated it fairly high for the educational and fun values, and quite low for the durability. Overall, it's not a great product."},{"rating":"2","title":"A toy to grow with","review":"This is a great toy for any curious child. The leappad grows with your child so it will last for a few years unlike many toys they grow out of in a few months. It still holds my son's interest after a year.

She now has 8 books and we just bought the Midnstation to go with it. It is a wonderful toy. After a Year, she still plays with it all the time, and it very excited to get a new book. She loves to hear the stories read to her, and loves to play the games. This toy teaches her math, reading, spelling, and many other subjects. Educational Toys that are actually fun are hard to find. This one is definitely 5 stars.This toy has also been dropped from the top of a bunk bed, and the cord has been slammed between the sides of it many times, and it keeps working. This also gets five stars for durability."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Scam","review":"It should be rated \\"zero stars.\\" Like the rest of the people here who hate this product, my son's LeapPad worked just long enough for the warranty to expire and for me to stock up on books. My son was very careful with the toy. Even a new \\"pen\\" could not save it. Customer \\"service\\" (HA!) was rude, and implied that my son broke it. The people at Leap Frog products ought to be ashamed of themselves!There is only one guarantee with a Leap Pad -9 out of 10 people who wrote its positive reviews will change their minds in a year or two, when their Leap Pad dies and Leap Frog blames them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yeah Leappad","review":"Anything Leappad is great .

The book (worth roughly [...] of the purchase) uses a British accent. It is very hard to understand if you're American and is useless to a young child trying to learn phonics. Amazon will not let you exchange the product because it comes from an independent seller. (Although this product is eligible for Prime shipping, it doesn't come from Amazon.)Beyond that headache, the LeapPad is also a poor piece of technology. To answer questions, you must be fairly exact with the pen and press hard. If you don't do this quickly, the LeapPad ends the game, which is frustrating for a child. I'm not sure why everyone raves about this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken toys are not fun","review":"I purchased this for my child who has problems with fine motor skills. It turned out to be too much for her at the time (Christmas 2003) so I put it in the closet for later. When I took it out in the Fall of 2004 it no longer worked. (It made sounds like an electronic babbling brook)This toy had been used two or three times. I spent forever online at their web site trying to find a way to get help, scrolled through hundreds upon hundreds of trouble shooting questions and answers, followed the directions to email my question/problem to them, and never heard back. Needless to say, had the warranty been for one year, it ran out while I waited for them to get back to me. Good product or not, the customer service fell short.

They trade books and have a great time. The cartridges can be hard for them to change - if you don't get them in just right, the leappad doesn't recognize it. In order to make sure the right cartridge stays with the right book, I taped a small baggie to the backside of the books. The kids know to put the cartridges away before moving to a new book.

To my disappointment, you would see only the etheric aura and not the shell - besides that you wouldn't be able to see the colors - just plain energy field. I'm using the traditional way to teach others how to view Auras. Training the peripheral vision, then the viewing. But all this takes practice, practice, and practice.

There was no way to differentiate which restaurant or which lodging I might like better. One was the most beautiful, one the prettiest, one the loveliest. The author seemed to like rustic a lot which is not necessarily a compliment in my book. The restaurants were all a foodie's dream. He also devoted way to much space to wineries.

As I went through this book I saw that this author's idea of \\"luxury\\" is very formal and stiff which (to me) is not \\"luxurious\\" at all.

And no one signed a name to it which makes me believe it's fake. I just wrote a review of this. We tested this book at a gathering of affluent suburban Chicago women, and we agreed that it didn't show the kind of comfort we all want right now. We are not into junk furniture or beat up furniture but into rooms that look welcoming and relaxing vs. formal and stiff.

We usually set one topic for discussion over wine and snacks (men, fashion, movies, books, and stuff like that). This time, we decided to talk about decorating, so we brought in magazines and books. One neighbor brought this book and passed it around and that's when the chuckles began. It started with the funny cover of the \\"luxurious\\" room with the one round seat in it. From there, we laughed over a lot of the rooms that are so uncomfortable or \\"stiff\\" looking . We decided to rename this book \\"Funeral Parlor Design\\" or \\"Decorating for the Old Folks Home.\\" It definitely isn't about the comfort my friends and I crave."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective Product","review":"Unfortunately the bench we received was defective, in that the drill wholes of the seating area did not match up with the drill wholes of one of the legs.

The only downside is the length of this disc, but other than that this cd is a gem. It was the follow up to Blackheart Man, and is often overlooked in great reggae records but it belongs there with the classics. A must have for any serious reggae collector.

Alegre had already become a division of the Tico/Roulette label. Accompanied by a recording studio musical ensemble under the name of \\"Sonora Alegre\\",Celio recorded 12 gems which would immediately become a best seller on vynil Lp format. Unfortunately,as the vynil Lp era ended around 1990, it took away many releases to the shelves, among them \\"El Celio de Siempre\\". Fortunately about two years ago, Tico, now and for quite some time, a division of Fania, decided to re-issue \\"El Celio de Siempre-Celio Gonzalez\\" on CD format. \\"La Primera Piedra\\", \\"El Rosario de Mi Madre\\",\\"La Muralla\\"(my favorite),\\"Antes Que Tu\\",\\"Sale A Buscar\\",\\"Pirata\\",\\"Negra\\", \\"Sonrisa Na'Ma\\",\\"Tremendo Lio\\",\\"Psicologia\\",\\"Mentira\\",\\"Abusas De Mi\\", are all unforgettable and superbly recorded by veteran recording engineer Irv Greenbaum.

It really doesn't sound like Manchester at all. I was very surprised because I like Mr. Manchester.I kept reading and turning each page expecting the book to begin in that shocking, startling, exciting Manchester way. It never happened.But nevertheless it was interesting to read as a typical Rockefeller bio. It contains the basics - nothing shocking or controversial. It is the same old same old.Compared to Manchester's later work this hardly seem to be the same author.Richard Edward Noble - The Hobo Philosopher - Author of:America On Strike - Labor History"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless","review":"Yet another attempt to recreate the runes in an author's own image. On top of this it includes the author's own pessimistic Christian bias in the meanings of the of the runes. He picks and chooses between the Anglo-Saxon and Elder Futharks for his meanings to suit his own bias. Not worth having except as a novelty. Not for the serious rune worker. Get the Power of the Runes Deck instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quite worth the asking price","review":"Even the current price of $0.01 doesn't make this a bargain. Save your pennies for something that is actually useful.Constraining runes to the faces of a cube completely changes the dynamics (getting 1 rune rules out the runes on the other faces). Also using the faces of dice does not fit at all well with the important 3x8 traditional ordering of the Futhark. At least the numbers (4 dice x 6 faces) prevent the addition of the spurious New-Age invention of the \\"blank rune\\". Apart from that, as a previous reviewer has commented above, the information provided is sloppy and heavily Christianized.There are plenty of books with some actual useful information on runes.Try these, and the books buyers also bought:Rudiments of RuneloreRunic Amulets and Magic ObjectsRunes (Reading the Past, Vol 4)"},{"rating":"1","title":"You've got to be kidding!","review":"Ms. Powell's work of fiction would more aptly be called \\"Sour Grapes\\".

Christoph's book Be Not Afraid is another shining example of what we need to do with our lives! It has been said that the only thing we need to fear is fear itself.

I was surprised by the reviews that the \\"surrender to Christ\\" aspect of this book was not emphasized; if you are not theistic in the sense of God intervening in your life, this book will be of little existential help. Let me tell you the plot: God and the belief in Jesus will sustain you in this life, and if you are imaginative enough, you can see God making people's lives better all the time, and hence, \\"why worry?\\" If you are reasonably convinced that consciousness as we now know it does not survive death and are looking for some insight to allay the fears that belief brings, you need not apply here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not helpful at all...","review":"I am very fearful of death and had hoped to find some tools for coping with such in this book.

I love Christian Bale, Winona Ryder, Susan Sarandon, Claire Danes, Gabriel Byrne, Trini Alvarado, and, yes, Kirsten Dunst. However, this movie is not completely true to the book, as no movies truly are. They completely left out the beautiful conversation between Marmee and Jo about their tempers, Amy had the turquoise ring before ever going to Aunt March, Amy wasn't transformed as in the novel but she continued to seem to be a selfish girl, the transformation in Meg wasn't shown, and there wasn't enough of Beth!

This movie is an insult to Louisa May Alcott. The story does not even follow the book, the acting is terrible, the casting is terrible, and the character study is non-existent. I won't even add this to my collection, and I have no one I would want to give this to. It's just that bad. Pathetic, absurd, boring and emotionless. Avoid it."},{"rating":"1","title":"blah","review":"if one was to compare katharine hepburn to winona ryder, the results would be obvious. the book isn't supposed to be a feminist account, it's supposed to be a civil war tale of a family. since it's so modern, and the acting and even the colors are modern, we never feel the full experience, or that we are in the 1800's. In the 1933 version we feel a part of the family. This is less than inspiring. how clare danes became Beth, i'll never know, what Kirsten dunst is doing here is a mystery. Although SUsan Sarandon is fine, she is the best thing in here, but nowhere near spring bryington. Christian bale is too dreamy, and his and winia'a chemisrty isn't right. it doesn't follow the book, and the cast is miscast. I don't recommend, instead watch the beautifully done 1933 CLASSIC, or even the 1949 one with June Allyson and Margaret O'brien. Skip this."},{"rating":"2","title":"New take on old classic","review":"A brilliant cast (just look at the cover) coming alive in lushly filmed settings wrapped around an old favorite make this a success. The only reason I give it four instead of five stars is its puzzling modernized philosophies, which were not in the book and serve as somewhat preachy distractions.Other than this, the movie remains faithful to the book in a rare, loving way. The first-rate cast adds depth and feeling to their roles. Each of the characters we wanted to emulate or lose our hearts to, as children who loved the book, comes fully alive here, imperfections and all.Will you need hankies? Yes, for many reasons. This is a movie to curl up with and watch over again. And I do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Classic!","review":"The book is good but I really enjoyed this version of the movie.

Susan Sarandon is flawless as Marmie, and Winona Ryder is an excellent Jo. Gabriel Byrne is perfect as the professor. The period settings and costumes are authentic (I'm a history teacher) without romanticizing days gone by. Best of all is the film's feminist sensibility. Some have criticized this as a modern overlay on a book from another era, but Louisa May Alcott was very much a feminist; in the Victorian world for which she wrote, it was necessary to soft-pedal her ideas. The film brings them to center stage."},{"rating":"2","title":"great movie","review":"I like to watch this whenever in a sentimental mood...plus the acting is superb. Don't miss it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Little Women","review":"Little Women is one of my favorite books so I was skeptical about the movie. How could anyone possible convey all that is in the book in one short move? Well they can't. What they did instead was make the most of what time they had. The characters were real and I fell in love with them all over again. No movie can convey every thing in this book but this movie comes very close. I love to watch it over and over just like I love to read the book over and over."},{"rating":"2","title":"A REAL MOVIE","review":"This lovely Christmas-colored movie transports you with its knowing performances and hugely entertaining series of romantic adventures. There are melodramatic pitfalls, to be sure, but that is one of the pleasures of Alcott's original book, and certainly what makes it endlessly enjoyable. Susan Sarandon is fresh and vital as Marmie, a mother for the ages, and each child brings to her role a sharp, colorful portrayal that stays with you. Christian Bale is perfectly cast as Laurie -- there is not one performance that does not move you with precision and dignity. The score is lovely and delivers emotionally -- there are many, many moments in this film that earn tears, followed by warm smiles. This is one for everyone in the entire family."},{"rating":"1","title":"They shouldn't have named this movie \\"Little Women\\"...","review":"since no one connected with it could have possibly read the book. Where was boyish, clumsy, unwilling to grow up Jo? I HATED Winona Ryder's portrayal, more like a betrayal to the character. Let alone the ridiculous social commentary: Meg won't wear silk because of child laborers in China!!!! Everyone who read the book knows Meg LONGS for a silk gown. (...) It may have been an attractive film, although I was too busy seething to notice, but \\"Little Women\\" it was not. Don't let your kids see it, they'll never know what the heart of the book is. Terrible! If I could give it negative 5 stars, I would."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best musical scores ever!","review":"I have never read the book, OK? But the film has become one of our perrineal Christmas favorites. The movie is a visual feast of real, or simulated New England autumns and winters. The soundtrack is an orchestral treat that is rich and moving. Susan Sarandon does manage to inject Marmie with a certain self-righteous, leftist, feminist, scolding quality, but overall, wholesome family themes win out. Each time we watch this film, it's even better than we remembered it."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent dude!","review":"this movie is very good. it tells you the heartfelt story about 4 little girls who become women over time. watch this movie it'll blow your socks off!"},{"rating":"2","title":"my daughter had to watch it for a class!","review":"It was nice to be able to download it and watch it the night before the assignment was due!

I can't say enough about this movie except for that it's absolutely beautiful."},{"rating":"2","title":"An enjoyable little movie","review":"Hmmm ... this film develops its characters well and that's what makes it work for me. Characters MUST be devoloped in the majority of films, otherwise the film lacks substance. Clare Danes' crying when she receives her piano is some of the best. I didn't think she had it in her. Winona Ryder is very nice as the lead character, Jo, and the film's acting is without flaw by any of the players. On my four star scale this one gets a three and a half.

Little women is full of joy and sadness, and touched the hearts of me and my friends.There has never been a better version produced of Lousia May Alcott's masterpiece, and I am happy to say that this is a film to be watched over and over again. The characters are all played so realistically by the all-star cast line up and I feel that Winona Ryder's portrayal of Jo was fantastic. Claire Danes as Beth was fantastic, and Kirsten Dunst played a wonderful Amy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Movie","review":"The lovely sets and costumes make this a joy to watch. And though there are some changes from the book it sticks pretty close to Alcott's story which I admittedly was obsessed with as a child. I took one star off for Winona Ryder's performance since to me she was a bit too pretty and socially polished to be the Jo the book portrays. Still this is a great movie for family viewing or for anyone who likes nostalgic movies set in the 19th century."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Version of the Classic Story","review":"This version of Little Women is a classic in its own right. Armstrong did an amazing job here capturing the period and coaxing beautiful performances from her cast. Ryder, Dunst, Alvarado, Mathis, Sarandon, Byrne, Bale and a heartbreaking Danes are all in top form. Visually, the movie is just beautiful and the soundtrack is mesmerizing. A must see."},{"rating":"2","title":"This film captures the spirit of the book","review":"While this film version of LITTLE WOMEN does not follow the book exactly, it captures its spirit with expert performances and cinematography. The soundtrack beautifully enhances this classic story of a family of women, struggling largely by themselves, in unforgiving New England.This may be Winona Ryder's best role - she captures the ambitious spunk of Jo with a winning performance. As Jo's sisters, Trini Alvarado (Meg), Claire Danes (Beth) and Kirsten Dunst (the young Amy) give strong, if sometimes uneven, performances. Susan Sarandon as Marmee has the right measure of no-nonsense Puritanism; her feminist lines often are too heavy-handed for this film that otherwise has a light touch, but the way she sweeps into a room overshadows any flaws in the writing.All in all, this is an excellent adaptation. Children may be bored by the art film pace, but teens and adults will delight in these characters brought to life by nuanced performances.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great movie with wonderful acting","review":"I often times get a 'cravin' to watch this movie! I did the other day and was not displeased! This is a wonderful movie. I have read the book, which was as good. Winona Ryder's portrayl of Jo is awesome as is Christian Bale's of Laurie. I think that the only complaint I have about this movie is the portrayal of Mr Bryne's character. He is seen in the movie as a older man, who was really quite charming in the bookThis is a great story for anyone who loves movies about sisterly love and charm!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Absurd story line!","review":"the movie did follow the book...

The all-star cast, including Wynona Ryder, Claire Danes, Susan Sarandon, Christian Bale, and Kirsten Dunst give amazing performances that feel like you're watching a real life drama play out. Just be careful, make sure the kleenex are nearby. A must-have!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good movie, bad actress (Winona)","review":"The movie overall was great because it was based on Louisa May Alcott's book \\"Little Women\\" but the choice of actress was terrible! I got so annoyed by the way Winona Ryder played Jo: too soft and feminine for a Josephine March. For this reason I ended up loving the June Allyson version more than this recent one...not only because June Allyson plays Jo's character so well, but also because there were parts in the movie where actors/actresses used the exact same lines as in the book. Try the June Allyson version! You'll see the young Elizabeth Taylor playing Amy March...surprise, surprise!:) Everybody loves it. Louisa May Alcott (the real Jo March) would have been happier with a stronger voice and boyish manners from Jo in this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful accompanyment to the older version of Little Women.","review":"I found this newer version of Little Women almost as wonderful as the older version. I loved the fact that they still kept the scenes quite snowey and the \\"era\\" very intact. It got a little long winded in a few scenes but the movie on a whole was very well done and moved along with the story.If you are a Little Women fan you will fall in love with this new version as well. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"preachy and ahistorical","review":"Having loved the book as a girl and enjoyed the earlier film versions, I had high expectations for this remake. Sadly, those expectations were dashed. I didn't have as much of a problem with the movie departing from the text, because I believe that movies always interpet the books which inspired them anyway. My objection pertains to the degree or extent of interpretation. What I disliked most about this remake was its unrelenting preachiness and the ahistorical way it projected 1990's values into the past. I thought the book was feminist and modern in its own context, and so its variant of strong womanhood should have been honored on its own terms rather than devalued by reinterpreting it in our terms, while still locating the story in the past. In so doing, this movie implied that the best, the only valid, and the most enlightened feminism is the one we know today. That's just plain old conceit."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Sarandon Version","review":"Others have written praising the updating of this classic story. I found the updating sad and came away sorry that this film of the book kept the original title. The new movie imposes modern liberal and feminist values on the old story and rips out the simple christian goodness that made the classic shine.I will agree with other reviewers that the new version is beautifully executed, but the simple joy and goodness of the book was left out."},{"rating":"1","title":"A decided opinion","review":"First of all, Winona Ryder is no Jo March.

If it wasn't for that, the movie would of been excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not As Good As The Book by Alcott","review":"I felt I was missing something thoughout this whole movie. I haven't run across anyone who doesn't regard it as a classic or a masterpiece that tugs at their heart strings...but I just didn't feel it.It feels too much like a movie...too much drama, too much music, and too many colorful costumes. I know it's a movie, but when I watch movies I usually am not thinking: \\"movie, movie movie\\" throughout the whole thing.Not one of my favorites. I like the book this is loosely based on better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good remake","review":"This movie is ok, but I prefer the 1949 one with Elizabeth Taylor. I hated Winona's acting, and I didn't like how Gabriel Byrne played Prof. Bhaer in this movie.

This is my second copy of this movie. I loved watching it so much that I had to get a newer copy in order to enjoy some more. The sister who plays the piano was super.

This movie is so much fun to watch!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Timeless Classic made by a Timeless Actress","review":"Winona Ryder is at her best in this fantastic adaption of Loiusa May Alcott's splendid book. In fact, all of the fine members of the cast and crew do a bang up job in this piece. The classic tale of Jo, Meg, Amy, Beth, their friend Laurie, and Marmie is properly done with the dignity and warmth of the book.It is too bad that Ms. Ryder has not reached the apex of her acting career after this movie. This film to date is her best acted piece. Her strength, joy, and incredible beauty give me goose bumps and make my heart soar. Jo March is everybody if we are able to channel the goodness of our heart and dare to live a dream. That really is what Little Women is all about.This is a great movie and will be a wonderful addition to anyone's collection if they collect movies.Thank you BB"},{"rating":"2","title":"COOL!!!!!!!!!","review":"This Movie is By far the best family movie to reach the silver screen so far.

I have never read the book or seen any other movie version. This is a truly \\"nice\\" movie about making it through the struggles of life and trying to find your place in a tough world and do something of value in life beyond just \\"getting by\\", so hard even with the support of a good family. It always moves me when I see it. Winona shines and the other actors are wonderful. The photography and directorial decisions are first rate. Special mention must be made of the music, which is undoubtedly a big reason the movie is as wonderful as it is. The Marches are sort of a dream family who are kind and decent, who one would want to spend time with. This is one of the top 10 movies I would take along to that desert island to improve my mood on those gloomy days. The commentary by director Armstrong is good, and the isolated music score is very nice too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet little book.","review":"Very sweet little book! If you're doing Origami for a group class this is a nice addition to read to younger children. The pictures are soft and blended. My 7 year old liked it, I'll use it in our group class, for 5 - 10 year olds, but I don't see this as a favorite in our house. One reviewer wrote they thought there would be instructions. I did not get this impression at all. It's exactly what the review says it is, a book of poems. The poems are very short and easy to follow, so they held our attention well. This just isn't going to be a read over and over type book, that's all I'm saying. There are books like Shel Silverstein that are falling apart on our bookshelf from use! This is cute and we'll leave it at that."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Box Set is the BOMB!","review":"Astonishingly, atomically good!!!

Very enjoyable even to those for whom poetry is not a favorite genre, as the language is easy, most poems short, and we can all relate with the feelings described. A good start to get acquainted with the wonderful work of this man... the book also makes a great gift to give a girlfriend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"This book is a sad reminder of what repugnicans once were. How can a party sink to multitudes of degrees of filth and worthlessness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Required Reading, but Not Landmark","review":"Even if not homeschooling your kids, I think every father should read this. I was very, very convicted in regards to my ownership of my kid's education (especially spiritually), and leadership in my family. A very quick read. It lays out some great outlines and practical tips. I will say that the author's current job and career as a lawyer in education comes through strongly. I would have liked to have seen other well known or respected thought leaders or authors referenced or even mentioned. That might make the book more comprehensive and thorough."},{"rating":"1","title":"not recommended","review":"If you know anything about Michael Farris, nothing in the book will surprise you. It is solidly conservative (perhaps leaning fundamentalist) Christian and political thought. I skimmed it to see if it might be helpful to my husband but can't say I would recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Eye to the Horizon","review":"My family has origins in Southwest Virginia and I always wondered when we drove south down I-77 what the sign \\"Appalachian Trail\\" meant. The author did an excellent job describing his journey. I found the book easy to read. His attention to his surroundings and his honesty made it hard for me to put the book down. I met the author and his wife this past summer before reading the book. I have a tremendous amount of respect for these people and hope to someday make this journey myself. The trip obviously takes intense planning and the author not only shares some of his resources with us, but he also shares some of the changes he made during his trek whether it be shoes he wore or the type of tent he changed to later in his journey through New England. It is not just a hiker book. It is a story of determination. It is a story of not only setting a goal, but attaining it with the help of his family. Good Book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Walk, eat, sleep, walk, eat, sleep - it's foggy today...","review":"I'm sorry, but I found this book too boring to even finish. I'd have to agree with the lone 2-star reviewer who said it is just another trail log. There is little in the way of wildlife and scenery descriptions, other than a laundry list of species observed, and not much as far as stories about people the author met on the trail. Mostly, the author wrote a paragraph or so per day about what he ate, how far he walked, and where he slept.There are a few photographs, many out of focus, and all in black and white.This book is not cheap, and in my opinion, not worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully inspiring story from start to finish.","review":"This book was easy to read and kept my attention all the way to the end. I purchased the book wondering if it would be something that I would enjoy reading since I myself am not a back-country hiker. What I found was a story that was both inspiring and enlightening. You do not have to be a hiking enthusiast to enjoy this material. After reading it, I felt as if I had participated in the hike with the author. Two of my friends also purchased the book and felt the same way. In fact, we were so inspired by his story that we decided to take on the trail ourselves, and I must say I now have a new-found respect for all that have made this trek. I hope the author has another adventure that he will write about in the near future!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bavarian American","review":"I got this during the 2010 OK Ice storm when there was not a shovel to be found anywhere in the state.

His non-war poems are just as astounding as his war poems and this collection is great for any reader of poetry. Highly recommended, this book will not dissapoint."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful","review":"An outstanding edition of Owen's work. The noted British poet C Day Lewis produced what is likely the final edition of Owen's work. Included are all his extant poems, including minor works. Also included are a very interesting Introduction by Day Lewis and an enlightening memoir by the poet Edmund Blunden. The War Poems, of course, are the heart of the book and included are some of the most famous English poems of the 20th century. Reading these famous poems with all of Owen's war poetry only magnifies the powerful effect of Owen's verse."},{"rating":"1","title":"i never ordered nor recieved this","review":"i just found this under my past purchases and i never purchased this or have i ever recieved it.

Jomini in many ways says exactly what Von Cluasewitz had said. There is a richer discussion of tactics in Jomini's work than Von Cluasewitz. If you are interested in knowing about tactical formations and ideas on lines of retreat and communications in the Napeleonic era this is the right book. The work is more compact than Von Cluasewitz yet Jomini didn't quite have the gift of explaining arguments as throughly in fewer words. Jomini gives more historical examples than Von Cluasewitz yet doesn't quite translate the examples into simple basic concepts as well as Von Cluasewitz. Von Cluasewitz is the better of the two. An knowledge of battles during the French Revolutionary period and Napeleonic era helps to enrich the read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Art of Life","review":"The Art of War (which I own several versions and copies)I believe should a primer for all people who wish to be in businessconduct relationships of any type and in general to be in this world.The process is simple, everyone is trying to make this planet a great place a FOR THEM to liveyou need to be aware of the implication of surface and deep structure of language, of actions and of intention."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome, and teaches popular tunes","review":"A friend has this, which impressed me. I own the \\"Starring Mickey\\" DVD, and my 2 1/2 year old daughter is fascinated with the old cartoons. They have a charm that rivets her unlike any of the current cartoons or Dora type of stuff. I'm sure that part of the reason is that they are filled with slapstick comedy that isn't considered as \\"correct\\" for kids these days --- but wow, Disney sure did know what kids like! The \\"Starring Mickey\\" DVD has a scene with Goofy and a piano, and its the first time I've heard my daughter laugh out loud at something she was watching by herself.

To be fair, a lot of bands put out live albums after each and every tour...The Stones, McCartney, even KISS...and most of the time, just like being at the actual event, you have to sit through the 'new' stuff to get to the classic stuff.

This was the most successful election for two parties outside of the main ones. The Democrats took the election with a victory for Woodrow Wilson but TR's progressive party and Debs socialist party polled amazing results given their standing. This book goes beyond the 1912 election and takes people through the world war showing what happened to each of these parties and the men. Debs life in particular was interesting and seeing the way in which the government reacted was indicative of the future. The book is very well written and worth taking the time to explore."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Historical Read","review":"This book offers a great retelling of the 1912 election and the personalities involved. The book is light on analysis, but rich with historical details and stories to drive the narrative forward. Although the race featured four candidates, it was unlike the other serious four candidate election of the 20th century, 1948. In that year, the full political spectrum was represented by Thurmond, Dewey, Truman, and Wallace. In 1912, the fight was over who was the most progressive. Even the incumbent, President Taft, had some progressive credentials despite being the conservative in the race. If the book has a failing, it is putting a bit too much stock in the long shot candidacy of Eugene Debs. If anything, Debs could have played spoiler, but did not have a serious shot at the White House."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting narrative, but it is unfocused","review":"This book starts off very well, but Chace misses the mark because he lets himself get unfocused. Only about a third to half the book really looked at the election, most of the book discussed life after the election and before the election for the four men. Also, Taft is not discussed as much as Wilson or Roosevelt. However, the pictures are spectacular, and the book is written well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific collection!","review":"Featuring some of his lost performances for RCA(available only on dusty old records at your local vinyl shop), Eddy Arnold can be heard here in pure, crooning late-'60's form.

Given some of the author's suggestions in the latter chapters, a parent, or an individual with this type of problem can find some real suggestions to move on to a more fulfilling and satisfying life. Thank you Dr. Jergen for shedding a fresh view on a very important topic.I believe one major issue addressed in the book needs further emphasis. I think it is true that people having the condition of ADHD lack self esteem.

The Reivers had it & delivered -- jangly melodies, evocative lyrics, and the ability to tell stories & evoke landscapes of memories with seeming ease. There's a warmth to their music, a homespun flavor that reminds the listener of old times, old friends, lost dreams & treasured moments. Criminally overlooked in their own brief lifetime, they're deserving of rediscovery by anyone interested in quality songwriting by a superb band. This one can be played over & over without ever growing tired or old. While I consider this their single finest album, all four are well worth getting.

There is much that is new and interesting. Unfortunately, the author's political views creep into the story as he attempts to prove that USAF leaders wanted to start WWIII.

I didn't even need to unwrap the shrinkwrap - it was clearly evident because of broken pieces rattling around and drawers shifted. The tabs serve two purposes - they serve as a drawer stop to keep the drawer from being pushed in too far, and they keep the drawer from falling out when opened.Akro-Mils clearly didn't size the tabs properly for the bigger drawers of this model. They are the same 1-2mm tiny tabs that are used for the models with smaller drawers and the plastic is hard and brittle enough that they break easily.This went unopened right back to Amazon.

They need to be attached to the wall behind the shelf I have them on to prevent them from flexing. The drawers do not fit well into the cabinet and even when pushed against the stops look uneven. The packaging says that they come with drawer dividers which is only partially true. There are only a few drawer dividers provided and you need to work for them. The dividers are stamped out of the back piece and need to be cut away from the cabinet and cut out individually with scissors. When they advertise that it comes with dividers, I reasonably expected to have a divider for each drawer.The drawers are made of a durable plastic and will probably hold up pretty well. All in all, I recommend that you look elsewhere for your drawer cabinets, $35 - $37 for these units is way more that they're worth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good quality, on the expensive side","review":"We bought two of these to accommodate our son's growing arsenal of Lego pieces - it works very well, except for some of the more bulky items.

I also didn't like the fact that castor and mineral oils were used in some of the recipes, as these will clog up pores tremendously. In the Gift-Giving section, her ideas were good, though I would have liked to have seen some actual recipes and step-by-step instructions on the creations of these ideas.

You can dish it out with your friends in the multiplayer with up to 4 players at once in the holloseum. The arcade mode is old school. If you like the Armored Core Series, then get this.

With a ton of unlockable weapons and parts, the number of different combinations of parts on your robo is quite high. The game designers don't overload you with a lot of options in the beginning of the game, either, so it's easy to try out the parts as the story progresses.The story of this game was much better than I expected and much better than a lot of gaming review sites lead you to believe. In fact, the whole game is much better than many gaming review sites give it credit for... if you have a lot of time to spend forming strategies and playing around with various parts.If you're the kind of gamer who wants to go in, guns blazing, this isn't the game for you.

Also, the dialogue in the movie is flat and uninspired. It's particularly annoying how several individuals in the movie are supposedly doctor level education but use the vernacular of sophmoric losers. Paul Dano's desire to adopt a chinese baby is an attempt at cutey-quirky that really lacks authenticity. J. Goodman and E.

He loves shaking things (he's 10 months) and it makes a pretty great sound. The core of the frog is elastic, so when he's older he'll be able to stretch the toy a bit too for additional entertainment. I like that the HABA toys are made in Germany to EU standards; it makes me feel better about him constantly putting it in his mouth.

He got excited at the image on the computer and started babbling happily at it. It is very well constructed and made of quality materials. I could even see him giving it to his child some day.

I had to force her to sit and when she did, she was still very alert with eyes wide open, watching my every move with ears standing erect. I will be returning this product tomorrow.

Its beyond irratating. We will be flying him on a 14hr flight and I bought these pills to keep him from ripping his kennel to shreds and roaming the cargo bay of the plane. He ALWAYS tears out of his kennel and hurts himself severly...even with zip ties. Needless to say, at 2 pills nothing...still paces & bites the kids when they move. 3 pills he lays down occasionally when NOTHING in the house moves...but as soon as the kids move an inch he is up scratching, grunting and being annoying. I'm worried to increase the dose more. He is only 65lbs.

Call me a stooge, but I think Starsailor shines at their brightest with their more pop-oriented uptempo tracks (such as \\"Music Was Saved\\" on Silence... and \\"Poor Misguided Fool\\" on Love is..), they tend to fall into a kind of syrupy mess when the tempo gets to slow, relying on overly orchestrated backing tracks. I got a chance to see them in January of 2004 and it only reinforced this opinion; most of the songs were given a slightly more uptempo presentation in a live venue, and it wasn't able to veer into overproduction.While providing less orchestrated, more uptempo songs, it still manages to preserves the lead singers amazing, soaring vocals (which sound the same live as on record, he can *really* sing!), which fortunately don't go into Chris Martin-style falsetto."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"This album could have been good. The tunes are ok, the lyrics are nice, no gripes on that. But the sound is very flat, it lacks depth and warmth (which is terrible for a pop album). And there is a bit too much orchestra in the background.I was much more thrilled by Turin Brakes' \\"Ether Songs\\", or even Moloko's \\"Statues\\", which both display amazing arrangments, and an outstanding sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"Several great songs.","review":"Rolling Stone described this album as the sound of Coldplay covering Barry Manilow. I laughed when I read that because at its worse (Bring My Love) I can sort of see the analogy, but overall its actually much better than that sounds, and the best tracks (Music Was Saved, Fidelity, Silence Is Easy & Four To The Floor) are really very good. I first bought the UK version a few months back, so I've been listening for a while, and this is one of those albums that gets better with time. The version of Born Again is an improvement over the orginal b-side on the \\"Poor Misguided Fool\\" single, though I still can't understand why they released it as the second UK single. For others who may have already purchased the import, I will say that I really like the first U.S. bonus track and the included video documentary is great. My favorite part is where James Walsh says that he wants \\"Four To The Floor\\" to be their \\"I Am The Resurection\\". That was a cool thing to say."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Band, Disappointing Album","review":"I am a Starsailor fan and was completely riveted by their first album, the stunning vocals, the song-writing, the depth and diversity of subject matter and musical approaches made for a full, satisying album. Sadly, that's not the case here. While the vocals are as compelling as ever, the songs are, save two or three songs, much weaker, redundant, anemic, cliche-laden, forgettable. If you love Starsailor, then you will, as I did, buy this album, but it is clearly a mediocre shack compared to the splendid skyscraper of the first album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect In Every Way","review":"Perfect, Brilliant, the best band from England in a long time.

The band seem to be relentlessly treading the same old path used by the last two albums, which isn't a good thing in my book. I think that although you'll probably happily tap your feet (or foot for those less fortunate) to a lot of this album, its instantly forgettable, as though a computer has seemlessly programmed the 'funk' & 'groove' into each piece with soul-less precision. I had heard that although the live band are quite good - and live(?) the studio side of this project is largely down to computers, so maybe that won't surprise those of us with a need for organic grooviness.

This CD sounds like they got tired of the whole thing, turned on the synthesizers and left the room, no, the building. Monotonous. Stale. Wow. Why?

Talk to 80% (rough estimate) of high school or college students and you'll find more humor and wit in one sitting than in the entirety of this book. McKay acts like he's some sort of master wordsmith, using self-deprecation as a sarcastic joke, but he has a long way to go before reaching anything close to some of the writer's he's been compared with (which I can only assume came from friends or friends of the family). The fact that this book was apparently self-published goes to show that it was unworthy of being published by anyone who thought it would sell any copies.To sum up: Good job McKay, you've done an excellent job of masturbating your ego and creating a false sense of accomplishment in yourself.By the way, is that a typo I see on page 1?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Water polo Shirt","review":"The fabric was nice and thick - good quality.

I pulled out the Circle Scissor and made a series of circle cuts then wrote the coinciding number and diameter measure on the cutout. Now I have a handy reference.

There is also a slight latin flair to many of the tracks. I have to say that if you are looking for super-catchy tracks, this is NOT the album for you. Rather, put it on, and go play by the pool (or in the Beach House), have a party, and have a drink.

The plot revolves around the \\"murder\\" of one of two humaniform robots in existence, which protagonist Elijah Baley is called to the Spacer home world Aurora to investigate. Asimov's characters and plot are deep, and his understanding of human nature is truly remarkable. This book is not only a very engaging work of science fiction and mystery, but also a shrewd exposition of the motives and prejudices of human beings. And yet Asimov manages to provoke in his readers a strong sense of hope for the future of humankind."},{"rating":"1","title":"NATURAL COLOR????????

Each movie continues on with the puppets adventures as they gain new Masters. Some of the Puppet Masters are good, and others are evil, but regardless of their master's intentions the puppets cary out their wishes using the special deadly talents that each one was designed with.

Can't the producers come up with anything more orignal instead of rehashing the special effects from the other movies. In some of the scenes the special effects were so bad that it looked like the puppets were hovering instead of walking on the ground. Besides the crappy special effects the rest of the movie was really boring. The puppets didn't do much and you barely saw them. The story line wasn't bad, but it wasn't good either. It started out okay and just got dumb at the end. The biggest disappointments were that the movie did not reveal any unknown information about Andre Toulon(like in the previous movies) and my favorite puppet wasn't in it, Torch.

What's worse, fame and success were obviously starting to go to the cast's collective head. Thus you had Alan Alda writing and directing an episode which he spends bickering with his father, the usually humble Mulcahy demanding (and getting) a promotion, and pretty much everybody seeming very impressed with their own wit. While other shows have managed to survive much heavier doses of cast ego, this sort of thing is especially wrong for M*A*S*H because it makes our heroes no longer seem unhappy to be where they are.Die-hard fans, of course, will want to collect the whole series.

Not to mention Margaret Houlihan's terrible facial and hair job - she look's like something out of a doll shop.Nup, these changes along with very weak storylines and recycled themes meant that the once great M*A*S*H had gone forever.

Lahr is unrivalled at finding these entertainers and letting them and their work speak.

I removed the Master Cylinder cover, then sucked the fluid out each wheel cylinder bleed valve individually (while topping off the reservoir with fresh fluid) until each cylinder ran clean. It was a one man operation with all the bubbles coming out the bleed screw (I put some grease on the bleed screw fittings so my tygon tubing made a good seal).

The design of the cup is flawed - shouldn't the cup cover atleast tightly fit the cup?.2) air leaked through the threads of the bleeder screw, and there isn't any way to prevent it. I don't know if other kits prevent this problem. Fortunately, this problem didn't have a severe impact on the outcome.3) the glass on the vaccum dial broke even under normal use.I hope Actron fixes design flaw #1 and #3."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk as a brake bleeder","review":"This is a fine vacuum test kit, but garbage for bleeding brakes.

It's a shame, I chose this product due to its perceived quality so this exact scenario would not happen (the plastic one I owned before did the same thing).If you expect to get some real, solid use out of this pump you might look elsewhere to one of the other metal pumps (mityvac seem to be a good alternative that don't have this design flaw)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Could be better","review":"Purchased to bleed brakes on a motorcycle. The pump itself is pretty good and sturdy but that is were it stops. The container is too small and it is almost impossible to stop it from leaking.

However, the pace was too fast and the moves changed too often to be giving a good workout to a beginner like myself. Plus, the camera angles, as some other reviews mentioned, made it even harder to follow. If they had not advertised this as easy to follow, I wouldn't be so disappointed. I recently started following another dvd, Ultimate Fat Burn by Women's HealthWomen's Health: Ultimate Fat Burn!, and that was a much better example of a good workout for beginners. It has a good pace, and allows you to focus more on the quality of your workout rather than racing through it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Workout!","review":"I really like this DVD! It constantly changes it up, although it does take a couple times to get the moves down. I agree with a previous comment that the camera work is little to be desired (which is why I am rating it a 4). Sometimes I have no idea what the instructor is doing because the aren't focusing on her and/or her entire body. But overall a good workout, even for a beginner!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another excellant workout from the FIRM","review":"I have been doing The FIRM workouts for more than 15 years.

I was using a heart rate moniter and at the end of the video, I had burned about 430 calories and been in my heart rate zone 67% of the time. I really sweat during this workout. I LOVE Allison, and think she is a wonderful instructor. I don't think the weight segments are as difficult, as someone else stated. I use 5 lb weights and can pretty comfortably complete all of the weight moves. (And I just got the 5 pounders about 3 weeks ago - I haven't been using them very long.) This is promoted as a Cardio workout, and it definitely delivers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I consider myself a fan of The FIRM workouts, but this one just didn't do anything for me. I found that the transitions between the cardio and strength training segments were weak. It was aggravating having to do cardio, then pick up the weights, then drop the weights, then do more cardio, then pick up the weights every two minutes. It was quiet annoying after a while.Also, while I love most of the instructors I've seen with The FIRM, Alison Davis just seemed so stiff and robotic for me. When she mentioned how our \\"guns\\" were going to look, I couldn't help but crack up at the absurdity of her comment. It's one thing to hear my thirteen year old students (I'm a teacher) mention that, but it just seemed so foreign coming out of her mouth.On a positive note, I loved how the workout was divided up into chapters, and I did work up quiet a sweat, but overall, it's not a keeper for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not your typical bootcamp workout!","review":"I have some of the older Firm workouts and really enjoy them.

The format of this workout is broken up into two types of segments--cardio and plyometrics. Overall, it's a good workout and does get you sweating quite a bit. However, the instructor is the reason that I only give this video 2 stars. Although, I don't care for peppy instructors, this one was quite the opposite extreme. She had no energy whatsoever and the most annoying part was that she referred to Sue Mi, the lady doing the modified moves a thousand times!!! The only reason that I can think of why she would refer to Sue Mi so many times is because she was nervous and was looking for fillers. It really deters me from wanting to work out to this DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Slow","review":"I do not workout at all, decided to try this work out and it is really slow...I was bored instantly, I did go all the way through the video but didn't work up much of a sweat. I have taken boot camp classes that have actually felt like I was really in bootcamp or what I imagine boot camp to be. This workout was like boot camp for the elderly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great cardio and sculpting","review":"I've been working out with the Firm for about two years now and this was one of my very first DVDs from them. Alison has become one of my favorite instructors because she explains the moves, has fairly good cueing, and keeps me motivated during the workout. That being said, you can definitely tell this is one of her earlier DVDs as she seems a little nervous and wooden during the transitions. The workout itself is nicely divided up between sculpting/plyometric segments and cardio segments. Each plyometric move is repeated twice during sculpting and is just long enough to make your muscles burn without making you want to quit. The sculpting and cardio exercises are pretty basic Firm moves, with variations for beginners and advanced exercisers. Overall this workout can be as intense as you need it to be and always leaves me sweating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty decent","review":"I have tons of Firm DVDs. I really like this one. It's a nice quick workout that will make you work up a sweat. It's fairly easy to follow along with and it isn't overly dancy. What moves are overly dancy, I improvise. (One of the benefits of at-home workouts is no witnesses when you mess up or improvise your steps to keep moving)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Workout!","review":"This is a fantastic workout that never leaves me feeling like I didn't do enough! When I'm wanting to push harder some days, I just add more weight. When I am feeling a bit sore, I use light weights. Not a beginner workout."},{"rating":"1","title":"ok for a change","review":"This one is OK, but still mostly boring. It's fair for just cardio, but not much on the strength training part."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too difficult to follow","review":"I'm honestly admitting that I'm uncoordinated and found this choreography very difficult to follow. I feel that the instructor changes moves too often, leaving me confused and frustrated.I decided to go with Beachbody DVDs instead (with Debbie Siebers). They are challenging, yet easy to follow with lots of repetition (not changing moves too quickly, unlike the Firm). I'm a seasoned exerciser, but my body was too used to the treadmill. I needed a change. Beachbody has given me great results and people compliment me all the time on my body (I'm 36 and a mother of 2 boys).In summary, if you're coordinated and able to follow quickly-changing moves, then the Firm is for you. If you're looking for a challenging, but easy to follow work-out, spend your money on Beachbody instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"FIRM Bootcamp","review":"I was very disapointed because I own other Firm titles which are challenging. It was boring, I played it once. For those new to fitness it would be all right. However, for me what a waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"I really like this one ;-)","review":"To be honest, The Firm isn't one of my favourite series. Often, there are instructors not giving clear cuing and they can be out of time. For some reason, I decided to give this a go and I'm glad I did because it's one of the better workouts of theirs.There is lots of variations in movements and music so it's kept fresh and interesting. For once I found the cuing very very precise and right on time. The instructor, Alison Davis, not only cues well to let you know what's coming up, but also tells you all the time about proper form and technique. The mix of toning and aerobics is perfect and I've found results already. It's a little over 50 minutes all up, and all you need is two sets of dumbbells. It's using basic choreography but the level is probably not for complete beginners - more of an intermediate to advanced level.It's fun and I like to do this once or twice a week along with my other routines and dvds. I thoroughly recommend this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good workout but annoying camera work","review":"I did this DVD for the first time today. Although I felt like I got a good workout and it was a nice change from the other 20 Firms that I've done, the camera work was just too amateur. At times, it focused on the girl with the easy moves so you could not follow along with the regular instructors. Also, there were times you could not see the leg work because it focused only on the upper half of the instructors. Whoever shot this video needs to learn from the original Firm camera people, who really knew how to shoot a workout video. However, I liked the plyometrics and speed moves because I felt I was going at different paces throughout the video and that is supposed to give you results faster. Worth a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Tough Days","review":"This workout is a really great one for the days you feel like you need a real toughie. Allison takes you through differnt cardio segments and weight lifting moves like a pro. Even though its called Bootcamp, she is too sweet to be a drill instructor. Love her! You'll need light medium and heavy weights for the sculpting segments. Be ready to work hard!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money.","review":"It has some great ideas - large tub, upper rack that moves, steam is recycled and not blown into kitchen, energy saving upper / lower rack washes - but does not do the job.

I usually try to watch period movies in the context of their era, but this film is timeless.

Disc Two offers some fun bonus features, such as wardrobe tests, a fan-friendly documentary and some newsreel footage (yes, that is CABARET's Joel Grey---looks like he had some rhinoplasty since this was shot!).The movie itself is wonderful. Great performances all the way around and you will barely notice the Fifties styles thrust into 1917 California--the story, the acting, the cinemtagrophy are all wayyyy too rich and sumptuous.Excellent collection for film buffs and, especially, James Dean admirers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Primarily interested in Rebel Without a Cause","review":"But the DVD transfer of RWAC is really atrocious, ruining this great film.

The drama is so stirring I have the most pained look on my face at the end of this film as I try not to cry before I inevitably do. James Dean made three films and all were great but this one is the best. He was truly a great actor and a great loss. The other actors are just as skilled and the director Elia Kazan makes the most out of his actors. This disk contains not just a great print of the film but several terrific special features. The commentary with Richard Schickel is absorbing enough to keep you glued to the television set for another two and half hours. Just a wonderful movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"East of Eden","review":"This was hard for me to find, so I was delighted to order it. It's a fine copy with worthwhile extras. Worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Episode of LIttle Consequence","review":"Watch this film carefully. Every detail holds a truth and a revelation. When you gather all the symbolic references, you realize the true true message of the film. Despite their best efforts to the contrary, all the kids end up just ike their parents. There are references to what's going to happen in 10 years, when Jim grows up. 10 years pass in 36 hours, and that's the heart of the tragedy. If you follow closely, you see that Plato gravitates toward homosexuality because of paternal molestation. Make special note of why Plato was in the police station, he killed some puppies. He did it so that they wouldn't grow up. In the end, Jim kills Plato so he won't grow up. Watch closely."},{"rating":"1","title":"James Dean was wonderful but the film was disappointing","review":"I've lately been reading great novels of the twentieth century and I'd just finished John Steinbeck's East of Eden. Certainly Steinbeck's best, the novel expands on the Biblical story of Cain and Abel through three generations of a family, more true to the Biblical text than most preachers ever could be, and philosophically ahead of its time. But this movie version is disappointing. The script was clearly written to showcase the promising young actor James Dean stereotyped in the \\"what's happening to our teenagers\\" 50's angst. The script obliterated Steinbeck's story line, cut out the Greek Chorus-like main character of the novel- the Chinese manservant Lee- and tried to focus a multi-generational theme into a few months of a wayward teen's life. The film is only a 'classic' because Dean was superb and he died so young. I highly recommend the 1981 mini-series TV film version of the story over the 50's 'classic.'"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a classic?","review":"I liked the acting and the production values. It is well crafted. I'm not impressed with the story. What a wacky, unlikely family. A more coherent plot would have helped also. I saw another comment saying the movie is not as good as the book.

They all say exactly what I am going to say: If you're thinking to watch the movie, to see the characters from the book in full color, don't bother. I couldn't even finish the movie because it was so far off from the book. James Dean's portrayel of Cal is ridiculous, showing Cal as some sort of half-wit emo-precursor, shuffling around in and out of bushes, brows draw in what I imagine he thought was ferocity when it really just looked neanderthal. And Adam Trask... and where was Lee?? Maybe he appeared later but, as I said, I couldn't stomach James Dean's Cal, nor Aaron, nor Abra's characters in the movie so I quit watching. And, my favorite character, Sam Hamilton... well, he wasn't there either.

During the film I never got the feeling that this was even a half hearted attempt at describing real life. The fact that this false, artificial, self involved movie was a touchstone for a generation of the same qualities should tell you something about the decline of our society, and not just the decline of Hollywood filmmaking.If you want true teen age nihilism try \\"American Me\\" or \\"Boyz N the Hood\\" instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie is crap","review":"This movie sucks for so many reasons, I can't fit them all in the 1,000 word space that amazon gives me. For starters, I'll give my impression of the 3 lead characters after watching the movie. (...) Natalie Wood's character is bipolar, and Sal Mineo's character is a little on the gay side. To make it worse, the plot is boring, unrealistic, and inconsistent. Oh yeah, and where does this image of James Dean wearing a leather jacket come from? Although it was even shown on the cover of this DVD, HE DOESN'T WEAR A LEATHER JACKET IN ANY OF HIS 3 STARRING ROLES. And to think that there is actually a James Dean brand of leather jackets with his face on the inside of the jacket. It's a conspiracy."},{"rating":"1","title":"let down","review":"What a let down, after hearing so much about this movie. It is so intellectually contrived, with Sal Mineo being named \\"Plato\\" and the planeterium metaphysics. It's cheap existentialism. And Dean has charisma, but should learn not to lurch about so much in his movements, nor keep his face so busy with contstant moving of his eyes and eyebrows. Any fan of John Mellencamp should observed James Dean's line on the stairs in the mansion, where he says to Mineo, \\"Well, then there...\\" In Mellencamp's song JACK AND DIANE, that's the line Mellencamp sings (in a perfect Dean impression): \\"And he did his best James Dean, \`Well, then there Diane, we ought, run off to the city...'\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Easy on the eye","review":"For my penn'orth see my comment on George Schaefer's 5* review.

Dean looked like he was 35/40 years old so the high school edge was unbelievable. Too much drama and overacting. Dean's character needed a whooping, that would have handled that ."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was not east of eden.","review":"OH my god. After reading the book by john steinbeck, this movie seemed so flimsy that it was unwatchable. It is the kind of movie that you can watch for two hours whithout actually watching anything at all. sure, james dean is great but this movie is not east of eden at all. It only covers a tiny portion of the book and leaves out all of the great characters like lee and is grossly innaccurate. It was just rediculous and a huge letdown.---READ THE BOOK!---"},{"rating":"2","title":"Inventing a Rebel","review":"James Dean was one of a kind. He was not the first to play a rebel nor a misunderstood youth but, he had a unique style all his own. James Dean made three films where he had starring roles. This is the one that made him a rebel. All three of his films including \\"East of Eden\\" and \\"Giant\\" are must haves for fans. James Dean died very young and really before he got started as an actor but, his films and his image live..."},{"rating":"2","title":"REBELS WITH A CAUSE","review":"This film's title has always bugged me for any number of reasons.First, the title is a total misfit. Every adolescent star here has a cause for rebellion. Dean's father (Backus) is a real piece of work, his mother is Napoleonic,and Granny does nothing but help reinforce Mommy.Woods'father belongs in ICU AT Bellevue, or behind bars for abuse.Mineo is the proverbial misit whose psychiatric treatments have been cut off.Secondly,even though director Nicholas Ray gave Dean plenty of room to improvise, we are left with 2 dead, 1 wounded, one knife attack, multiple arrests, with the elder Backuses smiling at day's end, all within 18 hours in suburbia 1955. Realism? Next, we have a superb acting job by the 3 protagonists, but silly, often unprofessional acting by all that surround them. Who's running the zoo? Finally, I'll go to my grave believing that \\"East of Eden\\" was Dean's best effort, with this film a mere symbol of what might have been."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Collection of \\"Rebel\\" Memorabilia","review":"Movie buffs of all ages will treasure this 2 disc edition of the great classic and lament James Dean's unrecognized potential as a director, screenwriter and all the roles he never had the chance to play. Most of the special features (with the exception of a dismal commentary track with some hokey trivia) really enhance the fun of this collection...these include wardrobe tests, deleted scenes and \\"behind the scenes\\" segments which give great insight into the mechanics of film production and the personalities of the players. Peter Lawford's 1974 \\"James Dean Remembered\\" proves to be one of the worst \\"chat shows\\" in television history, but still has retrospective entertainment value.Although certainly dated, REBEL still holds up with thematic resonance for contemporary audiences. Dean is breathtaking. Mineo is heartbreaking. A must have for your DVD library!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good quality digital restoration of a Hollywood classic.","review":"This is James Dean's first big picture. Definitely a classic, directed by Kazan who essentially gave James Dean his first big break, taking a chance on him. The girl, Julie Harris, for some reason gets top billing here. But James Dean obviously makes this film work. About the widescreen version, I do not own BluRay equipment, and the picture quality is as good as it gets for a 1950's era production. My only criticism is that when I viewed it on a 47\\" 16:9 aspect ratio TV, the black bars at the top and bottom of the screen are quite thick. This shrinks the viewable screen too much. This is an 'un-enhanced version'. But you would get a better \\"cinemascopic\\" effect on a larger, say, 52\\" or better TV. Still, I recommend East of Eden for the film buff's collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"customer","review":"The product was very good. Alot cheaper than in the stores.

James Dean will always be the rebel and he'll always be there, no matter what. his death was tradgic and his career little, but the impact he had on many still remains and thats why he's considered a great actor of his era. a great movie this was. with award performances by Dean, Natalie Wood and Sal Mineo give this life like it ever was. the end is gripping and so are the car racing scenes. you also get to see a young Dennis Hopper which this is his second movie in his career. dont miss this gem. directed by Nicholas Ray"},{"rating":"2","title":"A shadow of the book","review":"This classic with James Dean actually covers the last 25% or so of the famous novel by John Steinbeck. Having read the book first, it was hard to take the movie on its own. Of necessity, the film simplifies the characters--the stern father, the rebellious son, the good son and his perfect girlfriend, and locks them in a classic tale of sibling rivalry. Because we don't know anything of the history of the mother Cathy, or Kate, she is portrayed almost sympathetically in the film. The wonderful character of Lee from the book is absent, as is the wonderful sense of the country these settlers tamed. On its own, though, it's a fine film with a star cast--Julie Haris, Burl Ives, Raymond Massey, and the legendary Dean."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long Live James Dean","review":"This is one of those movies that prove that no matter how much things change, things remain the same.

I really like this movie because it has a teen's perspective. The parents don't seem to understand them, for example, when Judy wanted her father to show her some affection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rebel Without a Cause","review":"A classic movie that mirrors the time when the United States was in the midst of prosperty following World War II. After years of rationing goods, Americans were buying washing machines, televisions, and cars. True, the Communist scare and the war in Korea marred all the good news, but there was something underneath all the happy families living in the suburbs with pink bathrooms or bedrooms. Teenagers were looking for something more relevant in their lives. Reble Without A Cause reflected what appeared to be teenage angst but these feelings are what swelled into the rebellion and demonstrations of the 60s.The two disc DVD has good information about the making of this movie with cast and production people. It is a sad irony that the three leads died too soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"James Dean's Best Performance","review":"Although this may be the least known of Dean's three major films, I think this is by far his best performance and the one that most fully explores his talent. Dean stars as the troubled son of Raymond Massey, always trying to please his father, but without much success. Richard Davalos is Dean's brother, and he has his father's love and the love of a sensitive young girl played by Julie Harris. The boys are named Cal and Aaron, which reminds us of Cain and Abel, and so does their relationship. Dean gives one of those raw, emotional performances that is sometimes almost uncomfortable to watch it is so real. The rest of the cast is also excellent, with Jo Van Fleet giving an edgy portrayal of the boys \\"lost\\" mother. The struggle for approval and the feeling of not fitting in is one that we can all appreciate, and it is sensitively and dramatically presented. The Steinbeck story is a classic, and in the hands of director Elia Kazan and his terrific cast, so is the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Word-Classic","review":"This movie, made 46 years ago, makes more sense now than all the teen movies made now put together!!!

I was thankful that Amazon even had it as a choice for me to rent! However, I will be honest in saying that the screen went fuzzy a few times for about 15 seconds and then returned to normal, which I wasn't expecting. Also, if you are excited to see the movie because you thought the book was great, don't bother seeing it, because it was terrible. East of Eden is one of those books that no movie could ever justify."},{"rating":"2","title":"One to put on your shelf","review":"I often wonder what it'd be like to live back then as a teenager.

I first saw this film on AMC classics,or Turner classics back in the 90's not sure but I was captivated by James Dean, He embodied the true rebellion of a teenager and being the outsider, the tough guy with a big heart.

Streep, Russell and Cher turn in very average performances, but in all fairness they were portraying very average people. The big mystery is not who killed Karen Silkwood but how did Meryl Streep get an Oscar nomination for this? Musta been a slow year the the movies. I found it ironic that the lead character in the film was so concerned about the carcinogenic dangers of plutonium while she chain smoked through the entirety of the film. As I have said, the story is compelling. The movie doesn't parallel the events very closely as they really took place, and when it does follow fact it barely scrapes the surface.

A repugnant instrument that feels awkward and clumsy in the hand, it is an absolute horror that Parker has resorted to this kind of outright thievery. In doing so, Parker has driven its most loyal following to superior brands for their fine writing needs. What a sad day it is when such a distinguished name with so wonderful a history becomes a joke among collectors and those who truly appreciate the heritage of Parker and its contribution to fine writing. Alas, that does indeed appear to be only history now and nothing but a wistful memory of something once so sublime."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Gift!","review":"Pen Served as a great gift.

British humor at it's driest. Alastair Sim plays dual roles as a gangster and girl's school headmistress (in Drag). If you know Sim, he is an incredible actor, and played Scrooge in the old version of \\"A Christmas Carol\\". The acting troupe of Joyce Grenfell, George Cole, et al...made many British comedies, as well as the \\"Carry On\\" series. There are worse groups of girls these days, but in the 60s, these little monsters were busy blowing up the Chemistry lab, making gin, and fixing horse races. Alastair Sim as a female headmistress and George Cole as a shifty former stable-boy play off each other with ultimate and subtle humor. Not everyone's cup of tea, but I own the movie and love it as a classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absurdly Boring with Little Character Development","review":"Most of the folks reviewing this film seem to have been searching for it out of a fond childhood memory. If you like really dry, old-fashioned British humor, maybe you will like this film?However, I found this film to be absurdly boring. All of the girls in the film are completely undeveloped caricatures. The only developed character in the film is Sims. Of course Alistair Sims is a wonderful actor, but his voice can be grating when there is no other focus.This is one of the few classic films where I actually preferred the remake. This film barely has a plot. At least in the remake the every single scene isn't focused on the Fritton character.Don't get me wrong- I actually love British humor and classic films, but the humor in this film was a little too dry and the pace was a little too slow. Not to mention, the film quality (washed-out b&w; picture quality and horrendously low budget sound) gives me a LITERAL migraine."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE THAT ST.

Alastair Sim is at his best in dual roles of the headmistress and her twin brother.

The drive and force of Kleiber's interpretation does come through, however, the coughing is not a minor problem, it overshadows everything. In fact the coughers are much better recorded than the singers. Particularly Evelyn Lear suffers, her diction seems weak and her voice doesn't carry. Even Ridderbusch suffers. Fassbänder is really marvellous and so far (I have yet to hear acts 2 and 3) the only one who carries through the coughing. I am looking forward to hearing the rest, but with great misgivings. It being a full price set, I don't think Myto merits more than 1 star for having managed to transfer the Scala's public's (and the recorder's?!) coughing so faithfully.

Over the years the little community grew and everybody wanted to live in Linden Hills,even the whites who wouldn't asscociate with it at first.

This blatant outrage is similar to Jean Arthur, Claude Rains,and Cary Grant having never won Oscars either. If life were only fair. In \\"Rebecca\\", Hitchcock brings out the full flavor of Manderley, with terrific performances by the erratic Olivier, the despicable Sanders, and the positively haunting Anderson. If Fontaine's performance (not a personal favorite) reminds one of a similar exhibition in \\"Suspicion\\", so be it. Her whiny, melodramatic appearances tend to detract from both pictures. Perhaps her sister, Olivia deHaviland, in retrospect might have been a better casting decision. Greer Garson? Anyway, the public finally has a reliable DVD at a reasonable price. Even if you're not a Hitchcock fan, this is a film classic not to be missed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Like a Fine Wine","review":"This film had to grow on me, at first the film took me off gaurd because the story was completly different than what I had in mind. As I watched more and more, I became very involved and was trying to figure the mystery in my head. Not only do the performances help very much in this film, but also the atmosphere which so errily gives you chills. The maid was completely outstanding. Her empty stares and her obssesiveness of Rebecca was almost uncanny. I believe this film had every right to win a Best Picture Oscar. It had all the ingridients and more... I reccomend this film, not because of those facts but because it really grew on me. And now everytime one of the scenes pop into my memory, I have to recall where that stirring scene came from, then of course after a moment of thought, it was from \\"Rebecca\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent film","review":"This is a film based on a novel with it's same title.

Yet, she has to discover that behind this facade of wealth and fairy tale like mansion exists the influence of Rebecca's ghost, Maxim de Winter's first wife. The new Mrs. De Winter must fight with the negative influences of this first dead wife and also discover a dark secret about her husband.The film has a dark atmosphere to it.

It streams on youtube."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Happiness is something I know nothing about.\\"","review":"This was Alfred Hitchcock's first American film and stars Laurence Olivier and Joan Fontaine. Olivier and Fontaine have married rather hastily, and Olivier's dead first wife (Rebecca), who from appearances one assumes he loved very much, provides the chief stumbling block for Fontaine in ever capturing Olivier's love. But it's soon revealed that he never loved Rebecca, but hated her; in fact, killed her. Rebecca's dead body being discovered after a number of years have passed is a bit hard to believe, but from that point on the picture really rolls. There is a legal inquiry, attempted blackmail, and arson committed by the jealous housekeeper (Judith Anderson), who is deliciously wicked. The movie is a tad too long (over two hours), but the last hour is excellent. Definitely worth a watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rebecca Academy Award movie","review":"This completed my dvd seriea of all academy award winners.

This movie is about as provocative as an episode of Murder She Wrote. The music was poorly placed and way overused! With the exception of Fontaine, the acting was wretched. The plot revelations were so hokey I actually broke out laughing a few times. Other than some interesting lighting and photography (which you can see in probably a million other thrillers), the movie went absolutely nowhere--no real tension, plodding development, and an astonishing lack of credibilty.

Yet, there are some video games that really seem to set in the opposite direction. One game from Atari, really was one of those games now. Crystal Classics enjoyed moderate but not die hard success in the 80's. The game is a bit like a knock off to Pac Man, as you guide a bear throughout a maze-like castle, grabbing gems on the floor, and trying to avoid bees, and ghoulish villians to garner points. All in all, the game was fair, but this version is really not one worth purchasing. I strongly suggest you buy the Atari Anniversary Edition or the deluxe edition which includes over 80 different games, including Crystal Castles.

My husband (who happens to be a Juilliard trained percussionist) tried to mute the overtone it by taping a small amount of foam to one corner, but we could not get rid of it, and the ringing sound was pretty annoying. Otherwise, the drum is very well made and sturdy (we own several other Remo drums). We later returned this drum and ordered the larger 22\\" x 8\\" Remo Gathering Drum which due to the larger drum head, had a lower, warmer, and more pleasant tone. We realize this is for a toddler, but why not start them off hearing a rich, resonant drum that they can enjoy for years to come, and one which won't give the parents a headache. I would recommend splurging and getting the larger (wider) drum instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Remo KIDS Percussion Floor Tom 10\\" Diameter with Mallet, Rain Forest Fabric","review":"I gave this drum to my 18 month grandson for Christmas 2009.

I decided to buy this drum after discovering that our daughter loved to drum on my Remo djembe. Since I had to hold her up when she wanted to drum, I decided to get the kids version so that she could do it on her own. This is a high quality kids drum as expected, since Remo is a company that makes professional percussion instruments. Our daughter only uses her hands to bang on the drum for now, but maybe she'll pick up the mallets when she gets a bit older.

It's only slightly more expensive than the one at the toy store, but the quality is fantastic! It's very kid friendly and colorful, and the sound is so great that the adults can't help wanting a turn! I highly recommend this product.

What other release has cut footage that almost equals the original film release in length?

This is a hugely funny movie as basically the version that came out in 1982, but this video is not worth buying twice. (It is almost exactly the same as the \\"old\\" video.) This re-release does not even have the two videos that appeared at the end of the original release. Shame on MGM!Amazon, I note, does correctly identify that the VHS is remastered but that the DVD has additional footage. I should have read Amazon's description and not relied on MGM's ad blitz which even today (September 18th, 2000) still has a note on their website promising 1 hour of new footage on VHS and DVD.They should have done it in Dobly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tappers beware!","review":"This DVD apparently had some unspecified mastering problems that almost delayed its release. Maybe MGM should have delayed the release. Not only does the disc booklet not list the film's last three chapters, but the film itself lacks the original on-screen captions identifying characters, places, etc., thus making itself more bewildering. (For some reason, a Tap clip played during Rob Reiner's new interview has the clip's original caption.) Did the filmmakers intentionally remove the captions for this rerelease? If MGM did botch Spinal Tap, will the studio replace our DVDs with corrected copies, and with corrected booklets?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Classic Movie!","review":"Just ordered my special edition copy.

The band has a series of episodes, that do not portray them in a positive light. They are silly, and even admit they are child like. Their popularity has diminished and they need to come up with new ideas to rejuvenate the band. The film follows a young director making a documentary about them.This DVD has good transfer and sound. The extras are good as well, with a commentary with the band, out takes and more. The film itself is an effective comedy/satire of rock n roll bands from the 60's folk to 80's hair metal. I found the jokes throughout the film set up well, and one joke comes up right after another, with no dull spots, although it is not bust out loud laughing kind of humor. Fans of metal with a sense of humor should enjoy this. 4 stars. Check it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete hack job from a total hack","review":"No surprise Marti DeBergi wasn't able to get a job after this. He could teach Michael Moore a thing or two about selective editing, turning one of England's most influential rock bands into a troupe of inept buffoons. DeBergi clearly knows nothing about music, and its sad watching him struggle to understand Nigel's technical explanantion of his (then) cutting edge amps. The only reason to recommend this is for the music, which even DeBergi's editors couldn't ruin. Its a shame that this turd has so badly tarnished Tap's reputation, and even caused now-defunct Megaphone records to keep their brilliant catalog out of print."},{"rating":"2","title":"get the bonus edition","review":"There's not much to say that hasn't already been said in these reviews & the reputation of the film speaks for itself.

Rob Reiner does a superb job and the film actually feels like a documentary instead of a bunch of sequences designed to entertain. This movie will particularly appeal to musicians (or those that know and love them), though everyone will enjoy the comedy of this waning band being booked second to a puppet show and doing an act with a Stonehenge set, only to have a miniature Stonehenge descend on stage.Whether it's Nigel explaining to us that his amps go to 11 or, my personal favorite part, when he starts to solo during a show, using a violin to play his guitar, only to stop and retune the violin, this movie will make you laugh time and time again. A must see for all fans of comedy delivered with a serious bent and dead-pan splendor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unadulterated Junk","review":"This is without question the worst movie I bought in 2012.

Reiner directs and co-writes with Christopher Guest, Michael McKean, and Harry Shearer (all three of whom also play the main three Spinal Tap members) and we get to see the misadventures on the road and a few live performances of the fictional band on the road. So much could have gone wrong with this mockumentary, but thankfully Reiner and co. hit the satirical aspect dead on, and many bands from the era that this film was made are rightfully spoofed and no matter who you are you will not be able not to laugh. All in all, fans of comedies or fans of heavy metal music with a sense of humor should more than give this a look."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best","review":"This is so clever that it hurts.

The characters in this film are absolutely believable and the situations they get themselves in are, too (like the stage malfunctions, and the cancelled bookings).This is a movie that never gets old, and it's recommended for all fans of comedy and music. Five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"No One Knows Who They Were Or What They Were Doing, But Their Legacy Remains\\"","review":"A seering exploration of life behind the glitz and glamour of rock and roll? Not quite, but it is an amusing mock-u-mentry on a fictitious band named Spinal Tap and the trials and tribulations on the concert road for a group long past its glory days.Released in '84 'This Is Spinal Tap' is a cult classic amongst those who are in a band, or have ever been in one. I on the other hand have never possessed any musical talent and therefore I'm not privy to the clever nuances and insightful jokes that populate this film, I can only take the word of those on the inside.Be that as it may, if you, like me, find yourself on the outside looking in give it a chance anyway.

I'm glad it was free (for Prime members) because I couldn't finish it... it was soooo boring! I can see how this would have been funny when it released in the 80s, but if you're watching it for the first time in 2012 it doesn't have the same oomph it apparently had back then. Maybe our moral standards have significantly declined, but the band's \\"shocking\\" behavior/thinking/etc. isn't at all shocking by today's standards. There's a scene, for instance, that I can tell is supposed to be funny wherein the record label won't release the band's new album unless the cover is changed. The \\"shocking\\" cover is just a woman with a dog collar on.

This would be great book to issue on cassette. It is a frustrating book if you want to use it for debating others, since it has no index and no footnotes to back up what he says. It is an overview of how the Iraq war fits into history, past and future. It gives a convincing argument why Bush invaded Iraq. It explains why Bush's jihad against the U.N. is so dangerous for us all. It also explains why the USA is overreacting to the threat of terrorism."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trash.","review":"An uninspiring account of victimhood.

Griffith once characterized Hollywood, with perfectly unintentional irony, as \\"a Detroit of the mind.\\" Griffith's mind was itself a mini-Detroit, a depressed megalopolis masquerading itself as a genuine human community. And Hollywood, that perpetual dreamworld with some distant connection with the geography of Southern California, was surely Griffith's creation. Yet another reason (as if we needed another!) to consign Griffith to one of the deeper circles of Hell. And yet (and yet!), Lillian Gish makes the film nearly bearable.

As always Steve McQueen was cool in the movie but didn't show that much emotion to hold the viewers interest. The story itself was hard to follow, not because of a complex story but because they space the movie out with things that don't need to even be in the film like Bullitt picking up frozen food at the supermarket, going to the cafe, etc.These are the kind of scenes that are suppose to build up the character but in this case it doesn't. It was totally pointless. The basis of the story is very simple. So simple it could have been told in 30 minutes if you didn't include the pointless scenes I just described. I admit the car chase sequence was pretty cool, a lot better than the 'French Connection' one. All in all the chances you will get bored are extreamly high.If you are looking for your tough cop/car chase movie than hire out 'Dirty Harry' or 'the Italian Job'(original & re-make)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"I know this is considered a classic, but I personally did not like it. I thought it moved very slowly due to the minimal amount of action. Now, I love Steve McQueen just as much as the next guy, but I really do not think he played the hard-boiled, renegade cop all that well. His face didn't show any feelings of anger, frustration or rebelliousness. This film is famous for its car chase; I am sure that it was amazing for its time, but in this day and age, it is passe. The other thing that really bothered me about this film was its silence; there wa almost no soundtrack. Save for the occasional dialogue, song or sound effect, this felt like a silent film. The soundtrack elements that were present did not seem to enhance the story at all.If you want to watch a movie about a hard boiled, renegade cop, I highly recommend any of the Dirty Harry series over this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a bad movie...","review":"This isn't a bad movie, kind of slow in parts, but makes up for that with the awesome car chases through the streets of San Francisco.

Plus the greatest car chase ever! And I'm talking actual car chase with cars! Not CGI, fake cars built for the stunts, using nitrous, or any stuff like that.

But before the night is out, Stanton and Ross are splattered about a cheap hotel room, and Bullitt and Delgetti find themselves under fire from Chalmers - the politician vows to crucify Bullitt should Ross perish - as well as their CO, Captain Sam Bennett (Simon Oakland).Good performances, Lalo Schiffrin's jazzy score, and the action combine for a crime classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bullitt,what a guy.","review":"Just a great movie.

People always talk about the car chase in this movie & you will not be disappointed. Plus Steve did all of his own stunts back then.

This is not a Raymond Chandler story. Nor is it supposed to be a modern \\"Hollywood carnival ride\\" movie, even with the great classic car chase here. Answer's are not neatly explained, if at all. If you weren't alive in the 50's and 60's you're not going to understand the context of the times and what it was like unless you dig deeper... The world moved both slower and faster back in the 1960's. In some ways the story follows like a stoned dream, how San Francisco was rediscovering itself back then.

Most of the film he looks at dead people at the morgue, and little else. He barely pays attention to his case. This movie is too [...] detailed. I remember them showing him in the grossery store 16 times. The film slowly got tiresomely slow. I was squirming in my seat 37 minutes before the car chase. When it came, all I heard was roaring motors. It was so damn pointless that after the car chase I decided to fast foward to the airport shootout. Big mistake!

I know many people like his Great Escape, and so do I, but this movie has it all. Romance, intrigue and a fantastic car chase!!! Especially because it was set in San Francisco, what a place for a car chase. The next best is our modern day \\"Ronin\\", but that's a different kind of chase. It's set in Europe, where the street are super narrow. This movie, Bullit, is a great cop movie also.

The main difference I can see on the Blu-ray copy is that some scenes appeared brighter. Even on sale for $9.99 this was a waste of money.Since initially writing this review I have decided there is one benefit to the poor quality of this blu-ray release.

Like the chases on Rockford Files, but longer, and nice and wild. Being an old guy, it came to my attention that some of the young guys never even heard of Steve McQueen. I think they should experience the old greats among stars, such as McQueen, Cary Grant, Edward G. Robinson, and so many others, at least as a basis for comparison with the stars of today. Back then you didn't have to have all the bad language to make a movie sell. Just a good plot, and good acting.

Dream matchup","review":"I would be tempted to give a five star rating to this fast moving 60s offering but not for the acting alone. The location is probably what sets this film apart from the ordinary coupled with Mcqueen at his coolest and at the top of his all to short career. There are not many films set in this city that have ended up lemons. It would be a pity if all this movie was remembered for was the sight of Mcqueen propelling a 67 GT Mustang around the streets of San Fransisco as there is much to like both in the story line generally and the adequate and sometimes brilliant casting.Don Gordon gives a standout performance as does Robert Vaughn who seldom failed to give of his undoubted best certainly during the 60s. A very watchable film for many reasons."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but didn't live up the the hype","review":"For years, I've heard about how this was one the best car movies ever, with the Mustang-Charger chase, so I finally picked it up.

All this hype for that?\\" I took into account the age and what they had to work with, but just wasn't what I had pictured in my head.For the movie itself, there was a lot of just standing and walking around to the point I was shouting \\"Just DO something!\\" The hospital chase was pretty good though.The sound and picture were good, considering the age of the movie.

Reccomended"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best movies ever made!!","review":"I loved the movie \\"Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.\\" I loved the way Gene Wilder potrayed his character. I watch this movie over and over again. Even at the very end when Charlie's dream comes true. I always cry at the end because Charlie was a good boy always trying to do good and he finally got rewarded at the end. Which comes to mind the quote that states \\"good things come to those who wait!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply the BEST!","review":"By far the best film ever made. It was the furthest thing from what is now a PC society. It tells the truth of life as a young person .Whether you were fat,rich,spoiled or poor,like Charlie. This movie was not afraid to give people a morality lesson. We need more films like this in the 90's. \\"So shines a good deed in a weary world\\"-Willy Wonka to Charlie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I LOVE watching movies in full screeen!

Unlike the other HDDVD review I read who's disc froze in the special features, my disc froze in the main movie, right as they enter the factory. This is about the worst timing, Im already into the movie, loving the HD picture, and then nothing further right when it gets to the most visually stunning part. I was bummed, still am. At least I bought it post HDDVD demise, so it only cost a couple dollars. I put the HDDVD in the drive within 15 seconds of removing the shrinkwrap, so it is not fingerprints or anything on my part.

I really enjoyed this movie. I saw the version with Johnny Depp first and thought it was hillarious. But I was curious about the original. It was just as good. I enjoyed the original ending more."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my all-time favorites","review":"I love this movie - Gene Wilder, the story, the songs, everything.

A pure delight of pure imagination!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Looks PHENOMENAL in Blu-ray. Great packaging.","review":"One of the family's favorite movies, is a treasure in Blu-ray.The book like packaging is very nice as well.Beautiful colors in the transfer. Very clean sound, although I didn't noticemuch of a surround track, although didn't really take anything away.Bottom line, if you enjoyed this movie on regular DVD,you'll really like it in Blu-ray."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful for the Entire Family...But I Bought It for Me!","review":"This is the original movie. While Johnny Depp/Tim Burton's movie is good, this one is the first! I love the American story, and Gene Wilder is WILLY WONKA! Heck, HE looks the part and sounds like what you would imagine Willy Wonka would sound like if he was REAL! No disrespect to the British, but I favour the American story best! We live in a world that somehow believes that 'Brit' is best. So, I did not enjoy the 'Britanization' of this American story. It is wonderful to revisit time and time again. And if you have seen this movie as many times as I (& my grown children) have, then you enjoy singing along with all of the songs. My favourite is Sammy Davis' 'Candy Man'...Even though Gene Wilder does his best rendition. Purchase the movie and enjoy it with your family or just for yourself! Had it on VHS, but wanted it on DVD as well (YEAH!, I live in both worlds of old and new technology!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Load up on the candy before watching","review":"In my house watching Willy Wonka is an event. It starts with a mandatory stop for candy and lots of chocolate.Then just sit back and enjoy the movie. The classic scenes are like old friends. Who wouldn't want to spend a day touring the chocolate factory with Mr. Wonka. Gene Wilder is beyond amazing in this role.Every generation needs to be introduced to this timeless classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed!!","review":"Unfortunately I received the most pruduto spensive and unnecessary. The seller sent via express dhl, no need. I was taxed on a product below $ 50.00 and the most possible service charges of Brazilian custom house. A good seller, a seller with experienced international sales would know about it and send the product otherwise. The final product was three times higher than it should be. Disappointed!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"classic","review":"I like to say that I bought this for my kids.However, the truth is I really enjoyed this movie in my youth and still do"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wily Wonka","review":"This is a movie which would fill the holiday season with imagination of what can chocolate, spoiled brats, one last button, and Charlie's luck.

I will sit and watch it day or night. As a child watching this movie, was magical. Watching it as an adult it is truly hilarious. Gene Wilders level of sarcasim is outstanding. \\"Mr.Wonka, she really won't get burned up in the furnace?\\" \\"I think that furnace gets lit every other day, so she's got a good sporting chance, huh.\\" As a child I could have seen how the Oompa Loompas may have scared kids, but since one of them looks like my Dad it wasn't too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"HD DVD has an playback error","review":"I bought two discs of this movie and both had the same error. I get a playback error about 15 minutes into the movie and the entire disc locks up. I have the Toshiba HD-XA2 and I believe I have the most up-to-date software. The only thing I can think of is this error slipped through the cracks at the end of the life of HD DVDs. It's kind of suspicious because Warner Brothers does not offer this movie as a trade-in on their Red2Blue website. My only advice is to stay away from this movie because it won't work."},{"rating":"2","title":"MOST AMAZING FAMILY CLASSIC MOVIE EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :)","review":"WILLY WONKA AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY IS SUCH ANA AMAZING MOVIE WITH GREAT LESSON BEHIND IT!

They loved the boat ride in particular, which I found rather funny considering all the controversy I see in other reviews about the beheaded chicken (which appears to me to be already dead), and the worm inching across a face (which doesn't seem dead).So, I asked them what they liked about it, upon seeing the movie a second time. The five year old (funnily enough) said that it told her that nothing about the movie was what it seemed and it made her pay attention more (my paraphrasing). The six year old simply said it was cool.Fast forward 20 years. They're still paying attention to life around them like they were paying attention to the movie years ago, and treating nothing as what it initially seems. They're extremely successful in their endeavors (right now it's college). I have wonder if this boatride scene in this movie didn't have something to do with that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential Children's Adaptation","review":"This film, an adaptation of the book of the same title by Roald Dahl, is a blitz through a chocolate factory where the children selected to visit meet a number of quite amusing fates. This a childhood classic, one that every child should see, as it's fun, and filled with classic moments. I can't comment on the DVD, but as a film, it holds its ground among children's movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie, average DVD","review":"I hate to say it, but after such a long wait, I was still slightly disappointed with this dvd. The quality is clear, the movie runs fine, even the documentaries on it are good. But (and there is always a but) some of the options dont work, like the Sing-along song section is only a couple of the songs, and the oompa-loopa song doesnt let you see the words (as the others do). The navigation is not designed as nicely as it could have been. I had been hearing about this for a while and was slightly disappointed when I finally saw the finished product. Hence only 4 stars. Still, its a classic, the audio commentaries are worthwhile, and the art direction of the menus is pretty the first time. Definately a buy"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best childhood movie ever!","review":"Anyone who puts down a childhood classic like this obviously doesn't have the child inside them. Gene Wilder does an excellent potrayal of the ecentric Candyman in his imaginative world of candy and characters. The story of Charlie Bucket,a poor boy who dares and hopes to dream of living a better life for him and his family. It never amazes me, that I cry every time I see Charlie get disappointed or let down. He is such a sweet and loving child, a child we all hope to have when we start a family. A boy who is unselfish and giving. I also adore Grandpa Joe. He reminds me of my grandpa. I also love the set designs for his factory. This film being made in 1971 did very well in the special effects category without having a computer to help out. I wish there was a candy factory today that would have a contest like that! In a world of pure imagination I guess anything is possible....."},{"rating":"2","title":"For the right price, a must own :)","review":"Being a child of the 80s, we all remember this one! If you can find it for ~$25 here on Amazon, go for it. Lots of extra goodies...and mine came still in it's shipping cardboard from the manufacturer. Also, surprised to see they are individually numbered..limited edition of 100,000. I'm not sure how \\"limited\\" that is..but still..it was a nice touch :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"The widescreen version is pan & scanned from the fullscreen!","review":"This DVD is an outrage! I had previously purchased the fullscreen version of this movie and liked it so much that I wanted to see what I was \\"missing\\" and decided to get the widescreen version. After reviewing each movie side by side on 2 DVD players, I found the widescreen version is nothing more that the fullscreen version clipped off at the top and bottom. An outrage! The result is lower quality resolution and missing images. One would be wiser to purchase the fullscreen version and zoom it in to pretend it is widescreen yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Willy Wonka","review":"Great product.

My two year old niece is as fascinated as I was when I first saw the movie. She and I sing along everytime we watch the movie together.

Get it for a child, and get one for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"The original Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory","review":"The original 1971 film directed by, Mel Stuart with Gene Wilder is a great family movie. My 5 and 6 year old girls have watched it over and over since we purchased it. My younger was a little scared during a scene where a boat is going through a tunnel. It's a must have for the DVD library and I'd say its a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"willy wonka","review":"i,m 47 and i still enjoy this movie, all my kids love it too,this is a movie that will warm hearts for a very long time to come,"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Movie","review":"First time i saw this movie was in about 1974 at the cinema.I was about 7 and i thought what a sensational movie.Many years later i still like this movie.Some movies you see as a kid,and then when you see as an adult,you see them for what they are,and the magic is not there.But i still enjoy the magic of this movie,and the excitement of winning a golden ticket to see the chocolate factory.Of coarse entering the factory and watching the children enjoy all the treats,makes you wish you were still a child.Fortunately im a kid at heart and i'd sure love to taste some of those sweets.One by one the kids disappear till just Charlie and his Grand Pa is left.Not sure id trust goung up in that wonkavator,but i would like to try some fizzy lifting drink.I'd love an Ever lasting Gobstopper.The music in the movie is also enjoyable,i think this is a classic that can appeal to the whole family."},{"rating":"1","title":"Golden ticket is an HD-DVD that plays!","review":"I went though SIX copies of this before getting one that played without issues. This is yet another title that suffered from Warner's shoddy disc manufacturing. If your copy plays, consider yourself lucky.Even with a playable disc however, you find another way Warner screwed up HD-DVDs- this, along with other titles including Enter The Dragon, The Fugitive and Lethal Weapon 2, looks like it was transferred through a screen door! Everything has a blocky look to it- if you've seen it, you'll know what I mean. (Amazingly, I've read some positive reviews of this HD-DVD when it first came out, proving that many people wouldn't know what a good picture looked like if it hit them in the face!)I don't know if the Blu-Ray, which came out a bit later, uses the same flawed transfer or not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Willy Wonka - Musical Training","review":"We ordered this film for my daughter when her theater group announced they were putting on Willy Wonka, the musical. This musical is based on the story and songs from this Gene Wilder version of Charlie and The Chocolate Factory. It was a great way for her to learn the songs and get ready for auditions. Visually, the movie is not as spectacular as the Johnny Depp version, but the story is classic and my kids love both versions."},{"rating":"2","title":"My kids found it not as scary as I did","review":"I held back on showing it to them until they were 9 and 11.

This classic is one of his favorites and he can share it with the grandkids."},{"rating":"1","title":"Irritating.","review":"This movie is about a third generation loser that defies odds to inherit a factory downtown and become a chocolatier. Charlie as he is called, is flanked by the opportunistic Gandpa Joe who has spent twenty years in bed before literally leaping at an opportunity to tour the factory of a local recluse candy manufacturer (Willy Wonka) with his grandson. Willy Wonka concocts as series of sadistic tests to weed through the list of invited children before finally choosing Charlie. In the end Charlie must choose his path but what what will it be?This film irritated me on many levels. The biggest irritation was how Charlies mother worked her fingers to the bone to support her mother, father, in-laws and bastard son all while Grandpa Joe laid in bed ill for twenty years. Suddenly when an opportunity comes his way he is back on his feet. The sheer laziness of that family is sickening. I could not watch this again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chocolate covered psychedelic dream","review":"I don't like this movie. It's dated, the 'mod' and 'psychedelic' effects clearly placing it in the late '60s/early '70s.Wonka is a corporate CEO for the new millenium, though. He closes his factory, throwing the town into ecomomic chaos. Then he brings in slave labor (the Oompa-loomps) to make his candy.The only song worth remembering is \\"The Candy Man\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this film!","review":"I used to love this film a couple years ago, then when I saw Tim Burton's remake, my love for this movie fell apart totally! It's just waaaay off the book! THERE ARE NO GOLDEN GEESE! THERE ARE SUPPOSED TO BE SQUIRRELLS! If you love the book, you'll love the new Willy Wonka movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Offensive","review":"I do not understand why this bigoted movie became so popular. I find it to be extremely offensive. The suggestion that Willie Wonka has midgets as his own personal slaves is horrible. This clear exploitation of a genetic disorder is disgusting. Not only are they midgets, but they are also orange. This leads me to believe that Willie Wonka would favor the days of slavery when non-whites were put to work on plantations. I have heard that this is a very popular movie among members of the KKK. You sheep are blind and have allowed this racist, bigoted, piece of filth to enter your children's' minds and make them believe in a world of white supremacy. Consider yourself warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nightmare","review":"It amazes me that people think that this is a children's film. No child should be allowed to view this 'horror' film.

Isn't that a wee bit overpriced?","review":"I've never been a big fan of this film, even without reading the Roald Dahl book it was based on. Just a little too lightweight and creaky for me. (not being blinded by nostalgia, I think the Tim Burton film is far superior). But no matter how much you like this film, charging $45.00 for it is simply ridiculous. (And the $65.00 list price is grotesque. I wouldn't pay that unless Gene Wilder delivered it personally) I suggest waiting until the price reaches a reasonable level."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD did not work!","review":"My children wanted to see the original version of this move so I ordered it but we were all disappointed to find that this DVD did not work in any of my DVD players."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic!","review":"If you haven't seen it, you need to.

Looking back, the Willie Wonka movie was this amazing fantasy world I was able to daydream about for years. Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory is a touching and influential film that intrigued both adults and children alike. Charlie's impoverished lifestyle and willingness to give his meager earnings away is a lesson every adult and child should learn--selflessness and pure generosity, a kind heart in a world of selfishness. The DVD is great since I never saw the behind the scenes/documentary side of the movie. With all the reality TV out there, you'd think there'd be more about the movie and the actors. Well you can find it on the DVD, along with some other great extras. The picture quality is far above the VHS verisons we all own...This is a great purchase with a great message."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wilder makes this movie worth it.","review":"Don't let the star rating fool you. Despite this movie having an absurd plot, largely unlikable characters, particularly Charlie's family, and repetitive singing from the loompas, this is a fantastic movie. But wilder and the boy who plays charlie are the ones who really makes this movie a classic. ill leave the explanation of whats in this movie to the editors and other reviewers.the reason for the 1 star deduction is because of the transfer quality. some scenes are quite bad. such as the sketchiness of when charlie runs home after finding the golden ticket. since its been ages since i've last seen this movie i have no idea if anything was removed.Overall, this is a good buy. They're are interviews with cast and directors included on this too which makes even more valuable."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Coolest Movie Ever!!!!!","review":"I love this movie!!! Gene Wilder Plays Willy Wonka VERY well!! I have a Fave part every time I watch it my current one is the part when they are in the tunnel and the wall flashes a giant chameleon and Mike TeeVee whips out a gun and \\"shoots\\" it! Note: When I was little my sister and I were scared of it< so be careful about little kids watching it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant.","review":"How could the American Film Institute leave this off of the top 100 films of all time? This film is absolutely brilliant. Sharp, witty, humorous and insightful, this is a movie that appeals to anyone and everyone. Gene Wilder's performance is eerily magnificent. The scripts and sets reward those who are scrutinous and attentive. In nearly every new scene, there is a little \\"hidden\\" joke that easily slips out of the normal viewer's sight. Watch the movie again, and pay close attention...you'll see what I'm talking about. I have seen this movie easily over hundreds of times. It is constantly in my DVD player...a great addition to anyone's movie collection. Many critics complain about this movie's oddities, but after watching it again, their comments are silenced. This movie has it all: Humor, suspense, deep and intriguing moments, lessons, advice, wit and overall entertainment. A joy to the eyes, ears, and mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"A CLASSY CLASSIC","review":"Good movie for kids, my toddler loves watching it!Older versions of classic movies are soo much better than the new ones, with so much technology and computer animation leaking into kids movie these days, not to mention off color humor, its great to see the little ones enjoy good old fashion sets where the scenery had to be made by hand and the \\"oompa loompa's\\" are real and really there on set too!

Wonka is a fascist and treats his army of servants like dirt, he has complete disregard for the death and mutilation of the obnoxious kids (sure they're annoying, but is it just sort of okay that they die?). Charlie, who remains a total bootlick through all this, is rewarded with the dubious honor of Wonka sort of adopting him and playing continuious mind games with him.

I adored this movie as a child and enjoy it even still as an adult! This is the type of movie our young ones should be watching today, a movie that teaches values and morals while dazzling the younger mind with wonder and imagination....... Unfortunately most of the movies kids watch these days are simply 90 minute commercials to promote toys that are sold based on the movie. It's all about how much money can be made, right? Willy Wonka is a gem, to be treasured by kids and adults! I agree that it would be worth it to wait for the widescreen format to be available. My DVD is actually one of the original releases that was part of the mistaken release by WB.

Gene Wilder is a hoot as Wonka, his facial expressions are classic. This movie isn't perfect but I still feel this a good adaptation of the beloved book even though people like the newer version better. The songs are addicting and Veruca Salt is the coolest snob ever! One to watch with family.

It became my instant favorite. You can believe that two years later I was waiting in line at the theater the day the movie opened. I was thrilled, enchanted, triumphant--my favorite book had become my favorite movie!What can I tell you that you don't already know? That Willy Wonka is a subversive mastepiece? That it's an adult movie for kids? Or is it a children's movie for adults? Doesn't matter, like The Wizard of Oz, Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory is a must-see for every child and every parent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Matted Widescreen Okay","review":"As a rule I don't care for the matted widescreen formating and will not get it if a true letterbox edition is available. The matted gets the whole picture in there but it usually appears a bit contorted. In this one the contortion was not too bad and it was certainly better in this case than the fullscreen formating that cuts off at least one third of the picture. All in all, the picture is very enjoyable.I also particularly enjoyed the 35 minute 'Pure Imagination' commentaries about the filming of this production."},{"rating":"2","title":"Willy Wonka Review","review":"LOVE THIS!!!!!!!

I was so disappointed. The movie is about a candy factory owner who has 5 golden tickets inserted into 5 Wonka bars that are distributed around the world. The 5 people who find the golden tickets are given a tour of his factory. The movie does teach a lesson in morals & ethics. I can't really say much about that because it would give the ending away.I didn't particularly like this movie, but it was interesting to see."},{"rating":"1","title":"Creepy and boring all at the same time","review":"I never was a fan of this movie neither was my brother. This movie is very boring and pointless. About two years ago my teacher read the book to us and then we watched this movie and I have to say, this has just about nothing to do with the book! Those geese should be squirrels and Wonka is nothing like Gene Wilder in the book. All the kids are portrayed as brats!!!!!Next, this movie is just plain creepy. The loompas are from horror movies not a child's classic. How is this even a classic???? It has no real great thing that's really going for it (maybe Gene Wilder) The tunnel is a nightmare. How did they think kids could handle that. Guess what, this film was a huge flop when it came out and then someone said it should be a classic. What happens to the kids is wrong. If you really want to see and good version get Tim Burton's version of the story so badly crushed by this trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"I should send it back, but its to much if a hasel","review":"Did not play extra martial, just showed a picture and had plenty of audio.

Well, besides the fact that this movie is a classic, and I am a film nut, but this film also has appeal for adults. There are several elements that a 6 year old just would not understand.

Too bad they had to insult Gene Wilder and the others in that new version. Gene Wilder is Willy Wonka and no one else. This film had very memorable music that is still in my head despite the fact that I have not seen this movie in a few years.

An appetizing story line, great \\"black\\" humor, an artistic accomplishment ! Chances are you will either love or hate it, perhaps wonder what it is ...

Jack Nicholson's Brooklyn mobster accent is all wrong. He sounds like a generic dummy and clearly the character Jack plays is no fool. William Hickey as the family's doddering Don is also miscast. Best here is Anjelica Huston in a vengeful spurned lover role.There's better mob-type movies and to be certain far superior home video versions of this one.

I could only bear about 40 minutes of it before I quit watching. I'm really not sure under which genre this film falls. I love black/dark comedy, but to be considered a comedy there has to be humor.

The sound seemed a bit washed out, or muted, especially during dialogue. It even seemed to be re-dubbed in some scenes. Absolutely no extras, not even subtitles, on this DVD. It was surprising how good the picture quality was considering there wasn't anything special about this DVD. Many criterion collection DVDs have worse pictures. Mainly a DVD to get if you enjoy the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Microphone does not project sound to headphones","review":"Ordered and received KOSS SB-45 Communication Stereophones two weeks ago. Shipping and delivery from Amazon was great.Regarding the headphones and microphone, the sound quality is good on the receiving end. Unfortunately sound quality from the microphone is slightly garbled - based on recorded voice tests. Most disappointing however is the fact I cannot hear myself talk over the microphone (there was no voice-feedback). If you have ever talked to someone wearing safety earmuffs, you get a feeling of how distracting this can be. You don't know if you are speaking loud enough or too softly. I work a lot through internet collaboration websites, and I found that it was simply better to use my smart-phone rather than these headphones.Having thrown away the packaging, I am doubtful I can return this set to Amazon for a refund. Be assured, unless this is a malfunction in the Koss headset, I will not purchase another product from this brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor quality","review":"The headphones are cheap made and the microphone does not work.

I tried sending them an email to let them know the problem and that it's not OK to charge customers for THEIR defective product... surprise surprise, it came back undeliverable.First and only time I will ever buy a Koss product.Off to get Amazon help as they understand the value of customer service even if their suppliers wouldn't know it if it hit them in the face with a 2x4."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had 3 of these, would not reccomend","review":"I purchased this headset on 3 separate occasions. The first set, the wire connector between the headset and the inputs came loose at the headset juncture, and the sound ceased to work. The second set is my own fault, the cat got a hold of the wires and it was toast after a week (yes, I still have the cat and he is still unbelievably lovable). The third set the microphone is now completely shot for no apparent reason, and I see that another reviewer had a similar problem.I can't complain about the actual working headset - it's fantastic and comfortable as long as it works, but I just haven't been able to keep them for longer than 3-5 months before the go bad. Would not recommend due to durability issues, however."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why do I keep buying Koss?","review":"I like Koss's design when it comes to headphones, yet the product quality is sadly missing.

Yet it brakes or shorts out or the wires come apart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good for the price.","review":"The headphones are quite nice actually, relatively comfortable and actually do a good job of noise cancelling both on the headphones and the microphone. It isn't perfect, the boom on the mic is rigid and stays a long ways from your face all the time. Also, because they're quite noise cancelling, it can be quite difficult to tell how loud you're talking unless you take one ear out.Beyond that though, for the relatively low price compared to most others on here, they perform very well. High sound quality and good comfort means a quality purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Microphone only worked a few days","review":"Microphone stopped working after a few days - of course I'd tossed all the packaging so no way to return it. I'd been careful with the headset but I suspect the cord or plug is weak and just prone to shorting. The headpiece itself is comfortable over-the-ears so ok as just headphones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not recommend.","review":"I don't recommend purchasing this item. I bought Mine around 3 months ago. They function great, but in about 3 months the mic started shorting out. Then a week later the sound was shorting, finally within two to three days, they wouldn't work at all. Now, the packaging says there is a life time warranty, no questions asked. Though, when calling for a replacement, they informed Me there would be a $9 shipping fee. After what it would cost to send Mine back with shipping and their $9 shipping, I might as well BUY another headset, another brand surely.

It always seemed a bit muffled. Now after 4 months the microphone has died (I almost never used it but the microphone connection wire to the unit is frayed) and the sound periodically goes out as the headphone connection is also going bad. I'd pay extra money if I knew connections were robust on a headphone but reviews don't talk about that.The warranty might be lifetime but you have to mail it back at your own expense AND also include 9 dollars after which they might decide it is your fault and not the product's fault.The rest of the unit is pretty solid -- it is just those connections that are not!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Headphones","review":"These headphones are really well made and work great for my use.

I knew it only had an analog stereo connection but I thought this would give me more flexibility in case I wanted to use it for my iphone/mp3 player. The sound was decent and the mic worked good but then the mic stopped working altogether after a couple months.

And of course microphone malfunction within a few weeks of buying it makes it worthless for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Koss SB-45","review":"Great product. Sound is very good on my Macbook Pro. Use it frequently to listen to music. I have also used it on a television and the sound is also very good. Would recommend the product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as I'd like","review":"Usually Koss has pretty decent headphones, however these are not something you're going to enjoy using. They work, however the sound thru the speakers is terrible, they are hot, heavy, and sweaty. After using them about 10 minutes I feel claustrophobic, and taking them off is like coming out of a dark cave and breathing a breath of fresh clean air. The mic quality is quite decent on the other end, but that doesn't make up for the other shortcomings. If you intend to use these for anything other than short voice I'd find another pair of headphones.I should note that I'm relatively young, and still have decent hearing. I've been formally trained as an audio tech, so my expectations for audio are rather high. That said, I was overall disappointed. I wouldn't spend more than $7 for these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works great but only for a while","review":"I this because it was cheap and seemed comfortable and good for a variety of things. When I first got it, it was wonderful. Lived up to expectations fully. Then, well, then things went bad. After only about 6 months of use, the microphone died. And from looking at other reviews, it's happened to a few other people too. But the headset still worked for listening. That's when the ear piece just broke off one day when I was putting them on. Just broke off in my hand. The set is now garbage and useless. I would recommend a more durable, lasting headset over this one. It had so much potential."},{"rating":"2","title":"Koss SB-45 Headphones","review":"Purchased as a gift for my \\"Mixing\\" Son and he loves them.

I think this is unacceptable--even a low priced product like this one should last at least a year. This is my first Koss purchase and I doubt I'll be making another. I noticed that the wire is very flimsy where it attaches to the headset itself, and the earphones were very hot and uncomfortable. I'm going back to my Logitech."},{"rating":"1","title":"microphone faulty","review":"The microphone on these do not work. I returned the first one for a replacement, but the second one did not work much better. I am going to try a different brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very sub-par headphones","review":"There's pretty much no way to adjust these headphones to comfortably fit. Mine actually broke at the hinge on the right headphone while attempting to get these to not sit so awkwardly on my head. Fortunately I was able to fix it with a bunch of tape, but in the process of fixing it I nearly snapped the very thin and weak cord going to the left headphone.I haven't had any problems with the mic or sound but it's a bit aggravating that there's no way to adjust either via the headset when so many other brands seem to have this as a standard by now.These are definitely very cheap quality headphones, and I regret not getting something better quality that would have lasted more than a few months without breaking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice headphones for the price","review":"I was very impressed with these headphones. For $25 I was expecting them to be some cheap plastic ones like I've gotten in the past. Even though these are all plastic, they feel like they are pretty high quality. And as for sound quality, again I was quite impressed as well.Honestly, for $25 you can't go wrong with these headphones."},{"rating":"1","title":"too bulky","review":"I guess I did not realize how heavy and bulky this item would be. I really does muffle all sound but the weight gets to be a litte uncomforable. If you are not planning on using it for long stretches, I would recommend the purchase; if you plan on wearing the headphones for a long stretch--I would not."},{"rating":"1","title":"They are now great, overpriced headphones with no mic","review":"Worked great at first. After several months of infrequent use, the mic stopped working. Would suggest spending more for a better quality product and/or purchasing a warranty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too tight","review":"The headset is too tight for my head (and head width is not that wide). There is no way to adjust the width. It is tight enough to give me a headache. I would not recommend this. (P.S. I normally don't write reviews, but I got so fed up with the discomfort that I had to write this.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"What can I say? haha","review":"I've got to say, this headset is great. I souly purchased it for World of Warcraft but now I'm thinking about buying another one getting an adapter for my Xbox 360. This is just GREAT I love it.

I would definitely reccomend this to the skyper, the World of Warcraft...er, and anything else that needs a microphone."},{"rating":"2","title":"very nice and comfortable","review":"This is a very nice headset.

Returning for a refund this time, not willing to waste any more time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Left 4 Dead","review":"I got these to play Left 4 Dead but lets says the headset was already a Zombie. The mic sort of works but it only picks up your voice if you almost scream in it and even then it breaks up and fades in and out. The padding on the piece that sits on your head is so thin they get uncomfortable real quick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great after all","review":"Mine broke after a half year or so. All of a sudden the mic stopped working practically at the middle of conversation. Considering that I have explicitly used the microphone barely longer than 20 hours I'd say it's not very long life-time. Mind you the usage was moderate - once the headset was plugged in last Fall it mostly lied on the corner of my desk.While the headset was working the performance was okay. The sound was good (and still is) but, as many note in their reviews, the headset is somewhat tight so it gets uncomfortable after an hour or two.Overall, I am less than impressed."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT BARGAINING !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This headset is amazingly gooood.

Only to find out that the microphone doesn't work, which was my initial use of buying this. I can't Skype, I can't do anything. I bought $50 headphones. Waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please skip this one, you'll thank me","review":"In order to watch this, one must be strapped to a chair with eyes taped open. It's that bad.

The story is plodding, the jokes aren't funny, I spent most of the time looking at the clock waiting for it to be over, and the nicest thing I can say about it is that it ended. It's essentially all about how Scooby doesn't fit well in any other Hollywood role but that of crime-fighter with the gang. If you are looking for a good Scooby movie to enjoy, avoid this one and The Reluctant Werewolf.

In easy to understand language he shares with the reader not only what sort of relationship one has with the traditional tantric teacher, vajra master, but also how to responsibly take vows with a teacher as well as how to choose the appropriate teacher. He further explains the many ways that the tantric teacher provides transmission, formally, informally, secretly, etc. Even though I have already chosen a tantric teacher, I still found the book to be profoundly helpful at helping me appreciate my teacher and interact with her. Thank you so much Nga-la Rigdzin."},{"rating":"2","title":"A much needed commentary","review":"This is an amazingly well-written book filled with insight. It is an important book for western students of Vajrayana to understand in terms of their relationships with their root teacher. However, it is sad that such a commentary is necessary. Since it is written using the terms and phrases of Vajrayana Buddhism, it is unlikely that non-Buddhists will understand many of the concepts. It is also written from the perspective of a Nyingma tradition using Dzogchen as the primary example of Vajrayana practice, but those of us from the other traditions should be able to substitute our own common terms in place of the Nyingma terms (for example, students of a Geluk lama may be more likely to hear about the self-cherishing mind than the dualistic mind) and still understand the point. I recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"needy","review":"The author of this book is a member of a small Buddhist flavored cult called the Aro gTer. H.H.The Dalai Lama has refused to acknowledge the authenticity of this group, and has in fact, publically advised Dharma practioners to avoid them. They in turn state that as the H.H. is not a Nyingma practioner he has no say over them. This is too simplistic, since the Chinese invasion of Tibet all schools of the Tibetan Vajrayana acknowledge the authority of His Holiness. In any case the Aro's point is undermined by the fact that the head of the Nyingma, Mindrolling Rinpoche, has also declared the Aro to be inauthentic. As have all of the other Nyingma lineage holders. Why bother with a fake when we live in a time when the real thing is so readily available? In the Nyingma Tradition there is Namkhai Norbu, Tarthang Tulku, Sogyal Rinpoche, and numerous others. There is no reason to settle for a western imitation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Condition not great","review":"Was a gift.

They stripped typical rock n roll to the bare basics, focusing on three power chords and powerful guitar notes with catchy poppy vocals. Joey Ramone made a name for himself with his simple, yet mindlessly funny vocals about beating on brats with baseball bats, sniffing glue and the Texas Chainsaw Massacre. They were nothing the rock music world had seen in 1976.Although being a punk rock band these New York outcasts were influenced by all types of music, not just punk. They took the influences of surf music, '60's girl groups and pop, blended it together, speeding it up, creating something new and refreshing. They start with a simple \\"hey ho, let's go\\" chant and blast right on through the album. They were a breath of fresh air and added a new life to the music scene."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Album","review":"This is the best album ever.

Plus it kinda sounds like it was recorded with the band playing in a bathroom, with two tin cans on a string: one in the bathroom withthe band and the other running out to the hallway with a radio shack microphone sitting in front of it. Catchy tunes but if i had it to buy over again I'd probably just d/l essential tracks like I Can't Be and I Don't Wanna Be Learned/I Don't Wanna Be Tamed and spend my hard hustled scratch on a better produced Ramones album like End Of The Century or Pleasant Dreams."},{"rating":"1","title":"ramones play heavy metal","review":"the ramones ain't a punk band, they are a hard rock heavy metalband. and all the songs on this album are heavy metal style.joey ramone still sings the same voice thogh jonny ramone playselectric heavy metal guitar. the ramones always were a rock androll band."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe they should have just one song","review":"Seriously, every song in this album sounds the same.

Loud and awful but fun as it gets.. 3 minute cuts that tore like a bat out of hell through your speakers leaving you sweating, picking your nose, chugging bad liqueur and throwing up. Just the way they wanted it. This is one of those \\"can't go wrong\\" albums all these years later. You'll never play it just once for nostalgia sake.

The album clocks around at only 20 minutes, and it represents punk rock more than any other album at least until Never Mind The Bollocks, Heres The Sex Pistols. The songs are all great, mindless fun, everything from the famous Blitskrieg Bop to the cult favorite Judy Is A Punk to other greats like Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue, Havana Afair and Chainsaw. All great songs with the tight yet simple rhythm structures that The band became so well known for. Its sad that people can be so close minded against more simple forms of music, sure complexity is nice, im a big progressive rock fan myself, but what makes The Ramones great is the genious of their simplicity...I definitely recomend this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"When someone says \\"punk\\"...","review":"This is the first thing that pops in my head.

The game play reminds me of the Donkey Kong game that was released on Game Boy back in 1994. It starts out easy, but gets more difficult as you get further into the game. I am on level four now, and the screen that I am on is very difficult. You have to grab the key and hit direction switches to make the belts go the other way, and you have to hit red and yellow switches to change the blocks into solid ones. I have tried everything to get through that level, and I am quite frustrated right now. If there was a player's guide for this game, it would really help me out a real lot.

However, I do have a fabulous CD management system that is state of the art. I have downloaded over 700 CDs in my collection.

For those of us who grew up during this decade, this album is one of those we'd rather forget. Disco had a longer shelf life and at least enjoyed a \\"comeback\\".Just for fun at your next party of 40ish YO friends - put on this album, a John Denver album, and a Donna Summer album. Measure the flak you receive in decibles and ounces of food thrown at you per song. This album wins hands down. \\"Convoy\\" by C.W.

And for that, these guys are to be revered? Gimmee a stinkin' break. Rock music was at its worst in the early '80s, and it's these shaggy-haired hippies that are solely responsible. Thank goodness the world was soon saved by Motley Crue, Def Leppard, Styx, AC/DC and Dokken. For without those groundbreaking metal bands, we'd still be saddled with the dusky '70s boredom that is Bread.Avoid this sluggish \\"rock\\" at all costs, and instead pick up anything Motley Crue or Judas Priest.ROCK AND ROLL SHAN'T NEVER DIE!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Telling it like it is","review":"I bought this book because some ancestors fought in the 47th Viginia and many lived in the Fredericksburg, VA area, where the 47th took most of its men.

Anyone with ancestors in this unit, this book is a must."},{"rating":"2","title":"Early explanation of Edwards' theology","review":"This book is an early explanation by Denis Edwards regarding how he sees Karl Rahner's systematic theology as a way to explain Christ's redemption of all of creation. The book is easy to read, and especially so if one is familar with Rahner's concepts about Christology. Only in the last two chapters of the book does Edwards start to expand his own theology which is more relational than Rahner's.This is a small easy-to-read chapbook. If one wants some of the emotional highs and lows regarding Edwards' ecological theology, then some of his later books would be preferable. If one wants a quick overview of Rahner's relation to evolution, this book meets all expectations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Recording","review":"A fantastic concert film for fans of either Gorgoroth or black metal in general.

The special features were very good also, especialy the bio's, as i was very happy to discover the make of guitar Infernus uses (Eugen for those interested).Not much more I can say realy, as most black metal concert dvd's are of extreamly low audio/video fidelity (possibly deliberatly so), this stands out as being one of the best I have seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"crappy dvd","review":"the guitar sound is awful & they are not a very tight band,you can barley hear the drums,the video quality is good,i would only recommend this for hardcore fans as there are many better black metal dvds out now..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Husband loves it","review":"I got this for my husband for Christmas and he was ecstatic!

As Jesus said often, the strong faith and innocence of children is to be envied and emulated by adults if they wish to enter into the kingdom of heaven. These children reflect perfectly that strong faith and innocence."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Beautiful, Remarkable Film Depicting the Fatima Events","review":"This is a beautifully-crafted film depicting the events surrounding apparitions of the Virgin Mary in Fatima, Portugal in 1917. Susan Whitney, portraying Lucia, is remarkable; her hopes and her fears are portrayed with a true quality. Lucia is forced to honor both the wishes of the Blessed Mother and those of her earthly mother, who attempts to reconcile what her daughter is saying versus what the townsfolk and authorities expect. We are able to see how faith plays out in the lives of the masses and how large groups react in certain situations. There are many modern-day implications of the Fatima events, and many of the prophecies were very specific and came to fruition. The acting, the beautiful music, and the facts and theories surrounding the events at Fatima drew me into this movie and kept me for the duration."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"I was so glad to get this movies. It is an old favorite of mine, and I have had a hard time finding one of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful movie","review":"Recreates the true story in such a heartwarming way.All the actors were impressive...especially the child actor who portrayed Sister Lucia."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring","review":"I have watched it many times in my life. I am 64 years old and I never tire of watching it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Divine Intervention in Human Events","review":"'The Miracle of Our Lady of Fatima' is a likable and earnest reinactment of the events of 1917 when Mary, the Mother of Jesus, appeared to three peasant children in Fatima, Portugal. Facing persecution by family, friends, and the newly established atheist socialist government, the drama shows how timely events unravel their significance in human and spiritual history.As a film it is above average for selection, acting, and development. The children's key performances are mostly heartfelt. Susan Whitney is particularly convincing as Lucia, but Sherry Jackson as Jacinta is nearly as believable. Gilbert Rolland plays Hugo, a hearty but well-meaning skeptic-sinner who offers some needed tenderness for the children. As a movie, 'The Miracle...of Fatima' is a decent and memorable viewing experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"One star for the film, one for Gilbert Roland","review":"This film is much like Song Of Bernadette. What this film lacks is a good cast, a good script, and good direction. I very much enjoyed Song Of Bernadette but this film is so poorly done it became hard to watch. I found Gilbert Roland the only reason to watch the film; to watch it as a film that is, not as a confirmation of faith. Whatever you believe or disbelieve about the event in the film can you actually imagine the Virgin Mary would appear and say the Russians are bad people? Of course we were in the middle of what was called the cold war when the film was made and the Russians were the bad guys, but I laughed out loud and began to enjoy the film because it was so bad it became funny. Viewed just as a film, this was horrible. I gave it two stars only for Gilbet Roland, even out of place in this poor film he was an actor I admired.If you are a person of faith you will probably like this film, but if you are a fan of classic films pass on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor casting ruins the movie","review":"The girl playing Lucis is much too old for the part.She looks like she is l4 or 15 years old. The realLucia was only ten years old at the time of theapparitions. The other two children are extremelypoor actors and not believable at all.There was no need to add Gilbert Roland's character tothe story. It only dragged the story down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Story","review":"Ordered this from Amazon and it was delivered very quickly. I was not aware of this story or the events of what happened before I watched the movie. But I was moved by it. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a movie that will hold your interest. It will make you feel good. The events are very interesting and told well in this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring movie","review":"There is a lot to learn about this film. Truly it is the most amazing movie I haveever seen so far. And am grateful that there is Amazon to purchase this kind of movies atsuch a cheap price, even the less income could buy. Getting back to this particularmovie, there is emotion to see 'Our Lady' and at the same time happiness, thatI GOT GOOSE BUMPS.As I rate this the highest, I recommed this movie to be bought by anyone. I wouldhave purchased it even if it was more than the regular rate.Good Luck to all other Amazon Customers - Liz"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fatima Rewritten","review":"An incredibly sentimental 'account' of the Fatima apparitions of 1917, completely unhindered by any of the true facts, and presented in the rose-hued glow of a Hollywood studio. Ironically one of the best things about the film is the addition of a totally fictitious 'loveable rogue' (Gilbert Roland)and his donkey - so that should give a clue as to the quality of the rest of it. Still, the film is entertaining, and the depiction of the Miracle of the Sun is done well. If you want the definitive dramatised film on Fatima, seek out \\"Apparitions at Fatima\\", made by Daniel Costelle in the late 90's and available on video - it was actually filmed at the Cova da Iria with a wonderful largely amateur Portuguese cast. Accurate, very moving, and photographically ravishing. Costelle's film received both Papal approval, and that of Sr. Lucia, the surviving seer of Fatima - recommendations don't come higher than that!"},{"rating":"2","title":"MIRACLE OF OUR LADY OF FATIMA WAS WONDERFUL","review":"SUCH AN INPIRATIONAL AND FULL OF EMTIONS.

Truth be known, I think this is the best disc I've seen, as far as quantity and quality of songs goes. If you're into the techno/pop genre, this should definitely be your soundtrack. I pretty much like it all, but I really like the tracks from \\"Olive\\", \\"BT\\", \\"Soul II Soul\\", and \\"Everything But The Girl\\". Plus who hasn't cut-a-rug to \\"Information Society\\", \\"EMF\\", or \\"Ace Of Base\\" at one time or another? Some of these songs are obviously dated at this point, but that's part of the appeal.

Over 15 years after receiving the story I have it memorized and keep the book with me wherever I am."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I really loved The Fall of a Sparrow and greatly looked forward to another beautiful novel by the same author. Unfortunately this one fell apart about halfway through. Unlike the characters in The Fall of a Sparrow, too many of the characters in this book didn't sound or feel like real people, especially the grown-up Cory. The girl who painted an obscenity on the Appleton water tower was an intriguing character of few words seen mostly through the adoring eyes of the book's narrator: the grown-up woman just never took life on the page, despite the many long conversations in which she took part. The story of an American white boy's attraction to a black girl and his (surely realated) lifelong devotion to black music could have been a fascinating and far-reaching one: unfortunately this time the author fails to bring any satisfying insight to the subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapppointing","review":"I was happy to find this book, having enjoyed Sixteen Pleasures. That novel was interesting and clever nad the premise was compelling. Unfortunately Blues Lessons seems very dull, and not just in comparison. I found the characters unbelievable and unsympathetic. The protagonist was boring and the way he chose to live his life quite unlikely. The love of his life was more interesting but the book provided little insight into her motivations for denying that love and for keeping her daughter from having a family. The daughter seemed incredibly incurious about her father and was not at all a believable teenager. The purported exploration into race relations was nonexistent. Overall the book was a great disappointment and tedious to get through."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like DC Talk and TobyMac","review":"This was my introduction to KJ-52.

I listened to it and I have to say that \\"KJ\\" has no place in the world. His voice and flow are an Eminem knock off and the beats are also Eminem knock offs. Or actually cast aways because a real rapper wouldn't even want to be heard over this crap. Him trying to dis Eminem in anyway is ridiculous considering that KJ is trying to be Eminem.

Plus several others that really ministered to me.You can hear longer snippets of his songs by going to his webpage that is kj52 . com. Wonderful for youth fans that need godly fresh hip hop.

Gregory Peck is a stiff, as usual. And Ingrid, dear, you just don't pull off the mousey-and-unglamorous thing.The worst: that pseudo-Freudian mumbo-jumbo, embarassing, naive and reductionist. I kept waiting for Peck to get his memory back by getting konked on the head with a rock. These scenes don't even have the excuse of being dramatically compelling - they have the feel of a cheesy educational film you'd see in a high school psychology class.It's beyond me why this keeps getting praised while the superior \\"Marnie\\" (which admittedly has some similar problems in the psych department) keeps getting slammed.Liked the cinematography and the dream sequence, tho'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hitchcockian Fun!","review":"This absorbing thriller for the mind is moody, romantic, mysterious and atmospheric. The beautiful Ingrid Bergman is great as the Psychiatrist who is looking for a way into Gregory Peck's mind. Peck's coldness actually makes him perfect for the part. Michael Chekhov is also great as Dr. Alex Brulov. Excellent score, and the 'gun camera' sequence are highlights. The dream sequence is definitely a standout, it is filled with cubist imagery and is simply masterful. Filled with the \\"Master's\\" usual tricks, Hitchcock managed to create another unique movie. Extras: Hitchcok's usual cameo, this time getting out of an elevator.

The famous Salvador Dali dream sequence is everything it has become famous for, a spectacularly subtle and understated seduction sequence - itself almost a dream - and the famous single frame \\"red flash\\" at the climactic confrontation. The film is in black and white yet Hitchcock and Selznick induced the company to insert a single or pair of red frames at humongous expense in a subliminal bit that freaked the audiences. This is called power in Hollywood. For the next 40 years nobody restored the red flash - until Turner and Criterion did the disk - too ridiculously expensive for B&w; prints and VHS.And the score - fabulous!

Gregory Peck is very convincing as the mysterious and peculiar Dr. Ballantine, who comes to work at the mental health facility. It becomes obvious that Ballantine, who turns out to be as troubled as many of his patients, was involved in a crime. Amnesia prevents him from remembering the details.

I mean, you can't remove the individual monster pages from the book, which means a lot, especially if you're a DM like myself who likes to use several different kinds of monsters in a single encounter or even a single game session.

Some DeTerlizzi works do stand out, but I wouldn't buy this book just for a half dozen pictures. The reason to get it would be the lore. Every creature is described not only in terms of physical appearance and combat tactics, but \\"ecologically\\" as well. What it eats, what it's lair looks like, what it's body parts or eggs can be sold for, who its allies are etc etc. You find out, for example, that Green Dragons and Hill Giants hunt each other's young and each considers the other a dire enemy and a rival for territory.I think it can be safely said that this is the only book in existence that describes the alchemical uses of some 250 fantastical creatures and how many young they bear (or how they replicate themselves, in the case of undead). If this is interesting to you, then by all means buy this book. A used copy is only about 6 bucks before shipping."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another good Classic","review":"Book in good condition.

It concisely describes all the elements involved in running a fun, exciting campaign for everyone involved. It is also commendable in that it tells you often that the rules outlined are merely guidelines- nay, suggestions, and it encourages you to make your own rules.One thing I would have liked would be some more actual examples of gameplay, as this would help new DMs to get the feel of the game quickly. But these can be found elsewhere to those who care to look.Overall, a very useful book. An indispensible resource to any DM."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't do it!! Don't order this bench!","review":"I ordered two in May for Memorial Day. They arrived in June, and were packed so poorly that the FedEx driver apologized for the condition of the boxes. When I opened them, I found the parts were packed in thin cardboard and loose styrofoam. The wooden parts were gouged and scratched, and several metal parts were broken. I needed these benches for a memorial park, so I ordered another, and that one was just as bad. I was able to take parts from all three and make one that was presentable after I sanded and revarnished the wood and painted the metal parts. Amazon customer service said I could return the damaged benches, but how? The boxes were in no condition to return anything. I decided to contact the company to order replacement parts for the broken metal pieces, twice. It's been two months and I'm still waiting.

Burman) is outstanding, the photography is better than ANYTHING Hollywood has ever put out, and this is before CGI, so everything is REAL, not artificial! This was also the BEST debut by any actor EVER in Hindi cinema (Amjad Khan), and it was pathetically remade by a has-been director in the 21st century called Ram Gopal Verma who DARED to assume that he could \\"remake\\" this classic.

His plots are interesting enough in these Scottish police procedurals, but he weaves them through the lives of Inspector John Rebus and those close to him. Great character development, great details about Edinburgh, and the investigation is step by step, believable, timed just right. This is an early Rebus novel, so the language and style aren't as polished as later ones in the series. So what? Read them all. This is one of the best detective series going."},{"rating":"2","title":"I somehow missed this one","review":"While living in Spain, I had to get most of my books from Amazons UK site. That is how I discovered this author. I thought I had read all his Ins. Rebus novels, but missed this and found it here. It is as good as the rest. I have never been dissapointed in his stories. Some are weaker than others, but none have I not enjoyed. It was nice reading this one as it gave me more background on Rebus' past.He is a very well fleshed out character, with a very intriguing personality. Rankin also describes Edinborough very well, and gives a very good impression of the city.If you haven't read a Rebus novel, do. If possible start with the earliest and go in order, as his background develops with each novel.Highly recommended"},{"rating":"1","title":"boring and long winded","review":"After seeing the interview of Mr. Rankin on CBS Sunday morning I was very excited to read one of his books. I picked this one up and quite frankly wished I hadn't. To see that it is back ordered surprises me (maybe everyone else saw the interview).

Well done, Mr. Rankin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I couldn't get into this book. I didn't think the characters were very interesting and I really couldn't get too excited about the plot. Perhaps I found the characters too pathetic.

Now I have to buy all the expanded editions....","review":"...and retire all of my original editions. The remastering brings out much richer tones in the guitars, clearer vocals, and more driving bottom end. It doesn't change the fact that you're listening to the Ramones (there's no sense of studio fakery), but it does show you that the earlier limitations of the technology (and of the Ramones' budgets) really did a disservice to the music. The remastering is amazing, for example, the song Pinhead always had a very muffled tone, as if it were performed in a padded cell. It was always a great song, but with the remastering it literally explodes out of the speakers. What it really proves is that the Ramones were even better than we thought. Assuming that the other expanded editions are this good, then all my old discs are on their way to the \\"Used\\" bin at my local music store."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD remastering compromises excellent album","review":"The Ramones have fallen victim to terrible remastering on the latest Rhino reissues. The sound has completely changed. Listening to the original lp's that I've bought and then comparing the sound to these, demonstrates a clear decline in the power and intensity of the recordings.If your looking for cd issues of the four original lp's (all brilliant), the cd remastering on \\"All the Stuff and More\\" (I and II) seems minimal and therefor far superior in sound quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"reproduced","review":"This disc does not sound like the original record. It sounds slicker and prettier. It does not sound like the recording that shook the foundations of rock and roll. It hasn't been \\"remastered\\"; it has been \\"reproduced\\". As such, most of its original vision and power is lost.A shame because I've waited for years for the first four Ramones albums to come out on CD with their original artwork.

I settled on Ramones Leave Home as the one that best captured their early raw power, urban disaffection, and straightforward embrace of inanity. This did the trick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost useless","review":"The author takes the old D'Alembert system (he doesn't even spell it right)and lists various bet choices in casino games where you can try it. What's remarkable is that he recommends NOT trying many of the variations he suggests in the book. He then goes on to admit that this system, which has been proven over and over to fail (like any other progression), actually doesn't work in a real casino, and then tries to blame casino cheating! That, combined with his religious rantings that have nothing whatever to do with the subject at hand, lead me to seriously question this guy's grip on reality. In fact, one wonders why someone who is so worried about Satan and evil is encouraging gambling in the first place. His \\"Mathematical Analysis\\" sections contain neither math nor analysis. Send me your money instead and I'll recommend much, much better books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beat The House","review":"Fascinating. He takes the same systems Wall Street institutional investors use to milk the stock market and uses them to milk the craps tables and roulette wheels. He hints that the casinos are crooked, and have to be kept in the dark about the fact that you're using a system, otherwise they'll allegedly cheat you. It would be nice to see some proof of this, but the systems themselves, the first one in particular, HALF PEAK, are extraordinarily thought-provoking. He would have donebetter to have just stuck to mathematical gambling systems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some comedy value","review":"I bought this book based on its claim to provide mathematically sound analysis of gambling games, based on stock market strategies.Reading it led me to the conclusion that the author does not have even rudimentary knowledge of probability, expectation or house percentage. His \\"analysis\\" consists of doing sets of 100 rolls of dice on his kitchen table!He then goes on to the inescapable conclusion (to him) that the casinos are \\"cheating\\", since his schemes don't work there.I was so disgusted that I took the time to complain to the publisher, and ended up corresponding to the author himself, who repeated those claims. I even took the time to do a trivial analysis of his \\"half-peak\\" system, together with some extensive computer runs, just to show him how bad the systems are."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book to read","review":"The Tryst is an excellent example of Grace Livingston Hill's writing.

The widescreen is a Godsend for those of us who were annoyed with the VHS version's constant panning, and the audio is greatly improved.

Brilliant director that Wilder is, he builds up the suspense so much during the flight, that we're not even sure Lindbergh is going to make it to Paris. Jimmy Stewart is great in the title role, giving us a man who is as scared as he is brave. My only complaint is that Wilder only chose to show one aspect of Lindbergh's life. It would have been much more interesting to also see the kidnapping of Lindbergh's son, and his support of American isolation during World War II. I don't want to dwell on the negative to much.

Patrice Leconte is an excellent director, and it is one of my favorite movie of his. Daniel Auteuil is a great actor, I like him in all of his movies, and Vanessa Paradis as well. It is so far in my opinion her best movie (I still haven't seen heartbreaker but will soon). She is a great actress (and has been since she was a teen) and she is a great singer. Her charisma in this movie is incredible. I would recommend that movie to anyone who wants to have an idea of what the cinema Francais has to offer.

The soundtrack is phenomenal. I have seen \\"Girl on the Bridge\\" three times on the big screen and each time got lost in their world; the chemistry between Daniel Auteuil and Vanessa Paradis was sizzling on all levels. This little movie is absolutely absorbing, romantic and memorable. The only slight criticism I have is that sometimes the subtitles were illegible against white backgrounds; however, I was happy it was a French-language movie because it added an extra dimension to the characters..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Runs like a long Calvin Klein fragrance commercial","review":"This movie is a piece of eye candy disguised as an independent film.

She has no talent and appears listless in this film as adele. The only good on her cd Bliss was her long-standing boyfriend Johnny Depp's help in writing some songs and playing guitar with his outstanding talent. But I'm getting off this subject. The point is, she should never have tried her deformed hand at acting for her long neck is very distracting and takes away from the movie. The other actor's performances were fine, I am sure, but I would not know since her lisp was too prominent for me to pay atention to anything else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful!...","review":"What is wrong with Vanessa Paradis' gap between her front teeth?!

This is Morrissey at his best lyrically since \\"Vauxhall,\\" and his voice sounds great as well.I was a bit skeptical when I heard Jerry Finn (see Blink and Green Day) was producing the album, but this is the richest, most developed single Morrissey has released as a solo artist.

I'm about angst, so you should know that, I feel real deep anger at the world for all the suffering and torment I have been through, like when my parent's wouldn't drive me to Hot Topic to buy me these totally boss black shirts.

As soon as my music teacher put the cd in the stereo, everyone freaked out. They were shocked that someone would be willing to play such an awful cd at school. The first song that we heard was Helena and you couldn't understand any of the words. The singers were screaming and moaning about death. When someone handed my music teacher the lyric book, a look of horror crossed her face. I'm sure that this is what she was saying in her mind \\"What has happened to today's youth?

I am not and expert on instruments and how to play them, but the music sounds pretty good on this album. Gerard should work on his vocals though, I can't understand a word he says in a few of the songs. I think the two most notable tracks on here were \\"Helena\\" and \\"Ghost of You.\\" They really did and outstanding job on these two songs. I really think this band has potential.

It isn't a bad album, but after 2 years their style has changed. It lacks the punch that the first one had, and it also has a more mainstream sound that a lot of bands have adopted. Perhaps their lyrics still have the same meanings, but even their single 'I'm Not Ok (I Promise)' sounds like a cross between a Christmas song and some pop-punk band. Overall, buy it if you are willing to accept their new style and seemingly new guitar style. If you were hardcore a My Chemical Romance supporter, be prepared to be dissapointed.

I went out and bought this CD and 'I Brought you my bullets, you brought me your love.' I listened to every song on each CD.I LOVE this band to death. The lyrics are filled with emotion, and the music style, pure original. I think the greatest song on this CD is either 'I Never Told You What I Do For A Living,' or 'Hang Em High.'If I were you, I would go out and buy this CD and 'Bullets.' This is my favorite band of all time and will be forever. Don't listen to what other people say, if you want the CD, go buy it.

It was forward, emotional, and kept me listening for more. Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge is a refreshing change of pace from the pop and rock we commonly hear on the radio. Topics that are taboo have been hit on hard, ranging from prison rape to coming back from the dead. I highly recommend it to anyone with an open mind and a love for music."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little different from first but still great","review":"I was going to buy this on June 8th, the day it came out but I didn't have the cash so I got it like four days late... Oh well. First off, if you're even reading this review, you probably know how much MCR kicks arse in the first place. To compare albums though with the last one is where it gets a little picky. They both rock. After listening to \\"Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge\\", I found myself very pleased. It seems like yes even though there is less screaming and more pop influence, the song writing and sound has improved a bit. You can tell that they spent more than the three days they spent on their debut album. If you liked the first album, go buy this one, you'll most likely like it. As others have said, I would give MCR one more album and they will own the entire scene."},{"rating":"1","title":"After Hearing I Brought You My Bullets.....","review":".....this album did not impress me at all. In fact i am turned off by this album completely. I feel their first work is more talented and it overall sounds better then this album. Sure, there are definitely one or two bright spots. The first track (and 2nd single i believe) Helena is a great song. But it all goes downhill from here. The Ghost Of You (3rd single) is the only other decent song (terrible video though lol). The first single Im Not Okay (I Promise) is not a good song at all and gets annoying while listening to it. Thank You For My Venom has a great intro but.....well thats only the intro...the rest of the song is blah. If you want some good MCR, and some great Gerard Way (Lead Vocals) pick up I Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love. The lyrics are way deeper then this albums lyrics."},{"rating":"1","title":"no","review":"yes, i fell into the MCR hype. but its been almost a year since i fell into that hype, and ive left the MCR franchise forever, feeling betrayed. i was into them back when the video for Im Not Okay was just some live footage of the guys goofing around on stage and such. i loved it and got into them quickly. then they got super popular and the band said no matter how popular they got that they would never change. but they did. they changed alot. its sad to see a good band go bad. i cant even listen to this junk anymore. it sounds so fake to me. i cant believe i ever liked it. just overpriced junk in the sea of bad music that is today."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Chemical Romance","review":"Three Cheers For Sweet Revenge is a very good CD.

Disco, New Wave, Mallcore, and now this commercial brand of Emo are all fads that more or less die off when their fans grow up. The bad news is that this sort of music will continue to pollute the airwaves forever, but the good news is that this particular fad will die off in five years or so. This commercial tripe isn't even really emo, Fugazi was emo. I digress. As for the music, it's just what I'd expected. Poppy, angsty, and without much musical substance. Even the solos are pitiful, barely better than the leads regurgitated by Cobain on Smells Like Teen Spirit. If you're between the ages of 12 and 16 and think you're the most misunderstood individual on the planet, then buy this disc. If not, look elsewhere for music with some substance to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album - Not What I Expected","review":"MCR sparked my interest after I saw the newest music video for \\"I'm Not Okay (I Promise)\\". I listened to a few other songs and ended up buying Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge. I was surprised and happy to find that the other songs weren't as poppy and mainstream as I'm Not Okay (I Promise). So a message to those who first hear about MCR from this song (since it's been played so much): If you can't stand the poppyness, don't give up on MCR; give the rest of the CD a try. If you are absolutely in love with the poppyness, listen to the other songs on the album before buying it. The other songs are quite a bit darker and not exactly your typical MTV lineup sort of thing.That being said, the other songs are still catchy but they do have a bit more depth to them. I hope that MCR doesn't fall victim too much to the rabid MTV crowd. I'll still listen, but it would be a sad fate."},{"rating":"2","title":"A new, original and theatrical sound","review":"The fresh sound of MCR makes them easily stand out in today's generic music industry as they bring a new approach on all fronts and blatantly refuse to conform.There is not another band right now anything like these guys.In \`Revenge' they showcase their new handle on song construction (virtually invisible in \`Bullets') creating epic songs with story-like fluency, most notably the 3 stand-out singles \`I'm Not Okay', \`Helena' and \`The Ghost of You'. Yet the whole album is full of songs that add into the overall themes of the band as each are great and frantically paced songs that most importantly carry the unmistakable signature of MCR.This original and genre busting major label debut is a must have for any true music fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"this band is as punk rock as a little pink dress-stay away at all costs and hope that this pop trend will end","review":"rock band that everyone knows that by now and lets face it it HAS to be just a matter of time before not just kids but everyone stops listen to this junk cause everyone knows that all of this sugury sweet pop crap isnt cool and is just going to go away it cant last and soon listen to it will just make you the most uncool person in the world and i agree the sex pistols are punk rock in its most raw, hardcore form and if anyone wants to know what real punk rock sounds like they should listen to the sex pistols album -Never Mind the Bollocks Here's the Sex Pistols- or listen to any sex pistols album for that matter and if they arent willing to listen to give that a try or if they just handle that then they should just except that they are just part of the pop crowd and leave the punk rock to people gives it the respect it deserves"},{"rating":"2","title":"OMG!!!!!","review":"I LOVE MCR...

And it wasnt even like it was a good minute. The song just kind of dragged on with the singer only singing three songs. Sure its suppose to be peaceful, but its not. This song was a waste of my money. I will never get that minute back. Every time i heard it start, I would have to quickly push the \\"next\\" button. Its not like i completely blocked the song out of my head. The song is a parasite that once you hear it once, it will get stuck in your head whenever you even hear it begin. I was sitting, waiting patiently hoping that something good would happen in the song. But the good part never came. The best part that happened in that one minute was when i heard it change songs to one of my favorite songs. If i could have paid an extra $10 to just have the song not in my album, that would have been awesome. It would have been well worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW An Awesome CD","review":"This is seriously one of the best cds i have bought in a long time!!!!!! There are always a couple tracks on every CD that i dont really like but thats not the case here!!!! every song is so GOOD!!!!!!! and it isnt all punk rock because there's kinda a mix of music on here!!!! the vocals are amazing and the language isnt that bad (only in one song they say the F word :)) this is such a good cd and i cant wait for the next one!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sell-Out","review":"Before you buy this album, go and buy MCR's first album, \\"I brought you my bullets, you brought me your love\\". Listen to it, compare it. Their first album is true and raw, this album, is a complete sell-out fake. MCR completely sold out to get rich, there is no intensity in this album, it's all cinematics. MCR's \\"single\\" I'm Not Okay (I promise), is without a doubt the worst song they have ever written, there is no intensity, it sounds like something you would find on some teenage boy-band. My advice, borrow the cd, listen to the tracks, give it back, and buy their first cd. Listen to something that has feeling, I recommend Drowning Lessons. Nothing from this sell-out."},{"rating":"2","title":"im not ok","review":"great collaboration. my chemical romance is such a sensational goup and came up with a sensational album.album highlights:1 the ghost of you2 thank you for the venom3 im not okayi would absolutely recomend this piece to everyone"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"I seriously believe this is the best album (especially MCR album) I have ever heard. Yes I am one of those punk kids who dies their hair and wears black, but I was doing all of that long, long before I heard any of MCR's music. I believe their music is really inspirational and sung well.

About half of my school or so likes My Chemical Romance, and I like the most of the music that people at my school like, punk rock wise. But I was suprised so many people like this band, the guy can't sing, and the music is not so good. From the songs I listend to I heard no ones that I actually liked and I was very displeased with this album overall. It was a waste of my time listening to it, and I would not ever recomend listening to them. I heard that they're good live, but I don't know for sure myself casue when they came here I was busy at the Senses Fail/ The Bled concert listening to real music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Um...","review":"Ok listen this band isnt good i mean all they do is scream. There lyrics in some of there songs are ok but this isnt music... if you want real music check out (Straylight run, Brand new or Cursive)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally Kick-Ass Album","review":"My Chemical Romance is one of those bands that is really refreshing in a world of stale music. To try and categorize this album would be a feat in and of itself. Their influences range from Punk/Emo to 80's fantasy metal to hard rock to a number of other things. This combination of styles probably wouldn't work anywhere else, but MCR have come up with a style that works and that fits them completely. Gerard's vocals are very emotional and pull you right into the songs, especially on the first track, \\"Helena,\\" and the guitar work is impressive with its solos and grooves. I recommend any rock lover to check this out. Standout tracks are: \\"Helena\\", \\"You Know What They Do To Guys Like Us In Prison\\", \\"I'm Not Okay (I Promise)\\", \\"The Ghost Of You\\", and \\"I Never Told You What I Do For A Living\\", but all of the tracks are awesome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbelievable","review":"Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge is such an unbelievable cd. It isamazing. I love it. I'm usually into a lot harder stuff like dimmu Borgir and this cd is one of my favorite. There is nothing to say that is negative about it. The only song i didnt rate 5 out of 5 was, The Jetset Life is Gonna Kill You.And even though it wasn't 5 out of 5, it was still 4's. To wrap it up, this is definetly a buyer, and if you do get it (Which you should) you will not be unsatisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mostly a poor album","review":"'Ghost of You' is a great song. However, everything else on here is pretty bad. I like MCR, they have a lot of potential to put together some good music. Unfortunatley, not on this album. If you can get the 'Ghost of You' single, do so, but I can't recomend that you buy this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Frickin Awesome","review":"Awesome is such an understatement for this album and this band.

On the older one I liked about 6 songs, but on the new one, there was not a single song I didn't like.Seriously, if you didn't like their older album then you have to buy this one. I swear that you will not regret it.With songs like \\"Helena\\" (SWEET music video) \\"The Ghost of You\\" and \\"I Never Told You What I Do For A Living\\" you'll have to like this CD.MCR rocks!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"hmmmm","review":"i think my chemical romance is a pretty good modern punk/emo/hardcore band. i first heard of this band when i tuned into a radio station and the dj said that this as one of his favorite bands and i heard the single I'm Not Ok (I Promise)a couple days later. i liked it the first time i heard it and it eventually became one of my favorite songs on the radio. months later i switched my tv to MTV and saw the Helena music video. Gerard Way looks like he is about to cry throughout the song which is proof to me that he doesnt mindlessly sing about the sadness that he does. my personal favorites on the album are Helena, Give Em' Hell Kid, I'm Not Okay, Thank You For The Venom, It's Not a Fashion Statement(,)It's a Deathwish, and i Never Told You What I Do For a Living. the only thing that kept me from giving this cd 5 stars is that I can't really listen to it when I'm angry, and I have listened to it so many times, that all the depression kind of gets boring......its a great cd though buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Production + Bad Band= Decent Album","review":"I must say, this album was a guilty plesure for a little while. I think theres are well written pop rock songs. good hooks and everything but see this band live and it will change your opinion. I saw them last year open for Lost Prophets and they SUCKED so bad! It made me realize just how much of this album is production. The singer is TONE DEAF!!! He can't sing for his life! The drummer plays the same beat over and over again the guitarists have no idea what rythem is and the bassist may as well be playing a mop. This band is a train wreck live! MCR got lucky they got their songs produced this well! because before this album all they had going for them was their straigt out of hot topic looks. Download this album or buy it used because its not awful but for the love of god, don't see them live or pick up the first album because both of those experiences are quite painful."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite band, my favorite album.","review":"There's no question that I love this CD.

The first was warped by my three year old. Anyway, this special edition vinyl version doesn't sound to good. I think they just ripped the digital and not the master tapes. The Black Parade sounded fantastic, Three Cheers not so much. It's a shame too because I like this album so much more. The extra stuff that comes with it ain't too shabby either.

Every song on this album is different in its own unique way, which keeps the listner intently waiting for what the next track my bring.THEY ARE NOT EMO. ALL YOU EMO KIDS OUT THERE GIVE THESE GUYS A BAD NAME! Just because they have a couple sad songs such as the first track [helena] does not make them emo. nor does the ammount of makeup thy wear! They're main influences consist of the MISFITS, MORRISEY, and IRON MAIDEN. I repeat they are not emo. The chemistry of this bad is amazing. The 2 guitar players, [frank lero, ray toro] come from totally different musical backgrounds, which come together beautifully, to make MCR's FAST, AGRESSIVE, beatiful punk/melodic sound. I give this album a 5 out of 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"It isnt all bad","review":"I dont think you could call this album completely bad, there are some good songs on it like Helena, Cemetery Drive, and Ghost of You, other wise the album is pretty tasteless.

I was actually just listening to launch on Yahoo and the video for Helena started playing. At first I didn't really know how to react, to think this was a stupid song or to fall in love with it. Well, turns out I LOVE IT!! I love the band so much I've got tickets to see them this September. Surprisingly enough, there is not one song on this cd that I don't enjoy. They all have a different toon and they all are so original. I respect anyone or any band that can write their own music and MCR is number 1 on my list. If you have never heard of them or just a curious listener searching for new music, i recommend MCR and this album. You'll either love it or you'll hate it, but if you love emo/punk and The Used, you'll definately love MCR. Not to mention, their frontman Gerard is pretty hot... and so what if he wears makeup...that's a plus!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Musically, this is a horrible album.","review":"many people would agree that I have great taste in music. pretty much one of the many reasons I study music in college, along with being a musician. So listening to this album...I found so much wrong with it, musically. Didn't pay too much attention to the lyrics, but I can say the vocals did not redeem what I heard. Overall, the album is very sloppy. In their songs, they cannot stay on a consistent path or style. Their sound will not give you a chance to set it into your ears before it either goes soft or really loud, and you can't really understand whats going on. Not necessarily my prefered guitar style either. I can't believe Fall Out Boy said this band is better than them. At least Fall Out Boy stays a constant, steady path, with good lyrics, and if they change style, it's at the end, and it actually makes sense. Moral of the story: don't try to make all your songs sound like a quick paced medley, popping in about 10 melodies per song."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whts with all the hype?","review":"I must say that I had heard so much about this band, so I decided to give this CD a whirl. I try to listen to all kinds of music with an open mind, and even though most of my reviews are for metal, I am not some Mullet-Metal head that goes around bashing anything that isnt metal. What I am bashing is the musical talent of this band. NONE! I understand that MCR isn't a flashy rock band and try to write simple songs. It just doesn't work for me. It seems like every single song lacks any kind of emotion or feel, and MCR might just be another flash in the pan punk-rock act. If you like simple music or this genre, then stick to Nirvana, Chevelle, or even old school punk/rock like the Sex Pistols or The Clash. This one is a solid turkey, and unless they do a huge turnaround, I dont see them lasting to long in the music biz."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very dissapointed.","review":"I didn't like this as much as I thought I would. The only songs i like are the ones they released as singles. I'm Not Okay (I Promise), Helena, and Ghost of You. I'm sorry, but this album ia sappy. Most of the songs are ment to emotionally sad (or at least that's what i think)and you know what, they failed. Pretty much 54% of the songs have the same topic to it. Thank you for the venom doesn't do much. The lyrics are boring, the beats have all been don't before.

After the third song, I left the house of blues!!!In concert they get TIRED after the first song and sound HORRIBLE.The CD was pretty good, but if you seem them live, you can tell they mess around with their voice a bit... but a few songs were good.

Although the scale of the figures is just right and the appearance is excellent, these toys do not \\"play well with children\\". The sword and shields are removable. However, you are likely to break off an arm while extracting a sword from the Knight's grip. This happened even to me, though I was being careful.

The rigiht ear piece is basically dead now after about a month of use daily. It seems like putting them in your ear breaks the speaker cone or something. Would not buy again. When they did work they sounded O.K.

I got them for $8.88 but I would still buy them for twice that."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm Disappointed......","review":"I ordered these because most reviews were favorable and they were inexpensive. I plugged them in to my Sansa C150 and they sounded average, at best. Yes they sounded better than my OEM buds but not by much. The bass was actually too deep and treble response weak (even after adjusting my equalizer settings). As for comfort, they felt good and stayed in well.I just expected better from a 4+ star rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"These are not worth $9 shipped","review":"Stay away from these headphones.

I warned you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Runners Beware!","review":"I bought these earbuds to replace the bulky ones that came with my mp3 player, and every time I run with them in I wonder if I made the right decision. The left one doesn't even stay in my ear past a mile or so, and they make a yucky sticking sound in my ear canals with every step. The sound may be good, but it's only possible to concentrate on the sound when walking!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great noise isolation - if worn properly.","review":"This will be my second pair of earplugs since I flat-out wore out the last set.Understand that you have to squish the foam part before sticking it in your ear. That way, it conforms to your ear's contours, won't fall out, and blocks nearly all outside noise. I would listen to my iPod while riding my lawn tractor, running a weed whacker, or flying in a noisy commuter aircraft and not have to crank up the volume; thus, it's easy on your eardrums while sounding really, really good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bigger than I thought","review":"I was disappointed in the size of these buds. I thought they would be smaller. I probably won't use them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse Than My Dollar Store Headphones","review":"I purchased these headphones as a replacement for my set of ear buds (Koss SPARKPLUG - Stereo In Ear Ear Plugs. They came with a little white case and an extra set of the foam covers. The bass was a little strong, but I'm far from an audiophile, so it wasn't an issue. I just turned the bass reducer setting for my ipod on and I didn't notice it anymore. What really bothered me was the mute button. Every time I so much as brushed against the button, my headphones would cut out. More recently, after no more than 10 short uses, the headphones would only play out of one ear. I was furious, since this is the reason I end up replacing all of my headphones. It wasn't the usual damaged wire that was causing the problem, though; the mute button somehow became slightly dislodged. When I wiggle the button, the sound goes from ear to ear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Variable quality?","review":"While others have found these buds to be pretty good, my set is horrid. They have underdamped bass, overbearing \\"boxy\\" mids and dull high end. The tape mod helps a little but not enough to make them listenable. I suspect that there's a lot of variation from one set to another -- they're cheap, so cutting corners on quality control wouldn't be a surprise. For the price they're worth a gamble but be forewarned. I've had much better luck with the Koss Plug (not \\"spark\\"plug) units."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated, even with tape trick","review":"If you want cheap, knock-around earbuds, these should fit the bill.

Although I had no sound quality issues with the ear phone set that came with my iPod, the were uncomfortable and would not stay in the ear. I tried about 6-7 ear phones, ranging from $40 to $100 and was unable to find one that sounded good to me.My wife had the KOSS Spark Plug already and they sound great. At this price, you can't make a mistake, great sound, comfortable and excellent price. I bought myself a pair and and very pleased!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very comfortable, great sound, low price, just-right length cord","review":"The title pretty much says it. I like these ear buds for just those reasons. I own several pairs, one for each device that I own. Too many ear buds have a short cord, making them inconvenient. This cord is just right - not too short, not too long. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"They fit!","review":"I've had trouble finding earphones that fit right. Every other kind of bud I've tried has fallen out of my ears within seconds. I have been using Koss KSC75 over-the-ear phones, and they're good for audiobooks, but they sit too far away from my ear canal to give me good quality music, unless I either turn them up loud enough to cause hearing damage, or wear a headband to press them closer to my ears (uncomfortable and looks dorky).So I am pleased that these earphones stay in my ears and deliver enough sound even with the iPod volume low.Yep, they are muddy-sounding with too much bass, even with my iPod EQ set to \\"treble booster.\\" Covering the holes in the white ends with tape seems to help sharpen the sound.Finally, the price is right. I tend to destroy earphones within a few months so I prefer inexpensive ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect accesorie for my Ipod","review":"I purchase this ear phones to use with my Ipod and i'm very please with the sound. I used them every time that i can and they block the noise very well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent sound quality, terrible construction","review":"From the moment you open the box, you realize how cheap these earbuds are. Granted, they cost $10, but the foam looks like it was ripped from a stained seat cushion and barely fits in your ear. Once you manage to squeeze them in, they gradually expand and fall out within about 10 seconds.Seriously, they're inexpensive, but they're still not worth it. Go with the JBuds or another product. Koss makes great sounding products, but these earbuds are simply a poor fit for your ears."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites","review":"I tend to buy a lot of earbuds and keep them in a variety of places (gym bag, office desk, car glove compartment, etc), and this is one of my favorites. I get as good a quality as I get from bigger headphones, and it really cuts out ambient noise nicely. My only quibble is that you don't get enough of the foam buds so that you can replace them when they become worn or lost."},{"rating":"1","title":"eh.","review":"These earbuds aren't very comfortable, which might be handleable if they actually worked well. They don't though, so much so that attempting to listen to an audiobook left me unable to decipher whole sentences. I gave up in frustration, and was more than happy to go back to my ipod earbuds. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent for the money","review":"These work pretty well; the sound isn't great, but I use them for books on tape/CD, so they're fine for that, and they work well w/my Ipod Nano. One side sometimes cuts out if it's not positioned just right in the ear. There's a little noise when you run...not sure if it's the cord bouncing or the ear piece moving in my ear, but it's bearable. The noise cancelling is OK, better than most ear buds, and the rubber ear-plug type insert that goes into your ear is very soft and comfortable and stays in pretty well, even when jogging on a treadmill. The cord is a little too long for use w/an Ipod strapped to your arm, but it's tolerable. Overall, these are a good deal for the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good for the price","review":"You really get more than what you pay for. Although I had to do a little extra work to get them right, and yet they are a little too big for my ears, but for that price, my God!!!First off, you have to glue the earbuds with crazy glue, because they come off really easy, second they don't come with a clip to hold the wire, but most headphones don't have that either.It takes a few seconds longer to to adjust to ear depending how you feel comfortable with how deep inside the ear they need to be.While you chew food you don't hear yourself as much as with other brands.Also, you don't waste as much battery on your device, at low volume they sound louder than any headphones.Believe you me, I did my research and you won't find better headphones for that price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy these!","review":"I bought these earphones and they lasted about 6 months until the left plug just stopped working. Stupidly, I went to buy them again and got the ones with the mute button - even worse. The button is really sensitive to pressure and the just touching the wires makes the sound cut in and out. This happened after a few days of buying them. Now it is about a month after buying them and they hardly work. I've read reviews on other websites and I am not the only one this has happened to."},{"rating":"1","title":"And 6 months later.........","review":"Well after six months of seldom use and many untanglings the Sparks have become Sparkless! Apparently a wire has become frayed where you plug them into your listening device. On the Koss website they want $6.00 for S&h to replace. No way go for a different brand. The tape I had to use over the outer holes to reduce bass was annoying as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent 'Big' sound","review":"Unbelievable sound. I use mine with a SanDisk E250 and it they reproduce the sound as well or better than any headphones i have ever used. They shape to almost any ear, plenty of cord length and they come with extra ear cones. Great value and great sound. I have reccomended to co-workers and friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much more comfortable and secure than standard earbuds","review":"I'm not an audiophile, so I can't really comment on the sound quality of these headphones. Basically, they sound just about as good as other headphones.But I can say they are WAY MORE comfortable than the standard earbuds supplied with ipods and other mp3 players. I found that the standard earbuds were very uncomfortable in my ear canal and also had a bad habit of falling out of my ear. These Koss plugs are far more comfortable and stay in my ear much more easily. Just a quick pinch of the foam and pop'em in your ear...they'll stay put and won't irritate your ears the way many hard plastic earbuds might."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great deal!","review":"These headphones limit the external sound really well. I bought them because I found myself needing to turn the volume on my iPod up very high when riding the train to and from work. With these headphones, I can hear the music at about 40-50% less volume. I think the sound quality is better than the stock iPod headphones too. These are a great buy for the money. They limit sound, but not too much, and sound great. The only negative I can say is that they can be a little tricky to position at first, and in my ears, they might not stay in very well while jogging or other high impact activity. But I can't say for sure. But just walking around and sitting they stay in just fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uncomfortable, muffled sound","review":"Is it my ears, or do these Ear Plugs sound just plain bad? Once I had them out of the package, I regretted buying them. Poor build quality, cheap looking plastic. The soft material fit into my ear canal alright, but the \\"deep, rich sound\\" everybody was raving about ... I just couldn't hear it. I was so disappointed, I threw them into the garbage. My worst purchase this year. $12 completely wasted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the price","review":"As good as the $40-$80 equivalents, in my opinion. I had one pair of these fail on me after a few months, but that could always be coincidence. The pair I have now have lasted me at least a year.Not only does the in-ear foam design drastically improve bass and lower-end frequencies, but it's also a lot more comfortable and stays in your ear better than other earbuds."},{"rating":"2","title":"They Don't Hurt My Ears","review":"I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE these!I have ear problems and all the earphones I've tried physcially hurt my ears, but not these. The black part is soft and molds to your ear. Sound is good, not great, but good."},{"rating":"2","title":"OK for non-audiophiles","review":"I just got these ear plugs and have used them a few times, and I can confirm what many have said about the sound--to me it has a somewhat muffled quality. I only use them for podcasts, though, so for this price they're fine. The buds themselves seem a bit flimsy and may not last as long as others I've had, but a big plus is ready availability of replacement cushions.Koss PLUG Replacement CushionsI don't care what anyone says--they get a little funky after awhile. Fine for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will you ever learn","review":"Something else that will end up in the landfill. Will people ever learn? It's just another $10 peice of junk.

So they're constantly falling out. The sound quality is good, but not worth the hassle of having to constantly put them back in."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice and inexpensive upgrade from Apple's IPod headphones","review":"I have had several pairs of these over the years and have to keep buying them after lending them out or gifting them because these Sparkplugs are so nice and cheap. They do a decent job of isolating too even though they are not isolating headphones. The bass is impressive in these (which means some may need to turn down the bass while others will finally enjoy hearing it for the first time). If you lose or are dissatisfied with your IPod's headphones (or any other player) I would highly recommend these as a cheap replacement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uncomfortable!","review":"I am tired of headphones falling out while I run, so I bought these headphones. They do stay in a bit better than other earbud style headphones, but not much better and at a cost. First, they still fell out and I was constantly pushing them back in while running (frustrating!). Second, they sound terrible! They produce a very low, muffled bass note that overpowers all other notes. Even with a custom eq of no bass, no mid, and all treble, I could barely hear over the loose base notes.My recommendation? Don't buy them! I wanted to be an advocate of these headphones and was excited to have them arrive. I was pulling for them to be something great, and was nothing but disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"muffled with drowning bass","review":"i am a fan of koss earphones and have a purchased a few different pair in my lifetime and was never disappointed. these ear \\"plugs\\" are very comfortable but sound muffled and bassy. i was very disappointed. i immediately went to best buy and bought a pair of sony mdr-ex51Lp high performance earplugs. They are overpriced, but not uncomfortable and sound fantastic. you can actually hear the highs and mid range. i was hoping for comfortable earbuds that sound great for a fair price. buy the sony's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great headphones","review":"I bought these for my iPod so I could wear them when I workout. Regular headphones fall out when I start sweating. These don't. They're like earplugs and they stayed put during my entire workout. They are very comfortable because the foam makes a customized fit. The sound is really good too, but you might have to change the equalizer settings because these headphones increase the bass. I would suggest using these headphones at a very, very low volume if you're working out outside because they really do cancel all the noise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Distorted Sound","review":"The sound is a very deep base, even with the tiny holes on the outside of the ear pieces covered by tape. The sound produced is loud, and my mp3 player needs to be turned down to it's lowest volume setting. The plugs that fit in the ears are uncomfortable, and tend to fall out when I jog."},{"rating":"2","title":"No other choice.","review":"These are by FAR the best buds in the low end price range, hands down imo. I have really small ear's and could never keep ear buds in, but these stay in great, I can't even shake them out. They are very comfortable also, can wear for extended periods of time no problem. They are a bit bass intensive, due to the foam, it blocks sound outside but intensifies bass. That can be fixed with an EQ, or replacing the foam tips, I ordered replacement tips off eBay, different material much less bass, still great sound. I could ask for nothing better in this price range. Great Koss Product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't like it as much as JVC marshmallows","review":"Sound is pretty decent, I haven't had the glaring issues others have. It sounded comparable to but slightly worse than my JVC HA-FX34 Marshmallows that I intended to replace with these. The bass is there, but the higher frequencies don't come through as clearly as I would like. Again comparing it to the Marshmallows, the spark plugs lack the presence I feel with the other earbuds.The construction is very light weight. The big earpieces probably fit most ears, but they did not fit mine very well. They always felt like they were on the verge of falling out, though I never ran with them to see if this would happen (this problem is easily remedied by buying silicone replacement eartips, but that is beyond the responsibility of the consumer at this price range). Also, the cord would not straighten out and is prone to tangling.It's OK overall but I would not buy another, considering the Marshmallows are about the same price and more widely available in stores."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very impressive","review":"Nice. I do lawn care and so these poor things see a LOT of torture. But they fit incredibly well and cut out an astonishing amount of background noise.

Do not get both, you will be disappointed by the Spard Plugs."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate these headphones!","review":"I just bought these headphones at a CompUSA store that is closing and I can't return them. Even though they were only $15 they aren't worth a penny. I can barely hear anything that comes out of them, they fall out of my ears, and are very uncomfortable. I really think anyone that rates this higher than one star is being paid for their reviews. I will sell these to anyone that wants to see how much they suck for half the price I got them.Buyers beware! These headphones suck no matter what they cost. I could get better quality form dollar store headphones. Stay away!!! I hate them so much I felt like I needed write a review. At least I'll know I might save one poor shmuck $15."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty good sound that won't last long","review":"I really like this headset because I have small ears and standard earbuds will not stay in my ears. To date, however, I have gone through 4 sets. Though the sound quality is good, the headset seems to quit after about 6 months. Granted, I listen to my Nano nightly for 2 or more hours per night, but I am quite gentle with them. Can one be more gentle than to listen while sleeping?! Standard Apple-issue earbuds last longer, but lose their little covers all the time, which is annoying. If you really want to try in-ear buds, these are good ones if you can get them cheap and in bulk. Just don't expect long-term performance. And consider super-gluing the earplugs onto the main earpiece (carefully so you don't plug up the sound!). I found this really reduced my chances of losing them."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice sound","review":"It's quite comfortable in the ears and stays in a lot better than the i-pod earphones. It stays in the ear pretty well if you're just walking or strolling around. It's not so good for vigorous movements like running since it does fall out pretty easily. The sound gets better the more you use it, but overall, the music sounds nice enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeper","review":"Great sound for inexpensive earbuds. They fit comfortably but stick out of your ears a little too much. Hard to beat for the price though. I wish they would come in black."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Pair of Cheap Headphones","review":"The review by FightOrFlight is pretty accurate. These are very good headphones for the money. Many complain about a booming bass tending to muddle the sound, but I tried FightOrFlight's technique of covering up the port-holes in the back of the headphones with scotch tape and then poking out half of the holes so as not to completely deaden the sound. The result was very good, clarity is excellent, imaging is good, the bass is still very present but not overpowering.These are a big improvement over the stock iPod headphones. Make sure you have the fit properly or you may run into some problems. The fit is the only mild warning - my girlfriend, who has smaller ears than I do, complained that they felt very uncomfortable to the point of being painful in her ear. I haven't experienced this myself, but if you think you may have particularly small ears, the Spark Plug may not be for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sticking Cotton-Covered Pen Caps in Your Ears Would Sound Better","review":"1) To put these earbuds in, you need to roll the foam, insert/wiggle it into your ear, then hold it there while the foam expands in your ear. Then repeat for the other ear. Every time.2) Once in, they sound very boomy. Studio recordings began to sound like cheap live bootlegs. Apparently this boominess can be fixed by sticking superglue/tape over the airholes? But then they'd still take a minute to put on every morning (as in Drawback #1).On the plus side, they DO seal out a lot of outside noise. The problem is, the noise they make in your ears is even worse!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"I've been on a quest for decent ear buds for ages and someone recommended these to me. They have to be the worst ear buds I've ever had. Firstly, they don't stay in your ears at all. I choose the smallest bud and they still pop out. Because the buds have changable ends they always come off in my purse and I have to search for the stupid thing. Finally, they get soooo tangled its crazy. Since these don't come with a case or anything they just get un-usable in your purse and require minutes of finding the ear pieces and untangling them every time you want to use them."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor","review":"I was expecting to use in gym, if you have such an intention do not even think about buying.

I'm quite familiar with the material used for the earplug pieces as it's the same stuff I used to use for ear plugs in my shop. If you get 3 months out of these, I'd be shocked. And it's a good thing they're black too because you'd be disgusted by how filthy this foam gets when it's bright yellow.As for the sound: I was used to my Sony ear buds which I initially refused to replace because of their evil DRM schemes. These Koss earbuds sound like I've played my Sony's through a wax paper covered pillow. Muddy, no highs, absolutely horrible. I actually spent money to sell a little piece of my soul and bought replacement Sony earbuds.I gave it two stars because they were cheap and they worked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Koss should be ashamed of themselves for poor quality control","review":"I have been a stereo connoisseur since the 70's and have always studied and only bought the best for the money value. About 6 years ago, i bought a pair of Koss Spark Plugs and still have them. The pair that i bought 6 years ago are the most comfortable ear plugs that i have ever had and they still have exceptional base. However, i wanted another pair for my wife and when they arrived they had NO BASE whatsoever. They are extemely \\"tinny\\" in sound and even my wife acknowledged that they did not sound good at all. They are the exact same look and name, but apparently Koss doesn't do quality control anymore and I would suggest buying another brand, preferrably American made. These apparently are made in China, where all bad products come from."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice!","review":"I use these instead of over the ear headphones while playing my Roland V-Drums. They are much more comfortable for long periods of use and they sound great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"BIG improvement over the original iPod earbuds!","review":"I hated the earbuds that came with my iPod--they wouldn't stay in my ears unless I jammed them in until they hurt. I read some good reviews of the JVC Gumy headphones, so I bought a pair. Another disappointment--they are virtually identical to the original Apple ones, except that they only come in weird colors that don't go with my iPod. So I tried a pair of these Koss Sparkplugs.
