I keep in touch with friends from grade school through my current business life, all across the world. Fathers and sons connect playing fantasy football, friendships are stregthened (sometimes tested though), and it is a great diversion from the challenges of everyday life. Also, the draft is a great reason to all get together once a year and reconnect, face to face.Bottom line, Committed captures the soul of the game. Well done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Dissapointment","review":"I received this as an XMas gift and can't get through it. The book feels forced and manufactured.

The expertise with which she crafted her first book were completely absent in this one and I found it hard to believe it was the same writer. Lil Mama's rules is an unoriginal story told in an unoriginal and completley predictable manner. It lacks creativity, surprise or even that special thing that makes you want to turn one page and then the next until you realize that you've spent the entire night reading and it's time to go to work.

Madison was truly a woman of the 90's. It started a little slow, but once you keep reading it gets better and better. It made me realize that men do make mistakes but you sometimes have to dig beneath the surface to find the reason why,and the same goes for ones self. It was hard for her but in the end everything pulled together. Keep up the good work Sheneska!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book, mostly because I could relate to Madison in so many ways. I laughed and cried with her, I was mad when she was mad, and sad when she was sad. The characters and events felt so real. This book shows that even if you run from it, LOVE will catch up with you sooner or later."},{"rating":"2","title":"lil mamas rules","review":"This is a good book,I read it long time ago it touches on HIV in young black women.It has a good story to it.It really makes you think."},{"rating":"2","title":"The first Blowfly I ever heard","review":"After I heard this record, I was a new person. This album is so great, everyone in the world (unless you are offended by four letter words) should own this album. My friends and I have listened to this album so many times and continue to laugh with every listening.Sit back, relax, and find out you're horoscope.Blowfly Rules!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"For what you pay, you get.","review":"This is an ok product - considering you only pay about $100 for it, it's ok.It took my husband and I about half an hour to put it together, with relatively little pain, though some of the bars were bent from shipping and we had to use a hammer to adjust them, and some of the assembly holes had to be pushed through a little bit.It's too long for our bed, however, so it sort of bends on the top, and the ends sort of bow outward at the top. It was about five inches too long compared to our mattress and frame.We've only just set it up, so we'll see how it holds up, but for $100, I was willing to give it a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"Diversity Explained","review":"A good book. Gives all sides to Diversity issues and is coupled with many first hand articles that are very interesting. Definetly worth a read if you're interested in issues of diversity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Convoluted thinking","review":"This book starts with an absolutely unreasonable, poorly written, and perverted essay that tries to undermine the basic framework of our society, the family. The author, Ms. Rosenblum, does not believe in any absolutes and holds to the belief that all suffering and wrong-doing is caused by societal influences. In between all of the perverted conclusions she does provide encouragement to accept people for who they are, not as a thing, but as a person, but I was unable to even follow her reasoning as to why one should do this.Overall I would not recommend this book to anyone. I feel sorry for you if you are assigned this book as require reading or as a textbook for your class my sympathies are extended out to you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"eye opening","review":"very interesting book. really makes you look at how people treat each other and how we cope with our differences."},{"rating":"2","title":"facinating insights","review":"This book is great for anyone who is interested in questions like why do we as Americans' see white people and black people differently. It answers questions like this for gender, race, ethnicity and disability. The first chapter is terribly dry but it sets the stage for the rest of the book which is very insightful.(There's a bit of good history in here as well)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Dry","review":"Reading this textbook is very, very dry. The readings are boring and don't relate well to the subject material. If your teacher orders this book, fight to switch it! It's terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHY?","review":"Why would any professor want to use this book. I was doing alright until I came to the chapters on economic growth. These chapters used old data. How do you gauge economic growth and its effects on the poor when you are using data from 12 years ago(6 years from the edition I have)? A lot has changed in 12 years, especially with the recent economic downturn we took. There are many excellent lessons in social construction and diversity but the outdated information takes away from some lessons."},{"rating":"2","title":"Early 1900 decorating","review":"This is a great book if you are thinking of doing 1920's restoration.

It is sparkly and looks \\"believeable\\" for the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I hoped for","review":"The necklace I received didn't come the the chain in the picture. I don't even know if the chain it came with is sterling silver or not. Not impressed with the earrings or the necklace."},{"rating":"1","title":"You're kidding. Right!","review":"So full of errors that one must assume that the producer is not the scholar of Okinawan karate he claims to be, or any other subject for that matter.As far as being a \\"Professor\\" is concerned, repeated requests to the \\"scholar of the Okinawan martail (sic) arts\\" have failed to reveal what university awarded him a Ph.D, and in what subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mom","review":"The dog is very cute, but that is about it. First, it calls for \\"D\\" batteries on the box as well as on the battery compartment; however, when you open up the case it holds only \\"AA\\" batteries. After inserting batteries he breathed once and then stopped. He still doesn't breathe regularly but will occassionally when my husband hits him in the correct spot. If my daughter didn't like the animal so much I would return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't deliver on it's promises","review":"When the Amazon provider decided, after 10 days, that they didn't actually have this item in stock, I had to reorder it elsewhere. The item is very disappointing. The breathing motion is hardly noticable, and the \\"Snoozing sounds\\" are just the constant drone of the tiny motion motor. Yes, it's cute, but it's really nothing more than a plush knick-knack."},{"rating":"2","title":"Abook of justice and spirituality","review":"This book is among the best islamic and human books Ihave ever read.Indeed, one can not read and grasps the book without knowing its writer and his other titles.Mr ABD ESSALAM YASSINE,the great spiritual and political leader who has played a big role in clarifying the holy messages of QURAN and SUNNA. The book under study introduces ISLAM from its clear and pure origins.It talks about the strong relationship that exists between ISLAM and MODERNISM.Its writer wants to say that ISLAM is not against MODERNITY; Islam is against terrorism ,colonialism , sexual degradation , selfishness , opression in all its dimention...(islam is against EVIL be it human or satanic , individual or collective , organised or unorganised ).This book presents sanity , justice , brotherhood ,saintlove , peace...to both Muslims and none Muslims. We hope that people all over the world see and read this valuable book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Wonder of the Bun","review":"Bread is one of the world's oldest prepared foods, dating back to the Neolithic era. Wonder Hot Dog Buns, 12 oz is modernity's take on this most ancient of foods. And what a vast improvement the folks, no geniuses, at Wonder have made with this delicious side-loader.I hear the Wonder Hot Dog Bun is the preferred bun of Takeru Kobayashi, the world's fastest hot dog eater.If you're looking for a fine mix of deliciousness and speed, choose Wonder Hot Dog Buns, 12 oz. Unless of course you practice Discordianism, where hot dog buns are considered taboo because of the \\"Original Snub\\" as depicted in the Principia Discordia."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bun did not cool dog down","review":"My dog was hot. I gave him the bun to eat, hoping that it would cool him down. He seemed to be panting as much after eating the bun as he did before. I would have to say that the \\"hot dog bun\\" did not do a good job helping my dog keep cool. In the future, I will stick with giving my dog water."},{"rating":"2","title":"AT LAST!","review":"I am so happy I found this product.

I tried to open my Tissot and SOLVIL et TITUS , no luck at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh does this make battery changes easyer","review":"Before I found this I was using needle nose pliers and as you would expect it would scratch the back of the watch. This tool make it a snap. good product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will not work on large watches","review":"So beware, for regular size watch's only. Will not open a Marine Star, or anything bigger."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very unusual tool","review":"It was very difficult to find a retailer to unscrew the back of my watch off-so that I could purchase a battery replacement-since the watch was not purchased from any of the retail stores. I do not know what I would have done with out this tool. It is very inexpensive and comes in a wooden case to hold the different attachments for almost all kinds of watches. It is very unusual looking and it takes a little time to figure which attachment are best to use on my watch. But once I figured it out-it was great-and I was releaved to have accomplished the task. It only took seconds to unscrew the back-change the battery and screw back on. A really neat tool. I can use it again and again. Thank you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value and does the job","review":"A couple of minutes to set it up and insert the right tips and I found it pretty easy to open up my Wife's Tag watch to replace the battery. A handy little tool. Unless you are stupid you don't really need any instructions on how to use it, its common sense and easy to use. For the money I think its a bargain. Add the cost of this tool ($15) plus the cost of a new battery from Walgreen's ($5) I ended up saving over $55 on what it would have cost for a watch store to replace the battery. Don't pay these rip-off store prices for battery replacements, just do it yourself and get a tool like this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"... Does the Job >>>>>>>>>>","review":"This item performed what I needed it to do. Please don't try using something from your toolbox if you value your watch - you stand a good chance of scratching the heck out of it and hurting yourself. I washed the mineral oil off this tool (and my fingers) before I used it on my watch. You may need to use pliers to wiggle and force the pins onto the tool - no big deal. If you really need instructions, you probably shouldn't be opening up your watch. The wooden case is ridiculous, but who cares? Now, I can't wait for my watch battery to die so that I can use it again. Guess I'll take this tool out again in a couple of years from now... if I can find it then. :-)Bottom line - good functional tool for a handy person, but not a precision tool like your watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Watch Case Opener","review":"Actually, considering the price; this is a \\"5.\\" The box contained all of the materials necessary to get the job done. Precision, it is not, but accurate enough to align with the cover and remove the back in seconds. I cannot understand why some users claimed the parts are too loose when all you need to do is apply some pressure when inserting the lugs into the handle and they will stay in place very nicely. Over all, I am pleased with the product, the quick service, and vendor."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheap product","review":"The bits keep falling out of the holder. I cannot use it at all. When I have the handle up-side-down to insert the bits, it's fine. Then I have to turn it down-side-up in order to put it over the watch. One of the bits fell out from the handle. without one of the three, I cannot open the watch case. Totally useless. It didn't come with the wooden box. It came with a cheap blue plastic holder without the cover. It's just a plastic case with holes for the bits and a longer hole for the handle. It's only half the length of the whole handle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"I guess this is a love it or hate it item. I hated it and I sent it back. It didn't come with any instructions. I guess I got a different tool than the people that said it was easy and wonderful. I'm a college grad and I couldn't figure it out. I emailed the company and they sent me directions but they talked about a vice..what vice? and how it opened up..it did? The pins had no way to stay in place. Too frustrating and it didn't open a thing. You know what did open my watch? A sharp knife! Worked like a charm and it was free!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waterproof Watch Case Opener in Wooden Box","review":"Look like a sturdy tool. Does not look like waterproof. I found moisture in the plastic that wraps the tool and trace of rust though it appeared to have been rubbed with oil."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this","review":"This product is poorly made. The pins fall out as you hold it face down. The other reviews are correct in that you have to hold it upside down to prevent the pins from falling out. Don't buy this. Go to Wal Mart and get one for three bucks in the watch department and save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"sucky.","review":"I was able to open one watch with this. The rest I fought for hours trying to get the pins to stay when i went to unscrew the back. don't waste your time with this. i'm ready to throw mine in the garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Waterproof Watch Case Opener","review":"Another very useful tool to have for anyone that likes to maintain his / her own watches. This easily paid for itself the first couple of uses compared to the ridiculous rates that the mall shops charge for replacing batteries. It is fairly simple to match the proper pin sets and to adjust their distance to easily open any waterproof watch case that is threaded on (not friction fit)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works as advertised","review":"This tool is solidly constructed. It comes with an assortment of attachments and adjustable configurations for different types or brands of watches. It comes wrapped in a sturdy protective wooden box. The tool was a little greasy / oily when I received it in the mail which I found to be a little unusual, but understandable from a preservation perspective. It's a good tool. Get this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good tool","review":"Product was as advertised. I used it right away and it did the job. wood case was in good condition and case opener was also in good condition. Instructions were poor but after playing with it, I was able to figure out how to use it.Well worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good tool for the beginner to work on watches...","review":"I wanted something to save me money on changing waterproof watch batteries. I was paying almost $10.00 to have it done, now I changed out 3 watches for the price of this watch case opener! It cost almost $14.00 but it saved me more than twice that!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"I've always considered myself mechanically adept but I had trouble using this tool. The instructions need a great deal of work. My advice to the manufacturer would be to develop a fixed device that I have seen work on jeweler's benches. Also, to be more effective, the heads should consist of a two-sided static pieces and two sides that can be adjusted. Oh, and you will want to fix the base from up and down movement. Otherwise, the watch merely squirms away from the wrench, as it does now.I would not buy this wrench again.If this review was helpful, please add your vote."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Made","review":"The product is very poorly made. The bits don't fit very well into the tool and the verticle handle adjustment is very sloppy and loose.However, the customer service was excellent when I contacted them and an immediate refund was issued."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paper box not a wooden box pictured","review":"Ok the tool looks real cool in that wooden box with the inserts each in a little hole. What I was shiped was in a paper box with the tools in a little paper box.Sorry - not as represented!As far as the tool goes - I feel riped off and I'm returning it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Case opener","review":"It is constructed nicely, however I could not open any of my watches with it. The pegs kept falling out of the box. Hard to work with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"you can't use this watch opener alone. You need a vise to hold the watch. The gromets that go into the opener that are supposed to fit into the watch back grooves do not stay in. As soon as you turn it over they fall out. I've already lost two of them. It's a poorly made item, and if it woldn't cost about as much to return it as keep it I would return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am not mechanically challenged but","review":"I find this tool to be rather useless in most cases. It can really open only one type of watch back. The design may be \\"conceptually\\" right, but it really is not workable. I have at least a dozen watches,that belong to the family members, that needs battery change but I could only open 1 of them. Plus if you have an expensive watch, do not use this tool. It can scratch up the sides and the back. At least this has been my experience.I am not very impressed. Thing is I don't know what else is out there that I can use. The construction of the tool seems to be robust, but it really does not work or work only for very specific watches."},{"rating":"1","title":"The pins don't fit","review":"I could not figure out how to get the pins to stay in the slots, which negated every other positive aspect of this tool. It looks good, has a nice case, feels nice to the touch, and comes with 4 types of pins. However, the slots have small protrusions that prevent the pins from sliding in securely. There were no instructions, also."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed!","review":"I received my watch case wrench today but without a single key included. Nothing but the wrench was shipped. Obviously, without the key inserts, the wrench is nothing more than a paperweight.

What took her so long?for all you Emma fans, listen ... on February 6th, 2004, Emma is releasing her 2nd solo album called \\"Free Me\\". I am ordering it off of the HMV.CO.UK website. It sounds awesome. when it comes here, i defintily recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"I was never a fan of Spice Girls but when I heard the song\\"What took you so long\\" I became a fan of baby spice.The cd has great songs and her voice is very lovely and soothing. She actually co-wrote all the songs.Her voice, style, and writing reminded me of Donna Lewis and Merill Bainbridge.{My sister remarked that her singing doesn't give you a headache and it's actually good for your hearing.}I think you will love this CD and you won't be dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Emma is cute and can sing","review":"Emma can sing. That's good. This is her first album. The second one is good too. I look forward to her third, currently only available as an import. They're not all hits, but they are catchy. Nothing annoying. At least half that I could see on a mix CD. (sorry I don't do mp3)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent solo project","review":"Emma's first solo cd is a great album. Great tracks throughout the whole cd. My personal favorites are: What I am, What took you so long?, We're not going to sleep tonight, sunshine on a rainy day, She was a friend of mine, and A girl like me. If you liked the Spice Girls and even if you didn't, you should hear this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Well Done Album","review":"This album is much better than I expected. When the Spice Girls were together I really like Emma but she was everyone's I knew favourite so I kind of shadowed her. When she came out with this album, I heard the single 'What I Am' and didn't like it. I thought it was not Emma at all BUT I picked this album up anyways and I am glad I did. 'What Took You So Long' and 'Spell It Out' grabbed my attention and I finally realized why Emma was everyone's favourite. She's got a sweet voice and amazing hooks. A great album for a summer day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Getting worse?","review":"Well, after a series of solo Spice albums, Emma Bunton, aka Baby Spice, releases her first solo album.What's there to say? Nothing much. The album is downright boring! First single, What Took You So Long stands out as a sure hit, but other than that, the rest of the songs in this stupidly sugary album are incredibly wishy washy.Emma doesn't have the greatest pipes, she's no Melanie C, but she's a step above both Geri Halliwell and Victoria Beckham. Too bad she wasted her time with this disc - Spice Mania is over and the bubble has burst. If she was to be ranked on the basis of her solo effort, she'd fall flat on her face."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was disappointed!","review":"I thought this album would be as good as Mel C's album, but it wasn't good, or at least; not for me. Waste of many, I'm a huge Spice Girls Fan, but this is not my kind of music. Like emma says \\"Simple as that\\".1. What Took You So Long? It's ok 2. Take My Breath Away: A good song 3. World Without You: This is my favorite 4. High On Love: I hate this song 5. Girl Like Me: This is the worst song, ever! 6. Spell It O.U.T.: I hate this sone too. 7. Sunshine On A Rainy Day: It's one of the best songs of the album. Jus for this song * star. 8. Been There Done That: And for this song one more * star. 9. Better Be Careful: I like this song too 10. We're Not Gonna Sleep Tonight: This song is stupid 11. She Was A Friend Of Mine: It's ok 12. What I Am: I love this song"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Album","review":"An awesome album, a Pop album at its best. The songs are well written and properly organized, not to mention catchy. Ive always though Emma was the most talented of the Spice Girl. Her voice is just unforgettable and infectious, if you listen to Spice GIrls music, you can hear that she was the main chorus voice of the group, and with this album, she was able to show her talent not just as a singer, but a songwriter, and solidified herself in the music industry. Cant wait for her next album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Emma shines on her debut!","review":"Emma Bunton was always my favorite member of The Spice Girls. I adored her voice which, while not the strongest, is very sweet and pleasant. So, I really looked forward to getting her solo album and I was not disappointed at all. Out of all of the other Spice solo albums, Emma's has to be the best with catchy, cute songs (most of which she co-wrote) and great melodies. With songs like \\"A Girl Like Me\\", \\"Better Be Careful\\", and \\"We're Not Going to Sleep Tonight\\", she definitely has a winner. It's just a shame that most U.S. fans are deprived of what I have to consider some of Emma's best work. It easily eclipses a lot of what is currently seen as popular. I highly recommend this album to all who love good pop."},{"rating":"2","title":"Baby's got it MOVIN'","review":"Emma is the BEST!!!!!Her debut solo album (A Girl Like Me) is FANTASTIC!!!!I heared every song on the album and I would give a 10/10 or 9/10 to the songs on the cd!!Emma's songs are sweet,catchy,beautiful and nothing but the truth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I want","review":"I bought this C.D. recently. Being a fan of the Spice Girls though not Baby Spice I decided to check it out anyhow. BIg mistake. It's just not my type of music...check out Scream if You Wanna Go Faster, Geri Halliwell's new album! Now that is the best!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This Is What We Were Waiting For","review":"Anybody can have a hit single, which is why we were waiting for Emma's album before we cast judgement. Emma has managed to firmly say that she is a key player and she wont be seen as taking a step back after the Spice Girls. Emma's album contains the UK number 1 What Took You So long, the number 2 hit What I Am and loads of other single-worthy songs like, High On Love, A Girl Like Me and Better Be Carefull. Buy this album and you won't be dissapointed"},{"rating":"2","title":"Really cute, my daugher loved it right out of the box.","review":"My daughter is 21 months old. I got two of these on a great sale and I was going to give one to a friend's daughter and one to mine for their birthdays, a few months away. When I came in the house with them my daughter wouldn't stop trying to open the box. She really thought it was fun. Usually when I get something out of the box she will look at it and give up. Not this toy. She saw just the box a few minutes ago and had to have the toy. As another person said the top doesn't stay on the chocolates and that does seem to be a problem. I hate to have to put a toy into something to store it when it shouldn't need it. She has thrown it around some and nothing has started to look worn yet. She understands some of how it works, so I think it will be a good leanring toy for her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Think what you're doing","review":"Two objections:1) This toy is unsafe.2) Candy needs no extra promotion for children.Giving small children toy candy that's a choking hazard does not make sense.Obviously these pretend confections will be popped in many mouths.With so many more appropriate things in the world they could play with, sort, or learn from, stimulating interest in candy at all is not doing kids any favors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plastic toxic smell.....","review":"I received this as a gift for my daughter.

No luck with the toxic smell leaving. I had no choice but to throw it out. HIGHLY disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"not great quality","review":"I sent this back as soon as I received it.

But yet most of those people give it a 4 and 5 start review. I am sorry but a toy whose lid does not fit is a disaster. It falls down and falls apart, pieces get lost, kids get aggravated, etc.... The idea is adorable. It is learning (colors, shapes, counting, matching) until about the age of 3 and then can be used as pretend play. So this toy has the potential to be used for a long time. But calling Learning Resources - this item is discontinued and yeah, you guessed it - you are OUT OF LUCK. So ours stays in a large ziplock bag to avoid losing the chocolates and my daughter who is almost 3 is beyond annoyed that the lid DOES NOT FIT. So sorry folks, this is NOT a 5 or even a 3 start item if Learning Resources couldn't even make a lid that locked in place, let alone even just stay closed. 2.5 stars"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute but..but..but","review":"This is a cute little toy, but maybe I didn't read the right reviews. The little chocolates are just fun to play with, but the box doesn't fit together so it's really hard to store. You can't put half of the candy tops on the candies and still close the little heart container, it's really inconvienient to store and keep together, easy to loose the parts, too bad, but I wouldn't recommend this toy to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"so cute!","review":"this is a gift for my 2 year old niece. she loves sorting and colors. this will allow her to work with her hands to match the tops and bottoms. who cares if the lid doesn't stay on. the most important part is the chocolates and putting them in the correct spaces."},{"rating":"2","title":"super cute!","review":"This is a very nice set- great for fine motor skills, memory games, and appealing for little ones. The chocolates have good colors, a nice, smooth texture and are pleasant to handle. The chocolates are larger than they appear in the photo which is also a nice bonus.I will be using this set as a therapist(OT)and I think my kiddos will love it.The only reason that I didn't give it 5 stars is that the lid on the heart shaped box doesn't have good closure. When you put it on, it doesn't stay closed- a problem for me since I'll be transporting it from house to house. I can just see all the spilled pieces in my car now!

The classics \\"Point of No Return\\", \\"Exposed To Love\\", and \\"Come Go With Me\\" are energetic dance grooves with romantic lyrics about being in love and living life to the fullest. This cd is perfect for all occasions, to crank it up on a hot summer day, or for those romantic nights when u just wanna party. I also love the songs \\"Let Me B The One\\", \\"Seasons Change\\", and \\"When I Looked At Him\\". It's amazing how all of these songs sound great after all these years.

I would rather have the first CD. The new recylced remixes here leave out all the energry of the original hits, so nobody's missing out on anything by not having them. The first CD had a real sizzle to it. As this band continued they got progressively worse. The first original star of the first two hit CDs was the Italian chanteuse Gioia Bruno. She is now doing the occasional DJ hit in Europe on various labels. They tried to replace her with another brunette---the sound is now more r&b. Total crap if you ask me. It's really not even the same act anymore. The original producer---Lewis Martinee----is not even involved. I wouldn't want this CD because it's not the definite article. Get the first one and be part of the real deal.

Tracks like \\"Stop, Listen, Look & Think\\", \\"I Wish the Phone Would Ring\\", \\"As Long As I Can Dream\\" and \\"In Walked Love\\" were missing - it's such a shame. Overall this is a must have for those who love Freestyle - especially Expose \\"the Freestyle Divas\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy this if you want to reward corporate music","review":"This cd has none of the original members of Expose. Actually, not even their first album had the original members. Only hard-core Miami natives remember who the real Expose was; Ali, Sandee, and (I forget the third one). I saw them in concert during the fall of 1984 and they blew me away. I visited my local disco record store until they released an album. Guess what, THREE NEW GIRLS. All their original songs were redone. They became famous internationally, but they lost some of their edge. Now, their label disbands the group and is seraching for three new girls. Oh well, deja vu. Strip away the original energy, the original producer, and now you have a bland cd that does not do justice to the magic of Expose of old. I'll go back to listening to my original 12\\" records and hope one day, the label will bring back Luis Martinee to write some new songs, and find three new singers with real \\"salsa\\" in Miami."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breakthrough Contemporary Theology!","review":"Sallie McFague's book excellently redefines how God shouldbe envisioned in the current, postmodern society.McFague does an excellent job constructing a positive image ofGod that should be considered by any modern reader,especially one interested in the ecological crisisor the nuclear threat.

Alev Lyttle Croutier obviously spent a tremendous amount of time finding artwork to illustrate her book. However, most of the paintings that she selected are elaborate European orientalist fantasies of Haram life and not actual historicaly relevant pieces. Perhaps Ms. Croutier should have spent a little more time researching her topic. Aside from some pretty staggaring historical mistakes and gross generalizations about Islam, the book contains very little usefull information for scholars. Most of Haram: World Behind the Viel focuses on a single royal Turkish Haram - with very little cross-cultural analysis. If you are interested in orientalist art or detailed descriptions of eunich castration than this is the book for you, but if you are looking for actual scholarship - look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Orientalist Fantasy","review":"I'm with Kimberly. Although the book is richly peppered with colour and B&W photos and drawings, the book as a whole is a prime example of Orientalist fantasizing about \\"othered\\" Muslim women gone wild. Croutier makes blanket generalised assertions such as \\"In traditional Islamic cultures, most women would sooner stand naked in a marketplace than uncover their faces\\" and incorrectly misquotes hadith as Qur'anic text betraying ignorance of the most basic tenets and foundational structures of Islam. If Croutier can make such simple mistakes as this, can we trust anything she has written as being anything more than snippits of wild Orientalist fantasies passed off as \\"fact\\" to an unsuspecting audience? I think not. My advice is to cut out the pretty pictures and throw away the rest (or recycle it if you're environmentally conscious)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Educational and a great read too!","review":"I am usually more into light reading, fiction type stuff but I really enjoyed this book.

I've just finished treating a third floor palladian window in this fashion. I didn't have quite enoughVarathane from my first purchase to finish so I bought another from the same seller.A satin finish it ain't. Its GLOSSY!!

I was a little wary of Dionne Warwick singing brazilian tunes (some crossovers are terrible). I really like this CD. My only complaints are with the \\"Jobim Medley\\" and \\"Caravan\\" tracks. I love the music of Jobim, but this medley seems heavy, wooden, and far too rhythmically square. \\"Waters of March\\" in particular is so even, rhythm-wise, it's hard to listen to. \\"Caravan\\" is a great idea, but not executed very well. The mix is too heavy on percussion and too light on vocals.Having said those things, the rest of the CD is wonderful. I love that she sings in Portuguese at various times. I love the arrangements-tasty and rhythmically interesting. My current favorite track is the \\"Heart of Brazil.\\" I'm still singing it to myself days later. I'm very happy I purchased this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolute BEST value!","review":"There are better keyboards out there, but only for WAY more money. For under [$$$], you get 76 keys, 600 sounds, over 100 styles, and Yamaha name and quality and looks. I like the PSR2000 best because of 64-noty polyphony (vs 32 in the DGX200)and the vocalizer, but it is over 3X the cost! The DGX 200 packs most of the same sounds. I think it is truly the best value out there for the $$."},{"rating":"2","title":"another trick to raise the volume","review":"I used another trick to raise the voice volume.

Son is an avid LOTR fan -- he thought it was \\"totally weird.\\" Dotter generally doesn't like fantasy; she thought it was \\"interesting.\\" Me? Loved the film score -- lush, beautiful 85-minutes of strings and splendid orchestration. Lead actor was convincing albeit in a self-absorbed role as knight errant. Scenery was splendid, particularly in forest element. I won't rehash all that others have said here, except to add I enjoyed the spartan dialogue and this indie film's idiosyncrasies. It's a different, quirky view -- not brain surgery or world peace -- but capable fodder for an evening before the TV with a video."},{"rating":"1","title":"Westender","review":"The service in receiving this movie was exemplary.

It's a beautifully filmed fantasy story about internal and external conflict.

Buy this movie!","review":"Wow. I watch a LOT of film...and manage to enjoy most of it just for production's sake, or for my own edification. This takes the cake as something I tried to enjoy from ANY angle and just couldn't. I tried to stay awake for most of the film but actually fell asleep due to lack of plot. I convinced myself to restart the film the following day thinking it couldn't get any worse. I was wrong.Getting past the lousy quality of story and action, be warned that this DVD would not play on ANY of three computer DVD machines I normally use to watch movies (my personal plus two at work) and I was amazed that it loaded quickly into an older Sony component model DVD easily.Don't waste your time, find something that offers any of the above instead: a story, some decent acting, passable cinematography, a good swordfight, beautiful scenery, lush music, pretty production elements. Westender has none of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did everybody else see the same movie I did?","review":"If I hadn't paid money to rent this dog, I would have turned it off after the first five minutes.

But almost impossible to put together for several reasons. The box does not give a clear picture of the true shape of the puzzle. The edge pieces actually have a cream-colored border on some of them that does not show on the photograph. The pieces are cut into various sizes (some way too tiny) which makes an already confusing process even more confusing and the colors of the pieces differ from the colors of the photograph. There are also many pices that are just straight-edged all around and you have no way of knowing where they might fit into the puzzle. What a shame.

A song about the complexities of life - how nothing is black and white, dreams are dreamed and then given up in order to continue on. It seems to be a song about his life, \\"People think you know what you're talking about/All because you wrote some song.\\" Lee Roy Parnell plays slide guitar on the next best song, \\"Jesse's Soul\\". The story of a man who needed to settle a score from over thirty years before. How dreaming of revenge for thirty years made Jesse take \\"the peace he found and nailed it to his hate\\".Overall, a very good album. There are some songs that are stronger than those on the Del Rio album, however Del Rio is much stronger all around. I would definitely recommend buying it.Includes appearances by Kim Richey, Lee Roy Parnell, Albert Lee, and Harry Stinson."},{"rating":"2","title":"An enlightening perspective on history and religion","review":"Gore Vidal does a wonderful job bringing the fifth century B.C. to life. Most of the historical material that is available from this time period tells the story from the Greek point of view, though it is likely the Persians thought of Greece in the uncultured and unwealthy way that Vidal portrays. More importantly, the novel presents eastern thought of the period in a very clear, concise manner. Questions are raised not only pertaining to the narrator's Zoroastrian religion, but also pertaining to Buddhism and Confucianism. The benefits and pitfalls of each are described in detail. This is the first Gore Vidal novel I have read, and I will certainly delve into more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware!","review":"There is a problem with the most recent production of the soft cover version of this book.

I'm eternally grateful to my friend for introducing me to what can only be described as a wholly engrossing and intelligent journey into ancient civilizations that, until then, I knew little, if nothing, about. It dispelled myths while, simultaneously, educated me on the most intricate and complex factions of eastern civilizations. A must read for anyone remotely interested in history or even, to a smaller degree, religion and/or philosophy.

It is only over the later part of the 20th century that the glorious history of this \\"first true empire on planet Earth\\" is being re-visited in a more fair and even handed way.

It's like standing in front of a very expensive painting of what looks like vomit marks on a canvas, and the \\"art critic\\" next to you lectures you on the deep meaning behind such a fantastic artwork.Not that this book is a literal comparison here, but I found it a labor to read. Worse, the promise of the book was a fantasy \\"as if\\" look at what would happen if all the ideas of the axial age had somehow merged, or at least crossed paths. For years I've thought this an excellent concept for a book, and was delighted when I discovered that somebody had written one. This book is a waste of a fantastic concept. Totally undeveloped.

Best of all are his introductions to the stories -- that was always half the fun of Carter's anthologies, after all! His love for the fantasy genre shines through on every page, and a reader could do far worse than to spend many magical hours in his company.

Although I've read some reviews that disliked the previews in May's books, I think it attributes to the whole scene and makes you want to read the whole series over and over again. Every time you read the book, you see referrals that you want to check. (Has anyone noticed the mention of Claude from the Pliocene Saga, working on Caledonia with his wife?). All in all, a suprising book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unforgettable","review":"In all of the discussions of this book, never once did I see mentioned The Plague by Albert Camus. The parallels extend way beyond the common Algerian background. If pushed, I would say that The Last Summer of Reason is more powerful because it is more specific. It provides something I don't think I've read or learned about in the last few years -- a fully imagined sense of the life lived in the midst of the creeping, quiet disaster of fundamentalism. Even though it is so short, and, so obviously unfinished, I am left breathless by this unforgettable literary witness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too obviously unfinished","review":"Although the premise of this small novel is intriguing, especially given current events at a national and world level, The Last Summer of Reason is not worth the time.

The handle bends almost every time you pick up a ball you have to stop contently and strengthen it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst product ever","review":"I can't think a worse product that I have ever purchased. The toys you can buy at Chucky Cheese with 5 tickets have infinitely more value than this complete and total piece of garbage.2nd ball. This piece of junk fell apart while picking up the 2nd golf ball. It buckled a little on the first, and completely collapsed on the 2nd. Like many other reviewers, I couldn't resist the low price. However, I ignored the warnings and now get to deal with returning the product.STAY AWAY PEOPLE! Spend a few more $$ and get a better shag bag."},{"rating":"1","title":"Returned - POS","review":"Seems like the quality on this product has gone down the tubes - because the balls certainly don't! Ball gets stuck at the bottom of the tube. After failing to get the ball in the tube on the green, I went to the sidewalk and that didn't even work. Handle also bent after a couple of smacks. Total POS. Actual bag looks like cheap nylon. Don't waste your time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak design","review":"I received it today and picked up about 5 golf balls and I noticed that the bracket holding the handle to the tube was starting to bend, so I immediately boxed it up and returned it. Even for lightweight use at home I can't recommend this"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to par","review":"It is difficult for me to understand the more positive reviews for this shag bag. This is the first one I've purchased, so perhaps the grade is based on a curve. Sure it is all metal, but the thin aluminum that connects the handle to the tube bends easily with the pressure needed to pick up balls. after 2 or 3 balls, it is quite bent. It takes quite a bit of pressure to get balls into the tube. I envision over a season, that these brackets will break off, so I returned mine."},{"rating":"1","title":"JUNK!!!","review":"Do NOT waste your money on this product. It's cheaply made and bent on its first use. You can't load the balls due to the super hard tube spring clips; however,it has a super soft and pliant handle attachment to the tube as it bends off to one side or another like wire with the slightest pressure used to pick up a ball. Result: the thing bends in your hands and you can't pick up balls unless you hold the thing by the tube and beat the balls in using a hard surface. The cheap quality and thin gauge of the aluminum and poor quality springs used renders this thing useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth 1 dollar","review":"I picked up a total of 4 golf balls and the cheap metal construction collapesd rendering the device 100% useless. 4 golf balls! I'm starting to really believe in you get what you pay for. This is on it's way back to Amazon. I would absolutely NOT PURCHASE this shag bag."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work for me","review":"The first time I used it the supporting structures, which connect the handle to the tube bent. I think that they may have been bent in shipping. The handle, tube and other parts look very well made, but the two supports are very light metal that don't look like they would stand up to any amount of use. I returned the bag and received a refund promptly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get the Bag Shag Instead","review":"This is a poor excuse for a shag bag. The main problem is in the three prongs, or teeth, that retain the balls in the vertical tube. They are not constructed properly, and are way too weak for the job. Once you get 3 or 4 balls in the tube, the weight of the balls overwhelms the spring teeth, and any future balls added to the tube just fall back out. The fabric is also flimsy, and the steel frame is very weak. I bent the internal frame just by pushing down hard on a ball on the green. Do yourself a favor and get the Bag Shag brand instead. It has a 10 year guarantee."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is crap","review":"The first one broke after picking up 3 balls. Amazon replaced it fast, free, and easy, but the it is still the same quality. The top handle is secured to a plastic disc inside. It bends if you put too much pressure on it. I would suggest using pliers to fold the prongs that pick up the balls in. It takes less pressure off the handle and you might get it to last a bit longer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great way to practice and an easy way to pick up the balls","review":"This is a quality product. I had one with a plastic tube that broke. This one has a metal tube and will last a long time. Great product, great price, fast shipping.

Surprising enough in places to be more interesting than some of their previous albums. A real solid work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sisters of Mercy meet Front 242","review":"I love this CD! If you like Goth, Industrial, Electronic....you must own this CD! This was my first experience with C.O.X. and it has impressed me since purchasing from Amazon.com.

Favorite Tune: \\"This World\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't fix what isn't broken","review":"C+ standing on its own, this album is ok, but nothing compared to earlier releases. Head Clouds was their last authentic release, and Metamorphosis seemed to sink into mediocrity which was the end of their signature sound.Hidden faces seems like they sold out and attempted to mimic a sound that appealed to their initial audience, and in doing so gained some new fans, but alienated those who appreciated their (pre-1993) signature sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rumpole and the Primrose Path","review":"When I received the book, I discovered that it started on page 39, went to 86, started over at 39 and went to the conclusion.

But this one is still awesome and a worthy addition to anyone's library."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best Rumpole books","review":"I like this book because it introduces Luci Gribble, the new director of marketing and administration at Rumpole's Chambers. Luci is always spouting corporate jargon and at first glance doesn't seem like anyone Rumpole would like, but she turns out to be a valuable ally and a good friend. She helps him solve the mysteries in \\"Rumpole and the Primrose Path\\" and \\"Rumpole Redeemed,\\" covers for him when his wife Hilda (\\"She Who Must Be Obeyed\\") demands that he start working out at a gym, and helps him make it up to Hilda when it transpires that he hasn't been working out as regularly as he says he has. Almost thirty years after the first Rumpole book came out, John Mortimer still knows how to keep Rumpole fresh and enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"100 pages too long","review":"This book is a cross between a cozy mystery with a romantic element and a way too tedious reflection on questions of faith mixed with A LOT of palentology lessons. I was a little embarassed for the main character Em, who seemed to have no sense of what sort of man was appropriate for her - first she though George was the man, then Ray, and she was briefly swayed by the strange character \\"Earthworm.\\" Seemed pretty pitiful for a grown woman. Overall, I found that I cared very little for the characters, and about page 290, I was ready to stop reading, even though I was only 40 pages from the end. The exact person who had done the murder was still unknown to me, but I'd figured out the plot, and, unlike the police, I don't have to have every shred of evidence accounted for before I can finger the murderer.

He gives us the dirt on each philosopher, tells us who was overweight, cheap, pushed people around, etc. This would be great if we were reading about movie stars or politicians but I bought these books in order to understand something about what these philosophers thought. He does reserve a few pages at the end of each volume to tells us one or two of their ideas and gives us a handful of quotes. A total waste of money unless you hate your philosophy classes so much that you want to hear how awful the personal lives of the philosophers were.

By saying this it's in the same breath as Nas' Illmatic, and the Notorious B.I.G.'s Ready to Die and other 1990's classics not mentioned. Jay-Z's lyrical flow is so smooth and effortless on all of these tracks and also, this album seemed to have no commercial attempts by staying very underground and keeping the hip-hop natural. When Jay-Z knew this album was good he meant it because on his song \\"Hard Knock Life\\" (on Hard Konck Life: Volume II) he specifically stated, \\"they didn't appreciate it until the second one came out\\". This meant that no one appreciated Reasonable Doubt until In My Lifetime:Volume I came out all being compared to one another.

This album is right there.The lyricism and poetry imbued in all these tracks is insanely good. \\"Politics As Usual,\\" \\"Brooklyn's Finest,\\" and everything else on this disc is the stuff of an ambitious genius. I don't know much, but I know there's no way it got any better for Jay-Z than \\"Reasonable Doubt.\\"I've been turned off by the corporate crap that apparently clutters many of his subsequent releases (especially that annoying sample of \\"It's a Hard Knock Life\\"....UGH). But \\"Reasonable Doubt\\" showcases an ARTIST at the peak of his powers. A lot can be said of ambition, and Jay-Z had it.

In my eyes, this album, Nas \\"Illmatic\\" and Biggies \\"Ready To Die\\" are Hip-Hop classics and must haves for anyones collection. Quoted from Jay-Z himself, \\"Didn't really appreciate it, till 2nd one came out\\". He is still on top of his game and it doesn't look like he's going to fade out any time soon.

I own a couple of his CDs but to be honest, I never really liked him. His beats never grabbed me and his lyrics never stunned me so much that I just had to go back and listen to a specific song again. He mostly raps about drugs, money and cars. Nothing special, nothing new. I'm just being real about it, since everyone else is on his d!ck. I think the reason he's so respected is because he blew up right after Biggie died and he was the closest thing to him at the time.Granted, Jay-Z does use some good metaphors, but for the most part his lyrics are shallow.Best tracks on this album:Can't Knock the HustleBrooklyn's Finest w/BiggieDead Presidents"},{"rating":"1","title":"No illmatic","review":"Jay-z resonable doubt can't be compared 2 nas's illmatic.

Sources in the industry tell me that gangsta bad@ss Christina Aguilera has been brought in to revitalize this increasingly irrelevant rap group. That's a wise move: After her recent release from hard time in Pelican Bay, Christina will bring her sorely needed hardcore soulja authenticity to Jason Zengerman's limp-wristed flouncing rapper act.

The record ends appropriately with \\"Regrets\\": \\"This is the number one rule for your set / In order to survive, gotta learn to live with regrets.\\" For those who are used to Jay-Z's more pop-oriented style, this mellow, even sparse album may be a bit of an adjustment, but it's one worth making. 5 Stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jay-Z is Top 5 all time....","review":"Jay-z is an ill MC and just think for a second....Reasonable Doubt was his debut album...Over the years jigga has become a household name and cemented himself into hip hop history.

The tracks that follow, with the exception of \\"Regrets\\", are somewhat forgettable, but Jay unleashes so much energy and introspect on tracks like \\"Can I Live\\" and \\"Can't Knock The Hustle\\", and creativity on \\"D'Evils\\" and \\"22 Two's\\" that it really doesn't matter if there are a few missteps here. The odd combination of DJ Premier, Ski, and Clark Kent handle the bulk of production on \\"RD\\", which probably explains why no other album SOUNDS like Jay's debut, despite so many wannabe thug/hustler emcees trying. Hov raps about things that have certainly become generic in today's rap genre (money, hoes, and drug-dealing), however, he does so with an insight and remorse that justifies the mafioso rhyme schemes.

Jayz's street hustler personna in on this album (whether real or embelished does not matter) is gold. Given that this is his debut lp, Jay was hungry for something and he just spits it on this cd.

I want to know just one thing why did he keep on playing the same recording of him saying \\"rockafella yall\\" over and over?(I think that it might on every song)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jay-Z's Best Album","review":"Nowadays, when most people think of Jay-Z they think of the commercialized rapper who brought us commercialized songs on commercialized beats with commercialized lyrics like \\"Change Clothes\\" or \\"Big Pimpin.\\" Don't let anyone tell you that Jay's best albums were \\"The Blueprint\\" or \\"The Black Album\\" because this is Jay's best effort. When the album was released in 1996, Jay was making an album to show the world his skills, not to put a video on MTV. Jay brings 15 tracks of lyrical skills to the table and that makes this a great album. Don't get me wrong, Jay can still spit, but he just doesn't bring those great lyrics like he did here. So if you are a fan of Jay-Z, or a fan of hip-hop, this album is a must buy.My 3 Favorite Tracks:22 Two'sCan I LiveDead Presidents II"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Mind of a Stressed-Out Hustler","review":"This album paints the picture perfect of a hustler who is just plain tried.

Blige keep them in perspective. Jay blows up in the song 22 two'z , for those who don't know.... this nigga can freestyle. That song features his best lyrics and rhyming capabilities.

Surprisingly, it doesn't hold his attention like all the other DVD's in our collection.Also, this DVD requires you to sit through numerous ads before the show begins. What a huge waste of our time. We didn't pay money to watch that! (Henson videos are doing this more and more, and we're buying them less and less.) Finally, this DVD does not have a menu, which means you must play the DVD from begining-to-end or use the fast-forward button.

Good explanation of several other science topics and their history as well. However, his discussion of the population bomb tended to stray into the pop culture science of the 1970 era so it was highly dated.

It contains several examples of using NX in practice.Dr. Odell's eBook is an excellent overview and guide to NX and I found it extremely helpful. If you are new to NX or seriously considering using it, I highly recommend it. In addition, I have seen Dr. Odell respond to questions and to clarify some issues on the popular photographic website DPReview."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better Than I Thought it Was Going to Be","review":"I purchased this e-book to learn more about the new Nikon Capture software.

I decided to try Nikon Capture with the new Control Points. It is a great program. Since the new version came out, there aren't many resources for training, books, etc. This e-book by Jason Odell was one of the first, so I thought I would give it a try.

The first release \\"Mi Vida Loca\\" raced up the chart straight to #1, then \\"When You Walked In The Room\\" which also went top 10, shows Pam getting in to the song, then \\"Spilled Perfume\\" a very worthy ballad that peaked at #11? But it also includes \\"I Was Blown Away\\" a suprise top 10 hit and finally, probably Pam Tillis' best song \\"In Between Dances\\" the CD's big winner also going to #1, this album produced 5 excellent songs, and could have been six with \\"Better Off Blue\\". Her voice on this album is also at its best. But after this album and her greatest hits album she seemed to lose some of her punch, but it is nice to see her still going."},{"rating":"1","title":"ongoing disappointment","review":"Put yourself in my place will always be her best album and the one time height of her career. It's like she used most of her most rocking songs (and best ideas) on her first album and since that time couldn't do near as well. How she's made so many lame albums since is because most country folk like constant remakes of past country songs and a lot of slow sappy ballads. Juice Newton did a lot better back in the 80's because she always stuck to country rock and was terrific from album to album and never changed to attract a different audience such as what Pam Tillis has been doing after her first album. On Sweetheart's Dance I only liked four songs because they weren't remakes or slow songs. How anyone could consider this album an equal to Put Yourself In My Place has got to be joking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was this a Stephanie Plum novel at all?","review":"Just finished reading Hard Eight in four hours straight, and after eagerly waiting for its release for a year I'm extremely disappointed. Its a good enough book, well written, etc but its not the happy-go-lucky romantic comedy that I've come to expect from Janet Evanovich and Stephanie Plum. ...For those who think the Stephanie Plum series is unrealistic fluff, you'll like this book. Die-hard fans like me are going to read it anyway, hope you're not as disappointed as I was."},{"rating":"2","title":"Of Criminals and Crullers","review":"This story starts when sassy Jersey bounty hunter Stephanie Plum is asked by a neighbor to find her missing granddaughter, Evelyn, and her small daughter. Missing persons is not strictly Stephanie's forte, but she figures what the heck, she'll give it a go. And the usual Evanovich tour de force of mayhem, shadowy miscreants, binge-eating, attacking critters, and dead cars takes off from there. The action is great, the plot is strong, and the laughs are divine. Oh, and the romance! The love triangle with Stephanie, Morelli, and Ranger becomes even more tangled. Without giving anything away, let me just say that those of you with Ranger fantasies, get ready to kick 'em up a notch.Anyone who hasn't yet discovered the pleasure of the Stephanie Plum series, I highly recommend that you get thee to the bookseller and buy them all. They are absolutely delightful."},{"rating":"1","title":"are you KIDDING??","review":"I don't know who is writing these reviews, but you've got to be kidding me. This was one of the most trite books I've ever read. It was like every cop/action movie, but worse. The humor is NOT funny (unless you find Full House hilarious, in which case, buy the entire Janet Evanovich series), and sex scenes are tossed about shamelessly in places where it is entirely inappropriate... for instance, after Stephanie is abducted, beaten, and almost killed. she's gone for SEVERAL HOURS, and as soon as she gets back, she gets it on. WHO DOES THAT??? \\"yeah honey, i was just diagnosed with cancer... whaddya say we head upstairs?\\" i recommend you stay far away from this book, unless you're okay with an obvious storyline, a plot lacks any sense of reality, and humor that yearns for comparison to Yakov Smirnoff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book review","review":"I ordered this book on December 13, 2010 and have yet to receive it as of January 14, 2011.

I was very disappointed. Her characters lack any substance. Grandma and Lula should be a comic book instead of a mystery.

Bad day in Blackrock and a loss of my [$$$]."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stephanie Plum Character Expands Her Horizons","review":"The book is just a bit different from previous Stephanie Plum novels.

Even though I am male, and the books' target audience is female, I found the first seven refreshing, hilarious, and full of appeal no matter what your gender. But in Hard Eight, Evanovich basically destroys her heroine's \\"likeability factor\\" -- big time -- by having Stephanie basically cheat on Morelli. Evanovich tries like hell to justify all of this ... but it rings hollow. I wonder if all of the female readers of this series would be so forgiving if it was Morelli cheating on Plum. The double standard is in full force here, and Evanovich just ruined a GREAT series by turning her heroine into a common slut, who cheats because she is motivated by nothing more than lust."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard is right...hard to finish.","review":"Okay, so maybe it's not fair for me to judge this book, seeing as how I'm only on page 60-something -- but I'm a huge Stephanie Plum fan, and already \\"Hard Eight\\" is a major disappointment. I can hardly believe this latest adventure is written by the same Janet Evanovich whose previous books were so hilarious, irreverent, raunchy, and just plain laugh-out-loud wonderful. This honestly reads like some college student in a mystery writing class who's decided, \\"Oh, I can do that\\" -- and can't. The humor (such as it is) is terribly labored (the running gags have officially run out of steam) and the prose is endlessly repetitive, clunky and -- what's most shocking for an Evanovich book -- boooring. If I finish \\"Hard Eight\\" it will be in the spirit in which Ms. Evanovich seems to have written it: as a not particularly pleasant chore because she had nothing better to do -- or a publisher's deadline. Only for the most undiscriminating reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read","review":"I really enjoyed this book. Janet has a way of heating it up without giving any info. Hard Eight did have a little bit of sizzle. Stephanie Plum is a lovable character, I just with that Ms. Evanovich would have developed her more by the 8th book. Stephanie seems to be up to the same old and hasn't changed much. This is probably the pinnacle of the series, it's pretty much downhill (although slowly at first) from here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly entertaining! A great, fast, paced mystery.","review":"THis is the first book by Janet Evanovich that I have read but it will not be the last. I love her fast paced entertaining style of writing.

This is my first and last Evanovich novel and I gave it a 2 only because some of it is funny. But who reads mystery stories for comedy? Hard Eight has something to annoy everyone. The most tepid feminist will hate the incompetent female protagonist who is constantly being rescued by males drawn by her looks. Those looking for even a hint of gritty realism beneath the comedy will look in vain. The characters are cartoons. Men will grind their teeth in frustration at being set up for an ending that doesn't happen. This woman is in need of a editor.

The characters have always been amusing but I thought believable, I no longer find them believable.

I keep trying to like the book so I can read #9 when it comes out and hopefully it will be better!

I was lucky enough to discover the Stephanie Plum series on audio book #4, followed by 5 and 6, all narrated by Debbie Mazar. I remembered her immediately from some lawyer TV series a while back so even the picture fit. I enjoyed them immensely on long drives where the laughing kept me awake. They were those rare books where the voice matched the character. Debbie Mazar is ultimate Stephanie Plum, carrying it off with gum chewing, wise-cracking perfect Jersey style. The story itself is still good as the previous one, but do yourself a favor, buy the book, not the audio tape! Janet, get Debbie back, no matter what you have to offer!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Enough Already!","review":"It's time to wrap this thing up! This one's a labor to get through.

In it Stephanie has two more vehicles that get blown up plus Ranger's. It gets a little stale after awhile. This is still a pretty good book though because we see our old favourites - Lula, Gramma Mazur and of course Ranger and Morelli. Some unfinished business between Stephanie and Ranger gets finished too. I wish they could bottle and sell Ranger! Anyway, in this book Stephanie is trying to find a missing mother and her daughter for a friend of her family, and she is thrown against a really bad dude who begins terrorizing her and her family. Ranger really helps Steph a lot in this one because this guy is really scary! In fact, it makes Stephanie really consider a new line of work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yeaaaaaa!!!!!!! Worth every penny for the hardcover LOL!!!!!","review":"I can not begin to tell you how pleased I am at this last book. The 2 before this was beginning to get me on the trend of waiting for it to come out in Paperback. But Alas.... I enjoyed this one. Yeah she still writes in those quirky-borderline-stupid secondary characters that I have felt for the past two books were beginning to annoy me. But the story actually makes up for it this case she is working on does get a bit hairy at times and of course the whole Joe vs. Ranger thing is still a primary storyline. You will not be dissapointed.. or at least I wasn't.Stephanie is Stephanie and Lulu is Lulu the only character growth I saw in this one was................ \\"REX\\" and \\"BOB\\" LOL so don't pick it up expecting to see some major growth from anyone else.Happy Reading"},{"rating":"2","title":"Grrrrrrrrrrr\\"8\\" !!","review":"Writing a book series must be terribly difficult, especially after the first few. Expectations can be unrealistically high. So I almost didn't want to begin this book and be disappointed. However, without a doubt, \\"Hard Eight\\" is Evanovich's best in the Stephanie Plum series. This character-driven book had me laughing out loud (Lula, Grandma Mazur, Bender et al) and hyperventilating (those delicious Ranger passages). And I will not spoil the will-she-or-won't-she teaser. You'll have to read it yourself to find out:)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Like a Tastykake, but Without the Fat and Calories","review":"Janet E's Stephanie Plum series is one of my guilty reading pleasures. I brought Hard Eight with me on a six hour flight and it entertained me the entire way (wish I could same the same of the airline...). This particular offering doesn't really break any new ground - Stephanie is still the bad luck bounty hunter with an attraction for blown up cars and dangerous men. The regular cast of characters is out in full force - Lula, Grandma Mazur, Joe Morelli, Ranger, and Cousin Vinnie - as Stephanie tries to find a missing woman and child on the run from a mobster and capture a few bond hearing deadbeats (always amusing). The dialog is sarcastic and snappy, but in a few scenes it felt a bit overdone and contrived - no matter though, it's still an entertaining and fun read. I always wondered why they haven't turned any of these stories into a film or TV series - it could really be a great combination of comedy and action/adventure."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Bit of a Dissapointment","review":"I recently became addicted to the Stephanie Plum series, but was pretty dissapointed with this one. Everything happened a little too fast, every kook can be compared to a kook from one of her other books.

I was so disappointed in this one. I only laughed out loud once, the ending was predictable and the bad guy was \\"been there, done that.\\" So, Janet fans - - you'll like it because we all like Stephanie; but, when you're done you'll feel just a bit guilty that you want your money back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best So Far","review":"Normally, every book in the series is about equal. This is the first book that really stands out.Plum is of course as good in this one as normal. It is nice to see Ranger having a bigger part in this book that earlier ones. He doesn't just show up to save the day, but works with Stephanie quite a bit. The addition of Kloughn to the regular cast of characters is welcomed. He definitely falls on the hapless side of her friends.The bad guys are more entertaining in this book that previous as well. The guy in the rabbit suit is, well, interesting. He seems as dangerous as any of the people who have tried to kill her in the past, but more interesting.The story is about what we've come to expect from the series. Through a series of luck breaks and coincidences, Plum stumbles her way through to success. Hapless but effective.This book is as funny as any of its' predecessors, and a little more interesting. For fans of the series, I would definitely recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great and Funny Book","review":"Stephanie Plum, the character in these books, is a riot. She gets into the type of trouble we wish we could but not dare. Love the two hunks in her life and her family are real characters especially her Grandma and Mother. The only problem is the reader, she's ok but I wish the original reader from book one and two had continued to read all the books. This reader is a little dull and has no range for changing characters. But if you can get past her voice to the story you'll love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good","review":"This was the worst book Janet Evanovich has written.

I don't want to give too much away, since it is a mystery in a way. But it has all the classic Stephanie Plum elements: Ranger, Joe, Blown up Cars, and of course a couple of bad guys.For those of you who haven't read the Stephanie Plus series, start at the beginning and work your way up. There are references to past books.Stephanie's character is personable and understandable. She lives a normal live, basically. I mean, if you were a bond enforcement person how normal can your life really be?"},{"rating":"2","title":"JE Just Gets Better and Better","review":"The characters in this book are the same familiar ones we have learned to love ( or hate ) but the writing is a little crisper and the movement from scene to improbable scene just a little less jerky than in the first few.

Thanks for a great read !!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Janet has beat this dead horse enough","review":"I loved the first six books. Seven was... It contained material that seemed to be recycled from earlier books and detailed descriptions of Bob's poop. We went from Bob's poop to Bob's puke. Not much improvement at my house. If there is a dumber main character than Stephanie Plum, I've missed the book. She is such a colossal screwup and gets worse at being a bounty hunter instead of better. I wasn't surprised that Ranger broke off the affair after one night. Stephanie is incompetent at everything else, this seemed to be more...than a passionate affair. Kloughn would be more her speed than Ranger or Joe. Stephanie has gone from cute, endearing, gutsy to boring, incompetent, and about as smart as her grandmother who has also lost her charm. Book eight is more original than seven. For that I rated it a 2-star, but it wasn't worth the price of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard not to laugh","review":"Once again I find myself looking like a fool sitting at the break table at work and laughing out loud as I read another Janet Evanovich/Stephanie Plum novel.

Can't wait for more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Always Love Janet Evanovich","review":"This is the first e-book I've purchased on my new kindle and not only do I love the book (as I always do with Janet Evanovich) but the e-book experience has also been great. I just wish it was a bit more \\"cost effective\\" the e-book cost me the exact same as the paperback would have at B&N."},{"rating":"2","title":"I enjoyed Hard Eight","review":"I like the way Janet Evanovich puts little twists in things. Stephanie Plum is a fun character to read about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Done, Finished, Bored, Eight is Enough","review":"Let me start by saying that I started to read all of JE books in order. The first 3 or 4 books were so entertaining that I continued to read on. Then all of a sudden her books started to really get on my nerves. The same things over and over and over. Not to mention the stupid dog and his antics. I really tried to go on but I realized that from eight to nineteen things will never change. Things happen to her and her friends and family that are just so unbelievable they make you scratch your head and wonder do people really believe this crap? Sorry Janet, but if you want to keep us readers interested you have to come up with somethings new and exciting. Just my own opinion of course."},{"rating":"2","title":"Janet Evanovich","review":"This series is a very easy and quick read. Has me laughing outloud whilst I read it. If you have seen the movie [which was based on the first book] you actually can see the characters in each of the subsequent books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"Really Good book i love the Stephanie plum series, would recommend reading them all to anyone,well except kids. Good reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard Eight is Hard to Take","review":"After such a wonderful beginning this series has gone steadily down hill. The characters are no longer admirable or interesting. The...sassy heroine is now a total ditz, the hot hero a wimpy whiner, and the numero uno man of mystery a murdering... predator. The fun is gone and so am I. I won't bother spending another penny on this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed as well","review":"I am a devoted fan of Janet's however her material seems very old in this book. It was extremely predictable (including about how many cars will be destroyed).One good thing, Stephanie might be getting stronger - I know her Mom is."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW! Still in Shock at the ending!","review":"Janet Evanovich takes you on a ride that you don't wan't to get off. I finished this book in a matter of hours (the kids opened their own cans for dinner) and the ending was surprising. Probably not my favorite Stephanie Plum book, but when I finished it I started reading it again. That tells me that Evanovich is doing something right. When does the movie come out?"},{"rating":"1","title":"don't bother","review":"I have to agree with the Fort Worth reader. The story has some funny moments, but this is just another romance novel, complete with insipid heroine in need of being rescued, then boinked (or boinked then rescued ... whatever). She is supposed to be college educated. Why is Steph suddenly so stupid? C'mon, leaving her keys in the car while attempting to pick up a FTA, and later going out for pizza when she knows she is being stalked by a maniac is reaching. I really don't care how hot Ranger is. Why should she worry about death cooties on her sofa, then sleep unprotected with a guy who has been with the bar maid at the sleazy pizza joint? Eeeewwww.Stephanie needs to get a brain transplant. If I want to read this kind of garbage, l'll pick up a Harlequin."},{"rating":"1","title":"The first half stunk but the second half was OK.","review":"I've read two of these Stephanie Plum books and I personally find her constant slap stick bungling irritating. That's why I stopped reading them. When I picked Hard Eight up at the library I thought it was that other female PI from Chicago. Oops."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is stupid and obvious?","review":"This 4th-grade reading material is boring and beyond stupid.Avoid this drivel at ALL costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard-ly worth it","review":"Big disappointment. Stephanie's cars blow up, she loses handcuffs, she still hates shooting her gun, although she's a hell of a marksman in her apartment building. The whole Abruzzi plot is contrived and fizzles in the end. As does the \\"GREAT RANGER SEX SCENE\\" which is about as long as this review. You'd think a romance writer could have done a better sex scene, especially after building it up for seven books. Let's just say the seeming extent of Ranger's sexual prowess could be called \\"Hard Ate.\\" Big deal. Marv Albert does that and he's no mysterious, rock-hard bounty hunter.Janet is still good at getting laughs, although much less frequently than before. She needs to put more work into character development and plot. It's time to move on from Stephanie being a stupid, but lovable, idiot.After this, I'm waiting for Nine in paperback."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eight just misses being Great!","review":"The latest in the Stephanie Plum series Hard Eight,is a fun read. It was a pleasant surprise to read this one and find our character finally moving forward somewhat. Yes it has the same formula, madcap situations, ongoing lovelife problems, but there is also an interesting story unfolding. Plot wise Hard eight is perhaps one of Evanovichs best. Of course the secondary story, Stephanie's love life continues to unfold. Yes, Stephanie finally succumbs to Rangers charms. However, after all the hype the relationship has received in previous books, fans will be disappointed in the skimpy couple of paragraphs devoted to the tryst. It seems the author wanted to focus on the plot rather than the characters. Too bad,with a little more attention to character development Hard Eight could have been Great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"stephanie never seems to learn from her mistakes","review":"I've read all eight Stephanie Plum novels (in order), so clearly I got hooked early on. They are funny, clever, quick reading. Janet Evanovich has a gift for writing quirky (if annoying) characters and laugh-out-loud dialogue. However, Stephanie makes the same lame mistakes from one book to another, and usually within the same book. It is frustrating to see ineptitude over and over again, and I began to wonder what the men in her life see in her. Someone once said that what a man really wants in a woman is competence, which Stephanie seems stubbornly determined not to acquire.I may have spoiled the fun for myself somewhat by reading Joshua Armstrong's excellent \\"The Seekers,\\" about his true exploits as a tough yet compassionate bounty hunter in New Jersey. Nah--I'm just tired of seeing the same old dumb behavior, with no learning curve in sight. It's been fun, but I want Stephanie to gracefully retire."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious fun","review":"I have greatly enjoyed reading all of the Stephanie Plum mysteries. The Jersey-girl-turned-bounty-hunter is a terrific character, and so are the whole cast of folks who pop in and out of her chaotic life. You'll laugh a LOT, guaranteed. I just wish the mystery in this book was better thought out. The plot and its unlikely resolution seem almost like afterthoughts. Maybe you (like me) can live with that, in exchange for the fun of this highly character-driven series."},{"rating":"1","title":"I agree w/ Merylnne from Ireland","review":"I was there when the librarian put the brand new, One For the Money out on the shelf in hardcover, snapped it up, devoured it and was hooked. But here, I was disappointed too. I wondered as I read it whether it is the last book in the series. The introduction of the stupid lawyer and his idiotic incompetence and the other woman bounty hunter show us how far Stephanie has come and how far she still is from having professional expertise. But the end does not really set up the next book, instead, it's \\"Stick a fork in me, I'm done.\\" I hope I'm wrong! I must say though, that Ranger is hot (and gallant at the end), and I have always loved Morelli."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who wrote this book?","review":"Once again the book after a big cliffhanger has left me disappointed. Not that it wasn't a good story, it was. It had a lot of classic Stephanie moments. I just don't understand how two of the major characters could be so different in this book from the previous seven. Neither Ranger, nor Morelli seemed like themselves. And speaking of Ranger, I waited seven books for a resolution that came in 2 paragraphs and a \\"I've got to go?\\" Nope, sorry, this book was a big disappointment to me. I'm not so sure I will even bother with book 9."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not My Favorite In The Series, But Still Pretty Darn Good","review":"Hard Eight by Janet Evanovich is the 8th (as the title indicates) installment in the Stephanie Plum series. This time around, Stephanie is not on the trail of a bond jumper, but is doing a favor for her parent's neighbor Mabel. Mabel's granddaughter and great-granddaughter have gone missing and Mabel asks for Stephanie's help. Stephanie soon learns that the reason behind the disappearance is more complicated that it appears and Stephanie is dodging bullets, watching her car get fire bombed and finding dead men on her sofa. It's a race to a finish you will not believe!Hard Eight is not my favorite Stephanie Plum novel to date, but it was completely action packed and totally engrossing. And there was of course the added bonus of Stephanie and Ranger finally sleeping together. She has a lot more resistance than I would have! I just adore these novels and I recommend that anyone who likes a good mystery try on these for size."},{"rating":"2","title":"better then the first seven","review":"I really enjoyed this book. Stephanie has some really bad days.She keeps you entertained from the beginning to the end. I laughed out loud at some of the stuff the poor girl gets into. I was glad to see that Lula was back. Janet adds a couple of new characters. I really enjoyed Albert Kloughn. I can't wait for number nine. Janet just keeps getting better and better"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Great Ride!","review":"Strap yourself in for another wild ride with Stephanie Plum, laughing and engaged through all the twists and turns. Read it by the pool after a new novel that our book club picked up, Shade of the Maple by Kirk Martin. Janet Evanovich makes me laugh, Kirk Martin makes me cry. Perfect complements. Can't wait for NINE!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing Eight","review":"Who wrote this book? Surely not the author who gave each character a heart and soul in the previous 7 books. This is little more than an outline with characters tossed in, making statements obviously lifted from previous books. Don't forget we know these people. The biggest let-down was the encounter between Stephanie and Ranger. It was shallow and not believable. Please don't judge the series by this book. But I must say that I will wait for reviews before buying the next Evanovich offering."},{"rating":"1","title":"Creepy - this should be a Stephanie Plum novel?","review":"I have to admit I am a great fan of the series but now Janet Evanovich did it: I'm quitting! I can't believe she wrote this book! The last 50 pages were awful. If she thought she had to change something to keep her fans still interested in the series she could have wrote something that was funny but \\"Hard Eight\\" definitely was NOT funny. It's a hard-boiled crime novel and nothing I wanted to read as Stephanie Plum series fan. All I can say is I am totally disappointed, I could have saved my money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great author","review":"Janet Evanovich books were recommended to me by a friend. I started with One for the Money and have been reading the series. I just finished Hard Eight and can't wait to start the next one. If you have ever lived in or around New Jersey or have had relatives that have, you can relate to some of the people and events in the book. I laugh out loud at some of Stephanie's encounter."},{"rating":"1","title":"writing by numbers","review":"I have eagerly awaited each new book in the series but this one has almost put me off buying any more. It feels as though it was written by someone else copying the style of the last ones. What worked in the previous books - lets throw in some of that. The car thing is getting old . The ranger scene - less said the better after such a great build up.I bought the previous books as soon as they were released in hardback. The next one can wait till paperback and even then i'll read a bit in the bookshop first before purchasing.What a letdown."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I started the series with Seven Up, loved it, then read the rest. Hard Eight was disappointing. It seems rushed, unfinished. It lacks the usual joi de vivre of the previous books. The Ranger affair was badly handled. None of the characters seemed like themselves and the situations often seemed forced. I think a bit more editing and it could have been so good (if the Ranger thing was fixed too!) I hope Nine is a return to form."},{"rating":"1","title":"Such a disappointment","review":"I fell in love with the Stephanie Plum series from the start, but feel it peaked at about #3. I still rush out to buy a new entry on the day it's published, but... I think I'll stop now. After books worth of anticipation, Stephanie's encounter with Ranger is anticlimactic; her relationship with Joe has almost reached an adult-like maturity; and the constant rehashing of past events (books) is a bore. Something has gone very wrong with this terrific character and I sure hope Ms.Evanovich can resusitate her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard Eight - Unabridged Audio","review":"REVIEW IS FOR AUDIO ONLY!!! I have all of the Stephanie Plum series in hardback and audio. I can't wait for the next book to be released. HOWEVER, I didn't even finish listening to Hard Eight. The narrator read Stephanie Plum like she was a private school graduate. She was too precise and definitely didn't come from the 'burg. I was extremely disappointed in this audio. If Lorelei King continues to narrate Stephanie Plum, I will no longer purchase these on audio."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Dark Side","review":"While this book still serves up plenty of drools and laughs, Evanovich has upped the ante in this one with some hard edges and a bit more menace. Evanovich also manages to turn up the heat as well with even more Ranger. Evanovich's writing is fluid and smooth with a great balance between the usual craziness that is Stephanie's life and the more sinister characters and situations she's put in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Romp","review":"Always a fan of Stephanie and company, I couldn't wait to settle in and read this one. Many of my favorite characters made appearances. Some of the gags are getting a bit thin, but it wouldn't be Stephanie's life without a car explosion or two and some conflict in her family and love life.I was pleasantly surprised by the appearance of a slightly nastier villain than in recent books. One of my favorite parts of the One for the Money was the edge of fear and threat. I will admit that this villain was a little too kooky to be truly scary, but the end seemed to find the energy that I was looking for.Also, I admit to being curious about number nine, since Ms. Evanovich has dropped some hints that Stephanie may be looking for something different. Always a fan, I can't fault the very formula that I rely on. It is an entertaining, if predictable read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost it!","review":"I have read 1 thru 7. Thats enough! Its not funny anymore, the plot is weak and this adult woman can't seem to make up her mind whether she is in love or not and with whom. Grandma isn't funny anymore either.

JE you can do better, just crank em out now that people buy them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Least favorite of the series so far","review":"Have absolutely loved the series up till this one.

I was looking forward to another fun and fantastic read from Janet Evonovich and was very disapointed in the results. The same elements were here as with the other 7 books in the series, but the writing wasn't on par as before. The story was told, but it never got off the ground and played itself out. It read like it was a forced and fast write instead of the witty banter, insights and character developement we've come to expect. I'm sure I'll still buy the 9th in the series, but without holding my breathe."},{"rating":"1","title":"No go!","review":"A big disappointment. I own all Stephany Plum books. I loved the first three. It was downhill since. I am returning this one to the store. It simply is not worth the money. It feels like the author ran out of ideas and in a rush to complete yet one more book. Ms. Evanovich, your readers deserve better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Action, humor andventure","review":"Loved this one as much as the ones before!

It is more a reference and source of inspiration in dealing with life's events. At the end of each chapter, there is an excellent prayer to our Father. The basis of this book demonstrates how faith in our Father and His son, Jesus, and the love they have given us strengthens us in dealing with daily situations. It is interesting to note that this book was apparently first published in 1944 and 55 years later the advice and counsel contained in each chapter is relevant today as it was then. This is the type of book that should be carried and kept on hand to help you through trying times. If used properly, the pages will become \\"dog eared\\" through frequent use.

The second time around isn't much different from the first. The spiritual theme is still intact. The vocal melodies are superb, especially with the addition of a female vocalist (uncredited) on a couple of tracks. The themes and moods range from upbeat to sorrowful to passionate. Of course most tracks are dominates by Downes' warm keyboard tones. Wetton and Downs prove once again that you can go home."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even better than the first","review":"As a long-time admirer of John Wetton's work (Uriah Heep, Asia, etc.), I was happy to see the Asia-like follow-on of Icon. While the original album had many high points (God Walks With Us, In the End), it was uneven in spots. Not so with Rubicon, which is consistently excellent throughout. The album is bookended with \\"The Die is Cast\\" and \\"Rubicon\\" (check your history books if you don't get the reference), with moments of sheer genius between. Can't wait for the next installment...I hope the upcoming Asia reunion won't spell the end of Icon."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT","review":"Very fast shipping.

I found, however, that Bening and Downey Jr. seemed terribly \\"fish out of water\\".The DVD, as well, is pretty lacklustre, with hardly an extra in sight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shakespeare meets the Third Reich","review":"Some material is so good that it's like one of those stereo speakers that is so well-made you can sink it in a fish tank for a year, pull it out, and after being a guppy condo it still works. Bach perfomed on weird electronic instruments or steel drums or with a bunch of guys on sticks is an example of this. Richard III done in an imaginary fascist England of the 1930's is another. The clothes (wonderful!), cosmetics, body language, furniture, everything dovetails flawlessly down to the smallest detail. Ian McKellen, as Richard, is one of the most convincing villians I have ever seen. The language is so wonderful, it would -- almost -- be worth having fascism it that was what it took to get leaders who spoke instead of grunted."},{"rating":"2","title":"INTERESTING PRESENTATION - NOISE INHIBITS HEARING","review":"The setting was unique and helped make the play more interesting to those of us who experienced the 1930s. I wish the producers of the video would have published the video with none of the movie scenes edited out. The practice of covering dialog with noise is unfortunate. Hearing 16th century dialog well enough to understand it is inhibited by the \\"scene noise\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Destruction of a Masterpiece: A comment on Richard III","review":"Many consider Shakespeare the greatest writer of all times and when his beautiful work is manipulated and degraded, as in this version of Richard III, it is a great loss. Movies are supposed to use actions and pictures to support the words, but here the words, not the pictures, convey the emotion and meaning in the story. In Richard Loncraine's film, it seemed the focus was on the fires, guns, sex, and violence. When spoken, the words became a meaningless extra to the movie instead of the principal pivot causing the emotions. In Shakespeare's play the emphasis was on the words spoken with passion, lust, revenge, greed, and hate. The central flaw of the movie lies in its failure to reveal the greatness of the playwright's words."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Shakespearian movie you will ever see","review":"Set in a fascist state, in depression era costumes, this version is excellent. The cast is superb and the relevance of the setting to the plot is chilling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ian McKellen is the perfect Richard","review":"Right after I had seen the movie, I started wondering whether it was ok to create this Third Reich atmosphere for a Shakespeare play. Being German, I am quite sensitive when it comes to Nazi decorations and images. However, after reading loads of secondary literature on Richard III, I realized how close the image of Richard in Shakespeare's time was to our image of Hitler. The fact that Richard is a perfect Machiavelli-Charakter reveals best in this version and one can easily feel the terror that developed in the British's minds during Richard's rule. Still, there is a trace of sympathy which you will eventually feel for the character of the 'hunchback'. This shows a bit how little certain we can be whether Richard III actually was an evil man or whether he was only made an evil man by historians...All in all this movie is fantastic and the cast including Robert Downey jr. and Annette Bening is marvellous."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Note About Where the Ending Was Borrowed From","review":"The ending is taken from \\"White Heat\\" starring James Cagney playing gangster Cody Jarrett. As he falls, back-first, from atop the chemical storage tank, the camera tracks Jarrett's plunge into the hellish flames below. Jarrett's last words are: \\"Top of the world!\\"As Richard falls to his death in the flames below, the soundtrack plays a song begins with the words: \\"I'm sitting on the top of the world, just rolling along, just rolling along....\\"It couldn't just be mere coincidence."},{"rating":"2","title":"a good interpretation","review":"The film Richard III is a modernized depiction of Shakespeare's classical play. The movie gives a good interpretation of the plot and allows viewers the opportunity to understand Shakespeare's intentions and motives. The movie is somewhat humorous and lively. The setting is set around the 1930's; thus, numerous props are replaced with modern technology. The film slightly defers from the original plot and somewhat lacks channeling the true character of Richard. However, I must commend the movie, because it does an excellent job in portraying the evil, conniving intentions of the future king. Not only does the movie succeed in depicting the deceitful life of Richard, but it also succeeds in portraying the harsh life of the royal family during."},{"rating":"2","title":"a good portrayal","review":"This movie was a good portrayal of the actual novel Richard III. If I were to give the movie a rating, I would give it four out of five stars. Richard was represented by an evil, cunning man that had a hunch on his back and wasn't able to move his arm. The other characters were very close to the actual characterization in the novel also. The setting that was in the movie could relate to how it was. For instance, the tower was some far away cooling tower that was only accessible through a single bridge. Overall, the movie was very close to portraying what it might be to us in this century. In the time of century it took place, this movie would be good to see or show to a class in English."},{"rating":"2","title":"The groundlings would have been on their feet...","review":"well, anyways, they would have even if they could have afforded seats. This film was not \\"authentic\\" Shakespeare, in that the screenplay hacked the original play to pieces, obliterating reams of unnecessary scenes and characters, rearranging the dialogue, and splicing lines, but it made for a movie that was great fun, and I think the Bard would have approved heartily of all the special effects. Ian McKellen is a god. Maggie Smith was fabulous. And I was cheering madly when that hunky Henry of Richmond--oh, never mind, I won't give it away. A pox on all those assorted culture snobs and pedantic wusses who trashed the movie in the name of \\"high art.\\" Blush, blush, thou lumps of foul deformity! I for one will never see the Wars of the Roses quite the same way again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent film","review":"This adaptation of Shakespeare's play Richard III takes place in the 1930s, and charts Richard's rise as an old-style dictator of that time. Brilliantly done, the film catches the mood of that time, complete with modern weapons, party rallies and the cult of personality. Of course, in order to make this vehicle work much of the original dialog had to be taken out or shifted but overall I think this movie does justice to Shakespeare's tale of a power-thirsty tyrant's rise to power."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Know If This Had Been Done When I Was an Embryo....","review":"...I would have become more of a Shakespeare fanatic than I am now. This is sheer brilliance in acting and filmmaking. If you don't find new meanings in the creative new setting--such as McKellen's Richard over the pissoire upon the termination of the \\"winter of our discontent\\" speech--then we can say that nothing stirs your imagination. I always have been a Robert Downey Jr. fan and to see him here in this sleeze and carnage adds to the viewing fun. Compare this with the recent \\"Titus\\" and the 80s-ish \\"Dangerous Liasons\\" with Glenni Close, Malkovich, Pfieffer."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a movie that is really great","review":"This is a movie that is really great, and was more appealling to me because it was in the time setting of the 1930's but that is what makes it a great, excitng, and almost exactly like the book except for the fact that the movie was a movie and the one Shakespeare set it back in the 1400's. The book and the movie are almost identical and that is why it is such a good movie. Plus it had to do with tanks, guns, and gasmasks, while the book had swords, horses, and knives. So in conclusion it was a thrilling movie that I wish I could see again and the movie didn't take as much time to watch instead of the time it spent to read the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"theatrical & farce","review":"a great waste for acting talents and resources.

The political framework of this long and complex story is perfectly detected thanks to its modern setting: the '30s in Europe are the most well-chosen time for the Richard's dictatorship. The all-star cast is perfect and each of them hits the target."},{"rating":"2","title":"worth seeing","review":"The movie Richard III was a very entertaining. This Shakespearean play was set in the 1940's which at first didn't make much since. But later I realized that it had to do with Richard III portraying Adolph Hitler. One thing that I noticed was the acting. In this movie, produced by Richard Loncraine, the acting was excellent. Ian McKellen, played Richard III, an evil man that was determined to become king. Ian McKellen and the rest of the cast did and excellent job of making this movie. The language was clear and comprehensible. Although there was good acting and entertainment, the movie cut out many important parts of the play. Overall I enjoyed to movie, and it was real worth seeing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for children","review":"This is a picture book and it says it's for children, but I wouldn't read it to a child. Reviews call it an Orwellian fable. The pig farmer, Mary, befriends the pig and then tricks him into getting into the van to go to the market. Trust, betrayal and death. Definitely not for young children. Besides being seriously weird it has disturbing photographs of individuals holding up different masks for illustrations. I don't know if you can see the cover well from the photo here, but that's a ring of piglets around the woman's neck.Now this was a highly reviewed and very successful book, I'm just warning you that in my opinion it's not for young children despite the fact that it's a picture book."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Charlotte's Web\\" meets \\"Animal Farm\\"","review":"Are you worried that your kids may be sleeping to soundly?

I since have become a strong believer in this Stanley product. It is with me 24/7. I too use it every day for opening mail, packages, as a tooth pick when needed, as a screw driver when needed, to pry or open any number of items. Not a day goes by when I use this item multiple times. I have taken to buying them in quantity and giving them as gifts to people who remark, upon seeing me use it repeatedly, that they wish they had one. Both family and customers. It is truly indispensible!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Disillusion Single--thoughts and feelings","review":"This is the second single from The Hour of the Bewilderbeast, by Badly Drawn Boy. This single showcases a total of 6 tracks--the original version of Disillusion, A Bottle of Tears, Wrecking the Stage, and 3 alternattive versions of Disillusion. A Bottle of Tears and Wrecking the Stage are 2 non-LP tracks which display Badly Drawn Boy's unique indie style. The original version of Disillusion and it's alternative mixes are the highlights of the single. I would definitely recommend listening to the original version before cutting your teeth on the the other mixes. Each version is a unique play on the original, blending different instrumentation to create amazing soundscapes. The Disillusion single is a must have for any Badly Drawn Boy fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Picture is misleading, but it does the job","review":"The picture of this shelf makes it seem if the bracket design makes it self supporting, but look closer, it's getting rear support from the chair rail. Well, my laundry room doesn't have one, so when I put products on the shelf, it leans. Attaching a cork strip,then pushing the washer 1 inch closer to the wall corrected the problem. I love the additional storage and organization."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far so good","review":"I just bought this and it came today- the packaging looked dated like something from the 80's and when I opened it the rubber stoppers on the ends were a permanent shade of orange which I can only assume is a result of aging. The actual shelf is a lot wider than the space between my washer and the wall- My washing machine is in a closet that the doors fold right up to so pulling the washing machine out to accommodate the width just isn't an option. Still I have it sitting on top and so far it is working if you don't mind the big over hang. I need extra space and this is definitely a space saver! I will update this review in a couple months to give a better idea of how it is going to hold up over time."},{"rating":"1","title":"PICTURE IS DECEIVING, LOOKS LIKE IT MOUNTS ABOVE DRYER ON THE WALL - IT DOES NOT","review":"This one is a horrible design. It does not mount on the wall or on the dryer. it just sits on top of the control board (where the knobs are) and puts all of the weight on the control board (which is made to take ZERO POUNDS) the two strips that you see on the wall behind the dryer is not part of the shelf.

I tried to modify this a zillion different ways but it was never going to be stable enough for my purpose. It may be just fine for the intended use...on the back of a washer or dryer. Sorry, I wasted my money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea, bad design","review":"This item is a good idea but it was not adjustable so it would not fit over my washer/dryer.

They moved into a duplex and didn't have much storage in their laundry closet. They were easy to assemble and work great. Also, my mom is short so the shelves that were in the closet were too tall for her so these were a perfect solution."},{"rating":"2","title":"Convenient shelf","review":"I really like the over the washer shelf. If I had to find some complaint, it would be that I had to pull the washer farther away from the wall then I would have preferred because of the angle of the connecting bars, but that is the worst issue (so totally do-able).My only other complaint was more for amazon and the wasteful way they shipped the items (I ordered 3, they sent each separate in really oversized boxes - all 3 could have easily fit in one box with room to spare!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"A \\"Shelf\\" that hangs on your washer - maybe","review":"I ordered this thinking it could be mounted anywhere in the laundry room. The picture shows a rail on the wall, but this thing has some metal bars that just hang off a washer. It's an awkward fit and wouldn't fit on our Fisher Paykel washer at at all because it doesn't have a back panel. It fit on the dryer, but hte shelf isn't very deep and it's difficult to get it level - a process of bending the support arms and remounting it on the dryer.Overall, it's a waste - a piece of ventilated shelving from Home Depot would have been a much better solution."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sturdy, and a great way to utilize the wasted space behind your washer/dryer.","review":"This shelf is wonderful! It allows me to store all the things I would usually use most frequently. Personally, it holds a medium size bottle of liquid Tide, the large bottle of Downy (fabric softener), a large bottle of Clorox, the extra large box of Bounce, a Bleach Pen, another smaller bottle of Clorox and a lingere bag. It definantly holds up to the challege of storing heavy items!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great.","review":"A personal organizer recommended a shelf like this for my laundry room since the shelf I had in there was too high for me to reach. this one was so easy to install and makes a big difference in how the laundry room comes off. It looks much more organized and now I am not reaching and playing peek a boo with the controls on the back of the dryer that were hidden from view with all the products stacked on top."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"This has been one of the greatest, least expected buys I've made.

It works ideally with my dryer and turned out to be extremely sturdy yet flexible enough to fit a multitude of applications. It's large and strong enough to easily support a very large container of detergent, bleach and any other laundry items. What a great way to utilize otherwise wasted space.It's design leads me to believe that it may not work with all washer/dryers. My dryer has as bit of a lip at the top that securely supports the front 'hooks' yet my washer has more of a slope that may not provide as much support.Overall i think it is a great product especially for the price!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great concept - Poor quality","review":"I loved the idea - however, the product just didn't work. The shelf actually sticks out quite a ways from the way - so to use it, I would have to pull out my washer or dryer several inches into the middle of the laundry room. I did try that, but then I couldn't get the shelf to stay & hold even a few laundry detergent bottles. I returned the item. So sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look Carefully Before Purchasing","review":"I did not take the time to truly look at what is being sold. MY FAULT. If you look at the picture, there appears to be what I thought was a support bracket across the rear of this shelf. Was I surprised (yes very) when the item arrived and there is no rear wall attached support.This shelf tries to balance/secure itself by attaching (hanging) to the control panel of the dryer and via rubber pads; friction is used for upright support. This may work on some dryers IF the control panel is the right size AND you place the dryer the correct distance from the wall AND you do not put any item of any substantial weight on this shelf.I ended up adding a rear support to this and firmly attaching it to the wall. It functions very well as it now has the ability to remain stable. The shelf itself is very strong and can support a full container of liquid detergent, softener and dryer static sheets without the items ending up on the floor behind the machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wobbly!","review":"Used to have a product like this (that I loved) that attached to the wall behind the dryer...this one fits so loosely that I couldn't use it for what I need - storing detergent, bleach, softener bottles, etc....very disappointed..."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"Disappointed in the writing.

Some of the arts profiled are lesser known, but the martial instructors profiled do a decent job describing their art, and the lessons learned about life through its practice.Particularly inspiring are profiles of the only 10th dan female practioner in Judo, and the beautiful shots of Shorinji Kempo in action.A good reminder that martial arts are not always about fighting...but a type of physical zen that leads to discipline and independence."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Healing Factor: \\"Vitamin C\\" Against Disease","review":"This is a classic!

A triumphant return to form for Terry Pratchett!","review":"After Mr. Practhett's last few installments, I was beginning to think he was resting on his laurels - it seemed he was relying too much on his previous characters and jokes to drive the series forward. How happy I was to read this book and discover that Discworld is as alive and enjoyable as ever!The main thing I like about this book is that it STANDS ALONE - it's not just another Witches book, or a Rincewind book, or a City Watch book. Albeit, there are a few cameos by the Watch, but altogether it's William De Worde's story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pritchett does it again","review":"As a 20 something I love him my 80 something grandmother agrees. Terry really knows how to grab an audience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Great Effort","review":"This is another terrific Discworld book. I loved the new characters and I enjoyed watching Ankh-Morpork assimilate this new cast into the city. The meandering plot about the rise of two competing newspapers and a conspiracy to depose the Patrician was a great set-up for the new characters. And this doesn't even begin to describe the details of the plot - featuring the dangers of a vampire who experiments with dark light, a parody of the Watergate Investigations, the comic team of the killers Mr. Pim and Mr. Tulip, the estranged relationship between William de Worde and his Father, and on and on. I thought William de Worde was a fine protagonist - and Otto Chriek was marvellous. I look forward to them as minor characters in future books - just as the Watch were minor characters in this book. Plus, Pratchett's philosophical musings were hilarious, and The Truth, as usual: \\"This is a newspaper, isn't it? It just has to be true until tomorrow.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Pratchett finally back on the track: a really humorous read","review":"After a few disappointing novels, the twenty-fifth installment in the Discworld series sees Terry Pratchett returning to humor, plain and simple. Still, the previous novel, The fifth elephant, showed that Pratchett is getting a bit more serious, and this novel continues this 'new' style. The story of William de Worde, and of the power of the Word in general, can be quite serious in places. Still, the book abounds with humorous and funny scenes, and some of the best characters from Ankh-Morpork play their roles to great effect (no Rincewind though!). If you have enjoyed any of the other books in the series, you will probably like this one as well. Let's hope Terry continues to produce works of this quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not one of his best...","review":"I'm a *HUGE* Pratchett fan, and was greatly looking forward to another week of rolling on the floor laughing, with tears streaming down my face. What I actually got was a book fairly devoid of his usual sense of humor (with a few exceptions). The running gag of Mr. Tulip cursing by saying \\"----ing\\" (where he's actually just pausing and saying \\"ing\\") was cute for the first few times... but got really annoying after a while.It's not one of Pratchett's best, but then, he's farily exceptional. On the whole though, it's a pretty good book for an ordinary writer to have written, which is why I rate it 4*."},{"rating":"2","title":"Discworld is 25 books and still going strong","review":"If you are new to Discworld novels this one is a good one to start with - although Jingo or Feet of Clay might be slightly better. If you like intelligent, funny authors start reading Discworld books right now!As with all the books Terry manages to weave more subplots than you can shake a stick at into a glorious finale and at the same time every book has a point or a message. Probably the funniest and most well written author of his era.In The Truth the Dwarfs invent printing presses and William De Worde turns his newsletter into a newspaper with interesting results for the whole city. Meanwhile the Patrician was found trying to flee with a large amount of gold and two unsavoury characters seem to have something to do with it.Some of Terry's best 'laugh out loud' moments can be found in this novel; Mr Tulip's repeated use of '-ing' is funny enough to rival Deaths speaking in capitals."},{"rating":"2","title":"funny book","review":"Thoroughly enjoyable!Terry Pratchett is a pretty good writer :-)I've been a big fan of his for some time now and this book wasn't a letdown."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE TRUTH","review":"I love Terry Pratchett. I love several of his novels more than others. He gets right at the heart of things. I loved THE TRUTH and still recommend it to people. It is about journalism and what IS the truth? Of course when you read the book you will immediately see that sensationalism is NOT the truth but sells a lot more papers. Newspapers are supposed to tell the truth. So are all the other news media. Read it. Great novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excelent Product, Glad to finally see these films.","review":"Yes, Im glad to finally see these films by Don Glut. I grew up seeing pics of them in Famous monsters of Filmlandmagazine. Some of them are pretty good, Some of them are awful. And on most of them, you will be glad for the commentary track by Glut, because thats the only way you will have any idea what the hell is going on (See The Fire MOnsters\\" for example). But SON OF TOR, the real reason to buy this disc, and likely the reason you did,does not dissapoint. Its prettty well done. TOR, KING OF BEASTS comes close. I liked the plot of TOR, KOBbetter.

I was pleasantly surprised to find out that he could and did with Monsoon. This is one heck of an adventure story. There's a little bit of everything in it -- danger, adventure, intrigue, romance, and treachery. And fortunately, Smith does a great job of tying it all together into a coherent, very enjoyable story. My only \\"complaint\\" is that I thought ending was a tad rushed -- but that's likely because I didn't want it to end. The ending does leave an opening for a sequel, but it's not the type of ending that leaves you hanging. It just leaves you wanting more. I listened to an unabridged audiobook version of the book, with David Case as the reader. As usual, Case does a good job portraying the characters and their emotions. I recommend the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well thought, cut and presented!","review":"It is the best of the wilbur smith novel!. There is no writer that I know of who can write about adventure based on the african continent the way Smith does it.I was born in Zanzibar and when Mr Smith paints the picturesque harbour of Zanzibar I can see his vivid and graphic description just matches my own memory of the Zazibar harbour.Overall the story is extremely tense and will keep you turning the pages as fast as you can.I hope we do not have to wait for a long time to get the sequel"},{"rating":"2","title":"monsoon, completely excellent reading","review":"Because I loved this book so much, I believe I have become a Smith fan for life.

The talented author develops his characters masterfully, with a very plausible plot. One can't help becoming wrapped-up in the lives of the characters, and following developments with baited breath. One thing about this author is he doesn't have a lot of grey characters... its quite easy to empathize with the 'good guys' and despise the 'bad guys' in his yarns.The rich colorful detail provided by Smith, about the background settings of events, is a characteristic of this author. He paints the setting masterfully, using the pallette of evocative words to invite you into his reality. Highly recommended!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Full of twists and turns!","review":"A wonderful sequel to Birds of Prey! This book held my attention from page one.

However, he is not there to see the final chapter....Wilbur Smith is a master storyteller. His writing is so descriptive, you can close your eyes and relive every scene with all its details. The characters are very well described and the story is never boring and always flows in a constant rythm.I really enjoyed reading this book. I took my time to really enjoy every scene the author describes and I was very sad when the book was over, because I wanted to keep on reading about all their adventures!The setting is also very exciting, with all the glamour and adventure of the trading routes between England, the Cape and Bombay.Great book, wonderful reading, very enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well written, but predictable and annoying","review":"There's no doubt that this is a well written book and well researched. But my main problem with it is that it is so predictable.The stereotypical English family -- where the elder son treats his sibilings awfully. The younger siblings who start out boys and become men. The oath one brother gives to another. The bad guy who we know must be saught out and killed. The passing of the torch. All of these things I've seen elsewhere. What's new here?The characters seem two dimensional to me. I've read other books by Mr. Smith and I found the charactewrs in them to be larger than life, unforgetable. This is a disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why did it end already?","review":"Those were my words when the enigmatic and premature end let me orphan of the fascinating saga and its attaching heroes. I salute the magic of the author in making his story take shape and live in our mind. The talent translate in hours of refined pleasures, I write my name down on the list of the sequel seekers. I left one star blank for two reasons: First, the cast is a little bit too manichean, I would like to see a little bit more complexity than good vs evil, even in Africa, reality is not black and white. Second, I wish to see a novel that will depart from brother hating brother; sister fighting sister or generations conflict could open some new windows on Mr w Smith srt of making our heart dance with the music of his words."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wilbur has outdone himself once more.","review":"After Birds of Prey ended, I hungered for more rousing adventures with Hal, Aboli and crew. After a harsh two year wait, my excitement reached its zenith, and I was rewarded with Monsoon. A continually enthralling, always awe-inspiring sequel, Monsoon never allowed for any breathing space. I followed eagerly the ongoing trials and tribulations of these Courtney ancestors from beginning to end, and was left feeling that they were a part of my own family. I enjoyed every minute of it.

I'm an avid reader and particularly enjoy sailing adventures,so naturally I read MONSOON. WHAT A MISTAKE! This book would make a fairly goodTV soap, such as Day's Of Our Lives, if in fact you could even follow thethe shallow and one dimensional characters and story. Don't waist your time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring , repetitive and adolescent","review":"Having read all of Wilbur Smiths books and considered him a wonderful writer, he seems to be churning out boring narratives. I thought Birds of Prey was terrible but gave him the benefit of the doubt. However Monsoon is dire. The repetitive descriptions and sex scenes are laughable and occur so often as to bore you to death. They are cliche ridden and appear to ber better suited to some cheap romantic novel. I think Wibur Smith is living on his previous great books but after two disappointments I will not be trying for a third."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks better than it works","review":"I got this dispenser because it has many good qualities I wanted: red color and high capacity.

I have been quilting for over ten years, have 50-60 quilting books in my library, and I have to say that this is the most convoluted technique I have ever seen. To make the type of block you see on the cover, the author wants you to cut dessert plate sized hexagons, sew them together with all the Y seams, then cut triangles along the seams of hexagon quilt top. Rotating the triangles you make stars. The technique is done with templates, marking, and scissors. I am experienced enough that I don't shy away from Y-seams and templates, but those stars can be made much more easily and faster by rotary cutting strip sets. If you really have a thing against rotary cutting, why not just cut the individual templates out for the stars? At least you don't have to do Y-seams and then hack all your work apart again. Very strange book."},{"rating":"2","title":"For an MT specialist or a complete MT reference library","review":"One of the slimmer of the Stedman's volumes, this one deals with its title subject as well as any of their others.

Certainly anyone involved closely with specialists in the field must own this book, although again, be warned this is a word book and not a dictionary or encyclopedia.

To this end, author Mark Baker collects a vast series of comments from many of the brave men and women who answered the nation's call to duty. In doing so, Baker captures the terrible bloodshed of the Vietnam war.The only negative factor of this book is that Baker is not a veteran. He is a journalist who did not serve in Vietnam. Consequently, a few of his snapshots are open to question. They certainly make for good copy but as a two tour USMC Vietnam vet I offer with absolute certainty that some parts of this book do not ring true.Nevertheless, this is an important book. Baker reaches out to vets and allows them to bare their soul. Some sections of this book are horrible. Others reflect well on the quality of the American fighting man. All in all, any young kid who foolishly thinks war is glorious and that the battlefield is a place of honor should read this book. It will probably save his or her life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Steering away from \\"evil\\"","review":"Simply put, this album shows that Evils Toy is progressing towards pop/dance/club music.

A far cry from the un-danceable, dark, sinister songs of Human Refuse, Silvertears has some catchy tunes full of energy that make you wanna get off your butt and move around.

The book was horrible. While it did have the usual low country setting, the plot was awful. The book was written in first person with the narrator being Grace, a travel agent who could not even ask her Italian-Catholic parents to include her boyfriend in their family gatherings. Her spineless mother, who couldn't stand up to her husband, and who was a slave to her own mother, supposedly had some deep secret reason for her doormat behavior, however that aspect was not even explored. Most annoying to me was the Catholic miracle aspect. Perhaps Frank ought to reconsider writing novels and write sales material for holy water and religious statues."},{"rating":"2","title":"FANTASTIC!!!!!!!","review":"Being a full blooded Italian woman married to an Irish Protestant this book hit home in soooo many ways.

Do not recommend unless you like to \\"argue\\" catholic and non-catholic views."},{"rating":"2","title":"4.5 stars","review":"I stayed up all night just to finish this! It was well worth the baggy eyes I'll be suffering from tomorrow. The characters are fantastically flawed, the setting is gorgeous(only Frank does justice to coastal Carolina), and everyone can relate to the search for something to believe in. I won't write any more because I hate plot spoilers, but I know this story will haunt me for days. The only reason I rated it 4.5 stars is because I wasn't the vintage Dot I adore. Nonetheless, this is a book well worth reading.

The past three releases, \\"Shem Creek,\\" \\"Pawleys Island\\" and this latest one have an ultra-simplistic viewpoint. The plots are becoming less plausible, and for some reason, I am not sympathetic towards the main characters. \\"Plantation\\" and \\"Sullivans Island\\" were so rich and fulfilling that I feel as though the author is now just adding water and stirring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"I have loved all of DBF's previous books and looked forward to this one. It was readable and the characters were worth knowing; but, the story itself was weak and having finished it I didn't care. Usually I hate for her books to end and I have reread all of them several times. (I read a book a day so finding something new is often a problem and I reread the tried and true.) This time I didn't care that the book had ended and the feeling I had was that I had been cheated of a DBF story. The religious aspect of the plot was predictable and ultimately a total turn off."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Turn About","review":"The presentation and theme of this book was a huge turn about from the past writings of Dorothea Benton Frank. Previously, her stories were enormously witty, fast paced, and a mixture of light heartedness and reality. Much emphysis was on the geographical area of the story giving it an almost pulsating feeling of the weather in South Carolina. I truly missed the former way of her writing as I have read all the books she has done. Perhaps she has had a religious experience that has made the difference. I hope in her future writings that she recaptures the excitement, fun, and warmth, she put forth in her other books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!","review":"Full of Grace is such a BIG disappointment! Hopefully, this is just a temporary \\"phase\\" the writer is experiencing... The characters, especially Grace, lack depth to the extent that they're like paper dolls and stereotypes - in fact, the whole book is just too \\"cute,\\" had too much religion and too many miracles. In these days of political correctness, if I want to read about religious experiences and conversions, I'll read my newspaper - the storyline in this book was so \\"correct,\\" that I skimmed over a good portion of it. I've read all of Doreatha Benton Frank's books - Plantation is one that I've kept and have re-read about 4 times - the characters and the lifestyle are warm and funny and interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"A New Twist","review":"I just finished Full of Grace and loved it! Yes, it is different from your other fabulous books, but once I got going, I couldn't put it down. Fr. John is my kind of guy and we sure need more like him. As the parent of young adults, I pray that our children will appreciate the importance of family, a personal relationship with God and a faith community. You did such a great job with Michael, Grace and all the family. I loved all the wedding dialogue at the end. I startled the dogs by laughing out loud. I also look forward to more \\"traditional\\" Low Country tales. Keep up the good work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very different, but still good story....","review":"First this book is very different from her regular low country tales. There is still family, still troubles, but this book has more of a faith based story. I had no problem with Dot going in this direction because I am a believer in miracles, they happen every day. I did get frustrated sometimes with our main character but by 1/3 of the way through the book she finally found her wings and begin to grow. I loved the ending, while some people think it may be far fetched I do not, and while some parts were sad, the whole story was wrapped up quit nicely. I look forward to Dot's next book (always) and I highly recommend this book too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hate to be preached to and this book may as well be Sunday school","review":"This book was so promising, funny, super likable main character, interesting story...but then she had to go and ruin it by not only bringing god into it but bombarding the reader with lectures, sermons, and religious rhetoric. It got so bad that even though I enjoyed the characters, I couldn't finish the book. According to the author, god can cure everything from a hang nail to incurable cancer if you just BELIEVE and, given that the author believes you're thick headed, she feels the need to fill half of every chapter with preaching. Didn't notice this book being sold as Christian reading, if its not, it needs a warning label. Extremely disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clash of values","review":"Grace Russo is from a large, noisy Italian family who doesn't shrink at offering their opinions about almost anything. Their opinion about Grace's relationship with her live-in boyfriend Michael is not very high. He's Irish, he's not a practicing Catholic, and he dabbles in stem-cell research in his job. They don't even invite Michael to their house which embarrasses Grace but does not discourage her from her relationship with him. Dorothea Benton Frank creates some memorable characters in this book and weaves a good story in the process."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just couldn't get into it","review":"Sorry folks, I just couldn't get into this one. In the firs couple of paragraphs only a politician could use this many words and say this litte.Love DFB's books but this was a let down. Too many good books to read without belaboring something I just didn't like."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just didn't come together...","review":"DBF was trying something different with this book- and I appreciate that- but the effort just didn't gel. Grace, a worldly travel agent, lets her overbearing extended family bully her emotionally. This organized and ballesie travel agent, whose boyfriend does stem cell research, caves into that? That premise didn't wash and Grace's extended and detailed faith crisis really wore me down.DBF's humor was still there, but I disliked Grace's family so much, and tired of the overly described faith crisis, that I just became irritated and started skimming and flipping pages to get finished (I've never had to do that with a DBF book before). The travel agent slant allowed DBF to describe other locales, but, DBF, please return to writing about the sea water and marsh of the Low Country. That's what hooked us!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"This book was recommended to me by a friend and I am so glad I read it. I found myself actually laughing outloud at the main character and her family. It's about a single Italian woman who meets the love of her life who just happens to be Irish and a non believer. According to her family, who are strict Catholics, it couldn't get much worse! You will fall in love with her and her family and witness a \\"miracle\\" at the conclusion. It's light, entertaining and a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not your typical DBF novel....but I liked it!","review":"This book was different from the other books written by Dorthea. The fact that the main character was from New Jersey, was Italian and Catholic was far from the normal Southern themes that run rampant in the Dorthea B Frank collection. I liked it though. I'm not Italian but I am Catholic and I enjoyed reading about the references to the Catholic religion through out this book. I did recognize the DBF humor though. I got a big kick out of the fact that Grace couldn't remember Marianne's mother's name. Classic Frank humor. I think Dorthea likes wine and loves to eat and either has traveled a lot or wishes she has. All of her books are filled with food, wine and far away places. This one in particular. The ending was very hopeful. I commend Dorthea for giving us all a little more hope and a little more faith. This is probably one of my favorites of the Frank collection.

From Indian creation stories and early Indian/European encounters to life in Seattle in modern times, it's all here. I think the length is just about right also. Too many books labor their point, whereas this one ends just as you've had your fill of rugged individuals and the tough landscape they occupy.

Her acting was very painful to watch and her character's actions made no sense. I guess the creators of the movie hope you don't ask questions, this is a movie you just have to accept as being 98 minutes of nothing. The movie leaves nothing to the imagination--it is predictable, pointless and a huge let down.

I was wrong. They took this horrible concept and created a very well done movie. At no point did I say to myself, \\"This is tacky, turn it off.\\" Perhaps, I enjoyed it so much because I went into the movie expecting another \\"Human Centipede\\" type film (BTW don't waste your time on that movie), but I doubt it."},{"rating":"1","title":"teeth","review":"This is one of the dumbest movies that i have ever seen. the idea of this movie was different than anything i had heard before, but the movie is not worth watching. wish i never bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"So bad it's good","review":"This movie is based on a medical condition known as vagina dentata, teeth in the vagina that bite off the particular part of a man that goes past that barrier uninvited. This condition is nothing more than an urban legend, there is no basis in fact.Of course, basis in fact is hardly required for horror movies, since they're almost always based in the supernatural. The issue here is that the plotline is so predictable, the acting so horrendously bad, that the movie leaves you laughing where you're supposed to be scared. This movie is classified as a \\"horror comedy\\". It certainly achieves the second part, the first is left open to just how far you can distance yourself from what a terribly made movie it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pandora's...Umm...Dawn's Box","review":"4 Stars = Classic\\"There is something wrong with Dawn\\"A black comedy with bite, cult classic! This film is every man's deep seated nightmare when having sex with a woman, the ultimate female revenge!Funny & scary, this is a original film to say the least, from an idea as old as chastity it's self. No film maker has had the testosterone testicle fortitude to confront this malicious munching monster, until this film! But here it is, in all it's toothy terror!The moral of the story; don't go sticking your business in where it may not bring a return, literally!Don't be surprised guys, if you find your legs crossed while watching this film. It's safer that way! And if your wife, girlfriend, or a strange woman is smiling at you while watching this film, go immediately to the shower & turn the cold water on, then leave the state!Nuff said!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stream quality","review":"I do not have this problem with Netflix and thought I would give Amazon another shot for a few movies. The stream quality, quite frankly, sucks. I will let the movie buffer for a good while and come back to watch it. I can never seem to watch it all the way through without it pausing and buffering.

It's sick!!!!It makes a mockery of women and sex and is almost pornographic.There is no redeeming value to be found in this movie...watching itjust brings one down to the base level of the absurd content whichall hinges on the severing of penises by a young girl who has teeth in her vagina!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome","review":"This movie was great. It's not scary, it's only a little suspenseful, but it is entertaining as S*#@t. A good movie, you laugh, you'll cringe, you'll gasp, and then you'll laugh again. But not a bad laugh. Not the \\"Oh my god this movie is terrible\\" laugh but a good entertaining laugh. That's what movies are made to do is entertain...and this one does. Worth the 2.99 to at least rent and see."},{"rating":"1","title":"A gruesome and hateful tale.","review":"This is the best example of misandry in a film I have ever seen, which nowadays is quite an accomplishment. There is definitely a persistent air of misandry throughout the film where all men are jerks, rapists, or molesters, who all ultimately reap brutal retribution. The one notable exception to this rule is the father; likely a concerted effort by the director to ward off charges of propagating negativeof male stereotypes.If you take joy in seeing male sexist pigs get their come-uppance, in graphic,John Bobbitt style, as the camera relishes over their mutilated genitals, than this is the film for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gives New Meaning to [...]","review":"Typical B-movie you'll find late night on cable TV. It's difficult to label it a comedy, thriller, or horror movie since it didn't generate any laughs, thrills or scary moments. The movie is also quite slow and boring. It would've made a bigger splash if it were your typical \\"T & A\\" teen movie with lots of nudity, but then again, it's hard to get hard watching penises getting lopped off. In Russia, [...] eats you! :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Utterly Silly, but, in Its Own Way, A Triumph","review":"There are films from time to time that convince me that Hollywood writers get together in bars or their homes, get high, and then challenge one another to put together a complete script around an impossible premise and get it produced. If that is not the origin of this script, it might as well have been. Even to describe the premise would be a spoiler. Let us just say it concerns a mythical anatomical feature around which the entire plot revolves. And revolves. And revolves. And revolves. I'm not even sure who I would recommend this film to. I don't know that I would want to have the sort of friends that I would want to recommend it to. And I will say this: the folks who made this film definitely did not bite off more than they could chew."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whaaaaa!?","review":"Just plain weird.

But you WILL find yourself laughing your guts out. I especially liked the crunching sound \\"it\\" made while chomping down, and found the \\"fisting\\" scene (what else would you call it??) in the gynecologist's office to be especially hilarious. I also liked the way she \\"spit\\" her stepbrother's \\"thingy\\" out on to the floor for the dog to eat. You had to see that coming a mile away.Even funnier than the movie itself was the half hour \\"behind the scenes\\" feature where the principles and actors talked about it like it was something BESIDES a D-list exploitation flick. Looking for deeper meaning in a compost heap would make better sense. Just watch it and enjoy, you will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good execution of a crazy plot device","review":"The movie was very good. It had a lot of humor and was on some levels a spoof of other B horror movies. It has good pacing and some nice gore to keep you on your toes. If you happen to watch Nip/Tuck, you'll notice an actor from that series as Dawn's step-brother.Dawn is played by Jess Weixler and is very cute - that doesn't hurt the movie at all. She does a great job of playing the transformation that happens to her character. She starts out as a very goody-goody teenager who's very active in a sexual abstinence group.Things happen along the way and she is a very different person by the end.I'd recommend Teeth. It's definitely worth a watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"one word... dumb","review":"when i saw this movie for the firt time i thought i was geting myself into something unique. the concept of the movie was original and seemed entertaining, but in all honesty it was a huge letdown. there is never any explanation for what is going on and the end is really stupid. in fact, everything that goes on from the beginning until the end is really bad as well. its one of those movies that starts and then tops and you are left wondering why.to some the idea of a movie about a girl with teeth downstairs may seem silly but thats half the fun. if you hope to see violence or hear something humorous get something else. this is by far the biggest let down i have had when seeing a movie in a long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Psuedo-porn and no real horror","review":"I bought this used from a local store after finding out it wasn't available to rent. The story line sounded interesting. It turns out to be almost rookie-level filming, thin story line, vague insinuations (like them living near a prominently shown nuclear power plant), and then the obligatory boob shot of a teenager. Almost as scary as an infomercial, I'm glad I only spent $5."},{"rating":"1","title":"ZZZZZZ","review":"THE FIRST 40 MINUTES OF THIS MOVIE SUCKED. I THOUGHT I GOT BURNED AGAIN.

I THOUGHT THAT HOLE CONCEPT WAS SO STUPID. WHAT HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS WOULD DO SOMETHING THAT RIDICULAS? I THOUGHT IT WAS FUNNY WHEN SHE WENT TO THE DOCTORS OFFICE FOR A CHECK UP.

It wasn't suspenseful, nor all that entertaining, nor did it feed the violence hungry viewers among us.Our main character, the radical high school prude, is not a hero, nor an anti hero. I don't particularly like her nor do I dislike her. The acting overall reminds me a bit of high school plays, especially the brother.There is not much gore and the tid bits of violence we do get are not all that wild, despite the \\"toothful\\" situation. Even though the premise could call for some exotically erotic scenes you'll be disappointed here as well.The cinematography and editing are by the books and I was once again reminded that too many directors don't take advantage of the variety \\"film language\\" can offer to create stunning visuals that tell a story or just simply entertain us viewers. The director relied too much on the shock effect of the girl's \\"talent\\" however failed to actually be shocking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of.........","review":"What a waste of time!

I mean, how could the director and studio go so wrong with such a beautiful, solid concept? It's basically a feel-good movie about a young woman coming-of-age, dealing with the trials and tribulations of having teeth in her nether-region. I think the script is probably more suitable to the likes of James Cameron or Michael Bay. Imagine what they could've done with it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting","review":"Wow what a movie.

The movie is ultimately about a living example of the dentata myth. The main character Dawn is a squeaky-clean teenager who takes part in a local chastity group, & as such doesn't discover what makes her \\"special\\" until she's attacked. While there are some parts to it that could have been fleshed out (no pun intended), it's ultimately a highly enjoyable horror flick.Would I recommend this to a friend? Only if that person isn't squeamish. Not only is there a huge amount of blood, but the subject matter (male genitalia being bitten off) would make anyone wince. I highly suggest that if you are purchasing this for someone else that you first rent the movie to ensure that they like it. It's a great film, but it's not for everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Open Wide","review":"OK, now the idea of dentata for me (a male) was of curiosity. Of course, like the cat that followed curiosity, I believe this movie provoked fear. I loved this film. I found the morbid curiosity that brought me to view the film, also pulled from me the feelings of the unknown toward women. I thought the piece was empowering for women, and the lead actor Jess Weixler is someone to watch for upcoming films. I wonder how someone could put this film in his or her resume, but I?m not an actor, just an author. If the idea of (Can't say here) dentata frightens you, don't watch this film. I though the violence was subtle in much the way things was implied without being shown. All the same, I still cringed with every sound effect. Also, I think I laughed the hardest when she finally seeks professional help. Sometimes in features where the monster is shown for exposition at the end of the film...this movie will not leave you wanting. I will be watching for more from this script writer and director."},{"rating":"2","title":"crazy camp movie","review":"Teeth is about a young girl blossoming into woman hood only to find out she has teeth in the one place no guy wants.What was so funny about this movie was its female lead.

I'm a huge fan of movies that push the envelope and aren't afraid to go too far. I was disappointed in this because though the concept itself is great and hilarious the movie didn't push it to the limit I feel it could have. You could tell they wanted to but were too hesitant to really put this movie into a memorable creeper film. It's good if you're not into movies that disturb \\"average\\" people and if you're not used to this kind of weird ideal but it's a little boring if you are and feels kind of childish in that sense. All the killings are pretty much implied with little to no visibility."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute and Useful","review":"These are just fine, exactly as advertised. The thing is, I didn't read the description very well and they are much smaller than I imagined - just slightly bigger than a small votive candle.

On \\"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas\\" and \\"Silver Bells\\", he plays tenor saxophone, which helps out a bit. \\"Silver Bells\\" is actually the best song on the CD, for what it's worth.

Again I say: Ack."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hah. Bad.","review":"Don't buy this. Please, please, don't encourage this. The way Kenny G \\"writes\\" is to take an old song, play it at half tempo, and add a grace note, trill, or turn every measure. So basically, purchase of this album could be entirely circumvented by playing a Christmas record on 45 at 33 rpms, and occasionally hitting the turntable.Honestly, if you want good jazz, try maybe Keith Jarrett?

I must have heard this CD scores of times between Thanksgiving and Christmas Eve, but I barely noticed it because it's so lifeless and dull. I love Christmas music, but Kenny G's Christmas album is the kind that gives Christmas music a bad name.I will never forget the elderly man who came up to me with a copy of this CD and said, \\"Man, this guy plays a horn like you won't believe!\\" Kenny G? Whenever I want a chuckle I remember that line.

He was am impassioned, motivational speaker. Last year this book was required reading for all the teachers at the school where I am employed. Most of us did not read very much of it because we were put off by the book. In fact, there is a running joke among the teachers that Mel really thinks \\"there are no lazy students\\".

Educators can sadly have blinders to differences in learning style. Mel Levine's work reminds me of Howard Gardner's in many ways. I sense that he truly cares about kids and I like that he supports what is best practice in education. Levine says he can learn more about a child by getting to know that child than by reading a list of test scores........let's hear it for that!

The previous reviewer who suggested that a reader not buy the book because of the accusations against Dr. Levine is overlooking the fact that many, many parents and teachers have found his books very helpful and hopeful. He has already volunteered to revoke his license and is no longer seeing patients. But what he has to say about children with learning differences gave me insights to both my children who have their own individual struggles. Instead of focusing on their inability to spell or memorize where the states are, I see two very creative children with their own gifts. Would I bring my children to see him? Not a chance.

It is clear and well written and can be also entertaining. It applies to children with or without learning disabilities. The main thesis is that for better or worse, everybody is afflicted by a learning disability, even if that can be minor and didn't give rise to any problem at school. Defects can be unnoticeable and go undetected. Sometimes those problems lies in unexpected places. We can develop, consciously or unconsciously, strategies to come around those little difficulties.

Great use of unknowntalented actors, affordable only because they have not yet gotten their great break, whichjudging be their performances, they shortly will. Much better story than his previous Looking for Kitty,but with the same kind of alternate soundtrack director's commentary taking the viewerbehind the scenes and teaching a mini-course in low budget Indie film production. A MUST for anyaspiring Indie film maker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avid Burns' film fan.....","review":"but this film is certainly not one of his better films. Boring and predictable.

Matt Bush as the sports talk show host is annoying throughout with his insistence on always being 'nice,' to the point of complete absurdity. In this movie, everyone else is doing what they want except him, only he can't see it. The problem is the part is overwritten, so it all comes across as relentlessly unlikely. The fact that he is also about a foot shorter than either girl doesn't add to the situation. Watch if you are desperate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Facinating Collection","review":"this was a great addition to my library. i have a fascination for anything grotesque, especially medical journals. the pictures are wonderful, taken with great angles showing details of the diseases. my only regret is that it really is just a collection of pictures. it doesn't provide an explanation or details of the client or of the disease that they are suffering from. this would have been useful for others who view this book who do not have knowledge on the medical conditions that these people suffered from. apart form that, it's a great book"},{"rating":"2","title":"Photos that'll burn into your mind","review":"This is a collection of some truly stunning photographs.

The only issue I have is the book is smaller format. The opportunity to see what certain conditions will do if not treated is a rare treat. In modern medicine these things are not \\"allowed\\" to get this far advanced. Get this book, you won't regret it. Unless you are looking for a coffee table book.

Especially nice were the cross section drawings in 1/144 scale and the isometric drawings of the hull (no scale). A real plus for the model builder is the 8 pages of rigging schedule that give cable/rope dimensions along with the size and number of blocks/hearts/deadeyes etc. associated with them for both the standing and running rigging.

This book, however, often gave examples I couldn't really follow along with because I don't have the graphics or other tools he's using or he didn't explain how to construct them myself. Too many of the keyboard commands for Windows are incorrect. I found myself just trying any keyboard combination I could think of to figure out what the author meant to write. He also tends to explain the most complicated, roundabout way to access things in Photoshop. I often found an easier way myself or by looking in another book. Many of the links are incorrect (though probably updated in the new book). The last two chapters are useless and read as though tacked on in a hurry.

It reads like first draft, highly disorganized, with clunky prose. The \\"borrowing\\" issues of Ambrose's career are not addressed, but for an interesting experience, read his chapter on the Battle of New Orleans in conjunction with Theordore Roosevelt's account.Very sloppy editing and fact-checking. Two major boners that jumped right out: US soldiers did not carry BARs in Kosovo, and the MacArthurs, Arthur and Doug, were the first father and son to win the Medal of Honor."},{"rating":"2","title":"The last book of a great historian.","review":"It is a shame Ambrose died of cancer. I looked forward to his yearly books in the nineties. Although his last book was clearly a very readable book, it is not his best. It is summary history of what he learned throughout his life. He states his dislike for Nixon, but also states that what he did in holding the country together demonstrated his abilities. His admittance of some of his mistakes shows a truly great historian and gentleman.If you have read his other books, this is basically a rehash of all his other books. Since I have read many of his books, I did not learn much, but it was a pleasure to read his summary history.

I love Hawaii and I would really like to do to France sometime. However this book seems rather superfluous really compared to others. I mean I like kangeroos, but do I like them THAT much. I'm not sure. Oh well. This is a wonderful book because it's sixteen dollars cheaper here than at this other store where it was thirty. It's not very concise like this other book I read about Hawaii. In that book the words were garbled so it was very difficult to read...I think it might have been written in Spanish. Anyway I love Hawaii."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappointment","review":"The Eyewitness Guides are an oustanding series, so I bought this one without a second thought. Alas, this seems more like a placeholder than a serious attempt at writing a guidebook - a kind of \\"watch this space\\" advertisement masquerading as a book. It's so thin, in fact, that the cover seems to sag; the spine is thicker than the pages! The coverage of Oahu is decent, so if you only plan to go to Honolulu, the book might be worthwhile. But the coverage of Kauai (where we spent most of our time) and the Big Island were very poor. I'd very highly recommend the \\"Ultimate Kauai Guidebook\\" for Kauai instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bad","review":"I am a big fan of Dorling Kindersley Travel Guides, so I was greatly disappointed when I received this pamphlet sized guide to all of Hawaii. It contained slightly more information than I would expect from airport brochures on arrival. With roughly 10 picture covered pages per island, the guide is attractive, but not very useful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just plain bad","review":"As colourful and glossy this is, it would be a plain waste of money to buy this Eyewitness guide. DK does publish some excellent books, but this is just not one of them. As DK is traditionally weaker in hotel and food recommendations, it usually more than makes up for it with impressive content mixed with beautiful pictures. This is not the case in Hawaii, however. Coverage of each island is a maximum of 30-40, more realistically 15-25. At 208 pages, this guide seriously falls short of expectations. Try lobbying DK to make a much better Hawaii guide the next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too short, too high level","review":"We own about 15 of the DK Eyewitness Travel guides, and have dogeared the pages over several trips. They are amazingly useful.But this one is not their best effort. Hawaii is a very diverse place, and to try and \\"hit the highlights\\" in a travel guide is a mistake. This book is right at 200 pages, but almost 80 are about Honolulu, Wakiki and Oahu, leaving only 120 pages for all of the other islands. Even the pieces about Oahu (with little info about the west coast/Makaha and just a mattering on the North Shore) and Honolulu (with a few measly paragraphs on Pearl Harbor) is scant.As I said, I love the DK Eyewitness series, it is the first travel book we get when going someplace new. But for Hawaii, there are several other books more in-depth. If you are going to Maui or The Big Island, I suggest getting Maui:Revealed or Hawaii The Big Island: Revealed (each 300 pages, pictures, maps, etc.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Absurd","review":"This book stretches reality to the point of absurdity.

There are several main characters, all with a host of problems, some quite humorous. As the book progresses, the situations become more and more outlandish. In the end, however, the true meaning of the outcome is sincere and down to earth. Each character ends up right where he or she belongs. In Corrie's \\"final words\\", we realize that what one accomplishes in a lifetime may not be what one expects, but it is worthwhile nonetheless, and especially if one has done exactly what made him/her the most happy.

There aren't even enough stickers to give to every student in a typical classroom!The rubber stamps are high quality, but geared for younger children... which is why I'm confused about the \\"frowny face,\\" because most teachers of young children know that drawing frown faces on children's papers is not best practices (it's not constructive). If you buy this set, you need to ask yourself if four or five decent, cute stamps are worth your money - the rest of the set is pretty much useless, and you will have to buy a new inkpad soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't think you're Getting REAL TEACHER STAMPS!","review":"The price seemed too good to be true and it was. Is this a toy? I thought it was going to be a working set of stamps with a stamp pad. The stamp pad was too dry and I could not get any ink on the stamp. I added a couple Tablespoons of water to the stamp pad. I attempted to put a stamp on a student paper, but it merely made a small blotch of watery ink. It was impossible to see a smiley face on the paper.At this point, I will tell you this set is not worth buying if you are a teacher. The stamps worked a little better on a good ink pad I purchsed separately, but I still wouldn't waste my time trying to use them to create legible stamps on 50 student papers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classroom Stamps","review":"I purchased this stamp set for my nine year old son.

I happened to talk to my friend who has the same problem and she had replaced one already but the new door started to crack again after a while. So I decided not to replace it, which turned out to be a good choice because it stopped heating after merely three years of service. I have since used a Whirlpool for two years without problems.

All the characters speak with the same voice. The story leads nowhere and says nothing. The many fantasy elements are used not to illuminate truths, which good fantasy can do, but as an excuse for implausibility and incoherence. The one saving grace of the novel is the affectionate description of some aspects of Los Angeles history and geography. The passages about Mount Lowe are fascinating to anyone who lives here.

The recipes are useful in themselves and also served as examples for me with my own meal planning.The first book in the Daoust's series (40-30-30 Fat Burning Nutrition) is the \\"bible\\" and I keep it in easy reach all the time for the tables it contains, but \\"Formula 101\\" has helped me broaden my understanding and better use this nutrition concept. That's why I am sending a copy of \\"101\\" to the friend who gave me my copy of \\"40-30-30 Fat Burning Nurtition\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dynamite's exploding wit this album........","review":"Dynamite comes from the streets and this is reflected throughout her album. The introductory track which sets the tone for the rest of the album contains lyrics like 'life's full of pain, life's full of stress, especially when yr comin' from the streets...'Her released tracks 'Dy-Na-Mi-Tee' 'Put him out' and 'It takes more' are infectous RnB with a garage tinge. However, don't confuse Dynamite as a garage artist...she's principally RnB. Although the tracks she's released are quite 'in yr face' Dynamite does relax with a slower beat with emotional tracks like 'Brotha.' Personally, my favourite tracks are 'seed will grow' which is mellow with Dynamite and Keymani Marley both soundin amazin 2getha, 'Krazy Krush', a track with a great beat, and 'Now u want my love' which is hugely soulful and meaningful.Maybe a couple of tracks on the album are not providing much different but there isn't much to say about Dynamite thats negative."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great U.K. Import!","review":"I too heard Ms. Dynamite while in the U.K. I loved her single \\"Dy-na-mi-tee\\" and wanted to here more. Her music is much different then the R&B/Rappers here in the States. Some songs are more soulful and others \\"tell it like it is\\". There are a variety of different types of songs from Rap to R&B.. A couple songs did remind me of Pink. Great CD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ended up giving this to my boyfriend.","review":"I was expecting more of the booty-shaking garage MC'ng I have come to love from Miss Dynamite...and what I got sounded more like something from Faith Evans or Deborah Cox. There's maybe 2 tracks where MD gets down and dirty, most of it is R&B. I was pretty darn disappointed, but my boyfriend loved it so I gave it to him. Don't expect much similar to her earlier work with So Solid Crew and other garage staples."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sam7xl says pick it up","review":"Ms. Dynamite is a truely talented artist for a first LP this album is amazing and she only 20 years old!

Granted, I would probably say I'm above average when it comes to figuring gadgets out so don't feel bad if it takes a little longer. It seemed rather intuitive to me, but when I showed it to my roommate he was completely lost.This is the perfect self-motivation tool for someone that wants to lose weight, burn fat, and ultimately get in better shape.Speaking as a soon-to-be (250 hours through a 500 hour program) personal trainer, I consider this a solid investment for myself.You don't need to be a total fitness nerd to love this toy. If you're just looking to burn fat and lose weight without paying for training (which is understandable given the current state of the economy), I would highly recommend this (type of) watch to help you achieve your fitness goals. Whatever they may be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Getting me fitter","review":"A great device for fitness motivation for a newcomer. Before, when I was running and rowing it was difficult to be sure of progress, now I see that, for the same heart rate, I am, week on week, increasing my pace and distance.

The user's manual (even the online version) is awful--even the font on both versions is too small. Even getting the strap on one's own wrist is a little tough. What were they thinking? I had a Polar heart rate monitor years ago (which one, I can not recall). I liked that one. It was easy to use, and it had a good display. But the RS 100 is JUNK ! Don't buy it, or you'll be sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product!","review":"The Polar RS100 is simple, objective, does what it is supposed to do in a clear way.

Polar could learn a great deal about button layout from competitors.1. watch seems to have completely dropped the time and date reset. Set once, that's it? -can't adjust for Daylight Savings Time, can't change time zones? Pretty sad.2. testing the functions, can not reset to zero. Would be nice to begin each run with a clean 0:00 start point.Real disappointment, simply not too functional. Recommend buying something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very accurate","review":"Tried out the HRM today without actually exercising.The transmitter is quite good and the watch picks up the heart beat in a heart beat!However the reading is not steady. My resting BPM ranged from 70-96.

Use them all the time.The information available, from these units, are more than we use, but would be great for the pro.They have worked great until very recently.Both units very recently logged inaccurate max heart rates, each on different days.This might not even be due to the units but could be caused by some kind of electronic interference. We will be testing for this.Aside from that hiccup, they have been flawless for a couple years.A turn off was the admonition to return the units to the factory for battery replacement.The batteries finally did start to go.Replacement of the battery in the wrist unit and the chest strap was very easy. Just be aware that replacement of a battery, by other than the factory, during the warranty period, could affect the warranty.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good","review":"Hi everybodyExcelent product and nice.

Now, I know that HRMs aren't medical devices (as this one proves), but wow.I tried the included transmitter with my recumbent that also has a polar receiver and transmitter with the included cable. The bike shows correct and crap-watch is at almost half.I tried them both with the bike's transmitter and a spare I had. Again, the bike reads correctly and the crap-watch doesn't.Reading on other sites (without the shill reviews here) shows that this watch does have a problem. Maybe it's only 1 production run or something, but something is definitely off with this watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Got it today","review":"Got this today and seems great. I had a polar s720i HRM with no transmitter (lost it)and that was why I bought this. Turns out the transmitter for this RS100 sends a signal to my s720i and the s720i is able to pickup the signal. Both watches said 88 BPM. YEA!!!. Well, we will see if I continue to be happy with it. I will take it swimming in the next week and add to this review."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's ok","review":"I find it hard to read the screen.

I believed them, so I went ahead and purchased the Polar RS100 and made sure to precisely follow the instructions on how to take good care of the unit. I did only to have problems again after 7 months and only maybe ten occasions to use it! Sent to repair directly to Polar thinking it was under warranty but... no, the watch's warranty is 1-year but the strap only 6 months... and of course the strap was the problem and got charged two new batteries, too... I will not buy Polar again."},{"rating":"1","title":"high dead or low dead","review":"The set up seemed fairly simple, but the performance was not satisfactory. Sometimes it accurately displayed my heartbeat. Other times the display indicated that my heartbeat was in the mid-30's. Not likely. Or in the high 150's. Also unlikely. Lacking any confidence in the results I returned the product for an Amazon refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a little confusing and a little annoying....","review":"I bought this heart rate monitor because it met my four requirements in a HRM: Polar, able to display HR as a percentage of max, backlight, and able to store a training session. In those areas, it's a stellar product. But the two things I don't like about this model are really annoying to me. It doesn't have a walk test, so it is difficult to program my zones. I can guess, but it doesn't feel right to me. Also, the beep it produces when you are not in the zone is obnoxious, and unlike my RS5, I can't turn it off. It gets the job done, and I'll live with it, but if I knew then....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Value for the Price","review":"There is no doubt that Polar makes solid, highly functional and very durable products. The RS100 is no exception. I wanted something to help me control my efforts and help record my progress as I returned to fitness after a prolonged muscular back injury. The features and the price point of the RS100 fit that bill perfectly.The unit has all the critical features for heart rate based training, (duration, HR avg, max, lap times, etc) with no extra clutter. The menus are simple. The navigation actually makes sense after the setup process. I have used this unit for about 30 hours worth of workouts now and have been very pleased. The buttons are easy to access during activity and the heart rate strap is super easy to use and typically stays up. Its nice that it can double as a watch when needed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice","review":"The monitor works very well and was very reasonably-priced.The only reason I am docking it a star is that the programming, control and navigation are not very intuitive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Polar RS100","review":"The Polar RS100 works great.

The watch's functions are pretty easy to pick up, but the light stopped working the 2nd day I used it. I asked Amazon to exchange and they no longer had it in stock so they only offered me a refund. My girlfriend paid $75 for this watch and the current price is $108, so it didn't make sense for me to get a refund. The watch does what I want. It only holds one workout at a time though so if you need more then you should upgrade. I track my workouts through excel so it is sufficient for me. It works pretty well with Life fitness treadmills too. I would recommend this if you just want it for basic things like heart rate, stopwatch, and calories burned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"Based on other reviews I choose the RS100. I love it! I really enjoy using it in the water for my laps. That was a awesome surprise. I would recommend this product, but had troubles during my last half marathon and bike ride. I couldn't get it to read my heart rate and keep it for the duration of my workout. Disappointing to carry it without it working and not quite sure why, but next time I will make sure its working with no interference before heading to the start line."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inaccurate HR reading","review":"This HRM is completely inaccurate. It's not that it is not reading my heart rate, but that it says that my resting HR is 39-40 bpm, when it is actually around 60. It did work one time but that was it. Every time I've used it, except for one workout, it has stated that my HR is between 40-55 bpm during a heavy workout! I'm going to have to return it and I'll probably get a Timex instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm sticking to my old HRM","review":"My ancient polar S210 needed a new battery so I decided on a long overdue upgrade. Boy was I disappointed. The rs100 seemed to have all the features I was interested in, and the price was fair, but right out of the box, it never accurately recorded my heart rate, even when I used it with my old chest strap (which has always transmitted my heartrate accurately to my S210). The only good marks I can give this whole experience was that amazon.com has a very simple return process that made this ordeal nearly painless. I have since replaced my old S210 battery and watch band and am back in business."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great return for your money.","review":"all the simple basic functions I was looking for are here and they work great.and it can go as a everyday watch, unlike all the ftX polars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not what was desired, but works well.","review":"I called Polar and stated that I wante da monitor that would deplay the heart rate and the time on the same screen.

I have been a fan for 22 years and I noticed that some fan didnt appreciate the album...your loss."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Seventies Not Quite As Good As You Remember It","review":"This album had a lot of potential. The songs were chosen from among those that might have been played beside Manilow's hits in summer of 78 (when he was at his commercial peak).But although Manilow's in fine voice, he is done in by the stringy, synthesized goop production of Michael Omartian, himself a producer of some of the 70s schlockiest hits (everything from \\"Rock Me Gently,\\" to \\"Theme From SWAT\\" to Christopher Cross). Manilow's version of \\"I Go Crazy,\\" is especially maddening; Paul Davis' hit version (a hit in 1978) sounded similar to Manilow's hits of the period."},{"rating":"1","title":"ONE OF BARRY'S WORST RECORDINGS-DON'T BOTHER","review":"I DON'T KNOW WHY BARRY EVEN BOTHERED TO MAKE THIS RECORDING. HIS RENDITIONS OF THESE HIT SONGS FROM THE 70'S ARE TERRIBLE AND HIS SINGING VOICE DOES NOT SOUND UP TO PAR. I HAD ORDERED IT THROUGH A MUSIC CLUB AND MADE THEM GIVE ME A REFUND! ALSO, WHERE DID THE TITLE COME FROM? NOT ALL OF THESE SONGS WERE ACTUALLY RELEASED IN 1978!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing album - dull, boring, and embarrasing.","review":"I am usually a fan of Barry Manilow for over 20 years but this album is another one of his embarrasing CDs to date. His renditions do not add anything new to the original songs from the 70's. Hearing his versions of these songs make me want to hear the original artists' interpretations. Barry Manilow seem to have lost his touch of magic that was present in his albums 20 years ago. Today, he is satisfied to rehash old hits and unwilling to challenge his fans with new innovative music. Summer of '78 should never have been made."},{"rating":"2","title":"Remembering When...","review":"Those of us who are now middle-aged or fast approaching that wonderful time in our lives often remember our \\"first loves\\" during our teen years. \\"Summer of '78\\" provides a very nice walk down memory lane, especially for Manilow fans who danced, cuddled and experienced the coming of age with memorable, emotional songs playing in the background. This album should be appreciated for what it must of been intended to be; according to Barry, \\"they deserve a second listen\\". This album is a collection of songs that should serve to remind us of some of the best, really nice songs played by real musicians, sung by artists with a passion for making us feel good. Barry, thanks for the memories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, but...","review":"Even us Mani-Loonies must have to admit that this one is a dissappointment! What was he thinking? I have so much stuff that is heart-and-soul Barry, stuff you know he created with his foot on the gas pedal. He really let up on it on this one. He could have really taken those songs and made them his own, but it was like he couldn't quite take the reins so it all came out sorta...ordinary. Ouch. You have no idea how much it hurts me to say that! (much more than this review will ever hurt Barry!) I listened so hopefully to each track, waiting to latch on to just one I could love! (when it comes to Barry, you know I'm easy) Oh, well. One out of 14 ain't bad.Barry, call me if you'd like to defend yourself.

But this is a big no."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delicious!","review":"I first tried this product when I saw a brief review of commercial nutrition bars in Newsweek or TIME. The reviewer listed powerbars as the best, re taste and other factors.Pria powerbars are crispy and delicious -- especially good if you want to avoid those soggy or rock-like soy-based nutrition bars.I took five boxes on a one-month trip to China, thinking that it was probably overpacking. All were gone -- given away to fellow tour members -- or eaten -- by me -- by week 3. Now I routinely pack them for trips.Vanilla's my personal favorite, but Chocolate and Mint are good, too. Personally, I dislike all peanut butter tasting things (except peanut butter itself); but if you like that flavor, I'd guess those pria powerbars are good as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Levitin again...","review":"Levitin is a good writer and his books are great to read.

The battery has a very short life but I can hit all of the corners before it is finished. Does not pick up cat litter well at all. Fur fills the small cup quickly. The cup is easy to clean, but you do have to touch fuzzy contents. The toggle type power switch is distant, awkward and snaps into the \\"On\\" and \\"Off\\" position -- if you have small hands it may take both of them just to turn it on and/or off. The attached crevice tool is a nice feature. We have had several Handheld Vacs and know their many limitations, this one does do the job i purchased it for. I gave it 2 stars because of it's very light duty, weak suction, short battery life, and awkward design."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I'm afraid this vacuum was not powerful enough for my simple needs. It could not pick up any pet fur, nor could it remove cat litter or much of anything else from carpet.

I own the red 1 and it needs to be recharged WAY TOO OFTEN. You can't use it more than four times without having to fully re-charge it again. Once it gets weak, it won't suck small objects out of a semi-tight corner (like the crevasse between the rug and wall). Don't waste your money on Eureka products.

Peter Lorre is the only person speaking with a non english accent, and makes a somewhat absurd Raskolnikoff. Many details from the book are eliminated.

I've listened to it at least a hundred times and have never grown bored of it!! It's a beautiful musical journey - from the beat-driven to the ethereal. It's been a soundtrack to a large portion of my life; it fits in about EVERY situation. It's inspired me in my Architecture studio, motivated and relaxed me at home; it's warmed me up to go out on party weekends and brought me back to earth afterwards. I have yet to find anyone who hasn't enjoyed it; friends who know request it often.Do me a favor - once you've listened to it, write to Arista and ask them to bring Showbiz & Hood back together for another!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"ABSOLUTE, UTTER, SHEER PERFECTION!","review":"The things that amazes me the most is the speed with which these people play their instruments and, still, maintain flawlessness!

Here it is!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Never beaten","review":"I have listened to this album on average three times a week for the past few years. There's a flow and a rhythm that no words can describe. There are no albums like it - enigma feels too spacy and with no real path. Some Air and Mellow tracks come close to grasping the feeling, but they both lack continuity. This album will never cease to amaze me, nor will you regret buying it. Although, part of me selfishly wants people not to buy it - the album is so intensely personal that I want it to be mine and only mine. But still - buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"strong second set","review":"This doesn't have the \\"name\\" guest artists or hit tracks that were on the debut Moodswings album, but this is nevetheless a very enjoyable album.

Combining anthems like \\"The Winner Takes it all\\" and \\"the last time\\" with ballads like \\"The Queen of Hearts\\" and upbeat pop like \\"I won't let you go\\" this album is a fantastic showcase of Agnetha's different singing styles.

I love nearly every song. Agnetha had a lot of succes in Europe with her solo stuff and rightfully so. Hits like 'The heat is on' and 'Wrap your arms around me' are still great and stood the test of time. I feel this collection proves that Agnetha was as good on her own as with ABBA, something that cannot be said about Frida, Benny and Bjorn. Buy it and you will love it too!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"turgid","review":"As much as I love ABBA it's always been pretty obvious that Agnetha and Frida - the singers - have been pretty clueless when it comes to their own material (the honourable exception being Frida's marvellous return album, 1996's \\"Djupa Andetag\\"). \\"That's Me\\" only goes to show Agnetha is completely lost without Benny and Bjorn, as this 'best of' interminably demonstrates. Tacky, disposable, bland 80s pop is the order of the day here, and we'd all be no worse off without it. No wonder she hasn't bothered singing in more than 10 years."},{"rating":"1","title":"I like Agnetha but....","review":"I agree that this album has that awful 1980's synthesizer sound to it. There is too much of the background sound and not enough of Agnetha's incredible voice. The only solo song of hers I really liked on here was \\"Wrap Your Arm Around Me\\". I agree with the person who suggested an \\"Agnetha Unplugged\\" album. I hope her album that is supposed to be coming out focuses more on her voice. I recommend this collection for die-hard fans only."},{"rating":"2","title":"Agnetha Faltskog - That's Me: Greatest Hits","review":"Agnetha Faltskog - That's Me: Greatest Hits being a compilation that was released 1998 and contains both solo materials as well as three tracks from her time with ABBA. we get great tracks such as \\"Can't Shake Loose\\" and \\"The Winner Takes It All\\". We also get many nice photographs of Agneta F?ltskog and linernotes written by Carl Magnus Palm. The sound of the album is classic europop at its best. 4/5."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still great after ABBA","review":"I admit that I was skeptical but after listening to the preview tracks, I was willing to give it a listen. It was a bit of a let-down at first, I think because I was still expecting the ABBA sound. But after listening to it a few times, it really started growing on me and I listen to it every day in the car. I especially love \\"I Won't Let You Go\\", which is one of her own songs. There are only a few songs on the album that I usually skip thru, but on the whole, I am so glad I bought it.

All in all, if you want entertainment better than Beethoven's 3rd, eating unsalted cashews until vomiting ensues is a great alternative."},{"rating":"1","title":"Roll over Beethoven","review":"Straight to video nonsense with Beethoven returning once again with a new batch of cutesy puppies. Wondering why the original cast are missing? Simple- the new family are their relatives and have been so kind as to take care of Beethoven.The only recognisable actor in the film is Judge Reinhold who plays the father in the family. Beethoven's 3rd is basically a film which trys to act as an improvement and replacement on the original Beethoven movie. In the end though, it just proves to be completely unnecessary and ridiculous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strictly a family movie, but not fun to watch","review":"I haven't watched the original Beethoven or its immediate sequel. This third installment is a big letdown. OK, maybe it's because I'm a grown-up. Kids did like it. But I found the acting amusingly terrible, esp. the phony performance put up by the wife. The kids are not even likable. The Penny girl is kinda pretty but not particularly convincing. The two villains are the bright spots besides the dog (or the three dogs that play Beethoven), but after about 60 minutes, nothing in this movie has any redeeming value left. I pretty much fast-forwarded the last 20 minutes of this 90-minute film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie","review":"This movie is so fun. It is a family movie.

Based on the positive reviews on this product, I gave it a try.It works well at removing the haze and restored my windshield to about 90% clarity (some minor haze remains but that is probably because I was applying by hand, not with a motorized buffer).The real problem is it also removed small amount of paint from nearby fairings. I was careful to not apply this on any other body parts but even a small amount of rubbing on nearby fairings removed some paint.If I have to say whether this is a buy or no buy, I would say it is definitely a buy.

The top shows the clear headlight after cleaning and use of polish and the bottom headlight is the other headlight before I did anything to it.I found an independent review online and the dude wet sanded up to 3,000 grit paper before polishing and he had great results. I didn't see any sandpaper that fine at my local auto store so I just went ahead and polished after some cleaning with Windex. After just a couple minutes of hand polishing and wiping clean with a cotton cloth, the headlight was very clear. It's difficult to see the real world improvement as I cannot do an A/B comparison at night, but it's nice to know that I'm getting near 100% effort out of my lights.Again, the picture speaks for itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works about 50%","review":"This product did work... Some. I have a 2005 vow jetta out in California and the headlamps were pretty bad and one needed replacement. There my reference is pretty accurate.

The result was very good, and 3 months out it continues to look very good. I do not reccomend Plastx, unless your headlights are mildly fogged. The BG is far better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"Like others have said, this product is not for heavy duty jobs. But for normal hazing over time, it gets the job done. My 2001 Accord became yellowish and hazy over the years and I was thinking about buying one of them complete restoration systems, but decided to try this first. I'm glad I did.Cleaning both head lights on my Accord took approximately 35 minutes by hand. All I used was some paint tape, and some lint-free rags,(microfiber). Best $5 I ever spent, and I barely used 1/8 of the bottle. I'm sure those complete restoration systems will do a better job, but with it needing to grind down the top layer and stuff just leads to more user error. With this, you really can't mess up. Only drawback is that the results might not be as good.

I tried it on 4 separate cars ( ages of 16 years old, 11 years old , 8 years old and a 1-year old), that are both garaged and left outdoors in the mild, wet winters and the smoking hot, humid summers of Southeast Texas. The headlights were washed and dried before the PlastX cleaner was applied. The three oldest cars were tested first. From oxidized and foggy to perfectly clear? No, so not worth any stars. Any positive improvement? maybe 1/2 a star. This product did not help the aging oxidized headlights as previous reviews have suggested. The last headlights tested were on a 2009 honda van. They weren't damaged or faded, so there wasn't anything to notice except that it does work as a polish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Used on an oxidizing headlight...","review":"I used this product a few times on one of my headlights that was starting to oxidize and it covered up the problem, but within a few washes and a few more applications, it actually made the oxidation worse. Maybe I used it incorrectly, I'm not really sure, but I haven't used it since. That headlight was eventually restored by a professional and then replaced as it got damaged in an accident. I do like Meguiars products, just not this one. My other headlight is starting to look a little shabby and I decided to use Ultimate Compound by Meguiars and it has done a much better job. I also used it on my girlfriend's and dad's headlights and the Ultimate Compound really cleared away the oxidation.

Well turns out it works pretty good. It does not restore to of the lot shine or luster but it does most of its job. I used it on a corolla and the headlights looked very good but I was not able to remove scratches to the headlight. I also used it on a dodge neon, who's headlights were just this ungodly yellow hue that you couldn't tell if there was a light source inside. Well it did the job on these lights too! I was pretty happy with how the neon's headlights came out because they have been murky for years and at night and during rainy days this makes the headlights look clearer! You gotta rub hard to remove the oxidation but it should not take you more than 15 minutes for one car.

I usually rinse the headlight, put few drops and polish at slow speeds side to side. I only did it once and the headlight looks clear as a day. Granted, I can probably make it even more clear if I took the time and probably better to finish it off with plastic protector.This would be great for motorcycle visors and anything plastic really.

I don't think so. So it becomes re-written history in a way (altered historical film footage). It is too bad that today's people can't simply learn from the original black & white footage.

The narration by Kenneth Branagh is perfectly paced and not overpowering. Though the computerized coloring does add some flavor to the series, it would be worth the cost even if in the original black and white. If you are looking for the bright colors of today's films you will be disappointed. The colors are muted and dull, but still there. Since the amount of film available from WWI is limited, some of the film footage was used multiple times, but the way it was integrated into the history kept the flow perfectly. Though my main interest is in WW II, I wanted something in my collection to help clarify the beginnings of that war. This series did just that.

Brilliant!"},{"rating":"2","title":"World War 1 in Color","review":"This is the greatest documentary so far I have ever watched and the story telling part is especially interesting. It sheds tremendous lights on how things started to happen and how it ends.On top of the contents of the DVD, the \\"colouring\\" of those motion pictures gave a more realistic feel of the war, setting audiences with a virtual environment where war is really happening around them.It is amazing that WWI survivors were also being (and able to be) contacted and interviewed to add more spice to the documentary.Though, some scenes were actually being used repeatedly throughout the film and it is a little boring and seemed BBC has limited footage in this subject area.All in all, it's a great documentary and it is especially useful to be a medium in instilling interests in youngsters to get more involved in history and fact-findings of the past."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where are the Children ( VHS )","review":"The movie was great,in some part's of the movie and at the end of the movie there was alot of the part's of the movie you could not see, the tape was damage in some part's.You could not see it or make out what it was.If there had been a part here and there,then I would haved rate this alittle better.I know that my kid's watch VSH movie's all the time.They have over 300 VSH tape's, and these tape's are old.

Domingo is charming as always and the aging of his voice on this disk is very distinct, although in no way unpleasant. Brightman's performance is very credible and the audio production values, which were very poor on my copy, seemed to favor her more than any of the others. Lotti, so often versatile and acrobatic in his approach on other disks seems flat and clouded here. Cocciante is an annoying presence on this disk and his voice does not blend well at all with the other three...a marketing risk that did not pay off.

It sounds in exciting but I don't think it was the greatest. The author should make the story happen quicker and she should have less characters so they'res less to concentrate on. Also think that the author should have more then one problem then of them being stuck in a snow cave."},{"rating":"2","title":"At last","review":"this movie is on DVD. It's great in all ways--Sami Frye and Klaus Kinski as agents for opposite causes, and Diane Keaton in full '80s kit of permed hair and BIG shoulders. Excellent plot, of course, from John Le Carre. Not a feminist film, however--the woman is a weak link. Worth watching in spite of that."},{"rating":"1","title":"just read the book!!","review":"the little drummer girl was a great novel, but don't bother with the movie. the story is so complex that the movie has to oversimplify it to the point of being completely implausible. i don't think that diane keaton was the best choice for charlie, the actress, as she seemed too old and the clothes she wore (especially the shoulder pads!!) just made her seem too uptight, whereas the book made her seem more free-spirited. i guess the whole movie was just tainted by the 80s, which put a definite time frame on a story concerning issues that are not specific to that time. another problem with keaton was that charlie was supposed to be english. her actual acting in the movie was not bad, but the whole idea of an american star in the english theatre was strange. overall, unless you want a watered-down, mullet-crazy 2 hours, put in a little more time and read the book. it's worth it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"YIKES","review":"I was surprised at how dopey this movie was -- I mean, right from the beginning. But then, it wasn't made yesterday -- it was made 20 years ago. I guess nowadays we demand a far more detailed setting for a flick involving Middle East intrigue. It felt so much like a standard issue TV episode from the early 80s that I kept expecting to see a commercial break. I swear I've seen episodes of Gilligan's Island that outperform this film in terms of suspense and plot development."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's one of my favorites!","review":"I think this is a great movie! Dianne Keaton and Yorgo Voyagis are outstanding! Also watch for David Suchet (Hercule Poirot)! The young actress (Keaton) is recruited for a dangerous secret mission. It is very realistic and exciting. I recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Little Drummer Girl","review":"I really love this movie, although I have to admit I didn't catch the entire plot until I turned on closed captioning on my TV. A lot of the words are just too garbled to understand. My one big complaint about the movie itself is the casting of Diane Keaton. This isn't a criticism of her looks since I think she's very attractive, however for the role she was playing they needed someone who was very pretty in order to be convincing. She does do a magnificent job of acting the part.This movie is one the most romantic I have ever seen. Although there are only a few romantic areas in it, they are enough to carry the whole thing and make your your knees go weak. I became an instant Yorgo Voyagis fan after seeing this.The plot is excellent and carries you through to the end. I recommend this movie very much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Diane Keaton at her best!","review":"Superb acting and action! A must see for history and espionage buffs.

Then this book is for you. Elaboration on symbolization, on context and connotation, on three parts on understanding - verifiability/inferences/judgments... etc. Unfortunately, those segmentation is merely for easy to analyze language and not grip language itself. Besides, take every arguments by granted, rather than convincing examples or comparsion. Pop books, like Steven Pinker's books.Recommedation:1. The new rhetoric by Perelman2.

The characters are well-drawn, believable, and deal with difficult situations. This one is a page-turner; the reader won't want to put it down until this entire story is unfolded.

I have read almost all of his books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite unlike \\"Chocolate Factory\\"","review":"I'm very surprised at the positive reviews. This confusingbook has almost none of the charm and grace of \\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\\". The characters are often surly and sour, the attempts at humor are often spiteful, there's a paranoid overtone to the whole sorry mess that left me very, very sad. Halfway through, my young son and I decided to put it down, which resulted in a pretty good conversation between us about how even talented writers can go far astray. I can't help thinking that Mr. Dahl was in a pretty dank personal space when he knocked this insipid sequel out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dahl was coasting when he wrote this","review":"The publishers must have demanded a sequel, so this is what Dahl came up with. Slow, repetitious, and not very imaginative.The glass elevator goes up-up-up. So what will come next? It will go down-down-down. The grandparents take pills in order to get very, very young. What will happen next? They take pills to get very, very old, of course. But not without alot of repetitive dialog to make the whole story last longer. Ugh.We both loved some of Dahl's other novels for their creativity and heart (for example, The BFG), but this one feels almost like it was written by someone else. Maybe kids will like reading this book to themselves, but reading it aloud to my daughter was a chore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator","review":"The book Charlie And the Great Glass Elevator is a great book.

What a cruel disappointment to read this book. By chapter three, we were all bored. And as a parent, I thought the characters were unusually mean as they spoke to each other. By chapter four, the \\"President\\" was racially stereotyping other cultures. As the parent of a Chinese child, I couldn't even bring myself to read aloud the Chinese Prime Minister's dialogue (for example: \\"Gleetings, honorable Mr. Plesident\\" and \\"Excuse pleese, Mr. Plesident. You make big mistake.\\"Needless to say, we didn't finish chapter four, and we won't be finishing the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"This book was very funny. And the kids too!

I enjoyed following the Bucket family (eventually EVERYONE gets aboard, even the bed), after Charlie wins the factory. Crazy things continue to happen. Analogies to real life, imaginative things, and bizarre things continue to be pictured before your eyes.Books like this are fun to read aloud to your children or to any kid.I docked the book one point only because the beginning is a bit slow and because it's not quite as fun as the chocolate factory."},{"rating":"2","title":"Re-make still the same!","review":"Charlie and the gretat glass elevator is a continue of charlie and the chocolate factory.

There are adventures in space, a fight with an alien species, and many other senseless adventures which may work well in another children's story (or stories, since many of them do not work well in the same story). There is no central, cohesive plotline. There are no lessons or morals. The most glaringly absent item from this book is the sweetness and charm of its predecessor.I'll not read this again nor will I recommend it to anyone of any age."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is awesome!","review":"Actually, in comparison with the first book (Charlie and the chocolate factory) this book is definitely not as good. I did however read it in 2 days because I wanted it to be done in a matter of time for school, and, I couldn't put it down. This book does not have as much adventure because it's in space and then taking wonka vites and Vite Wonkas and so on and so forth. This book did keep your attention and of course, was written by roald dahl which makes it superior."},{"rating":"2","title":"A treat for lovers of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory","review":"This book lacks some of the focus and the sheer joy of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, but it is a delight nonetheless -- Charlie, Mr. Wonka and Charlie's family take the Great Glass Elevator around for some wild adventures.It's a sequel, folks.

Dahl does a decent job, so I give him 4 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't read this book!!","review":"Much unlike the wonderful first book,Charlie and the chocolate factory, this book was horribly boring, and I had trouble not falling asleep while reading it.This book is definitely not one you'd want to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing, slow and racist...","review":"After reading Charlie and the Chocolate Factory to my 5 and 7 year olds, I got down my childhood copy of Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator. It made for a terrible read aloud! The plot was slow, the dialogue boring and I had to edit out some racist parts about China and the Chinese. We all decided to abandon the read aloud after Chapter 5. Very disappointing! I was actually surprised to still find the book in print!"},{"rating":"1","title":"PUTS ALL LITERATURE TO SHAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This book was the stupidest book that I have ever read,it had no imagination,it was totally confusing,and the plot kept on shifting. It made me wonder if Roald Dahl was sober when he had written this book. It sure doesn't seem that way. the point where the book totally lost me and convinced me that it wasn't even worth a 1 was the chapters in which we see what is going on in the white house! this book was totally stupid,and should never have even been published. it is a complete waste of time,and does not even hold up to the mavelous companion,published before it! mr. dahl: what were you thinking?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator is an excellent book","review":"Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator is an excellent.I give this book five stars because it is a creative book.

We have read and reread nearly all of Roald Dahl's children,s stories. In general, I love this author. His stories are entertaining, even magical, and so beautifully written. When reading Dahl, I am always aware that my children are exposed to high quality literature with a richness of vocabulary and ideas. Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator is the only exception to our general delight with Roald Dahl. It is dark and lacks the sense of optimism, the charm, the magic of his other stories. Neither of my children enjoyed this book and I did not either. My advice would be to stop after Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and not pick up this sequel. Instead, grab Matilda, the BFG, or James and the Giant Peach and treat yourself and your kids to a real treasure!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is an exciting gleeful story for children and adults","review":"I read this twenty years ago, and about all I remembered was that I loved the Vermicious Knids (\\"Scram!\\"). When I picked it up again a year ago, I realized that as a child, I missed the glorious absurdity, the joyful gibberish, and the over-the-top satire of U.S. politics (the Vice-President is the President's former nanny, and she basically babysits him and won't let him have too much candy, and his cat Mrs. Taubsypuss is a more important character than just about anyone else in the cabinet). Dahl writes this fast-paced little story with an irresistible mischievous glee, and his excitement is infectious. The story itself is not that weighty (basically, the family and Mr. Wonka go into space, have a quick adventure, come back, have a quick adventure, then it's over), but the style and enthusiasm are the real selling points. I heartily recommend this book to both children and grown-ups."},{"rating":"2","title":"by Sara C. Hildren","review":"This is an amazing book that follows Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.

Consider it the story of Wi-Fi, as it has lived and breathed to date. I dare say that this \\"history of Wi-Fi\\" would give excellent service in business schools as a study of how successful electronic technologies actually survive many subtle interdisciplinary trials.

I had to use it with my very old iron instead, which I was planning on throwing out....Overall very disappointed.

Ace of Base lacks creativity past a catchy tune. I've heard the phrase \\"it's a beautiful life..\\" 800 times...and I stopped the song before the end! The two stars I so generously awarded this CD comes from the two songs \\"Lucky Love\\" because of the acoustic stylings (very different fromt their \\"let the computer do it\\" attitude) and \\"Angel Eyes\\". The rest of the album violates music. They'll never top The Sign. Keep trying! Maybe you'll squeeze a hit out of your next album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent follow-up","review":"This CD was really worth the wait. I was impressed with The Sign, but more so when I discovered that The Bridge displayed a lot more talent and range. Ace of Base isn't just a dance-mix group, but can handle acoustics and ballads beautifully as well. The vocals seem much improved, too, over their first CD and many of the songs feature engrossing harmonies.Particularly noteworthy is the acoustic \\"Lucky Love\\", which didn't get the airplay it deserved as a radio release (especially in light of how terrible the top 40 hits generally were in 1996). \\"Angel Eyes\\" is a wonderful song with brief hints of Enya influence, and the rest come in a wide range that should please anyone who enjoyed the first album.Although I was a tad disappointed that there weren't too many songs that reminded me of The Sign (the CD, not the single), it's just as nice to see Ace of Base performing more than just one type of song here. If you liked the first one, don't pass this one up."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW","review":"This is literally the only album that I like every song. I don't usually like more than a few songs from most albums, but Ace of Base really blew me away! It doesn't have a consistant dance style through the entire album like the first, which I think is a plus because it give a much wider variety, and a much better chance of liking it. If you do want some dance beats, I'd suggest \\"Beautiful Life\\", \\"Strange Ways\\", \\"My D��ja V��\\", and \\"Never Gonna Say I'm Sorry\\". Also done with perfection are their ballads such as \\"Edge of Heaven\\" (my favorite ballad), \\"Ravine\\", \\"Angel Eyes\\". For some hot music, provided by Linn mostly, try \\"Whispers in Blindness\\", \\"Just N Image\\"; And for some classic unlabelable Ace of Base style, \\"Perfect World\\", \\"Blooming 18\\", and \\"Lucky Love\\", which was mixed into a great version giving it a different feel to it. All in all, Brilliant CD! By far their best"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Album","review":"This song is great!! I'd have to say it is my favorite of all of their albums.. The songs are a little less radio bound however. There are a couple that made it but this album shouldn't be judged by that. It's just good.."},{"rating":"1","title":"i hated this album from the minute that I heard it","review":"By the time I bought this album, I had already worn out my \\"The Sign\\" cassette. I expected this album to be just as good or even better than the first one. I was soo wrong! The songs on \\"The Bridge\\" did not have the consistent dance beat that \\"The Sign\\" had. :-( The only really good song on this album is \\"Its a beautiful life\\". My problem with this album is that most of the music sounds repetitive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incorrect information about this CD.","review":"This cd I received was supposed to be a Japanese Remaster that came out in 2010. I received one from Germany that came out in 1995. The cd is five stars but the information I used to purchase the product was faulty. It is misleading. I expected a Japanese 2010 cd. It will make me hesitant to buy any other special cd's if I am not going to receive the one I think I am buying. How do I know if they even look at the different ones available. They could just send the oldest one they have in their inventory."},{"rating":"1","title":"I loved this album even though I am a not a Ace of Base fan (4 Stars)","review":"I was in college around 1995, gosh it was way back, I never really listened to Ace of Base, I did like the song \\"The Sign\\", \\"Wheel of Fortune\\" they were big hits in South Africa. I was always into music so my friend gave me a recorded cassette of this album. mmmmm Ace of Base I thought, I put it on, used it as my cleaning the room cassette. The songs grew onto me, especially the non - hits, it was deeper than I expected, more professional, \\"Angel Eyes\\", \\"Ravine\\" beautiful ballads, \\"Strange Ways\\", \\"Never gonna say I'm Sorry\\", \\"Whispers in Blindness\\" all great tracks. I wore the tape out, had to eventually buy the CD. Although I do not have any other Ace of Base CD, I actually loved this CD. It really is a mature sound for Ace of Base even if it is not their best commercial success. I give it 4 Stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best albums of all times.!","review":"Fantastic album, 'Is a beautiful life' was a smash hit of dance music, Ace of Base have that unique ritm and voices, I have this album and I could never part without it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Good!","review":"I loved this C.D. it isn't my favorite, I only could listen to half of it because I was at a friend's house...

Paul Adam proves himself a worthy successor to Dick Francis and Tony Hillerman in creating Gianni Castiglione, a luthier, (violin maker) of Cremona, the Italian city where Stradivari, Guarneri and Amati once plied their trade.When Gianni's best friend, another luthier name Rainaldi, is murdered he feels honor-bound to track down the killer. In the process of following Castiglione about as he unravels the mystery, the reader learns a great deal about the history of violins, the craft of making them, and the unsavory business of counterfeiting valuable ones. Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Rainaldi Quartet","review":"Fast moving, a bit quirky mystery centered in the town of Cremona, Italy. The focus is on violin making and the mysteries of collecting rare violins as told by a violin maker. Combined with a murder, the detective and violin maker duo,provide insightful and unusual insights in life in Italy both rural and urban. Excellent read particularly before a trip to Venice and Italy."},{"rating":"2","title":"golf resort tycoon 2","review":"a fun easy paced game in which you have a lot of control over everything,plus you also get to play golf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does Not Work on Mac","review":"Very disappointed in this vendor.

As a Broadway musical? Faust was something you read in college lit classes, usually under protest. The combination of artists is incredible, and the idea of Taylor as Gd is hilarious! This CD is a great listen, and has several songs that should be listened to over and over, including 'Bless The Children of the World' and 'Feels Like Home'. The entire concept may not fly as a Broadway show, but as a concept CD it is wonderfully done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Music That Stays Good Over The Years","review":"My taste in music runs from operatic arias to The Beatles. As I pare down the selections every now and then to those that I can listen to over and over again, Randy Newman's \\"Faust\\" always makes the cut. I just love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the greatest albums ever made","review":"This is a quite astonishing piece of work. I didn't at first like the sound of it - a concept album? - a rock opera? - lots of guest stars? But I'm a great admirer of Randy Newman's (especially his last two albums, Trouble in Paradise and Land of Dreams) so I bought it anyway. It took me a few listens to acclimatise, and then it took me by storm. Brilliantly funny, savagely intelligent, deeply emotional, this is the work of a very great artist at the height of his powers. I think it marks a new high water mark of what rock music is capable of achieving."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most modern old story there is.","review":"Randy Newman is the devil in this drama with as much intellectual integrity as John Milton managed to give Satan in the poem \\"Paradise Lost.\\" The big problems in the philosophy of religion are set to music. There are some minor characters that cluttered up the mental landscape, and the ambitions of the Faust in this version of the drama are more modern than most religious thinkers would care to admit. I liked the song, \\"Feels Like Home To Me\\" because it was such a contrast to the setting in which we find it, but the other songs, even the most bitter, have their glorious honesty in their favor. People who think that philosophy is usually about like talk soup ought to listen to this album and see if it makes their comprehension of what motivates or despises angst a little bit clearer."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great Newman album with some crappy tunes thrown in","review":"OK, in theory, this should be one of my favorite albums. Randy Newman writing songs for the Faust Legend. These songs are sung by Randy himself, James Taylor, Bonnie Raitt, Linda Ronstadt, Don Henley and Elton John. What's not to like?Well, of the seventeen songs, about thirteen of them classic Newman. For some reason however, they've thrown in a couple of songs that don't work at all. For instance, \\"I'm the Man\\" is an integral part of the Faust story but the song is almost difficult to listen to.If you don't mind regularly skipping a few of the songs on this album, however, this album is one of Randy's better and more inspired offerings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb, Outstanding and Delightful!!","review":"The other reviews have given you the specs -- the fact is that this is by far THE premier musical soundtrack of all time -- you have to go all the way back to The Music Man to find another stage production with the wit, tunes, and singing cast that comes close to this quality. 'Feels Like Home' has even been excerpted on two sound tracks for two other movies and Linda Ronstadt covers it on her Home CD (but Bonnie Raitt's version is miles better). All fresh Newman tunes (though he could have thrown in a few oldies like Lonely at the Top for good measure). These songs make Andrew Lloyd Weber seem like an unimaginitive musical hack -- you will listen to this one again and again and again and never get tired of it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very moving of the Pacific War","review":"This is a very powerful dvd and the interviews of the veterans that foughtagainst each other. It is well done and is five stars. It is painful forboth the Japanese and American vets that were there and their rememberingthat war is hell. Thank you Steven Spelberg and Stephn E. Ambrose for thisoutstanding account of American history."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT!","review":"Brooks & Dunn never cease to amaze me. I own several of their albums and \\"Borderline\\" is one of their best. My favorite songs on the album are Why Would I Say Goodbye and My Love Will Follow You. Other good ones include A Man This Lonely, Mama Don't Get Dressed Up For Nothing, I Am That Man, and More Than A Margarita. The only song on the album that I didn't like was White Line Casanova, which I feel should've been left off of the album. However, it's easy to overlook one bad song when there are ten other songs on the CD that are top quality. Purchase this album today! You won't be disappointed. This is Brooks & Dunn at their best!"},{"rating":"1","title":"aptly named album","review":"Boy, they sure picked an appropriate name for this one--it's \\"borderline\\" in quality. Too bad! Sounds like they cranked it out in a big hurry. The great songwriting of their past just ain't here. Trite arrangements (same old Nashville studio players everybody else uses). ZZZZZZZ."},{"rating":"1","title":"As a whole, very poor","review":"I love Brooks and Dunn, but they have certainly had some mis-steps in their some 13 years of recording. This is by far their biggest. After putting out three hard rock/country masterpieces, they had the nerve to release something whose only platform to be considered a record is several mediocre, overplayed singles and the C.D. on which it is recorded. Don't support bad albums; anyone with any sense of what music is will not buy this piece of garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self-stick adhesive DOES NOT stick!","review":"Did not buy this product through amazon.com, instead bought it from a local retailer.

They have an o-ring for water protection but the o-ring wears out and crumbles after verly little time in the outdoors. As for the ICP panel I bought it for, it cracked withing 2 years of installation. ICP did not honor its 5 year warranty, saying it cracked due to getting flexed. It was mounted on a 3/4 inch board so there was no flex. ICP was not helpful. There are other panels on Amazon that I am now using that are half the cost, perform well, have better universal connectors, and above all, last."},{"rating":"2","title":"Steeltown is a great CD!","review":"Steeltown is an excellent CD through and through, second only to The Crossing, in my opinion. That makes sense since it was the follow up to the debut album. I find that all of the songs on Steeltown rock and that I typically don't find myself skipping any as the CD plays. It's that good through and through. It has an edgy, ringing, chiming sound, all with a serious rocking pulse amplified by four guys at the peak of their game. Just listen to the drum thread on Flame of the West. Phenomenal. But all of the playing is incredible. Steeltown is well worth owning, even after all these years. (And check out their Steeltown tour live on YouTube: a great performance in NYC)."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD is Definitely \\"Strong Enough\\"","review":"Following on the heels of their highly successful self-titled debut album, Blackhawk comes back strong with \\"Strong Enough\\". Once again that great Blackhawk musical style shines through on \\"Big Guitar\\", which coincidentally contains some strong guitar, both acoustic and lead. The signature song from this cd is \\"I'm Not Strong Enough to Say no\\", a song about a man who \\"gets weak\\" whenever his favorite girl comes around.Blackhawk has been described as a \\"man's band\\", but I think everyone will like their music. There is a good mix of guitar, drums, fiddles, and keyboards to satisfy almost every musical taste. Their music is upbeat and fun to listen to. If you like good country music, make sure to give \\"Strong Enough\\" a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent CD","review":"The music was great.A CD you can listen to over and over.They have a very distict sound. They are awsome"},{"rating":"2","title":"What the heck I'll give it 5 stars","review":"I'm not the biggest of country fans but I love this CD. It's really good. I like to define Blackhawk as \\"A man's band\\". Just about every song is well-produced. My favorite is \\"Ain't No Yesterday\\". If you have the greatest hits and want to add to your collection I suggest picking up this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chandler's Last--And His Least","review":"The setting--a coastal town called Esmerelda--is well-evoked. The observations are clever and occasionally poignant. And the mystery surrounding Miss Betty Mayfield shows real promise. However, this time out the characters are familiar and too genteel, the revelations are unconvincing, and the whole thing feels tired, as if Chandler were simply going through the motions. A flat note on which to end a career."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Change in voices","review":"This was disappointing, with no Ed Bishop as Philip Marlowe.The original BBC collection was a wonderful series, and the latest versionswith Toby Stephens just doesn't seem to have the depth in sound and voices.I do remain an avid fan of the entire Raymond Chandler audio books, and love thecity background noises."},{"rating":"2","title":"only for big fans","review":"As the title suggests, the tracks on this album are renditions of previous songs played freely. If you're a new fan, I'd strongly recommend getting \\"Fumbling Towards Ecstasy\\" instead. It helps to hear the original before hearing these altered tunes. And if you have a CD-Rom, check out the multimedia presentation because it is very cool!"},{"rating":"2","title":"These versions are almost better","review":"I absolutely love Sarah's \\"Fumbling Towards Ecstasy\\" This CD with it's acoustic versions is almost as good. In some cases, I like the acoustic versions, such as \\"Ice\\" or \\"Hold On\\"; a song that is much more beautiful than on FTE. In other cases, such as \\"Elsewhere\\" I would readily stick to the FTE version. But it is nice to hear the songs a little differently, and for the most part, I enjoy this CD, and I'm not sure if I'll ever hear FTE the same again."},{"rating":"1","title":"For die hards only","review":"This one is for Sarah die hards only. Any of the songs worth hearing here can be found elsewhere (and in generally better versions) and the multimedia section is unlikely to be of much interest to those who do not worship the ground this woman walks on.For the casual fan, go with her best album, \\"Solace.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential companion to \\"Fumbling\\", but stands on it's own","review":"I've always been facinated by the creative process; the steps to how artists, musicians, writers, et al, go through to create their works. So admittedly my opinion is biased just based on that. However, this album stands on it's own nearly as well. \\"Elsewhere\\" has a great groove to it, the loose version of \\"Ice Cream\\" is actually superior to the \\"Fumbling...\\" version, and Tom Waits' \\"Ol' 55\\" is a refreshing improv, especally for someone known for their pristine studio production. And the CD-Rom program isn't bad either!It's an essential listen for fans of hers to see how the final work developed, but the casual fan will also enjoy it a great deal. In fact, I owned this before I owned \\"Fumbling...\\" (although I was very familiar with it). A nice little portrait of the artist at work."},{"rating":"2","title":"How it should have been done the first time...","review":"These looser versions of the songs of \\"Fumbling Towards Ecstacy\\" show the artist's true song-writing and performing talents... (as opposed to her later commercialized work.)This album reveals all of the songs stripped down to an acoustic guitar, a piano, and vocals - a beautiful revelation. The result is much jazzier, more raw versions of the song.My favorite track on this is \\"Elsewhere,\\" which has a really deep bass line and ... well, just rocks.This album is really how \\"Ecstacy\\" should have been released in the first place, without all the studio drama... but having them both to compare, just makes this one seem even better."},{"rating":"2","title":"No more fumbling.","review":"These demos from the 'Fumbling Towards Ecstasy' album have a beauty that outshines the slick prodution of the final release. Sublime."},{"rating":"1","title":"woozy and too impromptu","review":"Despite the inspiring album title, I dislike the music intensely. It sounds like a roomful of drunk and woozy people attempting to make some noise. Reminds me somewhat of Janis Joplin at a low point. This group is in dire need of artistry and editing. Definitely not for the music connoisseur."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"What happened here? WHat in the world was she thinking with this release?

Pointless garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"This might be Sarah's most valuable EP","review":"Even if you're not a Sarah McLachlan fan, The Freedom Sessions is a great opportunity to approach to this great Canadian musician. Most of the songs on this record are \\"alternative\\" versions of previous released tracks, but they are far from being just self covers. Almost all of them sound more intense and definitely improved from the originals (specially \\"Good Enough\\", \\"Elsewhere\\", \\"Ice\\" and \\"Ice Cream\\" ). This was almost the only album that I was missing from her, if you are a fan and it is not in your collection, GO AHEAD.

The acting is stiff, the action scenes and hits are what you would expect from a high school drama club, the dialog is pathetic. John Turturro is like Sammy Gravano played by Richie Cunningham. The Cliche's are thrown out at every turn. This was also disapointing because there were so many actors that I have enjoyed seeing perform in other movies of this genre.

This is a great book to open dialogue about the nature of religion, it's development, and evolution. If you are open to thinking outside of convention, Eliade will blow your mind. He makes the underlying connections between \\"what we do\\" and \\"why do we do it\\" obvious. For anyone who wants explore the ultimate \\"why\\" questions of life, this book is a great place to start. Eliade's ideas have constantly change the way I viewed religion and the world.

There's maybe one spot which the paint looks \\"worse\\" than the rest, around her hand, but it is a pretty small area and literally unnoticeable unless you pick her up and look really closely. Setup is easy, though the base was a bit tight putting on, not just the pegs being too large or small, one of her feet was turned a little bit too far to push down onto the peg, though overall I found that makes her MORE sturdy, not less. So no objections there.Package arrived in great condition; the box containing the figure didn't even have any noticible dings or dents from shipping. Ontop of that, the package arrived a day -before- the scheduled day(s) of arrival, so that's definitely a plus. Looking forward to future buisness with this company!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Family saga","review":"Evergreenis the story of a young woman who leaves Poland to begin a new life in America. Anna Friedman leaves Poland after the death of her parents and starts a new life working as a servant in the home of a wealthy family.

I am thoroughly enjoying the book, but I am disappointed in the editing of it. I am constantly running into various errors, e.g. the word \\"we'll\\" is spelled without an apostrophe every time it's used. There are phonetic words instead of the word that is intended. This won't keep me from reading the book, but it is an annoyance."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful","review":"Even though i read this book years ago i wanted to read it again as the sequel is coming out in Feb. I just loved every page of this book more so then when i first read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A definite favorite","review":"My Mom had recomended this book to me, at first I was a little betaken by the 700 pages but nearing the end I had wished it was longer then that. You go through the lives of these charecters and you feel like you are part of them. You feel their pain and their joy. I would love to someday see a movie out of this. The movie couldn't be quite as good, but more people will get to experience the beautiful story this way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry but this is just a boring biography","review":"This book is a biography of a woman who went to America to try to live well... and she did that, her story is simple, sometimes boring and the main part of the story is pathetic, why? Because when she was married she had and affair that she didn't want, you feel that she was almost rape and with that relationship she had a baby and you will feel sorry for her, but then she went again with the same man and continue her affair until her husband dies, when he dies she decide that she won't have another affair, why she does that? Because all she wanted was to deceive her husband and when he past away the affair doesn't mean nothing because she didn't deceive anybody?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Evergreen","review":"This is a review of the Kindle version. Great story but marred by consistent errors. The contraction we'll is always spelled well. He'll is hell. Bother or bothered is always brother or brothered. Very distracting. I finally gave up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing for Readers","review":"With all due respect for what the author endured, I have to be honest. The book has too much detail about mundane things, leaving the reader saying \\"Get to the point already!\\" In addition, Too much information is given in the book, yet little is learned about her memories. Peeling Back the Layers does not pick up speed until three quarters of the way into the book. The author did not even truly heal by the end of the book so reader is left wondering what the point of the story was. It is not very helpful for those who have suffered from repressed memories of abuse and may even confuse them. Sorry, but I have to be truthful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sticks have nothing to do with Bill Bruford","review":"I assumed these were the Bill Bruford Signature Sticks, not the case."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Warwolf by Hermann Lons, translator R. Kvinnesland","review":"Firtly I am not a kid but a 69 year old retiree. I found this book a well written, very readable and very well translated account of the life and times during Germany in the terrible years of the Thirty Years War. The reader gets a real \\"feel\\" for the way in which people lived and felt during those years, and the translator's expert knowledge of the history of the era gives rise to very interesting and informative footnotes. Highly recommended for those who like a good historical novel.Herb Parker Queensland Australia"},{"rating":"2","title":"A seldom seen view","review":"Colorfully and emotionally provides the usually ignored perspective of the noncombatant to the reality of war."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very enjoyable book, well written","review":"I finished this book the day I received it from Amazon. The descriptions are so good, you imagine you are part of the action. The notes provided give a good understanding of a very chaotic time. I enjoyed learning about the life of the German peasants, and how tough being a farmer was for the peasants. The setting is one of my favorite areas of Germany, the North German Heath, outside of Celle. The culture of the area, and explanations of many of the symbols seen there today, were a nice addition to the story line.Hundreds of years later the lessons are still relevant. In a war the innocent civilians suffer the most. Non-traditional fighting is the most effective. Religion both hurts and helps the people. Community and family make survival possible.I think you will enjoy the story, and enjoy the history."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing ...","review":"If you are looking for a book about this filly buy \\"Burning from the Start\\" not this one. The \\"Legend..\\" book contains nothing you did not know about her. It is a book about mere facts, nothing new or personal. If you are looking for a book that covers the whole story buy \\"Burning from ...\\". I would not buy it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Tribute to a CHAMP******","review":"I loved this book I thought it was great it is my favorite out of the Legends series so far.

If you're into crazy music, ranging from almost soul like sounds to pure rock, mingled with the best guitar solo's you've ever heard: buy this one! And the voice of Alex is as complex as you will ever hear: Scottish sounding English with broad American hints. A guess where he really came from.If you are thinking about Bowie, well ...almost. Zappa? Close. SAHB rules.It's a gas, folks, hey hey"},{"rating":"2","title":"VAMBO ROOLZ!!!","review":"If you ever needed a good starting point with the SAHB, this is it, live, no safety net or overdubs, just 5 colorful personalities weaving stories of superheroes, Tomohawk Kids and much more! Onstage this band delivered the goods!Musically, it rocks hard, guitarist Zal Cleminson's appropriately snarly guitar helps weave the tales (ya gotta love a lead guitarist that looks like the Caesar Romero Joker on Batman!), while tart keyboards and a thunderous rhythm section hold you spellbound. \\"The Faith Healer\\" is a great chilling, opening with its throbbing synth and Alex demanding t let him put his hands on you. \\"Vambo\\" just grabs you by the throat as Alex tells the story of a superhero that's a cross between Spiderman and Santa Claus. The cover of \\"Delilah\\" is great hilarious high-camp, while \\"Tomohawk Kid\\" brings on flashbacks to reading \\"Treasure Island\\".Tight ensemble playing and a spirit of unabashed fun make this disc a must have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy this and hear why all the 5 star ratings are posted.","review":"Man,everyone has already said all there is to say about this album,but my two cents here:essential! I bought it,now YOU should. It's a real, LIVE rock album from the 70's...no B.S. on this release. Alex Harvey truly was one in a million.Again,buy this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best live recordings","review":"One of the best live recordings, a must for any SAHB fans. They top it off with the classic Framed and include another all time classic Faith Healer"},{"rating":"2","title":"Alex Harvey was Alternative Rock Ahead of His Time!","review":"Vambo is one of my favorite songs from the seventies. Alex and company were great live and this album captures a little known artist at his best. If you like alternative Rock you should love this this guy and his band!! He was way ahead of his time which I think is why he was not so well known. His time has come too bad he is not here to create more his music!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Never got the download","review":"I followed the instructions to purchase this item but because I didn't know to setup the download site first, I never received the download and when I tried to get it to download after my setup was complete, all I could get was a message saying already downloaded."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of My Favorite Albums","review":"I recently ordered and received the Waiting To Exhale:Original Soundtrack from Amazon and it is perfect.

I totally recommend this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"FANTASTIC!!!!","review":"This cd gives a true musical rendition of the lives of 4 different Black women in similar situations in todays society. It shows the trials and tribulations and love that is shared between black men and women. Its good listening too! I think everyone can appreciate this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"A terrific collection of r&b","review":"It seems like I am the only one who has never seen this movie. Oh well, I really am not one for watching movies too often. But music is a different story. I heard some of the songs from the film and heard a lot of positive things about the album, so I bought it, and was not disappointed. It has some wonderful songs by some of the best female r&b and soul singers. Although I do think that the TLC song is a bit out of place with its subject matter. Not really the kind of thing you want children to listen to. But, that aside, every other song is wonderful, and most deserve 5 stars. In fact the whole album deserves a 5 star rating, if it wasn't for that one track. Too bad that they felt it necessary to include it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Waiting To Exhale","review":"This is a awesome soundtrack it is fun and enjoyable to listen to. the best songs on this soundtrack are all of them. if you have not listened to this soundtrack then i recommend you do"},{"rating":"2","title":"a must-have of the 90's","review":"your 90's collection of r&b music is incomplete without this compilation of r&b/soul singles from artists of that time like TLC, Toni Braxton, Mary J Blige, Brandy and musical legends like Whitney Houston, Chaka Khan, Aretha Franklin and Patti Labelle. It would have been even better if female artists like Janet Jackson, Monica, Aaliyah, Mariah Carey and En Vogue were featured too, but still a must have. Standout tracks are Exhale, Sittin Up In My Room, This Is How It Works, Not Gon' Cry, Count On Me"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful R&B Soundtrack","review":"This is a classic. Most of the performances are spectacular, although Babyface's signature sound it written all over each track. The best performances are from Aretha Franklin, who puts in a killa performance on \\"It Hurts Like Hell\\", Whitney & Ce Ce Winans on the touching \\"Count On Me\\" and Chaka Khan, who puts a whole new, much need spin on \\"My Funny Valentine\\". Khan's version sends shivers all through my body.The weakest performances come from TLC and Patti Labelle. TLC just seem out of place and Patti puts in a feeble performance on the forgettable \\"My Love, Sweet Love\\". Latoya Jackson could have been more exciting than Labelle's tired reading of this song.This CD is a must for any serious fan of R&B."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scratched CD","review":"Although this is a classic CD, my purchasing experience was diminished by the fact that I received the CD at the very end of the delivery period and upon playing the CD, discovered two of the tracks are scratched. The seller indicated the CD was in good condition when I purchased it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love It!","review":"As much as I luv the move I gotta say that the soundtrack is so good!

IT was a great album overall and full of slow soft & soothing beautiful ballads. Also other standouts aside from the hit singles are Let It Flow-Toni Braxton, Why Does It Hurt So Bad-Whitney, This Is How It Works-TLC, My Comic Valentine-Chaka Khan. This CD is good to relax to and just chill to cause it's so soothing and soulful and the movie was a huge success too."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great CD","review":"6 years after buying this CD - I still listen to it.The reason why I gave it only 4 stars is because they failed to include that great song by the Whispers \\"I'm Gonna Make You My Wife\\". That would have made the CD complete!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Christmas gift","review":"I got the ring and I really liked it. The diamonds are very pretty. They are exactly as the rating described. The only reservation I have is the shank of the ring looked much heavier than it is. The gold is thinner than I wanted. But the ring looks good up against my wedding band. I am happy with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Gorgeous Ring!!!!","review":"I received this ring as an anniversary present from my boyfriend and I absolutely love it!!! It really does have a ton of sparkle! After reading the reviews, I did expect it to be shiny, but it certainly exceeded my expectations! I would definitely recommend buying this ring to anyone! Not only will it make a wonderful anniversary present, but it would make a beautiful wedding band as well. The ring is slim, elegant, very comfortable and definitely looks expensive (would have never guessed it is worth only $216)!!! I've been to many jewelry stores and to be honest, I did not find a single diamond band I liked and they were all at least $600. This one is perfect! I cannot stop staring at it, especially at the right light, when I almost get blinded by the rainbow-colored sparkles! My friends are so jealous! :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"I like it until","review":"I got this beautiful ring for my wife as a gift. The edges are square as in the picture - not rounded. The two outer diamonds are only held by two prongs -not 4 like the others. Within three months of wearing it maybe once a week, one of the outer diamonds fell out. Now it is not so beautiful. I would have expected that from a cheaper ring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to judge the size with no reference point","review":"The ring looks fine online but was so surprisingly small once we received it. A point of reference shot would have helped avoid this problem. I suggest looking at at least .5 cttw, it is not much more and it looks so much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING.","review":"While your imagination may conjure up scary possibilities with the premise of this 'movie' it's sad to see that the video makers decided to shoot EVERY single step of the long hike these people take into the woods. When the action FINALLY does happen it plays like an episode from some generic TV show with nothing brutal or scary happening at all! Several opportunities for scares are passed up as if the makers weren't even aware there was an opportunity. There is virtually NO blood, no real tension, nothing whatsoever approaching suspense. Seriously folks, this waste of time is just about as boring and as tame as they come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific show","review":"This is one great show!! If you have missed it on HBO--you are truly missing out!! It is provacative, funny, clever, smart, & heartwarming all at the same time. If you don't have HBO, I recommend buying the DVDs or renting them!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An author worth watching for","review":"I'm only occasionally a mystery reader, but this is an author worth watching out for.

As I'm writing this, Amazon doesn't have it in stock but Amazon.ca does, so I'll buy it there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read","review":"I've read it more than once and enjoy it a lot.

What is the normal delivery time?"},{"rating":"1","title":"the long goodbye","review":"The book was somewhat interesting as a family drama set in the background of national history however Ifound it unsatisfying as a family struggling with the loss of a father to Alzheimer's.

Where's the mystery?It has a drawer that I wouldn't trust and four legs.It has overwrought aged detailing.It looks fine for the 20 bucks you spend."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY!!!","review":"First of all, I thought this table was absolutely cute!!! When my daughter received the package, she was so happy. THEN, we noticed the freakin' leg was previously damaged!!! Who sells a table with a damaged leg!!! It look like someone damaged it, then tried to fix it with carpenters glue and white paint. Table was a complete waste of money!!! I need to get a refund!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"When the table arrived it had 5 black marks on the top of it. These marks will not come off of it.

Good luck with quality, good luck with receiving it in decent condition, good luck trying to get your money back!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pay for what you get, $20","review":"This thing is a piece of junk. I got it for a small table in a walk-in closet for a place to put things. But I'm embarrassed to have this thing. The lower shelf is so thin it looks like cardboard, and the entire thing screams cheap particle board. Pay for what you get!! On the other hand, after I painted this thing black and put a new knob on it, it looks OK for a cheap table in the garage, so maybe its worth the $20. I wouldn't pay more than that for this if for some reason the cost goes up."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a beauty!!!","review":"This little side table is just a beauty for the price. It's small, yet functional, and is just perfect for my need. I thought that the drawer on the front was just faux decoration and probably none functional . . . but it actually IS a drawer. SO CUTE! Would recommend to anyone looking for a 'shabby chic' style side table. I saw the exact same table on another site for $79, so you can't beat the price on AMAZON."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice!","review":"This is perfect for a little girls room or nursery. Easy to put together. Comes with black scratches on top for a antique look that I wasn't really happy about but is still very cute."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasantly surprised","review":"I bought two of these tables for a bedroom in our small country-style cottage home. I put them together in about 5 minutes, and they are very pretty and surprisingly sturdy for the price. Perfect for the bedroom I put them in. The only downside was the \\"distressed\\" look was poorly executed, but I fixed that in minutes with some sandpaper! Excellent value."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT!","review":"I bought this side table as a night stand and am 100% please with it.. It took no longer than 3 minutes to set this up, and put beside my bed..It seems very sturdy, and matches my room perfectly! I am very happy with my purchase!I especially love the \\"no tools needed\\" aspect of the set-up! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Shabby Chic Side Table!","review":"I love this side table, I put it on my front porch that has white wicker furniture and colorful floral pillows.

Great customer service also. Would do business with them again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great side table, but needs re-paint.","review":"Very good price for this table. However, you are better to re-paint it. I also added some glue with it's assembling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wished I had ordered two","review":"I wished I had ordered two at this price but was afraid it would be to cheaply made. It works great in my guest bedroom with my white iron bed. I don't like the machine marks that were made to make it look distressed because they are to uniform. I love the table and would recommend it to others. Not a high end piece of furniture but a great addition to my guest room. The table just added the finishing touch to the room. The room would look better if I had a table on each side but oh well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yea. No. Not exactly as described....","review":"You can't beat the price, it's true. And it is a cute, little table that fits in a cute, little corner in my home.So why not a higher review?The description states:\\"Wood with distressed white finish\\".Okay. Their idea of \\"distressed white finish\\" apparently is to carve out large strips on the table top and then color them in with a black pen. I'm not exaggerating. This table would be perfect if they just didn't try to age it. It looks pretty stupid and, initially, I thought my table was actually damaged! I settled on covering the marks but just consider yourself warned. Look at the negative reviews carefully please...many/most of them are for users who believed their table arrived damaged, that is how poorly the \\"distressed white finish\\" is.Good luck, best wishes to you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Piece","review":"This is an awesome product!!! Even though I had to paint it to match my daughters furniture, I loved it as it originally came. Very Sturdy!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not to bad","review":"The tables were actually a little nicer looking than I thought they would be. They would look great for a cottage, beach, or french styled room. They were easy to put together but be careful with the legs. One of the metal pilot hole casings came right out of the wood when I was trying to screw one of the legs in. Nothing a little bit of gorilla glue couldn't fix. They are pretty cheep nightstands, so I didn't want to send them back. They seem sturdy enough though and they look nice in my spare bedroom.

Easy to assemble and should provide years of good side-chair service."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great size and details","review":"I have an all white office and needed a small table for modems and a printer. This is just the perfect size. I has all the \\"girly\\" features that make it perfect for me: turned legs, filagree work on the drawer, and a faux glass drawer pull. As others have said, it was a breeze to put together and the \\"antiquing\\" detail is kind of hokey (a few black lines drawn across the top and on the shelf). Overall, it is just a lovely table for a great price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute Litte Table for the Price","review":"As many other reviews have stated, the marks on the table top look like scratchings my 3-year-old made, rather than creating a vintage appearance. However, they are not that noticeable in general, and the cute little legs and drawer with the adorable pull make up for that.The table seems sturdy and was super duper easy to assemble. I was very thankful for that after assembling two adirondack chairs that I could not say the same about:)Many other reviews have stated that they will paint over the marks on the top; I don't think that is necessary, but it would be better if they were not there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT Buy","review":"This table is junk.

It is very cheaply made and not even worth this cheap of a price!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Weird chemical smell?","review":"I ordered 2 of these tables...and I have to leave the window open in my bedroom. I don't know it it is paint, or whatever...but both tables have this very strange toxic smell. I wiped both down with a damp sponge and still there. Probably made in China at some toxic chemical plant. They are OK tables...kinda cheap but good for a summer or vacation home. Did anyone else notice that stench? ugh."},{"rating":"2","title":"loved it","review":"The table is just what i was looking for. I bought two to use as bedside tables.

Lest see, the paint on the top was rubbed off in five spots the carving on the side was broken and half of it was missing and the spot where it used to be was cracked. Every leg was scratched to the wood at lest in two places. One leg looks like a 10 year old tried to repair it with wood putty. Buyer beware. I hope the seller can take care of me but not before Christmas Im sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING!!!!!!!!","review":"This item is beautiful!

Luckily my husband was able to fix both."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed!","review":"We purchased this table for our grandbaby's nursery. It was supposed to be a Christmas gift, but after seeing how terrible the top looks, I contacted the company to get a replacement. They replied that it is supposed to look like that. It has 5 black lines on the top & shelf, like it was stamped. Since we would have to pay over $18.00 to send it back, we plan to sand the top and paint it. It can't look worse!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great price, great product!","review":"I was concerned because this was so cheap, but it is perfect. The top is a little smaller than I expected, but it sits a candle, picture frame, and cup just fine. I use the bottom shelf for my alarm clock. The shelf is a really good size, but it falls out if you aren't too careful. Overall, I would recommend it. I know it sounds like I'm bashing it but I just want to give the most information I can."},{"rating":"2","title":"Carved White Side Table","review":"I am happy with this table.

These tables turned out to be the perfect solution and probably something I will actually use in my next house. I am extremely glad that I read other reviews though about the five black marks on the table top otherwise I would have thought that my item was damaged (as my husband did). I turned the bottom shelf over when putting the tables together so the only black marks you can see are on the top. These tables were EXTREMELY easy to put together (5 minutes each table)! Overall, the tables are sturdy and very cute if you can overlook the black stripes... Perfect product for me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I really do love this","review":".. but one of the legs are about to break in half and there is such a horrible smell. There are black marks that can easily be painted and the legs can be glued together so it won't break, but that's so much an effort.

And what's better than that is the Streets and San Man's tone: the guy is funny as hell. I drove to a few of the detours he provides and they were great. The Big Chief detour was hysterical.

This is a great trailer at the right price for sure! My 3 year old son loves to climb in and sit with his 1 year old brother. It rides well and attaches to my Specialized bike with no problems at all. I also liked the ease in putting it together. I needed no tools and the instructions were pretty clear and easy to understand. I would definitly reccomend this to anyone looking for a bike trailer who doesn't want to spend an arm and a leg."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Trailer","review":"Took about 5 minutes to set it up and attach it to my bike. My 3 1/2 year old daughter woudn't even wait for me to finish before she got in and latched the harness herself. She didn't get it exactly right, but it was easy to latch. Unlatching her took a quick second to do, but I am happy that she won't be able to unbuckle it herself.This is a high-quality product. There is no need to pay twice as much or more for other brands. I have other InStep products and have been happy with all of them. Could not be happier with this trailer. The outrigger (double siderail) frame makes this a clear choice for ruggedness and wheel protection (short of skirt fenders).Pulling this trailer is a breeze. My daughter reminds me at times of the princess and the pea and she has no comfort issues.I'll check back in a year and give you a 5K mile check-in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rocket Trailer","review":"We've had this for a month.

It does NOT work with my husband's mountain bike.It is hard to keep in a two car garage attached to my bike so I have to fold it up after every bike ride and stand it against the wall.Overall, I think it is very solid and we enjoy taking bike rides as a family with our 1 yr old!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The kids love it. Quick and Easy assembly and disassembly","review":"I can assemble it, and disassemble and fold it for storage in about 15 minutes. My 2 year old loves it. A couple of things which may or may not develop into a problem:1. The wheels seem to have little more than normal friction; they do not free spin for long. But still easy to pull or push.2. The fabric seems to have some tiny holes at the wrinkles straight out of the box. I haven't noticed any new tears develop, but we have only had it for about a month and have taken it out several times on short rides locally already and one out of town camping trip.Overall it has been a lot of fun, I attach it to my 6 year old's trailer bicycle which attaches to my mountain bike \\"bicycle\\". For additional safety I attach the stroller handle bar to it and to which I attach a flashing red light, as well as using the orange flag. And of course we all wear helmets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Trailer for my 3.5 year old","review":"We have been out with this trailer a few times now, and my little girl loves it! She does get a dusty face if the clear plastic cover isn't used, but overall she has a blast. Plus, it's not hard to pull at all. Haven't (and will probably never) used it as a stroller. Hopefully it holds up well with use - time will tell!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good buy","review":"I bought this trailer to practice my biking during the summer. It was easy to assemble and very light. The material is not as resistant as the pricier models and it doesn't have tinted sides or front panels so be prepared to improvise some shades for your child. I liked the side bars that protects the tires they saved the wheels from a \\"sudden detachment\\" a few times while pasing through the bike path entrances. It is really important to be aware of the whidth needed to make it through all the time. As other poeple has mentioned, the harness latches could be better and they are difficult to remove. I haven't used it as a double stroller but it doesn't have brakes so It would be a little tricky to go on a hilly ride. I've tried the trailer with two kids and it works fine and two 30 lb kids can ride pretty comfortably, the challenge will be keeping them from fighting. Cup holders form each child are a great help.In general it was a good buy for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap quality and small","review":"I did a lot of research in an attempt to buy a bike trailer under $250. At first I brought home the Avenir Discovery but my wife said it needed to be convertable to a stroller...so I returned it and ordered the InStep Rocket. For about the same price as the Avenir, the quality of the InStep's side windows and seating were not nearly as good. The seat was terrible and small - the kids slid into one another. I do not recomend this carrier."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Jogger'Trailer combo for the price","review":"I have had this for a year or so and have used it many times as both a jogger and trailer on our bikes.

I have the Burley Solo. The build quality of the Solo is very good and was the reason I picked it over this one. In the end though my biggest complaint about the Burley solo is its smaller wheels. Again, while I do not own the inStep, The 20\\" wheels would be something I would have thought more about (much closer to the size of the bike tires). Also, the wheel guards, which mine does not have would be a huge plus in my book. I am very nervous when riding near things like signs cars, that I will clip it. I really takes awhile to get a good sense of how long your veichle really is. Finally, while the overall build of the Burley is probably better, I would seriously consider the Rocket if I were gonna pick one today.

I contacted the manufacturer and they told me to return the product as there is no attachment that would fix the problem. My bike does not have an abnormal frame and I was shocked to learn that the trailer would not work.

When I saw this book on sale recently, I decided not to wait a year to read it -- and wasn't disappointed in the slightest.If you're like me and enjoyed both the Nantucket and Peshawar stories and peoples so far, the same will happen here. Stirling may just be coming into his genius, story-telling wise, as \\"Conquistador\\" is a carefully thought-out and written alternate universe novel, an engrossing read. I couldn't put it down and finished it less then twenty-four hours after I bought it.You'll like the characters and wish you lived in New Virginia by the time you get to the third chapter. Don't miss this one, it's spectacular!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Put it down for over a year before finishing...","review":"I started out really liking this book - the premise, the setting of Northern CA and the mystery...unfortunately, it lost steam midway through and I felt as though I were reading a travelogue rather than a novel. I actually skipped pages toward the end because I felt like I was reading the action in slow motion. Too descriptive! Less words to keep the plot going at a good pace would have been much better, and could have cut the pages by at least a third if not half.I have read the T2 books and enjoyed them. I have Dies the Fire and will still give it a chance. One unenjoyable book won't put me off Stirling completely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok story, but way too S L O W","review":"I read the first two books of the Islands in the Sea of Time series. About halfway through the second one, it just got too boring for me. The original idea was very good, but there just wasn't much of interest beyond that. Conquistador shares a similar feel.The story wasn't bad and the characters were OK, but the dialog was bad and the book was just way longer than it should have been, packed with slow boring parts with a little action sprinkled in. I also felt like the author was trying to force in a lot of little trivia all along the way, and a lot of the time it seemed forced. Add to this an anticlimactic ending and it just wasn't as good as I had hoped.I wouldn't recommend this book. Stirling seems to have good ideas, but doesn't deliver much with them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing entry by an author I generally like","review":"I've enjoyed Stirling's other books quite a bit. This one spends way too much time exploring the ecological and political aspects of the alternate universe and way too little time on characterization and plot. The characters are shallow and way too \\"perfect\\". Everyone's good looking, smart, and athletic with a good sense of humor. I'm really having to force my way through to the end. I hope Stirling doesn't go the way of Turtledove, but after this I'm not optimistic."},{"rating":"1","title":"A gate to another world, in a book that goes nowhere","review":"More than his other books, this work suffers from some of Stirling's weaker tendencies. Extremely long sections of the book do not move the plot forward or keep the characters or readers much interested in continuing with the story.Although it bears some similarities to the Island series, this had a lot of interesting potential. Unfortunately, many of Stirling's characters tend to fall along the cliche that no matter how devisive or unrealistic it is, they will eventually say \\"let's do it!\\" Not in those words, but his characters make unrealistic emotional changes that interfere with the \\"suspension of disbelief\\" needed in a good yarn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I made it one-third of the way before throwing in the towel.

I've read a lot of sci-fi and I guess this is fairly good but his references to popular culture are kind of annoying. Al Stewart for heaven's sake? This is supposed to be set in 2009! But the funniest one is his continued reference to \\"safari wear\\" from Banana Republic. Someone needs to tell Mr. Stirling that Banana Republic dropped the safari format many years ago! As far as \\"alternate history\\" goes I'm not sure this even classifies in that category since it really involves an alternate world, not what might have been in this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Damn Good What If Story","review":"Mr. Stirling is, IMHO, one of best writers of alternate history in the field today. In this novel, he provides a select few in the days after WWII, access to a world untouched by advanced civilization. They set up their own nation, based in what we call California. It's not perfect, I get the impression that Mr. Stirling doesn't believe in Utopias. :-) I have a lot of family in California and am familiar with many of the places mentioned in the novel. The heros are larger than life, but then, that is what makes them heros. The Sluggy Freelance reference was very cool as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical Eurocentric Garbage","review":"Let me start by saying that I had high hopes for this book and its premise. After the first chapter those hopes were dashed. The book is based around a society of people mostly of European descent that at most levels have a confrontational and aggressive policy towards Native Americans on the other side. Just like it occured over here in real history. Napalming a rogue band of \\"indians\\"? The book bases its storyline around a eurocentric point of view that, due to superior firepower, the indians are on the loosing end again. Lame. This book could've been so much more. Its just a case of alternate history repeating history. Lame. To much Flash-Bang and repetitive themes and not enough substance. How about a storyline where indians and \\"settlers\\" get along?

The terrible characterizations and bombastically offensive stereotyping make me wonder what rock the author has been hiding under. Some of this is passed off as the differences between us and our Forties ancestors, but that's just sophistry painting over incompetence.FYI, I did like the author's Draka books and am a great fan of alternative history.

Her up-tempo jams aren't quite as good, but not horrible either. It's not an album for everyone, but if you're into smooth female R&B sound, this isn't a bad one for your collection. She definitely has a good voice and her slow jams will get you into a soothing mood."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just the tip of the iceburg!","review":"Wow...those were my first words when I heard the voice of the very talented Deborah Cox. I know this has been said several times, but Deborah is no doubt the next Whitney! I believe she has just as much of a future of fame as Whitney Houston has had. The thing that really impresses me is that Deborah doesn't feel she has to dress in a slutty manner to impress her fans and listeners like several of the rising female artists of today...two thumbs up Deborah!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If only the songs looked as good as she does .............","review":"This album announced a major new talent in music with a unique sound. Unfortunately most of the songs are ordinary and partly succeeded in hiding that talent. \\"My First Night With You\\" is the only song that allows her to show what her voice can do when heartfelt but restrained. I'm guessing production by Babyface is mainly responsible for that.On other tracks her fondness for Whitney Houston style vocal gymnastics makes its unwelcome presence felt, and it got markedly worse on her second album.The worst track for me is \\"Just Be Good To Me\\". The production here is woeful, and whoever thought Deborah could make a success out of a song that so clearly suited the completely different vocal style of Lindy Layton should not be making those kinds of decisions.I'm thankful that this album got her career started, but you wouldn't call it one of the great debuts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland and weak","review":"Unfortunately, this album falls under the category of \\"A few great singles and 80% crappy filler\\" Other then \\"Sentimental\\" and \\"Who Do U Love?\\" this is an extremely mediore album which fails to distinguish itself from the crowd. Perhaps Cox's second album will be better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seems great so far...","review":"My baby is not here yet so I cannot speak for the wear and tear, but it seems very sturdy when you put it together.

I was given a cherry colored rocker but could not find a cherry crib that I liked and this crib does not clash with it. So if you have other colored furniture and don't care about an exact match this color works well. I am 6 1/2 months pregnant and put this together mostly on my own. The directions are not the greatest and my husband and I had to install the drop side together. All of the parts where there and none of the pieces were chipped (it was picked up from the store).

That is totally impossible because air does not support tension (just as yarn does not support compression, or \\"push\\") Air fills the space above the wing surface because air pressure existing far above the wing maintains, to the extent possible, the static air pressure exerted on the top surface of the wing. Air mass/inertia prevents instantaneous space-filling above and behind the moving wing. If air had no inertia, wings would produce no lift. The True Simple Explanation of Flight: Wings experience a differential between the upper and lower surface pressures due to air inertia (air can't immediately get out of the way of the wing's bottom surface, and the air can't immediately fill the space above the wing, as the wing passes through the stationary air).

There really are no bad tracks. The general theme is of world / tribal music. Big names appear like O.Y.

But there is an overuse of sound effects that muddy up the musical landscape. While there is a consistency to the sound of this recording, I can't put my finger on what is going on here because it mostly just sounds like mush.

I fixed that with filling the lighter full of lighter fluid and turning it upside down until the wick was wet with fluid, then bent the wick to where it was pretty much touching the flint wheel.

These batteries have memories as all Ni-Cad batteries do. To get the full use from them, you need to drain them to almost empty and then recharge them fully. If you run Ni-Cad batteries down, say half way from a full charge and put it in the charger, it will only charge from that point to full and you will have only a half charge to work with. This is where people misunderstand these Ni-Cads from the others. Nickel-Metal Hydride (Ni-MH) and Lithium batteries do not have these memory problems. They can be run for shorter periods and still have juice left. When not fully discharged and then charge them , you have a full battery. Ni-Cd and the others will last longer if you follow this procedure. As always, use the correct charger with an overcharge protector for the battery."},{"rating":"1","title":"serious power issues.","review":"I picked up the Firestorm combo set about 6 years ago.

Dangerous Angels, being several books combined inside one cover, has in itself a complete set of emotions. She has the ability to delve into your heart and force you to relate to the characters. Her writing is mystical and completely real in a wonderfuly unreal way. She writes beautifully and this book encaptures everything beautiful in life and expresses it in a way you can't understand but can feel. She expresses so much through her characters in a way that you can relate too. Everything she writes is so soulful and everyone should experience the passion of her writing"},{"rating":"1","title":"There are better books...","review":"My daughter brought this book home. I can see why many young girls like it, but as even my daughter noticed, it is poorly written. Kids deserve examples of fine writing, there is no need to dumb down vocabulary and grammar for them.There are books that are better reads and are also better written. My daughter suggests the easy-to-read but well-written series Dealing with Dragons, Searching for Dragons, Calling on Dragons and so forth by Patricia C. Wrede, and I cannot disagree."},{"rating":"1","title":"Young adults deserve better (so do adults)","review":"The characters and the story are shallow, totally lacking in depth. The writer seems to free associate and wanders from page to page. It was like reading a comic book plot or worse.I read books for my teens before they read them. This book was a huge disappointment. It is not appropriate in other ways either. I do not recommend it at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"UUUggh","review":"I read this book because some of my students were reading them and I like to keep up with what the kids are reading. The content is totally inappropriate for readers under 13. The text is poorly written. I hope that reading any book leads students to keep searching for and reading other, higher quality, books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont bother","review":"From looking at the cover of this book it looks really good. But the story in it is really awful. I am not even finished with the book. i xant stay focused on the book for more than a minute. I have no idea what is going on. If the stupid author would stop making so many simili's and methaphors, maybe i could figure out what is going on.I read hundreds of pages a week and this is by far the worst book i have read in a long time. i am so glad that i dont own it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow and pointless","review":"I have to say, this book is far by the worse story that I have ever read. Every character is shallow and has they're own perfect storybook happy ending. I espicially hate the \\"love at first sight\\" with every character and the long, tedious paragraphs jam-packed with metaphors and simlies. Francesca Lia Block has obviously no idea what writing is about, nor how to do this. I am appalled that this has so many good reviews for such a shallow book. The plot is odd and twisted and the characters add absolutely no flavor. Are not your characters meant to run the story by some means, not just the story?"},{"rating":"2","title":"a portal to magistism","review":"francesca lia block is one my most favorite authors ... i am a 16 year old girl in hopeless love with all of her gorgeous and fantastical characters ... i find myself dreaming along with her books and daring stories ... her tangible, but at the same time dreamy, descriptions make things seem a little more beautiful and mesmorizing ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mystical and magical. Love is a dangerous angel","review":"This is a truly beautiful book. I learned the meaning of love, and of family. This book opened a world up to me, not the perfect nuclear families seen on tv, but a puzzle ruggedly fit together, but still happy. The intertwining lives of the charecters is expressed in such a mystical glamourous way, and it all seems to make sense. It is the story of people whos live are connected by a thread of love. I cannot even begin to explain what this book meant to me. It has changed me, it let me see in a new light, through tilty purple eyes or pink tinted sunglasses. It talks about the things that teens really are worried about today, but it has a powerful meaning. It talks about: family, love, sexuality, predjudice, inter racial-dating, dating. It uses magical language, the one word i think of when i think of francesca lia blocks writing style is Mysticla. This book is powerfull and beautiful. Love is a dangerous angel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"With a luminous magical realism style, Block tells the stories of Weetzie Bat and her family and friends in the five books collected here. Usually marketed for a young adult audience, the books are more for the young at heart, covering adult themes like AIDS, racism, and sex. These heartwarming books overall tell about what a family really is: a group of people who care about each other through it all. ... It's the story of a young gay boy trying to find another like him, as well as his place in his family and the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Summer Read","review":"Part of being a teenager is dealing with all of the messy feelings and general angst that show up unexpectedly. Francesca Lia Block manages to give voice to that uncertainty along with the excitement of growing up in this collection of Weetzie Bat stories. Her characters so lack pretension that the turmoil they experience doesn't feel like a plot device, more a document of what it feels like to fall in love for the first time, to be lonely, to find out what makes you truly happy. In a way, the characters in the five novels are better versions of the teens we all wish we were: Weetzie wears cool vintage clothes and scribbles poetry on her dresses, Witch Baby is a badass drummer who roller-skates everywhere, Dirk fights skinheads and knows where all the best punk shows are, My Secret Agent Lover Man is an auteur, etc....These are interesting, complicated people that make for an engrossing read, like an introduction to The Beats and Charles Bukowski via YA fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Original and gritty feeling to writing.","review":"With this series I was hoping for more fantasy. While there is some there is also a piece of reality fitting into the story. The world of Weezie Bat is kinda of gritty and reminds of reading a Poppy Z. Brite book but less graphic. I thought because looking at covers there was fairies in the book and there are not fantasy fairies.. I wish there was more about Weezie's daughterl, Witch Baby. I felt I was itching to know more about her witch or djinn power."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a very imaginitive fairy tale that relates to every day","review":"i feel that this book makes you look deep into the characters and you can actually replace yourself with them. All though some of the things are very much a fairy tale, it teaches you a lot of lessons about life. this book is like a dream, you dont really know the true meaning unless you take sometime to think afterwards. over all i think this book was very interesting and i enjoyed all the mixed emotions, feelings, and messages that were given."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tapestry Of Eye Pooping Words","review":"While some characters may seem shallow and flat. Block does a beautiful job with her writing.This is a very good strange romance series. I love it because it's so off beat and not like other romance novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Something's missing...","review":"Block's stories receive wonderful praise, but after reading just the first book in this collection, I've got to ask \\"Why?\\" Yes, the prose is beautiful, sprinkled with sentences that are magic. But I put the book down feeling like something was lacking. The writing is too detached from the characters and story, choosing instead to focus on fantastical descriptions of a picture-perfect Hollywood where clouds are made of cotton candy. I found it hard to relate to Weetzie, Dirk, etc. when I only had the briefest glimpse of who they are. They start in high school, then are suddenly living on their own, with boyfriends, having babies. How did that happen? I wanted some more insight into the characters to make them seem more like real, relatable people, not puppets controlled by the author with no inner thoughts or feelings."},{"rating":"2","title":"good","review":"Well i havent quite finished this book yet... but so far it is kinda confusing. It is a really good book tho. It has love in different kinds of places. It tells about homosexuals, regular love, and different kinds of things about finding yourself and who you are. But i do plan on reading this book fully. It seems very good and the author is great. I plan on reading Girl Goddess #9."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book ever! =)","review":"This by far is the best book i have ever read. i borrowed it from a friend after she told me how much she loved it and i finished it in 3 days. i loved it so much i bought it and i'm reading it again. it has wonderfully poetic discription that i get lost in everytime. francesca lia block is by far my favorite writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weirdo central","review":"I'm not saying this book wasn't interesting or anything I'd just like to point a very obvious fact this book is umm. kinda weird. But over all it is a great read. Justbe prepared to umm. dal with the weirdness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unrealistic.","review":"I found the book a little hard to believe. What was the point? It was too unrealisitc. Striking it rich, when My Secret Agent Lover Man appears out of nowhere. Yes, it was a wish-come-true, but a genie? The book doesn't explain the details. It feels like a hollow book, no meaning. I think that some people, who are more into this type of stuff may enjoy it, but I found it to be just a bunch of hocus pocus. Good thing I got it at the library first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fallen Angels is more like it","review":"I found this book tedious and disappointing in its glorification of social dysfunction and hollywood glamour. I read about half before I put it down for good. Don't bother, unless you're a druggie wannabe."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment (--5 stars)","review":"I picked this book up hoping for something big. And I guess I got it -- a big disappointment!!! This author writes as if words of more than one syllable don't exist -- unless they're pretentiously cute inventions such as \\"slinkster\\". An utter lack of rhythm is also displayed here. Whatever happened to writing paragraphs as if one sentence related to another? And, what about developing ideas beyond the level of simplistic platitudes? This is writing at the most amateurish. I hoped to step into a world in which innocence is confronted with the hard truths of reality and triumphs beautifully -- gaining experience without growing cynical. However, this mess of hippy-dippy, shallow dithering left me feeling cheated. I don't expect all writing to be master-class quality but this stuff is simply dreadful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terribly Written","review":"I picked this book up because the cover intrigued me, and it sounded interesting. Yet within the first five pages, i realized that it is horribly written!!! I did read further then those pages, hoping it would get better, but it didn't. la Block writes in short sentences, and jumps around a lot. i would NOT recommend this book if you are used to more sophisticated styles of writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply an amazing book.","review":"This book may be catergorized as a childrens book, but it relates to both the young and the old. After reading this book-i read it again. The style may be simple, but the poetic writing slowly envelopes you and before you know it you are taken into the story and the lives of the characters. A great read for anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dangerous Angels Rates 1000 Stars!","review":"This is not just a book for young adults. I read this book when I was 21 and I fell in love with it. Please read this book; it will open your mind and change your life. Francesca Lia Block is simply marvelous."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVEY LOVE LOVING THIS SLINKSTER BOOK","review":"This is a book that truly touches my soul. That may sound cliched, but this book certainly is not. She speaks of love in the way we feel it, not just the way we want to feel it. This reaffirms my ideology that love makes the world go round and that people can do and should do what they want to in life. The characters are like my best friends. This book contains the perfect combination of reality and fantasy. I, like one of the other reviewers, have lent my copies of the Weetzie Bat books out, but I have never gotten them back. This book takes me back to me. I highly (even higher than that)reccomend this book to anyone who feels weird, particularly those of us who are not 100% hetero. Before you open this book, remember that life is magic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dangerous Angels","review":"I loved this book. My grandmother bought it for me on the 16th and I was done reading it on the 17. I read the entire book in two sit down sessions. The story is very realistic with just the right touch of fairy tale for it to be wonderful. I know this is a bad reviev but I'm only 13!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"sure sure","review":"admittedly this might not be the best written book ever. or the most plausible story. that's not the point. the point is i read this book when i was 15, in high school, and the only gay kid i knew of. my friend gave me her copy of weetzie bat and i read it all at once then went to the library and got the rest of them. it was one of the most reassuring things. people who loved each other beyond the conventional perception of what family is, or what love itself is even. this book didn't \\"save my life\\" but it certainly gave me something to look forward to."},{"rating":"2","title":"hum cancellig, slightly fatter sound","review":"these are great, if not the be all and end all for stacked humbuckers. they cancel the hum and have a bigger sound than the original strat pickups. they keep the character of the strat tone however, which for me is a good thing. if you want to get rid of the strat tone, buy the hot rails kind of design, but I dont have to because I have a Les Paul as well. it just depends on what kind of music you play and what you want from your guitar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay - not great","review":"What they don't tell you in the description is that the bottom piece does not fit properly - resulting in gaps at each of the 4 corners of the bottom of the waste basket. The solution was to put in a cheap plastic tray in the bottom. It does not look good at all. I'm going to return it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smart set","review":"I bought these to match a new bedroom suite and they look rather smart. After a couple of years of use, the wood finish on the laundry hamper is getting damaged (from having wet clothes thrown in it) and the velcro is peeling off the inside, but it's holding up pretty well. Unfortunately, the laundry bag insert has shrunk after repeated washing and no longer stretches to attach to the velcro propertly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too Dangerous","review":"First heard of Drum Club on an Ambient Collection and search Amazon.com for their album. Drums are Dangerous was the only one available and I thought I would give it a try.The CD came, open it, heard it and wasn't too impressed and stuff it back into my shelf. 8 months later, took it out, dust it and played it again. I must say the second time round, it actually sounds good. Some hardcore drum beats interlaced with vocals and syns. Very engaging once you get into the groove (or should it be loops).Have been playing it over and over again, and it keeps getting better each time once you pay attention to the tracks.Great stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quirky Murder Mystery","review":"This is an off-beat mystery set in the back woods of Canada. Polly Deacon is a sassy puppet-maker who investigates the murder of her best friend's unpleasant husband. Loads of plot twists, saucy and irreverent humour and strong characters make this a great read - I was hooked from the first page. This book is a must for anyone who doesn't take their murder mysteries too seriously and who likes detectives that aren't run of the mill...(ie, little old ladies or embittered police inspectors) Get hold of a copy now!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Haynes is the only game in town but it stinks.","review":"If you are into disassembling your entire engine to get to a piece in the logical sequence of a teardown, this might be for you. Terrible pictures and the age old deconstruction approach to every repair make the Jaguar online forums a much better resource if something is broken on your kitty."},{"rating":"2","title":"lots to like, wish more breeds were pictured","review":"This book has nice, large photos of chickens. The author's stated aim is exploring the world of exhibition poultry. The majority of the photos are of the more crazy looking chickens, including Polish types, cochins, games, frizzles, etc.I got this book from the library, hoping to see clear photos of a wide variety of old-fashioned dual-purpose breeds (Dominiques, Orps, Rocks, etc.). It didn't really meet that need, but was still enjoyable. It you love the crested breeds and \\"fancy feathers\\" you will enjoy this book. I think the author's new book \\"Extra Extraordinary Chickens\\" may be better, with many added photos and additional breeds. (I haven't seen that one.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"My nephews love chickens and I sent this to them for Christmas. They just love it. I found out afterward that they use to get this book out of the library and they're so happy to have a copy for real. If you've got youngsters who love animals, especially chickens, then this is a must buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful Pictures, Almost Useless For Information","review":"Looking for a book to give me more information about various chicken breeds, I took a chance on this book. My children love it because there is no writing. The entire book is images of chickens, and there are tiny notes to indicate the breed...but not the sex of the pictured chicken, and NO breed traits, characteristics, stats at all. The images are beautiful overall, and it's not a bad coffee table book if one is in the mood for chickens...just know that it is nothing more than a picture book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Full color pictorial of exotic chickens","review":"If you raise chickens and are interested in the more exotic breeds and what they will look like when full-grown, then this would be a good addition to your poultry library. The full-color pictures are beautiful and offer an up close view into the world of unusual and beautiful show chickens. If you are looking for an educational book on raising and/or showing birds, this probably wouldn't be your best choice, but for entertainment value alone, I give it a thumbs up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extraordinary Chickens","review":"This book is worth having, even if it is just for the pictures. The Pictures and information give a clear insite of the different chickens that there are around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly Extraordinary!","review":"The striking images in Extraordinary Chickens showed that \\"the world of chickens is a world of wonders\\" (New York Times Book Review).This is a very unique book which provides a glorious window into the world of exotic chickens. The author, Stephen Green-Armytage, captured many unusual breeds from around the world with his camera. Gorgeous color photographs and informative text.Chickens of all sizes, shapes, and colors.This book is not onle a great reference for breeders and enthusiasts, but also a revelation for people who still think chickens are all brown.It is an enjoyment to look at these wonderful creatures. I love chickens, they are smart and actually love people."},{"rating":"2","title":"The chicken as art...","review":"This hefty little book is a surprise on every page. I've always known chickens were beautiful, as all fowl, poultry and gamebirds are. But these lovely macros of the breed standards are really just incredible, from a fellow writer/photographer's point of view. Whatever your interest in these birds, be it a curiosity or a hobby, you will love this book.I also like the size. Easy to find on my overloaded bookshelves. So kudos to Mr. Green-Armytage, for a job well done. Chickens aren't the most cooperative subjects for a photo shoot. I just wonder how many hours to photograph plus travel time he has into this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing diversity beautifully photographed.","review":"This is not an important book, but it is very enjoyable. It introduces us to the amazing (and, for me, hitherto unexpected) diversity among different types of chickens. It is a wonderful tribute to the variety and beauty that can be developed by either natural selection or selective breeding. Or, if you are creationist in your outlook, it is a wonderful example of the Creator's whimsy. The book is mostly photographs; there are some some brief descriptions of the types photographed, and a little general background text - but basically, it is a photography book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way to small","review":"I was disapointed in the size, it is 4\\"by 5\\". It is not fun to look at as it is to small to share with a nother person, unless they sit in my lap. I have seen the large book and it is wonderful. My bust that I did not know what a CHUNKY book is.

Once I did pick it up I had trouble putting it down.The focus on this book is how to discover your strengths using a Gallup online 45 minute timed evaluation. This gives you your top 5 core strengths with an explanation and examples. Now, if this was all the book gave me then I would have given it maybe 3 stars.However, the book explains in detail how we are required to focus our lives both personal and professional on these core strengths. They are the key to getting a life we want to live. I have to agree.There is a brilliant introduction as to how our brains develop and in turn creat unique individuals with unique talents and abilties. Yes I know it may sound corny and very self help oriented but it was an eye opener for me.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy a Used Book","review":"Part of the value of the book is a code to access a web site to determine your strengths. If the code in your book has been used, the only option to get a viable code is to buy another book. I bought a book that was supposed to be new. The code had already been used and there is no recourse."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Internet Code - Do Not Buy","review":"The book may be well written, but if you expect to take the internet evaluation do not buy!!!!

When I first began to read I wondered how the book could relate to my life right now. I don't work at an office and I certainly don't hire employees. As I began to read, I enjoyed the knowledge that the book shared with me. It was an interesting way to view life, especially focusing on an individual's strengths. My favorite part was the StrengthsFinder. It was very helpful in letting me see what talents a program thought I expressed. After reading the book and taking the online survey, my confidence grew and I was able to focus on my strengths more. I would highly recommend this book to anyone, in any career, at any age."},{"rating":"2","title":"Now, Discover Your Strengths","review":"This item was pruchased per request of someone in the department.

Once the password has been used once, it cannot be reused.I made sure I purchased the book new. It looked new when I received it. Yet, when I went online to take the test and I entered the passcode I found inside the flap of my book, the system said that the password had already been used. So, someone had already accessed that particular password.I gave the review 2 stars because I still got a bit of useful information from the book, but without having my personal results for the online test, most of the book was of little use to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unhappy customer","review":"Paid for book 'Now, Discover your Strengths' being used in a study group.

I contacted them and requested a code. They took like a week to get back to me, just to ask me more questions. Told them I had borrowed the book from the library and answered their other questions (full name (why?), id code (which I had already provided), title of publication). A few days later, they responded with a sales pitch about their other publications and that I must buy one new for a code. Nice marketing. Forget it. One of my strengths is not to waste time or money on companies that lie and are motivated purely by greed. ;)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for professionals in any field","review":"In summary, I am in full agreement with all of the positive reviews posted here, however, I also agree with the various criticisms I have read - hopefully they will be noted by the authors and incorporated into a revised and improved next edition.I found myself enlightened, inspired but unsatisfied after reading this book and wanted more real-life story examples and advice for how to apply the knowledge in my career and personal life. I particularly liked reading examples of how some people overcame their weaknesses with their strengths and would have liked more of this inspirational material.I would suggest hunting around and reading the various other strengths-related books from Gallup in order to fill-in the gaps and provide other perspectives. Also, \\"Unique Ability\\" by Catherine Nomura and Julia Waller is rather complementary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snake oil for the 21st century! Step right up!","review":"What a joke! What a huge waste of money and time! I could take the survey mutiple times (if it's possible...which it's not) and come up with completely different lists of my so-called \\"Top Five\\" strengths.A 1 star rating is 1 star too many for this presumptuous, pretentious psychobabble.There's one born every minute and Marcus Buckingham is waiting to take your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't access the survey","review":"I purchased this book a couple of weeks ago after hearing glowing reviews from a friend. I also checked out what amazon reviewers had to say before purchasing and was anticipating a valuable learning experience. I skimmed through the book, then decided to take the online survey. But when I entered the code, I was informed that it was no longer valid--had already been used. Now since I bought a new copy from Amazon, I can only assume that somewhere along the line another person knew what to look for and registered that code. Although I will still read the book and probably gain some insight, I was particularly interested in incorporating what I would have learned from the survey. I'm very dissatisfied for the first time in my long association with Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Micro$oft Meets the Gall-up Organization","review":"Every other book on personality that I am aware of has the assessment contained right within the book's pages. The author's of \\"Now, Discover Your Strengths,\\" however, have come up with a new bookselling scheme. To take the assessment one must use a unique keycode printed on the inside cover of the book's jacket to access a website. The code is good for only one assessment, meaning one book per person (unless you personally file a complaint, I understand)--and not even that, but one assessment per person. Whether \\"Now, Discover Your Strengths\\" adds to our body of personality assessment is certainly debatable. Whether it takes greed to a new level is certainly not. My opinion is that it is best to stick with a book not so marred--an \\"open source\\" book, we could say."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheated","review":"As you know by now, each new volume contains a unique code which can be used to take the Strengthfinders test. I bought a brand new copy of the book from Amazon and the envelope which comes in the back of books was tightly sealed. I opened the envelope, entered the code in the Strengthfinder website and was told that the code was invalid or had already been used. Links to \\"help\\" allow you to send an e-mail to the publisher which results in absolutely nothing.Not recoomended, unless you want to buy the book for itself alone. This is a bad way to conduct business."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning!!!! Don't Buy Used","review":"I purchased this book used on Amazon and started reading it with great anticipation. I covered the first 80 pages in about an hour and went online to enter my code to take the online test. However if you buy the book used then the code won't work. AND the publisher won't sell additional codes online so the only way to take the online test is to buy the book new. Great, now I have a $4 paperweight or doorstop and it will be 5 days before my new copy arrives and I can pick up where I left off. So far the book seems really interesting, however don't waste cash on a used version. Somewhat of a cheap trick on the publisher's part."},{"rating":"2","title":"Requires effort to employ...like anythiing else","review":"I liked this book. It will not solve all of your life's problems, or make you an instant success. But, it provides useful information derived from polls, interviews and a lot of refining that helps you to realize that if you are to succeed, you need to do what you do best and \\"manage\\" your weaknesses. This can be accomplished through a solid staff that complement one another with their strengths. If it's not good for anything else, it sheds light on other peoples' tendencies and their root causes. I gave the book four instead of five stars because a few more \\"how should you use this everyday\\" examples would have been helpful. But, again, if you expect to get anything from the book, you should plan to work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Accentuate the Positive","review":"The Gallup organization uses surveys of over 2 million people to develop a model including 30 different types of personal strengths. Included with this book is an access code to determine your own strengths.

This is part of an exciting new trend in organization and personal development that focuses on positives rather than dwelling on negatives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting and","review":"Great insights to your strengths, but somewhat complex with the descriptors of the 32 possibilities. At least you don't have to read through them all...just your own 5 dominant strengths."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"It's a good book.

I've used it with two different work teams to better understand where to focus development needs and as a team-building exercise. Our team revealed their top 5 Strengths to each other with commentary and discussion. The team members reported stronger bonds because of hearing personal stories that explained Strengths.

I have used this book and the test as a teaching tool in my seminars and programs that provide a method for applying discovered strengths, and there has never been even one person who said the test was wrong or that they did not gain tremendous personal insights from it.But, the knowledge itself is incomplete without a method for applying it to accomplish your own personal success.I recommend it highly"},{"rating":"2","title":"The first step towards greatness","review":"Ask anyone including your self, What your top natural talents are and what do they do for you in your current roll?

This exercise was helpfull to me in order to arrange my priorities in learning, my job and life in general.If you dont know what you are made of, you have a slim chance to trsnform your life into something great.

Think Peter Drucker and this idea is not new. It is useful, however, as a tool to gain personal insight into yourself and others on your team and to understand how each of us possess different strengths. The online tool is relatively simple.

Clearly authors had to have some volume to prove value so they drone on and on and on. Very tedious reading. Then at every turn they continue to try to sell other products or services. The major killer is having an online exam to evalute your strengths; however, the code is only good once - so DON'T buy a used book as your code will be invalid. If the exam is a work related exercise, you'll be forced to buy a new book just for the code. Also, DON'T let your spouse read the book. If you do, they'll want to take the exam and suprise suprise, you would need another new book just to take the test."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste","review":"To do anything with this you need to go online and take the profile. Only one per book. So if someone else in your family wants to, they have to buy a new book with a new access code.

Don't bother buying a used copy, if the previous person used the code, your out of luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing new","review":"While the Gallup organization is well known for it's polling abilities, and their previous book, \\"First Break all the Rules\\" is a respected management tool, it appears the authors felt it was time to write another book, whether or not they had enough new material or not.The basic premise is that we all have strengths and we should find those, capitalize on those and manage around our weaknesses. A reasonable message, and one that is pretty well covered in the first 15-20 pages. The rest of the book is filler to expand the book to 260 pages. After all, who would pay a list price of US$28 for a 20 page booklet?There are other management books out there that are far superior. Pass on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"beware of used copies","review":"An integral part of this book is the online profile. Each copy of this book comes with a unique PIN number inside the book jacket. If you buy a used copy, the PIN number may be already used, and thus will not allow you to use the online profile. However, the book is still interesting if you enjoy reading through the signature themes and guessing what your profile would have uncovered. It is also fun to read each theme and think of people you know who come to mind, and consider ways in which you can support their strengths.I would give this book 5 stars if an unlimited number of people could use the online profile with each book purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this book used/second hand","review":"In order to take the online test you have to enter a unique number printed at the back of the book.

You must buy this book new in order to take the online test. I purchased a used book through the marketplace (always and excellent experience by the way) so the code has already been used.

But a contrary opinion is needed here.The premise was great: working on our strengths is more important than focusing on our weaknesses. The first 2/3 of the book repeated this idea in various ways. That is great, but I already believed that or I would not have purchased the book.Almost 1/3 was spent explaining how to manage people by understanding the strengths of your employees. A few pages in between explained the profiles that are derived from the online test. These pages are descriptive, but quite general. They sound like horoscopes from the newspaper. But no space was spent on how to apply the descriptions of the strength profiles. And that is what I came expecting to learn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not sufficient","review":"Well this book is ok if you already have a successful career and you just want to fine tune some management issues.

This book is required for the Business class I am taking. I went to enter the code and it said it had already been used! I am very P-O'd because a great deal of my grade is resting on my assessment and how I enterpet it. I don't know if I can get a replacement- I emailed the seller- I doubt there is anything that can be done. I don't have money to go purchase this again... I am frustrated because it IS a good book- but I feel it's not worth it if you can't take the assessment. There could be a better way to distribute the code. Or maybe the book should be SEALED or something. Now, I will probably fail this course."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe the book would be good if you could access the strength finder web site","review":"I think the subject of the book is good, however a big part of dicovering your strengths is taking the on line strength finder quiz.

While the concept is sound (focus and develop your strengths, do only damage control on your weaknesses), the test does not reveal anything that could be applicable to my work. Many of the 180 questions are just simply asking you where your strengths are and then telling you the same thing in the result. The applicability of the result is very low. 3 out of 5 of my strenght mean that I like to think, the 4th means that I feel everything is connected (how is that a strenght?) and the 5th is that I like to collect things (ideas, stuff). I don't feel this book and especially the test is worth the money nor the time. On the other hand I would be genuinely interested in hearing from someone who found the test useful in his/her life."},{"rating":"1","title":"A self help book that didn't help me at all","review":"The title implies that it will help YOU discover and use YOUR strengths, but it is actually more of a management/hiring book- it helps you place other people to use THEIR strengths effectively. Since I am in sales, (and only have one assistant who doesn't need much managing) it wasn't much of a help. The personality test wasn't even helpful. The book recommends that you use it to \\"hone your strengths\\" and then it doesn't tell you how to go about doing that. If I were managing 20 or so employees and had to make a lot of hiring decisions it might have been helpful- it did discuss how to match people with different talents to appropriate jobs. Since I am not- it was a total waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Caution on buying this particular book used.","review":"The major feature of this book is that you can go online and take a test to identify your strengths.

Everyone gets more opportunities to shine, and cooperation has increased."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Tool","review":"This book is a great follow-on to the first Buckingham book, \\"First Break all the Rules\\". It is an indepth look at how companies can and should alter their perception of employees, building a workforce around strengths, creating an entirely new paradigm. The fact that Buckingham has backed up his theories with such a breadth of research is refreshing. It takes a human resource-type discipline and gives it a systematic and measured path. I believe this should be required reading for every CEO, HR manager and business leader. Well written, understandable and highly engaging. The testing tool is great.

The strengths test is interesting, my top five were facets that show in my personal life (the bookish little nerd liberal arts major) much more than in my professional life (hard Harvard MBA). What is missing is how to apply this insight...what the particular combination of strengths means, how to communicate with and lead people with differing strengths, etc., etc. Perhaps I am expecting too much, since I am basing my expectations on the Myers-Briggs and other personality tests with larger data and research bases....."},{"rating":"1","title":"No better than a horoscope.","review":"No, the test results seem random.

There isn't even a way to pay a little more for a new access code. I was just stuck.The book was pretty weak anyway in terms of practical advice a person could apply right away.One section on managing employees with different strengths had a reasonable amount of practical advice, but you'd need to know their \\"themes\\" for this to do much good.Buying it new might make sense if you really enjoy learning more about what makes you tick.

A key component of effective leadership these days is the understanding of the strengths of others and how employees and companies can benefit from this knowledge and application in the work environment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't buy this book used!!!!!!!","review":"The book requires the user to take an on-line preference test to determine your \\"strengths\\". The publisher controls the process by printing a code on the inside of the jacket cover. Once the code is used, it cannot be reused. Thus, anyone who buys the book from someone who has already used the code to take the test will be unable to take the test. The book is almost worthless without the ability to take the online test."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another disappointing management tool","review":"I purchased this book at the suggestion of a co-worker who suggested that the strength assessment tool had really done a great job identifying his strengths and that as an organization, we would be well-served to have all our associates complete the exercise for the sake of their co-workers and managers.I took the \\"test\\" and only found that 2 of the strengths identified appeared to apply to me. I was willing to acknowledge that I wasn't as \\"self-aware\\" as other people and purchased the books for the rest our our department. The results appeared to as thought the strengths were identified by random (i.e., if there are 6-7 types of personalities, you'd expect 1-3 traits to apply if they were applied by random).This was a disappointing book and I would recommend that managers stick to more traditional personality and temperment assessment tools."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"Based on other reviews I got this book expecting to be informed. What I got was a long poorly disguised sales pitch for their selection test. As a former user of the Gallup test, I should have known better. The basic premise is not new. The things they tout as traits are really just characteristics.

Focusing on the positive definitely keeps me motivated to do even better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Team Building Tool Yet","review":"We purchased this for each member of our support services team. This included accounting staff, conference planning staff and administrative support staff. First we planned a quick session to identify the characteristics of a good team and qualities of great team members. Each members's top five strengths were displayed on the wall and grouped by team. This allowed the teams to see how the strengths of its members contributed the overall team. We basically went through the list of strengths and those who shared that strength reflected on how that contributes to their work here. Team members gave them positive feedback on how they experieced that strength and were impacted by them. It was encouraging, uplifting and has inspired them to work toward their strengths and focus less on weaknesses. We would recommend it to any individual or team."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stingy with the tests - not professional.","review":"The authors want you to buy more books in order to take the test more than once yourself.

If you buy this book USED it may be largely useless","review":"I purchased this book used through Amazon only to discover that for the book to be useful, you have to do an online Strength Finder Profile. The problem is that each book contains a SINGLE code that is only good for ONE USER! So if the original book owner used the code, you won't be able to, and the majority of the book will be meaningless to you because you can't do the profile. I felt completely ripped off when I discovered this! It would be easy for the publisher to note this on the cover so people would know before purchasing, but they don't, so I hold them responsible. They also don't provide or sell additional codes for a fee. I couldn't use the book for its intended purpose therefore it gets only one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"I want my money back","review":"I purchased this music expecting to be able to put it on my i pod, but I can't and I can't talk with anyone who might be able to help me.

I sent a complaint and the supplier sent a replacement and it arrived yesterday and after it was installed the audio went mute after 2 minutes and never returned. This item is not perfected and if it were would be a nice addition to my system. It is small the switching was no problem it also has an 5V electric option which they do not tell you in the ad but it switched fine without the power and I tried both. I even changed all the HDMI cables thinking the problem was a faulty cable. Nope, this is a piece of junk and I do not suggest ordering one.

I was hoping to be able to run my satellite dish and upconverting DVD player on the TV. Forget every other feature this device might offer. The connectors are of such low quality that jiggling the HDMI cables will cause the signal to drop in and out. Even without touching anything, the signal will drop out randomly. Every time this happened, I was able to restore the picture by jiggling the HDMI cables. I tried different cables (new and old ones that I knew worked) in different configurations.

Jeeves is the butler to Bertram Wooster, a loveable idiot who endeavors to solve the problems of others but inevitably ends of making them worse. Wooster is a typical \\"high society\\" goof character, but the real gem of this story is Jeeves, whose subtle wit and quiet charm help to smooth over Wooster's blunders. My one complaint about this book is that there are so many characters, each with his or her own story line, and I wanted to see more of Jeeves! Still, while most of the other characters were family to Wooster, some other members of the household staff were featured, such as Anatole, the temperamental and emotional French chef. Wodehouse does a brilliant job of flipping the roles of high society and the help, having the family practically beg the help to stay on. I'm definitely considering reading more in this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lesson in comedy","review":"English comedy at its best. Wodehouse is a genius.

Can I get something? The second story... forbidden fantasy... yeah I'm thinking homeboy was a pedophile. And both of them (Austin and Ashleigh) worked my nerves.

The writing is wonderful--zippy but never shallow, and the dialogue crackles. She skewers the male psyche without man-bashing in the least, and shows up female foibles, too. This is a wise, funny, compassionate, hip, bittersweet story, full of telling details, with its fair share of belly laughs. And the steamy sceenes actually seem to belong to the story, something many writers just can't pull off."},{"rating":"2","title":"I read this book cover to cover!","review":"Groping for Luna is a thoroughly enjoyable read. The characters are vivid and three dimensional. They are gritty and awkward and real - often doing or saying the wrong thing and struggling to piece a life together. This is an engaging story of artists and musicians who never achieve great fame or fortune but never-the-less spend their lives working at it. On the journey, the main characters bang up against many of the of the stereotypical trappings of a career in rock music - drugs, sex and betrayal and to my surprise move through them in ways more real than fiction normally portrays. And as an added bonus the plot is full of surprises. I couldn't stop reading (I read cover to cover all night)- I wanted to know what would happen next. The end is a pleasant surpirse which I won't spoil.

The instructions consist of a picture above the pattern, no fabric requirements for any patterns. If you want to learn the freezer paper method, fine. If you need to learn to paper piece mariner's compasses forget it. Even the teacher teaching paper piecing could not figure out what she meant by the marks on the pattern pieces and she has been teaching for 25 years.

Within the first four mintues I had hit two targets and had them yelping after the second bb hit them. Needless to say, for the price you cannot go wrong! The CO2 lasted well over 100 rounds. It hurts to get hit by it, so others won't take you lightly if this is all you're armed with. It has a great feel to it and weighs enough to make my son think that it is \\"real\\"... Buy it and enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Value for money","review":"This is an excellent CO2 pistol. I purchased this for a friend for her birthday because I already had one myself. It is all ABS external with metal internals. Velocity is high, accuracy is best with heavy bb's (.20g or greater). Magazines are easily obtainable, both online and at your local Wal-Mart (Crosman C11 6mm mags work). Trigger is long and spongy, not the best, but a controlled mag dump is easy enough to do. When combined with this technique, easy hits out to 70 or 80 feet are obtainable. I much prefer CO2 to green, red, or propane gas. 12gram cartridges are simple to load, and have a much smaller chance of leaking then gas chambers and loading valves. CO2 is also much easier to find. Also the CO2 lasts a while. I will use this gun as a secondary when either assaulting or sniping, and in this role, one canister will last at least two games, more if I don't use it much. This gun is an excellent deal for the price. It easily competes with any gun less than $100."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works at first but.","review":"I got this sometime last year thinking it was decent pricing for such a solid looking gun-I was wrong... When I got it, the canisters were very difficult to put in, and once i did screw them in finally it seemed as if it was leaking a bit. A week after I purchased it the canisters stopped screwing in all together, I took a closer look at it and realized the needle that punctures the canister was made too far away from the area you put the canister in...

Unfortunately the author provides almost no backup for her statements regarding wheat, white, or whole grain breads. Her primary commentary is on the comparison to home milled flour and white flour, which of course the home milled flour will be much better for you. Her only real comment on comparing home milled flour to whole wheat/whole grain flour is a short paragraph where she states there is not enough research on the subject. I personally found the book very boring and not worth the money or time to read. The only benefit I found to the book are the recipes for bread making using home milled wheat. In my opinion you can find all the statements she makes on websites for free."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Useful Reference and Primer","review":"I have been milling grain at home since the 70's. I didn't purchase this book with the thought that every page would be new information for me. Unlike a prior reviewer, how is an author to know how much information is enough or too much for each reader? I would prefer too much information; I can filter out what I know quite easily. This is an excellent primer for someone interested in, or just starting out in, whole grain work. I wish we'd had something like this back in the early seventies!I have an employee who has approached me, interested in doing her own whole grain work. This was the book I have loaned her.

It comes in a cardboard envelope and contains 2 Kimba episodes: \\"Hunting Grounds\\" (original title: Catch 'Em If You Can) and \\"The Legend of the White Lion\\" (original title: Journey into Time). These are the 1993 version of Kimba, not the original. The picture quality is really washed out; these DVDs were very poorly made.

His voice is as warm and intriguing as usual. This has little to do with his experimental music of the early '70s, but has its own tiny investigation into standards from composers as diverse as De Andre', the Stones, Richard Anthony, Jacques Brel, and the late Sergio Endrigo, among the others. The two Battiato's originals get out at the end, with wit and good taste. Nothing more to be desired if you are in search of something new. American Radio Stations, take note!"},{"rating":"1","title":"mostly asterisks","review":"the work in this book is an example of why poetry is marginal and going to remain that way. Kelsey is more interested in white space than in language, which means that not only the pages but the poems themselves are empty. I tried reading the poems aloud to see if that gave them any more substance, to see if there was something compelling about the actual sounds that silent reading didn't evoke, but unfortunately, there's not much music to found in these poems. There are, however, many, many asterisks--the book is littered with them. And like the lines of letters and words Kelsey arranges, they're symbols of lack you really just skip over.

I've tried to get into the album but after five listens all the way through, I cannot remember a single cut, except for the chorus to the In memory of... whatever.

So if you are male, don't expect either too much practical input for you or being able to read this book without feeling queasy. There are enough references to other belief systems to make even the Buddhist connection tenuous in the extreme. Her website is even worse.The positive from all this is that we have decided to write our own book on pregnancy and parenting from a Buddhist perspective and we are not going to be including any references to Isis or Hestia. We will be presenting teachings directly from the Pali Canon.I will finish reading this book, but it simply shows me the need for something that is both more rational and significantly less feminist/New Age in orientation.But then another use for this book will be as toilet paper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mindful Mothering","review":"An important meditation on the spiritually rich and profound significance of mothering today, as always.

There is also mention of the execution of seven members of the raiding party, including James Andrews, the raid's leader. This story was made into a movie at least twice, the first being the silent film \\"The General,\\" starring Buster Keaton, and a later version , \\"The Great Train Robbery,\\" by Walt Disney.Much grittier, and none of the romance of the movie versions, just a first-person historical account.Riveting!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well written first person account of Civil war triumph and tragedy","review":"Brought the drama and harshness of the Civil war to life with a first hand account comparable to a thriling movie script but with reality of someone who was in the thick of it.

The way Mike uses each instrument is amazing, I especially love how he uses keyboards and pianos. Plus vocally he's killer, very warm and inviting.

You can hear the beginnings of what makes Gizmodgery such a great album, but none of the songs are satisfying. The chord progressions dont work to build up energy or break into new beats or anything.. they're just more strung-together, seemingly without much thought.

What a disappointment. He tried tuning it and it would not tune right. It kept making a buzzing sound. We took it to a repair shop and they said the next was so warped and twisted there was nothing they could do to fix it. We returned the guitar for a replacement. The replacement was worse then the original. They said the frets looked like they'd never been sanded. They were uneven and too high. The neck was warped and there was was something wrong with it he couldn't figure out. There was so much static coming from the guitar he was amazed they even let it off the line. What a HUGE dissapointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is there a warranty on the amp?","review":"I bought this as a Christmas present for my son. He used it for about a month before he realized that there is a short in the cord for the amp. The amp is not blown, it is just a problem with the cord. I expected the amp to last longer than a month. I would have returned it sooner, but my son did not tell me that it was not working (typical 20 year old) until after the return date was past. I have read that there is a limited warranty on the guitar, but I can't find anything about a warranty on the amp. Is there anything I can do, short of paying more money to get the amp repaired? I am really dis-pleased that my first Amazon order ever only lasted a little over a month. My son loves the gutiar, I can't pry it out of his hands."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you are having doubts, dont worry this guitar is good for its value.","review":"I used to play aquostic couple of years ago and always had yern to play an electric guitar however, i had no idea of what kind of guitar to buy so I crossed my fingers and ended up getting this one. Its almost been two months since I got it and I couldnt be more happier. It comes with a gig bag, a belt, a small amp, chords, extra set of strings and a tuner. So its pretty much a complete package. I would recommend you buy a beginners book if you are one. The amp is little small so I had to get a new one, however if you are looking to play something in your apartment or room without disturbing others, then this amp should do the trick. All in all, i have had no problems at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"It cant be worse","review":"The Amp doesnt work at all. The guitar's workmanship just match its price.

My son opened this on Christmas morning only to get an incomplete set. The strings, digital tuner, picks & cord to connect the guitar to the amp were missing. I've sent Amazon an e-mail already, hopefully they can get this shipped to us quickly. Other than that the guitar and amp look great, hoping to get this up and working. He was really excited then just as equally disappointed!! C'mon Amazon, it's not that hard to make sure a guitar pack you are selling is completely shipped. I'll keep updates on how long this takes to get all my parts!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"worst ever","review":"first off the guitar was beating up all over the amp wire doesn't even fit i didnt even get most of the stuff in the picture no picks none of that stuff so i would say stay away from this guitar unless you really like wasting your good hard earned money"},{"rating":"1","title":"GOOD LOOKING, CRAP SOUNDING!","review":"The guitar is good looking, but as said in other reviews, the 6th string hits the fret board. no matter if you use the picks or your finger. it hits the fret all the way to the 4th fret before it stops vibrating on the frets. the other strings seem to do fine, but even that one string hitting the fret, it ruins trying to play it. The amp cord is pretty cheap, but its what you can expect for $119.00. The amp is pretty loud, and has a good amount of adjustments for various sounds. Even tightening the hell out of the 6th string will not prevent it from vibrating on the frets. a good looking guitar is pretty worthless if it does not play worth a damn.You would think that a guitar company that has been in business this long could manufacture a decent sounding guitar, but I guess it's since on the guitar it says \\"MADE IN CHINA\\" on the back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great set up","review":"I purchased this for my son, who is 10. He has an acoustic guitar, but wanted to move on to the electric. I had looked at the Fender guitars that were being offered as a kit. The price tag was a tad bit too high for me (we bought this on sale for $100).Shipping was fast, the product came in a brown box, well packaged. The tuner is junk. We had to do some adjustments right out of the box, but not really a big deal. The high E strings continually were breaking, so we upgraded to Ernie Ball Super Slinky strings and we have not had a problem since. The sound is nice. The amp is a perfect size for having in a home (it is still too loud for me sometimes).This is a great guitar package for a kid. He can ding it, drop it and do whatever and as a parent feel better knowing that I didn't shell out 200+."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value, great sound.","review":"Silvertone guitar and amp played great AND the amp has a headphone jack as well as an input to play along with my iPod.

The graphics are amazing and the story is incredible. It puts you through the entire spectrum of emotions.The ending on this series is different than the original broadcast I believe and leaves you saying \\"What the..?!\\"I highly recommend this series. I'm sure you'll enjoy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I purchased this DVD set with high expectations. It was NOT what I expected. There were no fighting scenes or action scenes with Chise as the \\"Ultimate Weapon\\". She would appear as the ultimate weapon but there was no violence, fighting, or graphic context. The story was boring and the animation was poor in comparison to other animes Ive seen. I give it 2 out of 5 stars. Did not like this anime At ALL!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I wept like a baby.","review":"If your looking for an action series look elsewhere.This series started off slow for me. I was expecting a mech action anime. I was not expecting a deep and moving multiangled love story. This anime by Gonzo is one of those must haves that will have you feeling sorrowful days after completing it. The line in the last episode \\"you have this much love for me in your heart\\" got me crying and I couldn't stop. No one was around so I went with it. This is one of only three movies/shows that have ever made me cry. My Dog Skip, Radio Flyer and now Saikano. If you do not have this in your collection buy it now."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Raining Hits !!! Even Better Than Schizophonic !!","review":"Definitely a worthy follow-up to Schizophonic. Geri has proved (with her recent #1 hit \\"It's Raining Men) that she has staying power. I love every song on this new CD. This is one of the only CDs I have ever owned that I don't forward through any of the songs when running the tracks. She's managed to record an album where every song is a pure winner! I HIGHLY recommend this CD. BTW, I had to order this as an Import. When is it going to be released in the U.S.? Best Tracks: Scream If You Want To Go Faster, Shake Your Bootie Cutie, Feels Like Sex, Don't Call Me Baby, I Was Made That Way, and, of course, It's Raining Men. Definitely a must have for any music collection !!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Scream If You Want Something Diffrent","review":"Geri Halliwell Scream If You Wanna Go Faster. A more mature album with a diffrent sound. Very diffrent than scizophoic. Sadly there are no songs like Bag It Up and Mi Chico Latino but never fear there are lyrics close to it. A little disipointed and suprised. All together a good album. Reminds me of Emma Buntons A Girl Like Me but with more talk of fornification! Fan or not check it out you never know."},{"rating":"2","title":"We Need Geri in the U.S.!","review":"In my opinion this is a really great album! geri shows she definitely still has the spice, and i think she isn't given enough credit for all she can do. she's really a talented singer, and this album just helps to prove that. she covers many emotions with this album, and just has fun with all of them! only thing that could've been changed is it should've been released in the U.S. too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Geri's done it again","review":"Geri has done it again.She has made another incredible CD.Geri's incredible vocals and song writing abilaty is really shown in this CD.This is one of those CD's that you can listen to all the way through and not hit the stop botton.The songs have great beats,fun lyrics,and excelent vocals.Geri has never sounded better.A must have for all pop fans and Spice Girl fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much Better Second Time Around","review":"I must admit I was a bit disappointed with Geri's Schizophonic. I wasn't sure what to expect as a solo effort after leaving the Spice Girls. But her sophomore effort blows the previous one out of the water. Her vocals have improved and the music is so much better. If you were a little let down by her first album, Scream If Yo Wanna Go Faster will prove herself well. She may no longer be an official Spice Girl anymore, but she definitely still has SPICE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"a very bad disc","review":"First of all i thought this would be a great cd however, after hearing the songs on the radio it is clearly aimed at an older audience not people who are fans of pop music so do not waste you money on this cd the few songs I heard it rainging men and scream if you want to go faster our garbage maybe everyone was right when the called Geri the least talented Spice Girl If you want a good Spice Girl Solo alobum try Emma Bunton A girl Like me It is The best their is not a bad Song on the Disc So this album is for people who are not really into pop music but more adult contemptory. buy at your own risk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can it get worse?","review":"For someone who left the Spice Girls, she sure can't let go of the past! Seems like she's trapped in it, as almost every song sounds like a Spiceworld reject. Ms. Halliwell's attempt at altering her musical pallet is laughable - the rocky and funky beats are as out of place as a goth kid in Disney Land.Nothing on this cheese packed excuse for a CD can redeem Ms. Halliwell. The only thing it brings into light is her total lack of any vocal talent, and not the mention song writing ability. If this CD got any cheesier, you'd find in between the Havarti and Chedder in your local Deli. Geez."},{"rating":"1","title":"Geri Fantastic Album","review":"I really like to this album.It so nice of music of this own although it member of 60's.I think \\"Scream if you wanna go faster\\",\\"It's raining men\\",\\"calling\\",\\"Circles round the moon\\",and \\"Shake your bootie cutie\\" are good and best."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"It's heaven, it's hell being Geri Halliwell...\\"","review":"Scream If You Wanna Go Faster by Geri Halliwell was a very catchy album in 2001 but this cd is a bit dated now. Halliwell was never known as a strong vocalist but she has spunk and fun with each of her albums. This was my last Geri album, never was interested in her music again. There are some highlights from this album especially the songs, Stength of a Woman, Don't Call Me Baby, I Was Made That Way, and Circles Round the Moon. Just buy this album if you are a complete Geri nut!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Scream is an understatement","review":"After purchasing Schizophonic on Amazon I decided to give Scream a try. It took awhile for the album to wear on me. But it is an album I still listen to. Sometimes after a long day I'll play it and it always gets to me. Especially \\"Circles Round the Moon\\". One of the prettiest love songs I've heard in a long while. It is more of a playful pretty love song. But it is my fave. \\"Don't Call Me Baby\\" reminds me of the song \\"Stop\\" by the Spice Girls. Proabably the same writers. I was amazed that Dave from the Eurythmics worked on this album, as did the man who engineered a lot of the Eurythmics' albums. I always liked the New Radicals and I like his rock contribution to the album. For some reason the song and video for Scream IYWGF always reminds me of that Garbage song \\"Special.\\" Overall a good album although I didn't purchase it for the #1 remake of Its raining Men. I loved this era of Geri when she got fit and into athletics and rock."},{"rating":"1","title":"Betty Crocker Angel Food Cake Mixes","review":"I was disappointed in the packing of this product.

Its everyhing you ever wanted from the UK Club scene rolled into 2 CD's. Its, the culmination of popular songs from the clubs of Ibiza to the UK charts. Any Americans into the club music of the UK should definately buy this CD... its not the best Kiss album the radio station has ever released but it sure does contend with the other compilation albums of this year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good disc!","review":"Pros:Good game!Great graphics!The story isn't bad at all!Cons:They don't say that Maui is Donald's old alter ego, and he is.The game dosen't seem to have cold shadows."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awesome game, but bad CD!","review":"Do not buy this CD unless you have Win 3.1 or 95.

Get the SNES version instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wrong album name","review":"This is labeled as \\"Aggayu\\" by Abbilona but it's actually their \\"Orisha Oko\\" album.

I love the clean recordings that do not include the hands in the air concert praise & worship setting. This album is a great introduction to a lot of great classic artists: Michael W.

I got my sheltie and named it Julie. I fed her... Trained her... Took her for walks. Got new collars and stuff. But then came the day my dream came true... I got a real, live, sheltie named Sadie. After that I didn't play my dog game so much... I was too busy playing with my real dog. This game is absolutely great for someone who doesn't have a real dog. But if you have a real dog already, there is no point in getting this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Purchase on My Part","review":"I purchased Nintendogs Chihuahua & Friends because I absolutely love dogs, mainly chihuahuas. The graphics are life-like and they interact with you as if they were actual dogs. It teaches you what it's like to own an actual dog and is a great alternative for those who can not own a dog for whatever reason. The only problem I have with the entire Nintendogs company is that they do not have much variety in dog breeds. It is basically the same game over and over again with a different name and a breed replaced by another. I highly recommend Chihuahua & Friends if you are thinking of purchasing a Nintendogs product. Overall the game is fun and is great for all ages."},{"rating":"2","title":"4 star","review":"its a great game with alot of effort in it, but it lacks the pull that some games have... over time it kind of gets boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 year old daughter","review":"My 5 year old daughter absolutely loves this game.

This is a game, it has nothing to do with adopting homeless pets from the shelter, someone could say the same thing about the Sims. So if you played the Sims should you go out and adopt a homeless person or adopt a child? This game was created to bring joy to the person who plays it, I would even recommend it for anyone who is thinking about owning a pet, but don't want to get in over their heads. Some people are allergic to dogs, so this is a great way to \\"pretend\\". It is a very innovative and thoughtful game, I see that a lot of time and study of canine personality went into the development process.

It is really boring, oh yea, the dogs have voice recognition, but only for a certain voice, so if your buddy comes over and buys a new dog, you're gonna have to match his voice if you want the dog's attention.

I got my DS and opened it up.15 minutes later after getting my dog and thinking ofa name to name it I pressed the microphone button and said his name Casper. After a few trys he got the hang of it.I was so impressed by the graphics, It made me think thatI actually got a real dog.I found out my friend sam also got it and introduced my dog to hers (by putting it in bark mode).They got along great.

At first you are in the kennel and there are six starter breeds. You pick your dog and go home. Then you meet the point of teaching it its name. It takes a several times but if you say it clearly and loudly it'll learn it in just a few trys (try not to put your face right on the microphone try to say at the distance that you play the game)You can teach three tricks a day and enter your dog in contests 3 times a day. There is also bark mode where you can connect with other real life owners within a 100 ft distance. The reason why I gave 4 stars is because I don't like how you have to wait 30 minutes between walks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nintendogs","review":"This game is very fun. It dosn't teach anything, but it would be a great start for anyone who wants to know how to raise a dog. I have it myself and I play it for hours and hours at a time.

A simple but also an adventurous read. I read it when I was young and now my kids are reading it. Its at least the right comic book to read when the kids are young, especially when the comics these days when comic books represent to much violence, vulgarity and to much fiction, and yet only have action in them and nothing to fascinate the kids minds. These books are all against that and just plain yet clearly a novel type read.Since this came out way before man actually made it on the moon can show how authors used to imagine the world to be. Also, there being comedy, some serious mysteries and situations, this makes it the perfect book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great birthday present for a Tin Tin fan","review":"Bought this as a birthday present for a 10 yr old boy.

The standout tracks were the first song, and first single, the Dre-produced \\"Lookin' At Me\\" which is a banger as always, \\"Ghetto Village\\" with an interesting Stevie Wonder sample, \\"Young Locs Slow Down\\", \\"This Gangsta Sh*t Is Too Much\\" and the reunion of Warren, Snoop and Nate Dogg on \\"Yo' Sassy Ways\\". Warren is never outshined by his guests, and his flow is always on time and perfect. Infact, this may be a contender for the best album of the year, and it is definately Warren's best since Regulate. Those who may hesitate over it because of his last few offerings, buy this album, take a chance, you won't be dissappointed.

Warren G is at his best when puts out mellow, laid back beats and laces them with simple, but catchy rhymes. This album is full of bouncy beats, and the flows don't really ride the beats well. I though reuniting with mista grimm would be a good idea, but it wasn't used right, and George Clinton doesn't belong here. This album was made for a particular west coast type of fan, and not really intended for hip hop fans in general. warrens best was his first, and take a look over your shoulder was tight too, I still don't know why people hated on his second album. That album was tight. His third, I want it all, was okay, but you could notice a bit of a decline, and this one just dropped his status. His next album, the g files:code 213 should get him back on track though, as I heard he is taking it back to his roots. That should drop sometime this summer, 2003."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Ones A Dud","review":"My Favourite song right at the monemt would have to be \\"somthing to bounce to\\" this is basically the only good song on Warren G's disappointing release, ghetto village is alright and the intro soundz quite good, but the rest of the album doesn't sound good at all, warren g use to keep it g-funk, now he got dr dre to produce tracks and dre is getting a bit boring producing everyting now.soumthing to bounce to is a work of art and the rest is striaght up wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Resource","review":"These line if books are great for any traveler.

I purchased it for my first two babies (1996 & 1998) at local bookstores but have been unable to locate it since. With baby #3 due next month,I was about to give up hope on finding it again. The reason I like this book enough to want to use it three times in a row is that it has a really open format that allows you to create areas for baby momentos that are important to you. My biggest \\"peeve\\" with traditionally formatted baby books is all the blank lines to fill in! I am not that organized of a person to record every detail of baby life that the book thought to make a blank line for-- my children would have been destined to blank pages!

Avoid this album. If you're looking for dba's electronic dance pop sounds, the 1996 album \\"Bubble\\" is a good choice, and is an album I still enjoy listening to.

I want to read the book that tells WHY these intelligent creative people threw themselves so totally into Warhol's world...a world that couldn't have existed without them.....All I can say is, if your intent is to try and understand Warhol, then Bob Colacello's book is the absolute best take...besides yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Illest book","review":"Beyond being an all-inclusive portrait of Andy, this book breaks down the public, trends and the superficiality of fame and fortune.

After reading Victor Bockris' Warhol biography, Brigid Berlin's & the Superstars' biographies - then the Diaries (some sections over and over), I thought I was pretty familiar with Andy as a person, artist and businessman. But this book is so intelligently written and thorough in its detail, from the point of view of someone who was there, every day and every night, the impression is like living through those exciting yet stressful times myself. I do not see this as Mr. Colacello's way of complaining about unfair treatment all those years; on the contrary, I think he has a legitimate right to want the truth known about the unacknowledged efforts on Andy's behalf by him, Fred Hughes, Brigid, and others at Warhol Enterprises."},{"rating":"1","title":"not thrilled","review":"These felt like normal dress tights. relatively thin.

Shipping was prompt and package arrived in good shape."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"This icing is so fast and easy and delicious, I love it! Any time I need a quick delicious cake I look for my Home Style Seven Minute Frosting to put on it and it always looks and tastes great. The bad part is you can't just go out and buy it in the stores anymore, you have to buy it online. I usually give lots of it away to family and friends who can't purchase it because they don't have a computer."},{"rating":"2","title":"PURE DELIGHT!!!","review":"I cannot express my delight that I was able to find this product! I have used this frosting mix for over 35 years. It makes a perfect recipe each time (not like the made-from-scratch version cooking on the stove with syrup, etc.) It is perfect for cut-up cake creations and makes a wonderful brownie bar that ONLY THIS TYPE frosting will work (must be baked with this icing on it in oven!) I do not understand why it is not available in stores. I was so excited to run upon the product that I order 2 cases (that's 24 boxes). I just hope it is still available when I need more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Frosting for Holding Coconut","review":"I have found this product almost impossible to find in my area (Northern Kentucky.) This frosting is comparable to homemade 7 Minute Frosting, but less touchy to prepare. If you family likes coconut, this frosting holds the coconut where butter cream frosting does not. My family likes yellow layer cake with lemon filling, frosted with the fluffy white frosting that has been covered with coconut. Great at holidays for making bunny cakes with coconut \\"fur\\" and for Santa cakes with coconut beards. The frosting also make a great rim for topping cakes with fruit fillings.I will place an order soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"not for wedding cakes or professional cake decorating...","review":"i'm a professional cake decorator and wanted to see how this tasted, frosted and if it could give a smooth texture, but it can't.The texture is like marshmallow fluff, so it's almost impossible to have a very neat and clean look to it.On the bright side, it's definitely convenient and easy to make (just add boiling water) and is great for simple home baked cakes.I wouldn't recommend this for anyone looking to make professional looking cakes though.

My Mother always made it at Christmas.(at 92)I can't rely on her. I saw this recipe a few years ago. At that time this frosting was easy to find. The past 2 years it just seemed to disappear from the shelves. I wrote to General Mills and Amazon was one of the places for the frosting mix to be found. I appriciate the fact that they recomended Amazon as having the product. It is not as good as Moms but is a great replacement. Several friends told me it was just like what their Mom or Aunt made. The recipe is on the box so to have great divinity get Betty Crocker Fluffy White Frosting Mix. Thank You Amazon and General Mills.I used 3 boxes this Christmas. It has a great date so will have more for next Christmas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Frosting ..hands down !","review":"This frosting is sweet,fluffy and definitely NOT greasy like the typical can frosting in the grocery store. It's so easy to mix all you need is a bowl, hot water and a mixer. Then seven minutes later you have perfect frosting. You can tint or flavor it anyway you want. You can spread it or pipe it on cakes and cupcakes easily. It's PERFECT !!! Why Betty Crocker's Home Style is not available in my area is a mystery to me. Thank You Amazon, once again you are a life saver."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fluffy easy cookies purchased at Amazon Verified Purchase.","review":"Having a recipe for this item, I'm anxious to try this out again. I've used a box like this before, and so I'm glad I could putchase these boxes from Amazon verified purchase.

If you love marshmallow flavoring, if you love fluffy icing, if the traditional cake icings are just TOO sweet, then THIS is your product. Every year, my mom makes me an angel food cake and then asks what color I would like. Most years, I ask for lavender, but have had blue, pink, green.....and one time, it turned out gray. lolYummmm Yummmmm Yummmm...you have to try this. You won't be sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just as I remembered it.","review":"This is Just as I remembered it. Very light and fluffy.

When I was a teenager learning how to cook I used to make this frosting from scratch (boiling the syrup, beating the egg whites, etc.) and it was a lot fo work. After I got married my mother-in-law introduced me to this mix and it makes a frosting virtually identical to the home-made kind. We weren't able to find this in the local stores any more and had several boxes we \\"squirreled away\\" and have rationed for family occassions like they were treasures. I was delighted to find it on Amazon; I was afraid it was lost forever."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE Best Frosting mix, EVER","review":"This is absolutely the BEST frosting I've ever used !!

In addition to the smells (they're not ALL bad), there are many bits of historical trivia. For example, you'll learn more than you ever wanted to of the death of Thomas Becket.

Phonics doesn't exist in the true linguistic system of our language. What does exist in reality...a beautiful systematic system of phonology, orthography and most importantly morphology. Please learn the REAL English language and then teach the conceptual and very meaningful way our forefathers put it together.

That's the case here. Nearly 100 years worth of research converges on one simple, unassailable fact: Phonics taught systematically and directly is the key to the successful teaching of beginning reading. The logic in this book is difficult to follow because it rests on beliefs rather than the best science.

Bernstein explains the path to reaching this goal and the key pitfalls that prevent most of us from maximizing our investments. He uses enough detail to be convincing but not so much detail that we get stuck. I know we have all seen this line before \\"if you read just one book...\\" When it comes to personal investing this just might be that book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A bitter pill for the investment business to swallow","review":"In a calm and carefully reasoned way he punctures the egos of nearly everyone in the investment industry who would stand between you and your assets. Those familiar with Jack Bogle's writings will find little new here, but Bernstein has a slightly different perspective as an individual financial adviser. His words of reassurance for the long term investor in these troubling times are worth the price of the book. I have read many books about investing, but few have risen to this level of usefulness, timeliness and readability. And most amazing, he is a fellow physician. We are not known for our financial common sense."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best investment book I've read","review":"Bernstein is obviously extremely analytical and objective. I've been trying find good books on investing and have read quite a few books. Some of those are good. However, no other book I've found gives a clear idea on how to formulate an investment strategy with a clear eye on risk overall with some excellent suggestions on independently going about it like this book. There were many little \\"gems\\" in this book in addition to great overarching clear ideas. Also his take on mutual fund companies and some advisors is eye opening. It made me reconsider my current strategy in an objective way. Read it and you will feel more confident in tackling the complex journey of investing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of Truth and Candor for the Money","review":"A splendid book. I've admired Dr. Bernstein's efforts to popularize modern portfolio theory on his web site (The Efficient Frontier) and read his previous book on asset allocation (The Intelligent Asset Allocator). This book is his best effort yet to bring objective advice to the average investor about portfolio building.Previous reviewers have covered most aspects of this fine work, but I'd like to emphasize one aspect. All individual investors should understand the role of brokers, the financial press, and even mutual funds in the financial industry. Dr. Bernstein lays out who's interests they serve, and where their profits are derived. Be aware.Heartily recommended to new investors, and also to experienced investors who routinely rely on conventional means to make their investment decisions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Four Pillars provides solid foundation for investing.","review":"I read Bernstein's previoius book and liked it. I like Four Pillars even more. It is well written, references substantial studies to support it's points, is easy to read and is often entertaining as well. Bernstein provides an important inside look into the deceptive world of finance, giving historical background and explaining how some heavily promoted ideas are not substantiated by objective studies. I have used Bernstein's ideas for my personal investments and have seen good results: nice returns without the usual rollercoaster ride. The best part is that, not only does his system work, it is so simple to use and requires very little time and effort. Thank you, Dr. Bernstein."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book!","review":"This book taught me a TON of information about investing and turned into one of my first hobby \\"passions\\".

Shrewd! ;-)In any case, I separately relished Bernstein's 2009 \\"Investor's Manifesto\\"--which (as the author himself essentially concedes in its preface) is likely a better choice for lay, beginning investors because it minimizes (or \\"segregates\\") the \\"unnecessary complexity\\" of this \\"2002\\" book's sundry \\"tables, graphs and examples.\\"That said, there's certainly enough textual subject matter here NOT included in \\"The Investor's Manifesto\\" to warrant your perusing \\"The Four Pillars of Investing\\" too.

There are detailed examples for various types of investors to optimize their asset allocation.

Well, maybe not because I feel like I have a leg up on every other investor who believes he can time the market, get rich quick, or knows where the market is heading (well, after reading this book you'll see where the market is heading over the long term, and long term does not mean 6 months). This is by far the best book I've ever read, I cannot express enough how this book has open my eyes to investing, trading, saving for retirement, planning for the future, etc. Anybody who is at all interested in any sorts of financials, saving money for retirement, day trading, investing in stocks, bonds, mutual funds, etc. this is the first book you should read.

It was a very fast read (I finished it in 3 days) due to the writer's natural style, and it will open your eyes to things like actively managed funds vs. index funds, fees associated with mutual funds, and the importance of asset allocation and diversification. I completely changed my long-term investment strategy after reading this book and I already feel like I am doing better than I had been for the past few years as far as increasing my portfolio's return while lowering its risk. Like I said, get this book now.

Mrs. Bernstein is probably one of the best salesman for that company, at least is book is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good general concepts...can be inaccurate at times","review":"The author makes a worthy stab at reviewing the topic of investing, its theory, history, psychology, and business practices. For the most part, this is a good book for the beginner and intermediate investor. With the right level of attention, it could leave the reader with a road map for the future which would be solid enough.But, the author gets a little too passionate about his arguments and points more than once, and overstates his case. Since the book is written for a novice investor, this is a dis-service. Also, the book has some inaccuracies and inconsistencies, none of which are fatal, but some are material.Finally, the author tries to run the reader through some asset allocation examples - which turn out to be overly complex on the one hand, and simplistic on the other.All in all, a good book, but should only be a starting point for the curious investor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Erudition Spoiled by Intellectual Dishonesty","review":"The best single critique of the efficient market theory was done by Warren Buffet in \\"The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville.\\" Bernstein never troubled to address it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"There are a few tidbits here which would be very useful to the novice investor but it is based on classical financial theory, much of which has been debunked by modern portfolio theory.

I've probably used this mitt 4-5 times already because we eat alot of fish. It slips over the handle nicely and I'm able to remove the skillet from the fire quickly and without burning anything. I only put the mitt on the handle when I want to hold on to the handle to turn the fish or when I want to remove the skillet. Otherwise it sits on the counter nearby. This mitt is thick enough to protect your hands but not so thick that you can't feel the handle.

Makes it possible for you to grab a cast iron handle without getting burned. I've had no problems with heat affecting it like some other reviewers mentioned. You just have to be smart about it. Take it off if you have it on high heat for a long period of time and then put it back on when you need to touch the handle. Simple."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice","review":"We use cast-iron skillets (Lodge, of course) all the time. These are great at avoiding the burning handle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was nice","review":"I usually used a towel over the handle of my cast iron pan. I was excited to get this because it seemed more convenient. When cooking, I pulled it off part ways so it didn't get as hot. After a few times, the inside was singed and I had to throw it away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great at protecting hand for more than a few seconds.","review":"If you're using the Lodge skillet as a serving piece, the cover works well to prevent a dinner guest from grabbing the hot handle and burning themselves. If you're planning on using the cover as a pot holder to protect your hand from heat while you're serving, you better server really fast. After a few seconds, the heat transfers through the mitt, and it's painful to keep holding on."},{"rating":"2","title":"It does what it's supposed to do.

This creates a toxic smell..that is very poor for the food and probably to inhale. Also, the shipping charges are ridiculous, because this item would ship for about 90 cents by first class mail."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flammable, flimsy and flawed","review":"These mitts are poorly constructed from flammable material. They don't hold up in the wash, the color comes off easily, and they melt and burn far too easily. I have a flat glasstop stove, so there are no open flames, but if these mitts are within 2-3\\" of an active burner, they will quickly heat up and start to smoke. Once that happens they are brittle and charred to the point of being unusable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mitt Misfit","review":"I just received this handle mitt as part of a three part set, cast iron waffle maker, mitt, and cleaning brush. I am not displeased with either item except that the mitt does not fit over the double handles of the waffle iron.

My oven is clean at it was only set at 350 degrees. Within 5 minutes, I went to retreive the pan from the oven. As soon as I opened the door, my eyes started burning and I saw a little smoke.

It took myself and my family about 4 days to complete and is a beautiful puzzle. We found it challenging but not at all frustrating. The first problem we noticed however was that the cut was off - where there was suppose to be white border, sometimes was cut into the picture. At the end, there was one missing piece and two duplicate pieces. If there were only a missing piece maybe I could assume we somehow lost it... but since there were extra pieces and a bad border I think its obvious we got stuck with a \\"lemon\\" of sorts. I am returning it for a refund."},{"rating":"2","title":"A LOT of Orange","review":"This puzzle took my husband and I a few weeks, on and off, to complete. As said in previous reviews, the picture is not crisp or clear. It feels like this was a smaller image that was blown up way beyond comfortable size, so the entire picture has a blurry effect to it. When we initially took the pieces out of the box, and spread them over the table, we literally felt like we were swimming in orange. There are not a lot of pieces that can be picked up and immediately matched to a location on the cover. This puzzle definitely felt like an accomplishment when it was completed though. I probably won't purchase another Sunsout puzzle due to the lack of clarity on the picture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dragon puzzle","review":"Not my favorite puzzle.

The outline is very difficult with a white band that varies in depth. There are many similar colors but not as bad as ocean or sky!

The It Girl is less guitar oriented and more song oriented. Sleeper has several gems on this album.

By the name I expected to see great segments on Yaz, Fisk, Clemens, Evans, Rice, Foxx, Boggs etc, instead you get every bit of the 2007 season and a tiny bit of history. Not enough time was spent on past greats. Also too much time spent on garciaparra. Good buy at $5 or less other than that STAY AWAY.

It doesn't seem to have a clear story line, the topics bounce all around. But the one thing that really stood out for me was that they would play the same footage AGAIN! There would be a scene shown early in the DVD and then they would show it again later on....why??? As if we didn't notice it the first time? This was very poorly produced, which is too bad because they did have some great vintage footage that could have made this a Red Sox fan must-have."},{"rating":"2","title":"HOUSE MUSIC AT IT'S GREATEST!!!!","review":"Awa Band has a sound that everyone should hear.

I went onto this \\"Professional\\" edition. Boy was that a mistake. While I could follow the concepts in the book, they were presented in a very overly-complex manner. It seemed the authors (and there were a lot of authors) tried to present the most complex scenario they could think of for each topic. But then did not give any \\"real-world\\" cases where you would ever use all of the complexity and nuances discussed. They could have made the code examples much more direct and to the point without trying to confuse the reader. I think I could have gotten a basic skillset from the Beginning book and picked up anything else I needed through development. Also this book is absolutely filled with errors.

This wasnt the book. It seamed that all of the authors did not work together to come up with a concise guide. There is a great deal of content on different topics but not meaty enough to merit the title and I felt lots of duplication (Should have expected with so many authors).

Some chapters were good, but most were not. If you have taken out all of the redundancies the book would have been 1/3 smaller. In many cases the book introduced the concept, gave 1 example and then quit - web services and threading. I expect more from a professional level book. In fact I would say this is maybe a beginner+ book.

But I am not talking about Windows XP, it's more like Windows 1.0. It crashes and freezes constantly. It has so many glitches it would take me pages to describe all of them. Just don't buy this unit. For my part I will never buy another RCA product. I have owned a few RCA products in the last 10 years and all of them have been pieces of junk. The bad thing about this unit is that you cannot even ask to exchange it for a different model because the DRC8335 is the only VCR/DVD-R combo that RCA has ever produced. Mine has died for the second time and I am now struggling with throwing it in the garbage or warranting it out again only to suffer another couple months of frustration."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why isn't there a 0 star option?","review":"If only I'd known how bad this thing was before bought it. All the other bad reviews are dead on. As it is, I'm going to try to take it back for a complete refund today. I have been messing with this unit since day one. It has a super confusing and tedious menu system, and I was being generous, thinking it must be MY fault I was having so much trouble with it. But it locks up regularly. I buy quality discs and it says they are bad. At this moment, I can't get the disc out and I've tried everything but a crowbar. I just went to the \\"HELP\\" site. Absolutely laughable. I am very unhappy with this product. No more RCA for me, I guess. I thought they were a quality company, but things have changed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst DVD player ever!","review":"I bought the first one of these at Walmart in September 07. It worked fairly well for the first month or so. Then it started not reading discs that would play in my son's $ 29 dollar DVD player. Finally in December 07, while watching a movie, it just froze. I was able to get the disc out, but it wouldn't do anything but blink Hello. So, we took it back and got another from Walmart. Big mistake, but since we didn't have the receipt we couldn't get our money back. Now, we've used the new one twice, and guess what? It has already stopped working. I had my last DVD player for 4 years and never had one problem. Please save yourself the money and the aggravation and don't buy an RCA."},{"rating":"1","title":"AVOID THIS VCR/DVD RECORDER","review":"Save your money. This is the worst piece of A/V equipment I have ever purchased. There is a loud hiss that plays thru your speakers from both the dvd and the vcr player. The vcr player constantly 're-tracks' itself and sometimes even freezes. This happens about every 3 minutes of playing. This is my second one, the warranty was easy thru RCA, but why buy an item you keep having to return to the manufactor?? Plus, Thompson Group (RCA) has set up a seperate toll free number when you are calling with problems with this machine.Save your money. RCA is not the quality they were a few years ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad!!!","review":"Performed poorly or not @ all ,depending on the task.

Makes me wish for the good ol' VCR days.After hooking up a new TV recently, the DVD's play in black and white only, but I figure thats a messed up connection problem. Or maybe directions that aren't clear enough for an old guy.Guess my main gripe today is the typically pitiful 'Customer Support' offered online. Since my RCA manual's troubleshooting section didnt deal with the color (lack of) problem, I figured I'd check online. Anyway, after going around and around several times, and filling in the same blocks over and over, I finally ended up getting to ask a question. Time will tell if/when I get a response. I can only imagine how unhelpful it will be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay Far FAR Away From This One","review":"I bought one of these from F........ in 2007 and it worked fine for a couple of months but then the DTV tuner died. I returned it to RCA and they sent me a completely new one. That unit's DVD section failed and then the whole unit bricked. I ended up getting a $137 refund and gave up on it. It really was a good unit but it just refused to work. Save yourselves the hassle and leave this thing be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke in 14 weeks, just 2 weeks past warranty!","review":"Sigh!

Though Ron Ely is a good Doc Savage, the story is not one of the greatest and it is a bit too campy for me.

Nothing gets him down, and the tougher things get the tougher he comes back at them. Armed with courage, determination, resources that would make Bruce Wayne proud and his band of loyal associates; he fights evil and wins the admiration of the dames. Plus it includes some of the cheeziest snake FX ever. Two thumbs up and half a glass of milk out your nose; watch it and appreciate that all movies do not have to be big budget blockbusters to be enjoyed and watched again and again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only for people interested in anything about Doc Savage","review":"This video is a campy take off of the Doc Savage character. It is similar to the Batman series in the 1960's. Those who truly enjoy reading the series will not be amused with the antics and truly bad acting of this show. I gave it a three because it had the Doc Savage character.

The books are all high adventure with a naive 1930's idealism. This movie did a good job of captuing that feel but stepped too far into the Batman and Lost in Space campyness of the 1960's. It just becomes insulting to the audiance. I still watch it every few years since I enjoy Doc Savage, Ron Ely does a good job as Doc, and the casting of the Five was decent. Find some of the old books and read them instead. If you enjoy them, watch the movie and imagine what it could have been.

No hint of what the Doc of the books was all about; no suspense; no elan; nothing. But, this is the usual outcome when Hollywood tries to bring superheroes to the screen...The Shadow (all special effects and a mish-mosh of themes and stories); The Phantom (Billy Zane good; Devil and Hero great, Treat Williams over-the -to \\"performance\\" ruins the picture along with the cutsey-poo asides and wisecracks not to mention the Ghost Dad to help out his often benighted son...The Phantom needs his dead dad to help him out with Diana? Evidently the writers never read the Phantom strips.)Superman I looks like they changed directors 1/2 way thru; The rest degenerated to the point that IV was a social message film; Batman I was decent, if you could accept Keaton..but, the next 2 were abominable, showing no one understood what made the first one decent.

I thought this would make a nice Christmas gift. She has a beautiful voice and sounds well with the full orchestra and strings behind her. We both found that showcases the rich beauty of her voice. We found when she sings in a band group with back up singers, it's just not the same rich sound. She is very good but not with the band back up, I would not buy this CD again, the cost of this CD was very expensive at $45.00 plus. Why would this cost so much? Must be good marketing.

This book was informative, encouraging, and down-to-earth. I think we can all find a little of our life in her examples. Although I did not agree with some of her ideas (or maybe I'm just not willing to try them yet!), for the most part I found Joni's plan very do-able. Some very good recipes included, and a good chapter on shopping and cooking ahead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Daydreaming about staying home? Then read this book!","review":"I don't rate many books a \\"10\\", but this one is excellent, practical, and realistic. Jonni McCoy explains indepth both her reasons for staying home and how she went about achieving her goal. Most importantly, she makes a statement that thrift and frugality are choices. She enjoys luxuries just like the rest of us, but in the moment of truth, she will forego those luxuries to keep her ultimate goal: not going back to corporate America! This is far different from Amy Dazcyzn's books (although they are excellent). Jonni's books make it all seem so possible for the average woman wanting to be a stay-at-home mom"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing new, but much missing","review":"The general impression I got when reading this is that the author read The Tightwad Gazette, then decided that the info in those books was just way too \\"cheap\\". She repeatedly speaks of spendy ways as \\"the good life\\", and makes frugality out to be a hardship to be endured, and only to reach an important goal. The recipe section was very nice, as well as the resources listing in the back of the book. Overall, I would say save your money, and get The Tightwad Gazette instead. You'll get less biased information, and lots more tips for honestly saving money."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you are a new sahm this book is for you!!!","review":"We lost 60% of our total income when I quit my job to sah.

While it is no hardship for me to give up the job, giving up the income scares me to death! I found this book to be reassuring, and full of practical, doable ideas. Yes, the biggest focus is on the grocery bill, but according to another book I just read, food accounts for about 12% of the family budget (making it second only to the amount spent on housing, and tied with the amount spent on the family car/cars), so I think the emphasis is well placed.I would recommend this book to anyone considering trying to live on one income.

The writing is poor, with grammar mistakes and a sloppy style of putting words together. What bothers me most, though, is the lack of research that went into this book.

For example, ideas in the food shopping category include \\"watch for sales\\" (really!) and put together a price book.... She also pushes readers away from using a stand-alone freezer because of the additional cost. I have a large size chest freezer that only costs me approximately $32/year in electricity, which I can recoup on one good sale of vegetables, fruit, bread, cheese, etc. And, by the way, did you know that pumping your own gas is always cheaper?

His playing is fine, but he hands over the vocal chores to Bizor on one track, another is an instrumental, and most of the songs lack the focus of his best material.

They basically arrive disassembled with either missing hardware or broken bones. The spines are all twisted like it should be called bucky the cripple skeleton. You have to take the entire skeleton apart just to correct the warping. The screw on the top can barely stay on and will collapse thanks to the excessively warped spine. All the screws along the spine are loose, floating around in the box or lost in transit. You can't find screws like this in the home improvement centers. Last one I got his arms were on backwards! The one before that had a bad drilling where the leg connects and too short a screw to attach the thumb screw. It's no good his leg wont stay on.

I was happy to see this album release in surround sound but was disappointed by the lack of content and very disappointed with the fact that I still can't figure out how to fast-forward through songs on the 5.1 side of the disc. Why would you disable that option? I guess the people who made the disc had a lot of extra time on their hands from not having to add extra content to the CD.

The big hit \\"Money For Nothing\\", was a fun listen in '85, but the years haven't been kind to this #1 smash. The songs I still enjoy are, \\"So far Away\\", #9 hot 100, #29 MSR, the keyboard driven \\"Walk Of Life\\", #7 hot 100 and #6 MSR, the mellow jazz-rock of \\"Your Latest Trick\\", \\"Ride Across The River\\", a different sounding Straits, very strong song.

The latest mix (done in 2005 by Chuck Ainlay) is terrific, because it gives you a different perspective of the production. I know most people will jump right into Money For Nothing, but the quieter ones are the most effective, cos they give you a chance to sit back and enjoy what these songs really are: brilliant songwriting. Chuck Ainlay has been working with Knopfler since the nineties, producing his solo records and his skills are truely amazing.

I knew no good would come from the Miami Vice fashions sported by the band in the \\"Alchemy\\" concert film. But I dumped the Straits after one spin of \\"Brothers\\". Tracks 1-5 (Side One, vinyl) just flat out suck. Where is the tight, groove-oriented playing? The Knopfler knack for good storytelling? Noticeable improvement on tracks 6-9 (Side Two, vinyl), but the Straits tank on the first half. Compared to the first four albums (self titled, Communique, Making Movies, Love Over Gold), \\"Brothers\\" is a lightweight, Mr. Mister-sounding stinkeroo. Some record label hack must have sent Mark and the boys into a panic on this one. They seemed to have lost faith in their instincts, and subverted their talent to achieve mass market stardom. Pity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not That Great","review":"You can't please all of the people all of the time, but if you try, this is what you end up sounding like - the aural equivelent of white bread.

In comparison to Dire Strait's bread type, he's organic seven-grain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too 80's for me...","review":"The 1980's were a bad decade for music, and this album is a good example of why. I hope you like overly long, overly synth driven tunes that run out of inspiration shortly after they begin, because that's pretty much all you get. In fact, I can only think of two tunes worth salvaging here; Money for Nothing and the Man's Too Strong, which even then don't touch average works by great bands (the Beatles, the Stones, Cream, Led Zeppelin, etc).A fine example of everything bad about this release is Why Worry, eight-plus minutes of boring...for one, you can barely hear it, but when you can it's fairly uninspired. The same can be said for the title track and especially the opener, So Far Away, which repeats the same line (not to mention measure) for about two minutes in the end, and the title track. I'd avoid it, but that's just me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of getting something for nothing ....","review":"GoHastings clearly advertised in the wrong place and did not provide the dual sided disc with 5.1 sound but merely the standard CD version, which explains the <$10 price.

I think theMoney for Nothing on here I think is done really well and I liketo repeat it over N' over again. Sometimes 3 when even better.Also, check out Your Last Trick, Why Worry, Ride Across the River, The Mans Too Strong, and One World."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Brothers In Arms\\" is the reason God gave us ears...","review":"Simply put, and IMHO, this is the greatest sounding audio recording ever released in the Pop/Rock category. The quality, even after 16 years, is unmatched. If you are a true Audiophile, you already own it. Whenever I upgrade my 'gear', I come back to this recording, and enjoy it all over again. You should too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just plain GREAT!!","review":"This is one of the GREATEST Albums of all time in my opinion.

So the anniversary edition was the way to go upon its release (along with the new DS/MK compilation 'Private Investigations'. This is still a classic and the best of their studio albums, along with 'Love Over Gold'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life set to music...","review":"Not a child of the 80s, I bought this album for the \\"Walk of Life\\" guitar work, but it was the soulful lyrical images of \\"Your Lastest Trick\\" and the haunting war commentary of \\"Brothers in Arms\\" that got me hooked. For anyone who loves music (and life), this is a MUST HAVE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best 5.1 sound I've heard","review":"I'm finding out the hard way that 5.1 surround sound is only as good as the sound engineer who mixed it. As I invest in older CD's that I enjoyed in stereo, I'm finding out that I'm not always satisfied with 5.1 surround mix. \\"Brother's in Arms\\" is a great Dire Straits CD. It could have been even better in 5.1 surround, but the man at the sound board dropped the ball. I expect to become engulfed in the music, with sound coming from all around. Hence the term \\"Surround Sound\\". Well, that didn't happen, and after the first 2 tracks, I got bummed and listened to something else.There is such a great opportunity to do something creative with surround sound, and that opportunity gets blown in the hands of the wrong person. I guess everyone has a different idea of what they expect to hear. In my opinion, Sting, Steely Dan, Bryan Ferry, (to name three) had their music mixed properly in 5.1 surround."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't believe them - it's not that great","review":"I like Dire Straits with their more laid back approach due to the singing and playing by Mark Knopfler, but listening to \\"Brothers in arms\\" is in the long run a rather boring experience. This album was in a way Dire Straits big breakthrough and includes the excellent \\"Money for nothing\\", and the catchy and happy \\"Walk of life\\". But the rest hasn't the quality I'm used to when it comes to Dire Straits.Skip this one, and go for their debut \\"Dire Straits\\" (1978) and the even better \\"Making movies\\" (1980) instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"TWO GOOD SONGS","review":"NOT GREAT JUST TWO GOOD SONGS ON THE WHOLE CD.I THINK WHEN YOU PAY ALOT FOR A CD IT NEEDS TO HAVE MORE THEN TWO GOOD SONGS ON IT...

It is overplayed on every radio station in the world, and it is one of the worst albums of all time. Why Worry, & The Man's Too Strong makes this a rip-off. This, Communique, & Alchemy live is JUNK DIRE STRAITS and I don't recommend any of them.ps- overrated."},{"rating":"1","title":"All I see in stores...what's the point?","review":"This is all I see in stores, this and Sultans Of Swing The Very Best Of. Are those 2 the most popular? Why is it? I know because people like Money For Nothing, & Walk Of Life, & overrated BROTHERS IN ARMS. Everything about Dire Straits is BROTHERS IN ARMS. What is the point? Why Worry, & THE MAN'S TOO STRONG ARE 2 OF ONE OF THE WORST SONGS I HAVE EVER HEARD FROM 'Dire Straits'.HAHA! Thus, what is the radio always playing this? JUNK!!!!!!!!It Seems like you can get anything you want from the BEATLES, & the ROLLING STONES. But pop music is really weak. Try to get anything from Green Day or even Guns N Roses. They rock, and they are METAL!!! You can get any Dire Straits CD that rocks like the great ON EVERY STREET '''which contains HEAVY FUEL...the greatest song in history, a whole lot better thanoverrated songs like STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN, or FREE BIRD.'''DON'T FOOL WITH ME!! HA"},{"rating":"1","title":"Only 1 good song...rest dissapointing","review":"I can't tell how overrated this CD is. It is very overrated and boring. If you like sexy, overrated, sad, boring noise music buy this. The only good song is Money For Nothing and it is one of my favorite songs of all time. It is pure hard rock and heavy metal. But the rest of the songs are weak and dissapointing. If you really want a good Dire Straits CD, I recommend go pick up On Every Street 1991. It has one of the greatest songs rock ever done, Heavy Fuel. That one is a must-have. Dire Straits make slow and long music. If you want good music that is loud, pick up Green Day or Guns N' Roses insted. American Idiot CD ROCKS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Only Overplayed Dire Straits Album And Is The Weakest of the Straits albums","review":"This is just as bad as Communique. 5 of the songs on this arereally lame & weak. Why is this considered classic? Another overplayed album is Making Movies and I love that one, it hassome really nice tunes. If this is overplayed, I never see Moneyfor Nothing. All I see is So Far Away. And all I hear on the radio is either Sultans of Swing or Money for Nothing. If I'mgonna listen to this overplayed and overrated album, I will justlisten to the good songs. Plus this is also all I see in stores.Why is this also so popular, I mean why does everyone like thisso much? Especially radios need to stop playing just this andCommunique, and go with Love Over Gold, or On Every Street.See Ya Later."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Retarted Album","review":"Ooh man, I can't tell you how awful this album is, it's really bad. I was just listening to it 1-5 and man, this album is reallyreally bad. It has several really awful cuts depart from 'So Far Away'. 'Why Worry' is one of the worst, most dull songs I have ever heard with 8 dull sad minutes. It's so retarted. I don't like it, I wish you could throw this in your trash can and goget the 1991 Dire Straits album insted. Even Metallica is betterthan this so stay away from this awful album. Thanks."},{"rating":"1","title":"overrated and i don't know why","review":"Why do people love this album from Dire Straits? I think the other 4 albums from Dire Straits are slightly better. And thisis not their top seller, either. So in my opinion, it's slightlyoverrated with several weak songs. Here are the good songs on this album. SO FAR AWAY, MONEY FOR NOTHING, and WALK OF LIFE.But I can't stand the rest of it as it's boring. This is a littleto 80's for me, I would like it if it wasn't their top seller and if LOVE OVER GOLD could be it. Get these albums insted...ONEVERY STREET, MAKING MOVIES, DIRE STRAITS DEBUT, and LOVE OVERGOLD.

The sound quality is much much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Have","review":"Any rock fan must have this album, doubly so for any guitar fan. Mark Knopfler's unique style is showcased quite nicely. I really like this album for the deep cuts like \\"Ride Across the River\\" and \\"The Man's to Strong.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, except for the Big hit","review":"One of the biggest selling CDs of its time, partly due to being the first CD issued in England, and partly due to the once-inescapable dreck of the song \\"Money For Nothing\\", this is for the most part a genuinely great album, don't let \\"Money For Nothing\\" turn you away. Mark Knopfler's beautifully clean, precise playing can never be faulted, for starters, and this includes one of THE most soothing, beautiful songs ever, \\"Why Worry\\". Other highlights are \\"The Man's Too Strong\\" (which has the most thunderous guitar parts; truly a brilliant use of dynamics); and the title track. If you do not have any Dire Straits CDs, I recommend first getting \\"Making Movies\\", their finest moment; I recommend that over any best-ofs, in fact; but you could do far worse than to get this fine album."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a band","review":"What can you say about a band that has the courage to play almost exclusively its own music and then make it sound like you have heard it a million times before. This is one of the true \\"classics\\" of our times and this remastering of the original has produced for the listener an even greater enjoyment and awareness of the sublime musicianship of this band. If you like Dire Straits and even if you have the original do your self a favour and give this a listen on some decent equipment. I cannot stop playing it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"This music brings up good memories of the 80's, and I like the lead singer's voice very very much. The music and the lyrics are great (in my opinion)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fools","review":"I'm one of the so called \\"Youth Of Today\\", I'm 16 and I hate the talentless music that is brought out by just anyone. As weird as some people think it is I love music from the 70's and 80's, and if I had one wish it would be to go back to then, cos that is my idea of heaven. Those were the days when musicians had talent. So in future can some of you think before you go accusing all young people of listening to crap."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Brothers\\" ruled the airwaves","review":"Because \\"Brother in Arms\\" raised Dire Straits into international superstar status, it would be natural for longtime fans like me to hate it. But I don't because despite its popularity, it is no sellout. \\"Money for Nothing\\" and its MTV tie-in may have been the most overplayed song of 1986, but songs like \\"So Far Away,\\" \\"Walk of Life\\" and \\"Why Worry\\" are among leader MArk Knopfler's best ever. In fact, only a couple of draggy songs toward the end keep this album from obtaining true classic status. A rare example of artistic and comercial success going hand-in-hand."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT the 1985 version if it says \\"re-issued\\" or \\"remastered\\":","review":"BEWARE - Read the fine print. Even if it says 1985, if it also says \\"re-issued\\" or \\"remastered,\\" it is the horribly messed up version with all the life compressed out of it - for the \\"loudness wars.\\"This is classic rock - really good stuff, but be sure to buy a used CD with the original mastering. The original is breathtaking in its clarity. Very quiet voices and instruments are clearly discernible. It is startling, actually. Not so in the remastered version. The re-mastered version might be better for jogging with an iPod, but if you are going to listen on a good stereo, the original is far superior. Turn up the volume."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overplayed?","review":"I love dire straits, I love Mark's guitar playing and it just makes me happy to hear it.For all the people saying this CD is overplayed because they only listen to songs like Money for Nothing and So Far Away, then here's a hint, listen to one of the other songs on the CD. Brothers in Arms is an amazing song that's full of meaning and great instumentals. Ride Across the River is an erie example of how a song can effect you, I felt the same way about this song as I do about Bob Dylan's Masters of War."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Well we all know this album is amazing.

Still it is hard to understand most of the examples that are presented in this book. The explanations are short and superficial. This is defenitly not a good book for students.

Comprehension of this subject is clearly essential for the good software engineer. Mr. Rosen exhibits a special skill in letting the unsuspecting student immediately fall down the old pedagogical rabbit hole where, like Alice in Wonderland, we're bewildered by cerebral cul-de-sacs, awash in incontrovertible inconsistencies, served a panoply of unsolveable puzzles, with a peppering of paradoxes for good measure.

Immediately after reading The Black Swan, I took it and threw it in the nearest trash can. The story of a little girl getting therapy from a swan may be cute but did not transpire into any lasting change. It was like listening to a friend's horrendous story of neglect, abuse and abandonment and then suggesting she \\"find her center.\\" Most of what the swan offers as help, is New Age psychobabble. If you are not into New Age philosophy you will hate this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Black Swan: The Twelve Lessons of Abandonment Recovery","review":"It is wonderful when the therapeutic \\"recipe\\" is a give away in a book.

I think this book and it's lessons would be a comfort to most people who have been wounded in their childhoods."},{"rating":"2","title":"Black Swan","review":"Excellent book. I highly recommend the book. The book is written through a child's experience. It's a great way to illustrate the hurt, pain, one feels when abandoned.

I think the book would also be a great tool for children old enough to understand it's contents."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Story to Illustrate the 12 Lessons","review":"I was under the impression that this was a book discussing abandonment recovery; however, this is the story of a little girl abandoned in the woods by her father.

I've traveled with Brits and had to go through the \\"America Bashing\\" which is nothing like his \\"British Bashing--after the fact\\". The only positive thing in the book was he spelled \\"Maasai\\" correctly. I won't buy another book about humorous trips in Africa, because I'd be afraid they would write like him.

Very thin plastic and it only throws the ball back about 2-3 inches, maybe. I tried it on more than one plug in. Maybe I got a lemon, not worth my time to waste gas and spend money on the postage to return it, even if Amazon did offer to pay for it. I can't believe Amazon would let such a company sell this product on their web site. Surely, somebody tested it. Maybe not and maybe that's why the price was so low.

If you are the type of person who can learn from a book, the dance step diagrams will work for you. There are three Zumba routines in the book. The idea is to learn the steps, memorize the routine and timing, then follow along with the DVD. However, the DVD is basically a music CD with a huge timer, no instructor and no indication of what step you are supposed to be doing. I found an error right away: the first song on the DVD, a merengue, does not have a corresponding routine in the book. I emailed [...] to let them know and asked if they could provide the routine. After 6 days I have not heard from them. Overall, I really love the music and have learned the steps enough to do my own routine to the DVD. My health club only offers one Zumba class per week.

One reviewer stated that this was a minor inconvenience. In my opinion it's more than a minor inconvenience, it's dangerous, as another reviewer found out. If you're not there to manually eject the tape, the motor keeps on running which causes an overheating condition.

This so-called prep completely neglects the Quantitative Reasoning (math) section of the PCAT: its practice tests lack ANY calculus or pre-calc problems (50% of the 2006 PCAT's QR section!). Even if you're a math whiz who doesn't need any review, this book misrepresents the content of the 2006 PCAT.Also, the book contains only a handful of diagnostic tests and 2 practice PCATs -- the remaining 100 pages is a cursory guide to pharmacy school, info anyone planning to take the PCAT already knows. The only PCAT guide out now that even attempts to cover the material on the new PCAT is the (not so great) Kaplan's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great music, very poor sound quality","review":"I love Pugliese and it is very sad to have to listen to it this way. The quality is incredibly poor. It sounds horrible.

It's a series of races to get trophies for. It's not a file game either so once he beats it, that's it. He can rerace but no trophies are available. This game's better for PlayStation, GameCube & Xbox. We'll be getting the GameCube in a few months & I plan to buy the Cars game for it. If you want this game for the Gameboy Advance, you're wasting your money. Get a different game for your child."},{"rating":"1","title":"This game is not popular with my 9 year old","review":"We just bought this game and want to warn others that the set up is just awful. You're guiding cars from the side, rather than from the back, so you can't see what direction to turn. My 9 year old who is fairly adept can't stand it. He also mentioned that he watched the advertisements for the Game Cube version of Cars, and it showed the race occurring from behind, so your POV is of the road ahead of you. So, I don't know what happened, but the Gameboy Advance SP game is an exercise in frustration for one child .... (He advised 2 stars for overall just because the subject was racing ... but I think the fun factor was in teh zero range based on his narrow-eyed demand of Can we return it?)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cars game","review":"My son loves this game.

And the prologue and first chapter or two were right up that line. Then it devolved into a series of mostly unrelated short stories that, with one exception, weren't very interesting (either standalone or in the context of the greater story). And the \\"glue\\" that held them together was repetitious and pretty boring -- this being the journey of St. Vidicon down the mouth of the beast and the ongoing relationship between Tony and Sandy. I did, however, like the final story where the alien conspiracy group took the TV studio hostage.Stasheff could have done so much more with this idea, and the book falls flat."},{"rating":"1","title":"ouch...","review":"This book was a horrible disappointment.It initially sounds interesting: A wanna be Saint and his assistant help people that are having technical problems, and for his help the Saint advises the assistant in his love life. Interesting, right?The reality is more confusing than interesting.First of all is the problem with it is the book's flow. It's more like a series of short stories about the same general characters. There is almost no transition between the assistant's real life and his battles against a variety of technological demons, added to the fact that the fights themselves are more confusing than interesting.The aspect of the story that talks about the assistant and his relationship to his girlfriend is confusing as well.So does he do it or not (you'll understand of you read the book)?Besides, how good of advice about your love life would a celibate Catholic Priest give?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark and Sexy","review":"This is the type of album that you just put on, close your eyes, and space out.

Can you believe she made a specific request for that CD? Not any of the popular music, but the one that reminded her of her mother and her peace and spiritual center.

Although most rock recordings heard on the radio today could be written and recorded in a couple of weeks, this is a production of several years. I think that the original version of \\"wasted\\" was better (probably just because I became attached to the first PSC song I heard), but that every other track is well worth the buy. The quality of the recording is perfect and is almost as fun as seeing them live.

You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISPOSABLE","review":"Being a fan of the Rustic Overtones, I was excited to hear about the prospect that the key architects (Dave Gutter and Jon Roods) had a new band and decided to continue to make music. That excitement quickly faded as soon as I put PSC's self-titled CD in my player. The soul-inflected organic sound of RO has apparently give way to music that's over-produced through Pro Tools and processed to death. However, that's probably the least of their problems; The songwriting is just plain terrible, with songs on the album sounding like bad, incomplete demos. The songs sound like Dave Gutter just took a few bong hits, scribbled a few notes with lyrics and called it a day.Need proof? \\"Wasted\\" is just brain-numbingly awful. Do we really need another song about the glories of getting drunk?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Are You Kidding?","review":"This isn't a new album from them... its the same songs on their last albums... its kind of a joke how they remixed the same songs and then call it a new album.

I'm not saying that this is a bad DVD, but it hasn't worked for us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful for speech delayed toddlers also!!!","review":"My 2 1/2 year old was speech delayed but when I got Baby Babble 1 he loved it. It took him a couple more views to start to copy what they say or do but he has improved from how he used to be. He makes more consonants and vowels sounds. He's not quite saying sentences but at least we got a few words in.

I read the reviews and so many people loved the video. My son is 2 and has autism. This video does keep his interest, but is low quality. It is very low budget. Not that it matters when it comes to something that keeps your child's interest and is educational at the same time. He doesn't seem to mind watching it, but I don't care for it myself. He also hasn't picked up any language or sounds from watching it. I hope this helps...."},{"rating":"2","title":"speech-delayed no more!","review":"Our 25 month-old grandson was considered speech delayed and was set for his first pediatric speech therapist appointment after being assessed by one. We researched DVD's to help him and found Baby Babble. The fact that it's written and produced by pediatric speech pathologists, and some of the reviews were so encouraging, we tried them. He barely spoke when he began watching Baby Babble and after five days with both Baby Babble DVDs and working with him as suggested in the parent tutorial, he added at least 25 words. He LOVES to watch Baby Babble and now, just over a month later, says every word on the DVDs and more!

I have a speech therapist for my son and she laughed at this video. These two women do things you easily can (and I'm sure already are) doing with your child at home with toys and sounds.

Every baby is different but I would not recommend this dvd at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"my daughter is addicted","review":"hi,I got this for my 2 year old daughter who was just not speaking besides saying 2-3 words. She instantly LOVED the video and follows along really well before this, anything that i would put on, she would get bored...it really does captivate the mind of your two year old... Her vocab has improved a little and what i really like is that they focus on sounds instead of words....like the sounds of vowels..a e i o u...and they also make different facial expressions that my daughter imitates right away...so i highly recommend it,... i just wish they had a VHS version *YES* i know because she keeps on opening the DD player and playing with the disc and has put scratches on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT FOR LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENT","review":"WE HAVE A 24 MONTH SPEECH DELAYED DAUGHTER WITH A LIMITED VOCABULARY.

We have watched it 3 times already and he has picked up a few more sounds and words from it. It keeps his attention and he actually looks like his little mind is working up a storm! This DVD has also helped me to realize what I was doing wrong when I try to teach him something. Baby Babble has taught me to break things down to a more simple and understanding way to teach my son. Before, I would try to over-do things for him and I think that is why he would get frustrated and give up. I suppose it is hard for adults to remember a time when we didn't know what \\"up\\" or \\"down\\" meant. I would recommend this DVD for any young child (and parent!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing...","review":"I ordered this DVD on the recommendation of my child's doctor to help her with her late talking. Although it was modeled after the Baby Einstein videos but created by speech pathologists, I found it really disappointing.The quality is *lousy* and the music absmyal. My 18 month old was scared of the video at times and I think it had to do with the sound and music. The speech pathologist was somewhat severe during the demonstrations of the sign language and I found that offputting.We are much happier with the \\"My Baby Can Talk\\" videos and my daughter was much more responsive to them. The \\"My Baby Can Talk\\" videos is succeeds where this video fails and my daughter started doing some of the signs from it the second day of watching. I also found the parent information much more useful than the Baby Babble video."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked for my son","review":"This video really works! My son is talking a little late and has some trouble with pronunciation as well. This video has my son making many new sounds and also saying a few new words.

My daughter is 18 months and is slow with her speech. She only says about 5 words, but after we got her this video for Christmas she has started with more words and sign language. The parent tutorial included on the DVD is excellent as well and helps my husband and I work with our daughter independently on increasing her speech. The video also keeps her interest through the entire thing. We also got her \\"Baby Wordsworth\\" by Baby Einstein and she only will watch that for a few minutes before loosing interest. I highly recommend it for not only slow speakers, but for all children."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"Really low budget dvd...I can't believe this sells for $15!

I agree that it is not of the same quality as the Baby Einstein series. I thought it was a cheap rip-off of the Baby Einsteins. THe music and lighting could definitely be better.

But my son just doesn't like it. In the DVD, just two women pronounce a few sounds and words when moving toys around. They may be language experts but how can my son learn from them if the DVD can't attract him.I actually found my son likes Disney's cartoons a lot.

The parent section has 12 helpful points for helping your baby talk. The 3rd section is some basic signs, its short and ok.The main section is where the baby is supposed to be helped talking. It is a very boring, sterile, low budget toy advertisement. Many of the segments don't make any sense at all. Mostly showing a closeup of some toy with Fisherprice logo prominently displayed for no particular reason. The speech pathologists are completely stone faced during the entire video. It is painful to watch.Some of the segment focuses more on language than speech, ie trying to convey the concept of in and out. But rather than use a simple container and placing something in and taking it out, they have some bizarre complex toy where you drop a ball and it meanders around some obstacles to illustrate \\"in\\". Very confusing.This is one time I really wished I could have seen an excerpt before I bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed..","review":"this dvd isnt what i expected from 2 pathologists.it isnt organized and of no substance.I am so disappointed.(sigh)."},{"rating":"1","title":"My son refuses to watch this :(","review":"We ordered both Baby Babble DVDs for my 16 month old son.

My husband, having majored in Psychology, was in stitches after watching only 5 minutes of this video. My son was looking at us as if wanting to ask \\"what is this?\\". He had no interest in watching it.To call this video \\"Speech Enhancing\\" is ridiculous. This is a combination of what parents can do ( making sounds for their babies as young as 2 months) and baby Einstein , only non-cohesive. Also, the color quality of the objects and the overall DVD-Quality were horrible.I would challenge any parent to at least give other similar videos a try.

My 2 year old daughter who is a late-talker loves to watch this DVD and giggles whenever watching it. My 6 months old daughter who is already quite a chatterbox watches it full of smiles and interest. I'd highly recommend this DVD to any parent with late-talkers as well as other babies/toddlers because it really simplifies sounds and provides babies with a chance to repeat and learn various sounds like \\"baba\\" \\"dada\\" \\"ball in-out\\" \\"up/down\\" \\"peek-a-boo\\" etc. It is not as polished like the Baby Einstein series but because it isn't, it seems more easily interpreted by babies.

We've had them since he was about 18 months, and he's nearly two now. He still doesn't talk, but he loves his Baby Babble DVDs. We tend to leave the television on for background noise during the day, but Baby Babble is just about the only program that will catch his attention and even be able to hold it for the whole length of the video. In addition, he's definitely picking up some of the simple sign language they use (hungry, tired, etc). While speech comprehension isn't the primary aim of this program, my son's comprehension seems to be greatly improved by watching these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quite what I was expecting","review":"Somewhat unprofessionally done- lots of shadows. It is sometimes hard to see what the speaker is signing due to the angle of the camera and the lighting.Many sequences are very very close- almost to the point of ripoff- to Baby Einstein videos. Same type toys, same bodiless hand doing the shape sorter, etc. only not as crisp or as well done as Baby Einstein.My baby is only 9 months old, so perhaps her interest in this video will increase, but I can say that she is incredibly interested in \\"My Baby Can Talk\\" which is a similar style sign language video."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic learning video!","review":"Although this video seems \\"rustic\\" compared to other videos on the market, my son probably learned more to help his speech delay from this video than any other.

Better than Baby Einstein!","review":"My son is 18 months and not talking. I just bought this video after reading the positive reviews. I had been using the Baby Einstein videos to hopefully encourage speech, but nothing.

I checked out books for myself from the local library and purchased this video. This video is very entertaining for the child but has a wealth of instruction for the parent. I have recently ordered Baby Babble 2 and can not wait to receive it. My husband and my parents have noticed the advancements my little boy has made. He loves the video and is making all kinds of sounds and new words. These ladys also have a website with lots of helpful information! I highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recommend to all","review":"I love the Baby Babble video. I have a 2 year old grandson that has started talking since this video fell into our hands about a month ago. My grandson had alot of complications after birth which caused him to progress slowly in all developmental areas. We thought he would never start talking. Thanks to this video which was introduced to us through a speech therapist, my grandson has reached his goals now for his age and now is using two word phrases. I highly recommend this video to all parents."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for us","review":"I was excited for a speech enhancing program. But this one is not a good buy, as it's not for my baby. She is not speech delayed. She is rather speaking very well at 15 months. I wanted to make her speech stronger. I think that Einstein DVDs are much better and more fun. It's too boring and slow for her age. However, if I bought it at 3 months, I would have thought better of it because newborns enjoys quiet things like these more than toddlers. Anyway, i should be a good purchase if you have a speech delayed kid who likes watching quiet and boring videos lol. It's also OVERPRICED. I feel sorry for the money I paid for international shipping. :-s"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really worth the money","review":"I bought this dvd thinking it would enhance my 5 month old daughter's vocalization even though it seemed a bit expensive. She mostly just coos now with an occasional consonant. We had already begun signing for her since she was about 3 months old. I was really excited after reading all the reviews but this dvd just does not hold her attention at all. She would much rather watch her Brainy Baby video. I truly believe in signing to help babies communicate, though. I've seen it in action with my nieces. However, I recommend just getting a baby signs book and engaging in some conversation with your baby. Then, get a Brainy Baby video for entertainment. Please note that both were VERY cheaply made. It's just people manipulating toys to some background music. But at least the Brainy Baby allows me to get some housework done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheaply made home video","review":"I could do the same. This is boring for me. My baby has shown no interest in it either.Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor","review":"Poor quality both visually and with the sound. The exercises are beneficial though, especially if you incorporate other objects around your house.This video is more useful if you interact with it rather than just leave the video on it's own. The facial expressions scared my son at first. I wish they had smiled more. I would really love this video if just a tad more effort had been put into the quality.I do recommend The Baby Society video. My son loved that!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just talk to and play with your kids!","review":"Really less than one star! Please people, don't buy any more videos. Take your kids to the park, on a walk, read with them, play in the bathtub with them, anything. Talk to them and enjoy them and they will talk back. No more silly Baby Einstiens and the rest. How about crayons, and side walk chalk, and blocks. Just be with your kids. Give them your full attention when you are there. You don't need these viedeos and \\"smart\\" products!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Best for babies under 8 mths.","review":"After introducing \\"Baby Signing Time\\" to my little one at the age of 4 months, this DVD was very slow and boring for her now at 12 mths. It's not very musical nor \\"happy\\" at all. Really very serious. The woman making the vocal noises (like the soung of a Fire Truck or just bu bu bu) never smiles and the DVD is by no means fun. Even the sign language is very seriouse with no smiles, laughter or music. In my opinion, NOT what babies need.Baby Signing Time with Rachel Coleman is absolutely full with songs and music while showing the signs and that makes it easy to keep babies attention. It's thanks to the Signing Time DVD's that at 12 months my little one signs over 20 signs, showing me what she thinks, wants and how she feels.In a nutshell...Buy Baby Signing Time instead!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't believe the hype","review":"After reading all the excellent reviews I purchased this for my 2yo son. His vocabulary is limited and I was looking for anything that could help. He was interested for about a minute and then went to play with his legos. The video quality is very poor and does nothing to hold a child's interest. Anyone could make this video with a camcorder and some colorful toys.Not impressed at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont Waste your money!!","review":"I usually dont write reviews but thought I would try to save others from wasting there money!!! This dvd stinks!! I dont see how making a stuffed animal make noise teaches kids anything.

Very disappointed and I dont know how it had such good reviews."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great learning tool for Babies/Toddlers","review":"I got this for my grandson...who has speech delays.

I was horrified by how bad it was. The DVD is such low quality it looks like it was transferred from an 80's homemade video. It's extremely random with continuously changing shots of toys and people making various sounds. It doesn't stay in one place long enough for a child to absorb and practice the sound before moving on 30 seconds later to another sound. I can't imagine that I'll play this DVD again and I'll just chalk it up to a waste of money on something that isn't even worth 50 cents at a thrift store. It's bizarre how bad this video is!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Low quality product","review":"Unfortunately, I completely agree with the other critical reviews on Amamzon. This is camcorder-quality product, with little content, mostly plastic toys being moved around together with a few repetitive sounds like choo choo.. although I really wanted to find educative value in this, I failed to find any. I bought that video when my son was 11 moths old. He was almost as bored as Mom. He's never liked it and, at 20 months, has now totally outgrown it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for speech!","review":"My two year old had double ear infections for the first year and a half of his life which made him delayed in speech by a few months. Our speech pathologist recommended the Baby Babble DVD's to me.WOW!!! My son automatically started repeating sounds and words from the movie.There is a lot of repitition and fun objects to get the kids talking. This is a great DVD and I would tell everyone (actually I have told everyone) to get for their babies and toddlers. I LOVE IT!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Autistic Children","review":"My nephew was diagnosed with Autism this past Spring so I put together an Autism care package for my brother and his wife.They are young parents still trying to find their way in life and I live so far away I wanted to do something for them so this is what I came up with. In addition to a subscription to a magazine for parents of Autistic children, I sent them these:Toilet Training for Individuals with Autism or Other Developmental Issues, 2nd EditionTen Things Every Child with Autism Wishes You Knew1001 Great Ideas for Teaching and Raising Children with Autism or Asperger's, Revised and Expanded 2nd EditionBaby Babble - Speech-Enhancing DVD for Babies and ToddlersMy sister in law was very appreciative and said they were helpful.[...] Thanks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Daughter hates it!","review":"I understand the methods used in this DVD, but it is very simple and boring in my opinion. The biggest problem I have is my daughter just gets spooked out with the women in the DVD. She crys EVERY time she sees the women in some certain scenes. I do not mean to be rude or disrespectful to the women in this DVD. I am simply saying they scare my daughter. At first she started screaming when the one women appeared like a ghost out of nowhere with a black back ground on the screen making a weird humming noice. I ran into the room and played back what she had seen and could understand why. It was creepy in my opinion. I then put something else on and she was fine. One hour later is when I ran the test to see if the DVD is truly frightening her. Yes, they just spook her out. This is just not for my daughter. Again, no disrespect to the makers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for kids that are just begining to talk","review":"I would highly recommend this DVD; I got it for my 2&1/2 month old. at the time she would say a few words here and there. When she first saw the DV, she didn't seem interested but after a few tries she picked up a lot of sounds and signs. Now she has a vocabulary of 50 words and enjoys watching the baby babble...imitates a lot of sounds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing and frightened my 16-month old","review":"I bought this video in hopes of jumpstarting my 16-month old's speech. I should have paid more attention to the reviews that said the speech therapist was \\"severe\\" and somewhat \\"scary\\". She is. She wears a black turtleneck on a black background, so she looks like a floating head. But not a joyful floating head. A scary one that makes strange noises and facial expressions. It even made me uncomfortable. The production value also looked cheap compared to other DVDs like My Baby Can Talk. The lighting, color and art direction was bad. I had to turn off the video after five minutes because my child had this frightened look on her face and started to cling to me, and I don't blame her.The only reason why I give it 2 stars instead of 1 is because I understand the value of it for speech delayed toddlers who may not be so sensitive, but beware if you child is the sensitive type."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product for speech delayed children","review":"Our son was about 10 months delayed in speech when we bought him this video. He was a little over 2 years old. He loved watching the video, and he started to say all the words within a matter of days. He would say the words on the video before the narrator would even say them. It was music to our ears. He watched this video until he was about 3. Then he didn't really have any interest because the video was beneath his level. At 3, he was about 6 months behind in speech. Now he is 4 and he is at an age appropriate level. We tried many other speech videos when he was two, and it was hard to find one that kept his interest enough to watch it. This was the only video we could find that he watched and learned from. You can't go wrong with the speech tool. My second son is starting to watch it at 9 months and I don't think he is delayed. But, it doesn't hurt to watch it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Try this video!","review":"I wish I had found this video a while ago. My son was watching Baby Einsteins and then Brainy Baby videos. They are very entertaining, and Brainy Baby Left Brain and Right Brain are very educational and engaging too. Baby Babble has added something missing from our video collection and my son loves it. The two therapists focus on speech production with focusing on their mouth, movement and placement of lips and tongue too. Also, they add sounds of the toys that you see, and the toys are very visual and educational. My son is speech delayed and within four days of watching this video, everyday at least once a day, he added five new phrases to his vocabulary and learned to stick his tongue out and be more aware of his own mouth. He requests this video every day, and I would encourage anyone with a child with speech delay to try this video. I think it is very well done and the video is clear and professionally made. I'm glad we found this video. I would also recommend Braincandy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the best quality but worth the money spent","review":"I agree with some of the reviews where the quality is not as good as say Baby Einstein videos, however, I still recommend this video for children just learning to speak or with speech delay. My two year old son was not frightened by the woman in the black turtleneck although I agree that the facial expressions are pretty bland. I love the tips on helping your child with speech and language at the end of the DVD. My son is already trying to make new sounds since watching for only a few days. The video has given us new ideas on helping our son progress with his speech and language development. Hope this review helps those that are on the fence about purchasing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful for ALL children, especially families with children who have Apraxia","review":"My son was diagnosed with Apraxia (he isn't able to connect his thoughts and verbalize them) which caused a lot of stress in our household due to problems communicating. Even though he was nearly 3 years old, his vocabulary was at best that of a 1 year old. After watching this video a couple of times, he started mimicking the sounds and copying the signs. It brought almost instant relief to our family. Suddenly my son was letting us know when he wanted something to eat or drink by signing rather than whining while we guessed what he wanted. I strongly suggest this video to all parents...even if an infant can start to pick up on the signs which he/she can use long before \\"speech\\" is expected."},{"rating":"1","title":"speech enhancing DVD's","review":"As a parent of a child with autism and speech delays who is 6 I have purchased and veiwed several of the language enhancing dvd's. This is the most disappointing. This one is very expensive for the quality you get. It does not hold my son's attention, and my 18 month old hates it. She runs into another room. It is poorly made. I would recommend the following over it :Talking Hands , My Baby can Talk -First Signs, and any of the Baby Bumble Bee Dvd's. These are well done and they have helped my son learned to talk. He started talking at age three from watching Talking Hands.To get your money's worth I recommend buying one of those instead of this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great interactive and fun learning tool!","review":"I received this video as a gift when our son was one year old. He is now 20 months old and continues to love this video!!! I love how interactive the video is. We often watch it as a family and imitate the sounds and actions we hear and see. I personally learned a lot from the parent tutorial and strongly believe this video has helped in the development of our sons speech. I often will see him mimic the actions, sounds, and concepts that are so vividly projected in this video in his everyday play. I highly recommend this video for every child."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality; very little worth...","review":"This is my third and last time writing a review for this item. The last two have been erased by the staff at amazon, although I don't know why.My wife bought Baby Babble for our daughter (21 months old) to help her along with speaking.There is very little in this video to aid in talking. Many of the expressions of the women (Speech Pathologists) in the video are either almost scarry or just plain bizarre. The quality of the video is very \\"camcorder like\\". We've got the entire series of DVD's of just about everything out there for a child, but I never thought any were cheap/poor quality until I saw this one.During the video you will see: A stoic woman sticking her tongue out; rolling her tongue; slurping followed by a cheap toy suspended by a string with no attempt to hide it.There are a few signs that they teach within the dvd, like how to sign, \\"thank you\\", or \\"drink\\", but there couldn't be more than 10 the entire dvd.This video IS NOT WORTH IT!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"OUTDATED AND ALMOST UNWATCHABLE","review":"I bought both Baby Babble and Brainy Baby because of the high reviews here on Amazon and I cant believe it was rated so high. My cousin recommended Baby Einstein, and I was ready to buy it here on Amazon, but when I read the reviews of Baby Babble and Brainy Baby I decided to go with this instead. WHAT A MISTAKE!!!Baby Babble arrived first and I couldn't wait to pop it in the DVD for my daughter. My wife and I watched Baby Babble together with our daughter and we were extremely disappointed. The toys used are outdated. The expressions used by the people in the video are so bland that they are almost scary (seriously)! I don't recommend this video to anyone.Brainy Baby however arrived later and we are pleased with this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"Good idea but the quality and presentation is poor in comparison to the other dvds my daughter has. I recommend My Baby Can Talk and Brainy Baby instead as they have vibrant images and pleasant presenters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Baby Babble review","review":"I do like the Baby Babble video! I liked the talking and speech part the best. I bought it for my 7 month old who is not yet saying consenants. The only thing I dislike is yet another copy of Einstien videos where they put on every day toys onto a video for your infant/toddler to stare at. I have every day toys at home and she can stare at those all day long.. I want and are looking for useful skills that a proffesioal can teach me and my child. The teaching part in this video is very fun and great! The women could be more animated, kids relate to that. I really think Baby Babble is a GREAT video and they give lots of helpful hints at the end! I do reccomend the video to all parents."},{"rating":"2","title":"Baby Babble is a great value.","review":"I ordered Baby Babble after my peditrician became worried that my 15 month-old daughter was not speaking many words. After having watched the video with her a dozen times now, I have noticed increased vocalizations from her. She becomes very excited when she sees the beginning of the video starting, and loves to watch the various toys on the screen. Think of Baby Babble as \\"Baby Einstein with words and speech sounds.\\" Instead of just staring at the Baby Einstein videos, babies and children hear words and sounds, and are encouraged to interact."},{"rating":"2","title":"better than baby einstein","review":"This is basically baby einstein but they talk about what they are doing.

Also, it has been helpful for my 2 year old with speech delays, too. The video gives a good bases for beginning speech teaching how to make sounds by the speech pathologists. Another good DVD is Baby Einstein's First Signs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Baby Babble - Speach- Enhancing DVD for toddlers","review":"This video is expensive compared to other videos for entertaining children but I didn't buy it to entertain I bought to help teach and was greatly gratified to see my 12 month old grand-daughter sitting cross-legged before the T.V. fascinated with the close-up pictures of toys which I now neither have to buy nor operate. She also watched with great interest the pictures of how the speaker shapes her mouth and where the speaker puts her tongue. This little girl has no trouble talking, but I sent it to a toddler who doesn't talk and was told that he too appreciated it and made efforts to repeat the words. This video gives the rare pleasure of feeling that one's money has been well spent, and a little child's time in front of a T.V. has been beneficial.

We played it the day it came for our son who is 28 months a has a limited vocabulary. Since then he has watched it a handful of times with each time participating more and more.

We were so excited with the fast results, we just ordered Part 2 and can't wait to get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Our 1 year old LOVES it!","review":"We have a ton of Baby Einstein DVDs which sometimes entertain our 1 year old. We got this DVD for the \\"babbling\\" aspect of it and our son absolutely LOVES it! With any other video, he will watch it for about 2 minutes, but he actually stands in front of the dvd player and watches the entire video of it! He babbles and imitates the signs that he knows! It's amazing, I just wish they had other DVDs to buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It worked for us and we recommend it!","review":"If your child is speech delayed this is a great DVD to try to help him or her along. From the first time I played it, my son enjoyed the DVD, it made him laugh, and he began to increase his vocabulary. I've seen a few reviews that compared the quality of this DVD to Baby Einstein or the appearance of the individuals appearing in Baby Babble. The bottom line is this, it's about helping your child enhance language skills. If it holds his or her attention and it works, the quality is besides the point. And its important to consider that the appearance of the women in this program are focusing on facial expressions to help language not to attract attention to themselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for little ones with speech delay","review":"I have a 20 month old that has been struggling with her speech.

This, of course, doesn't take place of parental interaction, but is great material for parents to use supplementally. I sit and watch with him and make sounds along with the exercises.

The unit does rewind slow, so no time savings having to hold the lid closed while it rewinds a tape, with even pressure I might add, so you don't destroy the tape. Good looking unit, but rather flimsy. It is also telling that there are no replacements or exchanges offered on this item, just a refund. Is that due to the seller it came from? Don't know.

And last, but certainly not least, you have such gems of description as \\"nonmammalian eyes.\\" If this is the kind of literature that makes you laugh your a** off, then by all means, give it a whirl; otherwise, steer clear."},{"rating":"2","title":"A gourmet's delight!","review":"What a wonderful book. The author is obviously highly intelligent and a great lover."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Author just quit","review":"This book had an interesting premise but three-quarters of the way through the book, the author just seemed to tire of it and ran out of ideas to end it. Felt like a cop-out ending. Very disappointed in what started out as a exciting book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought-provoking","review":"When I started this novel, I was uncertain of what to expect. By the third chapter, I could not put it down. The characters were well-developed and the plot so imaginative, that I still find myself thinking about this book now, weeks after I finished reading it. I highly recommend this novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"1 degree of separation","review":"In a philosophy in which the city of the dead is made up of only those for whom someone is alive to remember, what happens when there's only person left alive? An intriguing story with multiple perspectives, this book explores the idea of how many people one person comes in contact with over a lifetime. There would have been five stars for this book if the ending had been less drawn-out and ambiguous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Author stumbles right before the finish line...","review":"This is a very unusual book with an intriguing premise. I very much enjoyed the way the first 3/4 of the book...as others have said, the characters are really well-drawn and the author did a great job of interweaving the story of the dead with the story of the last living human being on earth. But the book falls completely flat at the end - it really feels like the author didn't know himself where he wanted to take the story, so he meandered a while and then just - ended it. It's intriguing enough that it's worth reading, just don't be shocked by the dull ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read it... you won't be dissappointed","review":"The most thoughtful and articulate book I have read in a long time. I was compelled to turn each page.Mr Brockmeier, you have done well..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent short story, exhausting novel","review":"After the 1st couple of chapters, I got the concept of the novel and was curious to see where the author would take it. Upon reading the last page, I found out he only took it as far as the first couple of chapters.This book is exhausting, having little exploration or depth to an idea or theme. Instead, the Brockmeier just repeats ideas over and over again, without digging deep into the characters. One of the characters, Minny, feels like she'll never know anyone deeply or intimately. At the end of the read, I felt the same way about the characters in the book or the themes.Do yourself a favor if you want to read this: don't buy, get it from the library, read the first 50 pages, and then promptly quit.Originally this was a short story and would have held up well by itself. However, since there's more money in selling novels than stories, they had to publish the thing that drug on and on...like the protoganist's endless hike through the snow."},{"rating":"1","title":"What just happened?","review":"I saw the cover for this book when a friend of mine was reading it. The title was intriguing and after reading the synopsis I just knew I had to read this book. What a let down. The title and the idea behind the book are the best things about it. There is essential no plot. Interesting things happen. The arduous journey through the Antartic was interesting and I got involved with that character while reading about it. But I couldn't help but feel cheated after spending time reading half a book with a bad ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haunting idea","review":"This is one of those books I give to friends as presents. Not just one haunting idea but two - a girl struggling through the Arctic, last survivor of a plague on Earth, and an unearthly limbo city where the dead go until everyone on the planet has forgotten them. It asks profound questions about how we keep people alive in our memories, and this is enacted and dramatised beautifully with the device of the girl's memories which keep the people in the limbo city alive. Stunning. If you like fiction that leaves your soul stirred you'll love this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gorgeous Concept","review":"I read the short story beginning of this book (I think it was the first chapter intact, actually) awhile ago in The New Yorker and have been waiting for the novel ever since. Brockmeier's city of the dead is a fascinating place, and the possibilies he touches on are, without exception, compelling and even plausible. Readers who are hoping for a fast-paced genre novel will likely be disappointed here. It dwells not on the futuristic elements of the story, nor on the apocalyptic ones (thoough both of these things are interesting elements) but on the nature of endurance, love, and why we want to stay alive - even if we're dead already. This book is more in line with a work like Marilynne Robinson's Gilead, or with some of the poems of W.S. Merwin, rather than with anything Asimov. The writing is gorgeous, and Brockmeier's meditation on death, and ultimately on the meaning of life and of the number of lives that we touch (even inadvertently) is moving."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I got the book based on two enthusiastic reviews. It starts well, but loses its way. It has a very interesting premise that is never developed. It becomes a series of short stories attempting to be held together by the link of the woman in Antartica. I'm not sure what the author was trying to do or what the story was trying to say. Perhaps we all live on only so long as our contemporaries exist to remember us. Again, an interesting story concept that was unexecuted and undeveloped."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deeply disappointing","review":"The premise is intriguing, and the first few chapters start off good, but the book soon gets bogged down in various threads, all of which are, frankly, uninteresting. I had the urge to skim and read ahead to see if things got interesting again. Sadly, they never did. The dark, nearly depressing tone did not help matters either, made all the worse by the fact that there is no real connection to any of the characters. All in all, this feels like a decent short story that was stretched in a dull, drawn-out novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as I was led to believe","review":"I picked up this book based on recommendations and good reviews that were posted here. I was greatly disappointed. I had a lot of difficulty I getting through this book which seemed like a poor imitation of Richard Matheson's \\"What Dreams May Come.\\" The author of this book must have read that book first to get his ideas for this book but he did a poor job of trying to put a different spin about places beyond death. I suggest reading Matheson's book instead which is excellent!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Not Brief Enough History of the Dead","review":"I read the promising reviews and found the story's premise interesting, but what a let down. I eagerly read the first few chapters and then discovered that the author really didn't have much more to say. Oh, he kept building his characters into what should have become some sort of crescendo, but sadly there was none, and the plot simply fizzled out and died. On the last twenty pages or so, I found myself skipping over whole paragraphs in a vain search for something interesting to happen. I couldn't wait for the main character to die so I could finally understand the ultimate reality the author, no doubt, was going to reveal in the end. It seems the author simply got tired of rambling on about the characters and decided to hastily bail out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dhalgren Meets White Plague","review":"Reminds me of a hybrid between Delany's \\"Dhalgren\\" and Herbert's \\"White Plague\\" with a lot of metaphysical, existential matter stuffed inbetween. Don't read this book if you're looking for other-worldly sci fi action because the words don't flow smoothly enough for that. I found myself chugging along, plodding through this book waiting for something exciting to happen. Maybe it was just the narrator of the audiobook that I found tedious. Maybe you just have to be in the mood to think deep thoughts about the significance of the blind man, the city, and Laura Byrd. I wasn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well written, well conceived, but deeply depressing","review":"I don't have any new critique of this novel to add but I want to mention that several of the themes and certainly the ending, have left me feeling deeply sad and hopeless. I was drawn in by the first few chapters and an admiration for the creative undertaking. The last quarter of the book is perhaps the most depressing thing I've ever read -- not something I typically walk away with from a book. Maybe not a good book to take on if you're not in the mood."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting premise, dull story","review":"The problem with this book isn't with the writing, it's just that the writing is not good enough to sustain a complete lack of tension in the plot. The ultimate fate of all of the characters becomes clear more or less after about 10 pages. And the characters themselves are not very interesting. Flashbacks galore, but very dull. The little blurb at the beginning that explains the basic idea of an intermediate kind of heaven for people who still exist in the memories of the living is about as interesting as it gets. But Brockmeier doesn't do anything with it, I'm afraid."},{"rating":"1","title":"From Great to Ghastly","review":"Maybe ghastly's too strong, but progressing from a riveting start to a dismally open-ended finish was quite a letdown. The premise of the story was fascinating and its delivery was skillful. This was a page-turner that had me halfway through the book the first night. One part of the story, involving a religious zealot/prophet, totally lost me and I ended up skipping that chapter. I should have known it was prophetic and stopped there. The telling of the tale and the increasing tie-in between the two \\"worlds\\" progresses quite well through most of the book but the last two or three chapters are more and more \\"out there\\", tedious, and ultimately very disappointing. I'm not sure what the resolution could be, but I was distinctly dissatisfied with what I felt to be an open-ended letdown of an ending. Because it was a quick, short read I don't have to regret a big time investment but I still feel betrayed by a terrible ending; or should I say, \\"non-ending\\"?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fantasy with little redeeming value.","review":"The book never pulled things together- it was like a loosely related short story collection. I was expecting an ending with the Coca-Cola cover-up gathering up all the loose ends, but the ends remained loose and truncated. I also didn't need to look up a single word in the dictionary so I learned nothing new- no new words, no new facts, no new culture, just an unbelievable idea of what happens when we die. Fantasy. There is too much out there to waste my time reading without gaining something from a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"dull and boring with random characters","review":"This is one of the poorest reads I've sledged through in a while. Random loosely related characters, with little depth, and a silly imaginative plot line that has many logical inconsistencies. The concept could have been handled with a one chapter short story, but instead drags endlessly on. Well almost endlessly -- thank you for finally dying, Ms. Byrd, and putting us all out of our misery."},{"rating":"1","title":"I started skimming at page 114...","review":"I don't know what I was expecting. I read the review in Newsweek, and I guess I was expecting excitement on the order of a Resident Evil movie: plagues, undead, single survivor, etc. However, instead of \\"Resident Evil: Apocolypse\\" I got \\"Dull and Duller.\\" It's two stories intertwined and neither one is terribly interesting. I must confess that I skimmed through the last half of the book looking for something interesting to happen. As far as I could tell, nothing interesting ever happened. I just finished \\"The Kite Runner\\" which was the best book I've read in the last five years. If you're looking for a really great read, buy a copy of \\"The Kite Runner.\\" If you're looking for a good futuristic, end of society type book, get \\"The Wanting Seed\\" by Anthony Burgess. But do yourself a big favor and skip this snooze fest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea, poor execution","review":"This book starts out great - what an interesting idea. However, 100% of the story is given away in the first two chapters, and the remainder of the book simply plays out the inevitable. There are no surprises, no twists, nothing to keep your interest.I also found the writing style less than engaging. The whole book is an internal dialog that feels like I'm overhearing the thoughts of a regular person - that is, it's not very exciting.If you want a really captivating story about life after death, read Farmer's Riverworld series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The premise is wonderful, but the execution flawed. I was initially more interested in the dead than I was in Laura Byrd. As chapters went by I became less interested in both and was tempted to skim.There are many repeated elements I don't see as key to the premise that are mostly puzzling and therefore distracting.The things I am interested in (what is the social structure in the city? is there actual money? marriage? and other details that should be provided if you are going to bother to say there are census takers and maps) get short-changed.In any case, I haven't felt so let down by a book since I read \\"It\\", and that was a very long time ago."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this book, despite lack of easy answers","review":"This book will not answer your questions or calm your fears about whether there is life after death. It will make you think about your everyday interactions with friends, family, and strangers, and make you more appreciative of how impactful they can be. It's just a little bit sci-fi, but don't let that turn you off - it's a terrific spiritual tale for those who don't need their novels to be wrapped up in tidy little \\"DaVinci Code\\" sorts of ribbons and bows."},{"rating":"1","title":"A human nightmare","review":"The book wandered like the human mind during a restless night of dream and niightmare filled sleep. Thought provoking. Try describing this book to a friend!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Started out great ...","review":"I enjoyed this book until the last few chapters. I was thoroughly disappointed. The chapters that left you wondering how long you have to follow the marbles were BORING. Then when you got to the end, it left you with nothing. By the time I finished, I was wondering why I read this book. I haven't felt that way about a book in a LONG TIME. Don't buy it - go to your library and get it, if you must."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good","review":"Beautifully written, and quite a good read. I first read the beginning section of this in the New Yorker, and it was haunting -- hard to forget. The ending of the book is disappointing. I suspect the author is still used to writing short stories, and found it difficult to sustain his tale through a whole novel. I hope that he goes on to write many more successful ones, because this is an impressive start."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book ever!","review":"I have probably read over 2000 novels in my life, but this one is the very worst. Semi-stupid concept poorly executed. Bad, bad, bad! Avoid this like the Swine Flu! I cannot emphasize strongly enough how veryh bad this book is. The author must have blackmailed the ptublisher to get this garbage on the street. It is grounds for a class-action lawsuit. Have I mentioned that this book is very bad. Page after page of nonsense and drivel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting read but lacking","review":"I love reading books that make you think. This is definitely one of those books. I love being able to visually explore what the author has painted with his words. While I was intrigued with the story line and the very concept, I'll have to agree with some of the previous comments about the characters lacking any really interesting qualities. Overall I didn't feel a connect to any one of them and when the book was over I kind of just sat there for a moment with a glazed over look in my eyes. I commend him for the effort though, as the subject matter in itself was very interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting and well-written","review":"A fascinating premise and a well-written story. The challenge in cases like this is to grow that into a novel. In this case I think the author succeeded. The alternating chapter/parallel streams technique works well here to pace the story, and there are enough interesting characters to give some body to the story.The slightly abstract tone goes well with the subject matter. For example, there is a chapter reminiscent of the end of 2001 A Space Odyssey, and the description of the city intentionally glosses over details (for example, who cleans the toilets?).The only criticism I have is the Coca Cola culpability seems contrived and doesn't fit with the rest of the story. But, this can be read as a cautionary tale, and in that context maybe it was important to have a villain.All in all, a well-crafted book based on an intriguing premise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great beginning goes nowhere","review":"It's an interesting read for about half the book, then you begin to suspect that the author isn't going to make much with what he's started with. There is a lot of extraneous information about cross-ice travel, and a fairly irrelevant street preacher, and some fantasy segments of \\"crossings.\\" But it's mainly a good idea that needed better development, a frequent downfall with science fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read it!","review":"\\"The Brief History of the Dead\\" is by no means a perfect book, but it IS original, thought-provoking, gorgeously written and, ultimately, very moving. Kevin Brockmeier has taken some huge risks in attempting this very complex novel and, for the most part, they pay off. At first, I thought the first part of the book \\"telegraphed\\" too much of what would happen in the second half, but I was wrong. I was riveted, waiting to find out exactly how the two parts of the story would converge, and along the way to a very satisfying conclusion, I laughed, I cried, I was frightened, and I thought a great deal. I recommend it highly."},{"rating":"1","title":"flatlined","review":"Agreeing with previous reviewers, I found the concept of this novel to be irresistible so listened to it on cd-format. Was that a mistake. After becoming intrigued by the storyline and interested in the plot, nothing happens. Nothing. The last 7 cd's take me nowhere the first cd didn't already go. The ending is completely unsatisfying and a cop-out, and the \\"connections\\" the characters make throughout do not resonate. I also agree with the reviewer who claimed they know nothing about Laura, who is central to this story. This was a terrible \\"read\\" and I am extremely disappointed I listened to this whole book on cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flawed but worthy","review":"This novel suffers foremost from sketchy detail. This could easily have run to twice its length to develop both the city, and Laura's survival. The ending seemed sudden and contrived and was quite a letdown. Still, this is an eminently readable piece of work that stuck with me long after finishing it. It could have been epic, but it is still a very good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Original Ideas","review":"I enjoyed the writing style, the premise, and the characters. It's fiction people--meant to entertain. I have my favorite authors, but it's nice to find a new author who has fresh ideas. A good, fictional read that also provides some new ideas to explore."},{"rating":"1","title":"25% survival tips - 75% rubbish","review":"Don't bother purchasing this calendar.

The books are filled with hilarious \\"how to\\" diagrams and instructions, but this calendar only has those for about half of the days--the remaining days are marked by anecdotes presented as \\"Today in Survival History\\" and \\"Today's Hero.\\" These things are just not very interesting or funny and bear no consistency with the spirit and humor of the books and how-tos.

I sometimes wonder why George writes mystery books - her plots tend to be pretty thin, relying heavily on coincidence. What she does so terrifically is write about human emotion, love, hate and all the shades in between."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reading this is like watching paint dry","review":"I couldn't get into this book at all. I kept waiting for the mystery and all I got was slow-going personal information.I was also very confused in the beginning as to who was whom. I enjoy brief physical descriptions of characters and there was not much of that. My imagination couldn't get a grasp of these characters at all and I just couldn't relate to or identify with any of them.I had to put it down after 100 pages. I didn't want to waste my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aristrocratic deceit","review":"Written in the early 90's ...who would believe an entire household playing head games with attempted rape, addiction, violence and deceit, not to mention marital abuse, and murder most foul? There is an elephant in the middle of the room in every scene. Painful to watch everyone pretending that everything is just fine. A bunch of royal misfits who are pathetic. Surely a murder mystery could have SOME minor characters with a bit of spine. I have run out of patience to see if anyone will eventually behave in an interesting or authentic manner. Think I will return my copy half-read. Ms. George does seem to stress the down and dirty and violent. I loved the PBS series, Inspector Lynley."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best of Elizabeth George's Novels","review":"This is my favorite George novel of the 4 I've read so far.It keeps you in suspense throughout and adds new twists, turns and characters as it goes along. It also has a variety of unusual topics (I won't ruin the surprise for you). I enjoyed St. James' increased visibility and Lynley's character and history are explained in more detail. St. James' sister is a great kook. Deborah's character and conflicts are very touching (ok, ok, maybe more so for women).I just wish I'd started reading her novels in chronological order because the characters have become very interesting but some of the surprises lose their impact when read out of order.Overall a great read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Want to know the whole story behind Lynley, Helen, Deborah, and Simon?","review":"Then this is definitely the book for you.This time a murder mystery gets really personal for Lynley.We finally learn the entire story behind Lynley's relationships with his friends and family.

When I first bought it, I was running around, trying to figure out the plot points.George almost makes Tommy human in this one. But why is Deborah the villain and Tommy the victim? (re the abortion)I mean, really! She was only 18 years old, for heaven's sake. Tommy is at least ten years older. He follows her to America, seduces her when she is vulnerable and lonely, and SHE is the bad guy? At least Simon had the decency not to sleep with a young girl who he knew was in love with him.Although when you look at it, Simon's behavior towards her was cold and in some ways, cruel. He should have written to her while she was gone. And if he truly thought that she was better off without him, he should have bowed out of her life completely, instead of using his friendship with her father as an excuse for interfering. (\\"Go away-No, come back\\") He only admits that he wants her when she is engaged to another. Typical."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical, Predictable, and Essentially Trashy Pulp Fiction!","review":"George is popular but for what reason, I do not know. She is trite, uses lots of cliches, and expresses an intolerance to anything other than self-interest in her characters. Lack of depth or insight is an understatement with this author who has literary potential but has yet to achieve it, in my opinion with her many novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME","review":"This book really stinks. The character who gets murdered first doesn't even have one spoken line before he dies. The reader doesn't care who killed him because you never get to know the guy... or care about him.

Each was an improvement on the previous one. But this book is awful. The fact that this book is a prequel to the series does not affect my review. But the writing is just terrible. The characters make the most outlandish and hyperbolic statements. No one talks like these characters! Their behavior is often at odds with their characters. Written in the style of a harlequin romance; there is absolutely nothing subtle about emotions or reactions. I think that the book was plotted in advance and the characters were written to meet the requirements of the plot. Never mind that none of the characters behave in a realistic manner. Never mind that the characters are only caricatures. I cannot recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"She's written better","review":"I read \\"Deception on His Mind\\" and \\" In Pursuit of the Proper Sinner\\", both pretty entertaining (although a bit verbose). This book, however, is a big disappointment. The dialog is melodramatic soap opera junk. The characters are so whiney and self absorbed that I wanted them all to be murder victims.I kept reading because I thought it was going to get better. It didn't. I really wonder what kind of editor thinks this tripe is worth publishing.

He hardly ever does any kind of physical comedy ever. He's just a joke-teller. There are observasionalists like Jerry Seinfeld, pop-culture comics like Robin WIlliams, and ranters like Dennis Miller. But then there are just plain simple joketellers. You know those jokes you hear ALL THE TIME, and say \\"That's an old one.\\"?

And unlike so many comics, he almost never resorts to abrupt curses or vulgarities to make us laugh. His stuff is smart, witty, and entirely unexpected, the kind of humor that makes you laugh, and then laugh again wide-eyed at the wit you missed on first reaction.A big part of Wright's genius is his ability to pull so much humor out of a single observation. His best jokes begin like one-liners, but before you're finished laughing Wright adds another punch line, then another, until you can't believe he could possibly do it again--and he does.This album is almost clean enough for kids, although one verse of \\"Rachel\\" and a bit from another track are both questionable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absurd and hysterical","review":"Steven Wright is very, very funny. His is humor of the absurd. Those who don't \\"get\\" it may have lost their ability to see things in a fresh way.

Before he left, while I nearly collapsed in panic, he told me to get Bevington.I have stacks of statistics books that teach readers to plug things into formulas. This is not the way to learn or do statistics, and in anything but the most trivial of cases will lead to incorrect results. Bevington teaches the reader to think about what the data looks like, and specifically the error and uncertainty in the data.

I've been doing yoga for over a year and Pilates for a few months and I found this video to be a bit of a challenge. You really need to have strong abs to perform the workout here. The workout is about 30 minutes long but it's long enough to get a decent workout. This Pilates workout focuses on one's core: the stomach, back, and buns.

My only complaint is that the bottom is too wide. My previous battery-operated sifter had a funnel at the bottom which made it easy to direct the flour into a measuring cup. With this one, the flour goes way out beyond the cup.

After the third cup it stopped working (we needed to sift 8 lbs. so this didn't help much at all, back to the squeezing sifter to finish our cakes). We replaced the battery but it offered no help.

It is very slow. The sifting is done via vibration rather than any type of shifting paddle so it takes much longer than doing it by hand. Plus the product design allows clumps to get through three small grooves on the bottom where the screen attaches. I had to use my hand to catch the clumps and finally just re-sifted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pre-baking preparations have never been simpler!","review":"I bake a loaf of bread every couple of days, so to make life easier I put together my own bread kits in ten individual containers.

I'm so glad I bought this little beauty!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Recommended","review":"I have had two of these sifters, and they both quit working. While they were working they worked great at first, but got worse as time went on. The first one seemed to get bogged down if I added the 4 cups of confectioners' sugar I needed to sift, so I would reduce the quantity I added to the sifter at one time (which kind of defeats the purpose). Even after putting in a cup at a time, the motor just gave out after less than 10 total uses. I was so impressed with how it had worked at first, so I bought a second, determined to use only a cup of ingredient at a time so as not to stress the motor. Unfortunately, even with that, the second one didn't even last that long (maybe 3 uses). This product is a great idea, but I don't think the motor is powerful enough to do the job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok but not durable","review":"I used the sifter very lightly and it still did not last beyond a year. While it worked, it did a decent a job of sifting, but it was loud and vibrated quite a bit. I also had a problem with the handle shocking me when I'd put it on or take it off.

But it took me 5 whole minutes to get 1/4 cup of sifted sugar. If it were designed so you could just set it down and walk away and do all your other prep and baking work, then maybe I could deal with it. But you have to sit there and hold it over a bowl - and hold it - and hold it. I bake quite a lot, and for a single icing recipe that calls for 3 cups of powdered sugar, I would have to sit there and hold it for a full hour. NOT worth it. If I could send it back I would, but I tossed the box it came in - won't do that again."},{"rating":"2","title":"flour sifter","review":"I think this sifter is just great. The type that you have to squeeze the handles together cramps my hand. I bought two of the other kind, that you have to turn with one hand but both of them had the inner part that did not reach the sifting mesh. This one was inexpensive, easy and fast to use and I love it. I would recommend it to anyone.

It was a new battery, but I still tried two more, hoping the battery was bad. I finally accepted the fact that the sifter just wouldn't work. I sent it back and got a replacement. This time, the lid was broken (the box is really too small for the product). But I kept it because the motor turned on after the battery was installed. When I tried it with confectioner's sugar, I was really disappointed in the performance. I had to keep my thumb pressed against the on/off switch, otherwise it would stop. Plus, it worked intermittently, I had to let it sit for a few minutes for it to start working again. When I took the handle off to clean the sifter, the handle was loaded with sugar. Not a great product."},{"rating":"1","title":"It worked well - once!","review":"I have used this multiple times. It worked wonderfully the FIRST time I used it. I cleaned it out, dried it off and put it away until next time. Every time I use it, the experience is worse than the time before. The motor quit working continuously the SECIND time I used it, I had to keep hitting/tapping the side to get it to start again, this happened for probably two uses. Then I just used it as a regular sifter; I continuously tapped the side. This gets really tedious when I have to sift 2 lbs of powdered sugar at least once a week - no wonder I bought a mechanical one, huh? Yesterday I used it and the bottom/sifter fell out.

The father is absentee, the mother distant, and the big sister has to care for her baby sister. Goblins steal the baby away, and the big sister is able to retreive her through some drug-trip-like ritual. Meanwhile, dad's away and mom's staring off into space in the garden.Don't read this to your toddler/preschooler/school-age/tween/teen-age kids!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Super creepy - a nightmare maker.","review":"The images and text will make for nightmares. Not a fun one like \\"Where the wild things are.\\" He is talented, just missed the mark on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"I've Wondered Since Age Nine...","review":"My first brush with this book came when I was in kindergarten, the year my little brother would be born. The children's room had this book displayed, open, on a podium that was just short enough for me to see over. Instantly, I wanted to take the book out.I took it out a few more times over the next year or so, and was always entralled by both the story and the illustrations. The story itself gave me a bit of a thrill when I imagined having to defend *my* baby brother for Goblins.Eventually I forgot about it...until I was nine and Labyrinth came out. As you probably know, in that movie a girl's brother is stolen by a king and taken to a Goblin city, where she has to fight in order to get him back.Makes you wonder if this book inspired the movie, doesn't it? I know I've always wondered!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"Ida must watch her baby sister while her father is away at sea and her mother is in the arbor. However, she doesn't watch closely enough and goblins pull her baby sister out the window and plan to make her a goblin bride. Can Ida save her sister?Oddly enough, the book isn't as disturbing as it sounds. It reminds me of traditional fairy tales told with the intent to make children behave through fear. Ida learns an important lesson, keep both eyes on the baby.The illustrations depict intense emotions and help the reader to comprehend the somewhat limited text.Not my favorite Sendak work, but certainly a great one worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"My daughters' favorite book of all time","review":"Both of my daughters were enchanted by this book. We got it when they were 2 & 3 years old. Children have rich imaginations and rather than being frightened (as some reviewers thought children might be) they felt empowered by the story. Parents are not always around when you're faced with a frightening situation. Ida was able to save her baby sister and return her to the garden because she listened to and acted on the internalized teachings of her father. And in the end, the goblins turned out to be \\"just babies, like her sister.\\" All was well.While pre-schoolers may not have been able to explain this allegory, they understand it on a deep and personal level. In their late 20s now, my daughters still love this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haunting---in a good way","review":"For many years, I could remember reading a book about a little girl, a band of goblin babies, and a stolen younger brother. I also remembered what beautiful illustrations it had and how much I had loved it as a young girl. I was literally haunted by the memories of this beautiful book and tried for several years to find it. Finally I asked the right librarian and she lead me back to this wonderful book. I find it as enthralling and intriguing as I did when I was young, and I'm so happy to have rediscovered it. I think it is a lovely and odd book and would recommend it to all who enjoy such things."},{"rating":"1","title":"another Sendak dissapointment","review":"I want so much to love this author. His illustrations are wonderful. This story bored my 4 year old and left me unintrigued. I have no idea to whom this book should appeal. Much like \\"Where the Wild Things Are,\\" the story is over-rated and uninspired. Sendak should have left the writing to others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Appropriate for Young Children","review":"Although Maurice Sendak is a well-known author for WHERE THE WILD THINGS ARE, this book, OUTSIDE OVER THERE, in my opinion, is not appropriate for young children. Not only are the words difficult for a young child to understand in its old world poetic style, but the illustrations could easily spook a child into having nightmares. Any parent out there wanting to stay up all night? If your child enjoys the rush of being scared and you are willing to explain the spirit world with each turning page to your child, then OUTSIDE OVER THERE may be a good book for discussion in regards to kidnapping and such. I, for one, will not be reading it to my family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, but traumatized me for life","review":"We had this book when I was a child. It's a terrific book, but be aware: for the entirety of my childhood I was convinced goblins really could steal children. Between this book and the movie \\"Labyrinth\\" I was deeply traumatized. The melting ice baby in particular was quite terrifying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"Book was great! It took too long to get here, but it was good quality and a great story.

I think this is the only bad review I've ever given about a game. This one is just awful. The game decides if your voice tone is consistent and if it isn't consistent when calling the dog's name 5-10 times in a row, you have to start over. This takes forever and isn't fun. But once you get past it, you then have to \\"train\\" your dog to do a \\"trick\\" (sit) before you can do ANYTHING else. The training instructions are nonsensical and it's fairly random whether the dog responds. Go to youtube and watch kids struggling with this game. If you want to hear your kid shouting the name of his/her dog over and over...all day...get this game, LOL."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE THIS GAME","review":"I got this game when it first came out and ever since then I have loved it! Everytime we go on a car ride or when we're running errands, I always bring this game and I will play it the whole time! Its a great game for all ages! I am 12 years old and still not tired of it! When my little cousins come over, they fight over who's going to play Nintendogs first.This game has great graphics and really does teach you the responsibility of having a dog!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Game!!!!!! =-)","review":"Basically, you get a puppy and start training it. It responds to your voice, although mine took about 1/2 hour to learn its name.Your nintendog responds almost exactly like a real dog. You take him/her on walks, train it and enter it in contests (obedience, agility, and disc)You feed it as well as accessorize it with things like collars or hats. They come when you call them (if their trained) and you can get them to perform things like \\"sit\\" and \\"shake\\" You can even change around your house!As you train and perform in contests, you earn money. You can also get money by selling supplies you don't need at the shop.Overall this game is great for people who can't get a real dog, or just training to get one. Its my favorite game for DS!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's the 2nd best of all my games - [...] from Calif.","review":"I have 4 games: animal crossing, nintendogs, advance wars dual strike, mariokart (listed in order of favorites).Here is my summary of Nintendogs:Positives:1)Agility training - training your dog for a competition. It is fun to see your dog learn so much.2)It is like having a real dog3)The dogs are really cuteNegatives:1)It can get boring because you have to repeat lots of thingsNote: I borrowed the \\"dog trainer\\" devise from a friend. I had to write over all my existing data and now am sorry I did it. It does let you bypass the repetitive stuff but now the dogs are not as responsive and I miss my old dogs."},{"rating":"2","title":"BUT IT ALREADY!!!!!!","review":"i have the dacshund version of the game and it's the coolest!!! the best by far is the touch screen and microphone (when it works) the dogs are incredibly life-like and very different to each other.

You get to teach your puppy tricks and they're voice commands. the only draw back is that people think you're crazy when your in public calling your puppy's name and telling him to sit! I never had a dog and always wanted a puppy so now i can put on my game in my no pet allowed apartment and have a puppy for a little while"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the reasons i got a DS","review":"One of the reasons i got my DS was for this game. i had heard so much around it the past few years that i begged my husband (using his account to write this) for it for a late Christmas present.The game came today and i havent stopped playing!! It's all that i heard about and more! i picked a miniature pinscher and the graphics are so real she looks just like the one i used to have and the use of the voice command is a big plus.This is one game that no dog lover/gamer can live without!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Really fun game, great for teaching responsibilities !","review":"I usually don't play my sons games, but this one is really cute!

I was very excited to get this game for my 6 year old daughter. Turns out, neither one of us have the patience to train a dog over and over again before even getting the opportunity to do anything fun. I have decided this game is pure torture much like my experience training my own dogs. Perhaps an extremely lonely person or an extremely bored person or a dog fanatic may enjoy this kind of repetitive nonsense but it's not for us. We just want to play a game for fun, not get stuck repeating the name \\"Fido\\" over and over and over.... ahh!"},{"rating":"2","title":"NO PSP","review":"Ok i have a question for all the dipsticks that are saying this game is comming out fo psp.

I don't think there is anything bad about the game, as others have stated in their one star reviews. You can buy dogs and get cool accessories and you can walk your dogs and feed them. It might feel like a chore to some people but it's really fun. It teaches you responsibility and budgeting. Nintendogs ROCK!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT GAME!!!","review":"I really liked this game it was alot of fun. You get to train and have alot of fun with these little dogs. The one thing i would like to add that i didnt like was that you cant really interact with other trainers unless you live in a big city with lots of players. You have to have someone else looking for another trainer thats 30mi or less away. Another thing i didnt like was that it takes forever to name the dog if you say the name differebt every time. Rather than that this game is a really great game"},{"rating":"2","title":"(...)","review":"I love Nintendogs! It's sooo fun. It can get frustrating when your dog doesn't do what you tell it to in contests, but other than that it's awesome. I already have all eight dogs and $22,925 to spend on supplies or houses. You can also go on bark mode and bring friends presents and meet their dogs. You can earn stuff by winning contests and getting trainer points. I recommend Nintendogs to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Game EVER!!!!","review":"This game is awesome! It is my favorite game!

This includes feeding, bathing, petting, and even training them tricks. But that's one of the only downfalls to the game. Half of the time the dogs think ou're saying another trick and then they'll perform the wrong trick when you don't want them to. Nintendogs is an enjoyable game that is appropriate for all ages but sometimes just taking care of a dog is somewhat dull. [Maybe if they had other competions for the dogs.] I hope my review helped."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dogs Dogs Dogs!!!!","review":"I got this game for Christmas I was so excited that I started playing it right away it is very chalenging and hard to get money now, I finally have enough to buy a cute boxer pup.

It is a really fun game and I recomend it for people betweent the ages of 5-100 ok so now you know my opinion I hope that Nintendo comes out with another Nintendogs soon!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"cool game but will it work?","review":"don't get the wrong idea from my title, but I don't own this game yet and I am just saying what if people get bored with this?

The game was able to maintain her interest (and my interest) for about five minutes. I've read some of these reviews and there must be some really patient people who have the time to repeat the same thing three hundred times at an electric gadget and imagine that it's the real thing.

But you have to keep one, and feel like a bad person if you don't feed it and walk it.Honestly, think twice before subjecting your children to that!"},{"rating":"2","title":"So fun!","review":"Nintendogs is such a fun game. Keep in mind, I'm not as young as most who probably play this game, but I still have a blast playing!! Start by choosing the dog of your choice - there are so many to choose from, each with their own individual personality, so the perfect puppy is always waiting for you. If you already have a REAL dog, it's fun looking for a dog in this game that matches your real pet! Teach them all kinds of tricks, participate in competitions, groom, and play with your new puppy, just as a real pet! Accessories are also available, like sunglasses, hats, and neat collars for your puppy.For any parent with children who are interested in having their own pet, this is GREAT practice for them! And parents may even enjoy it, too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nintendogs game is fun","review":"This is a fun game because you get to actually feed, water, bathe and train your dogs.

Definitely get the film DVD if you have never seen it, a poignant tale of two widowed people with the common bond of schoolchildren, finding their way back to being in love again. In classic foreign film neo-realism style, the closeups of facial expressions say more than words."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware!","review":"This CD is a joke and, most likely, not legally licensed, since the true rights holders name does not appear anywhere. Furthermore, it is in mono sound, mastered off an LP. It's amazing what people think they can get away with. This score will finally be released in a few weeks, properly licensed, from the original album masters, in both French and English versions. That's the one you want - and in stereo, as it should be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mono and bad","review":"I'm not sure if people \\"reviewing\\" here are just totally without knowledge or whether they're just so happy to get certain music they don't care. This pricey import from Japan, like the other \\"import\\" that's available is not mastered from any first generation tapes - and it's mono where it should be stereo. For those who love this music, it's going to receive its first proper release ever on CD - in stereo from the original album masters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Un Homme et Une Femme","review":"This is one of the most beautiful collection of songs that I have ever heard. Every time I listen to my CD (morning, noon and night) I see the movie all over again. Every song while different in its own way, relates to the other, either with subtle counter melodies or sweeping harmonies. Every time I listen to this soundtrack, I hear something interesting that I missed before. If you can appreciate the classics, this should definately be in your selection for listening pleasure. Thirty five years after it's release this music is as fresh today as it was then. Definately the work of a true genius."},{"rating":"2","title":"You can pick up a vinyl version cheaper, BUT","review":"If you want the true blue soundtrack on CD this is the way to go.

Gorgeous music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this music","review":"Have it on all the time in the car. Love this music. Score and film (1966) are still incredible to listen to and watch.

I have been looking for the CD for some time and finally found it here. The price is exorbitant but so is the music. You will NEVER find better music to drive by or make love to.

There are up-beat classic as well. \\"Queen of Denial\\" \\"Shake the Sugar-Tree\\" and \\"My Crazy Life\\" are all magic to the ear, and of course \\"Maybe it was Memphis\\" makes the cut. Pure country gold."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Collection","review":"Pam Tillis is one of the more underrated female acts in recent country history.

Front to back, there are no weak cuts here--the two new tracks, 'Land Of The Living' and 'All The Good Ones Are Gone', are both first-rate, and several of the songs here remain some of the very best singles of the last decade, chiefly 'Don't Tell Me What To Do', 'Maybe It Was Memphis'(still probably her finest moment), 'Shake The Sugar Tree', and 'In Between Dances'. It would have been nice to have seen both 'One Of Those Things' and 'Deep Down' included, but as it stands there's nothing wrong at all with what is here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great voice!","review":"First, I must say I'm not very familiar with Pam Tillis' songs.

And no I wasn't choking on lunch.. ha ha.Anyhow, that song motivated me to buy the album to see what else was on it. For my tastes I'm not too crazy about the other songs, but the Pony song really strikes a chord within me. What a great voice!

It gives a nice overview on a variety of topics from the beginning of photography to present. It is by no means a comprehensive history book and it's not a how to book, but if you would like a quick background on photography's beginning, this does it. If you are looking for a comprehensive history text, go elsewhere, spend more and get a much larger book. I have taught photo-history and like the quick, easy-to-read, fun insight.

Then, as I had an instinct that this unit was junk, I tested the opening/closing mechanism WITHOUT attaching it to the item I needed to 'lock'. On about the 10th lock/open cycle, the lock 'froze' in the locked position. Nothing I could do would make it open. Fortunately I trusted my instincts to test it a few times BEFORE locking-up the item I needed to secure. That saved me a lot of grief, and all I had to do, then, was toss this unit into the trash."},{"rating":"2","title":"The scientific method in action","review":"I listened to this book on tape a few years ago, and have found that it is one of those books that has really stuck with me. I plan to purchase it now and save it for my kids to read. It is the best example I've ever experienced of the scientific method put into action.The author is absolutely committed, throughout his research, to the use of logic and evidence to reach conclusions. If an observed result is not logical, he tries to find the hole in it, and devises another test. If his theories are not verified by observation, he finds the hole in his thinking. He is never bound by either conventional thinking or even by his own theories. All that matters is getting it right.Most of our exposure to the scientific method looks backwards at supporting facts from seemingly obvious conclusions. This book really takes you through the hard work (physically and mentally) and frustration of reaching the solution.I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The hunter/trapper from Alaska pegged this fellow!

Scientific study and jargon are not the same. All of us need never forget that one does NOT need an advanced degree to understand and learn from the world around us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Invaluable information for Christians who care to know..","review":"This book provided invaluable, well written, concise information on the occultly influenced individual. I have done quite a bit of reading on this subject, but I found this to be very enlightening and helpful. I learned much more than I bargained for and was surprised at some of Dr. Koch's conclusions.

But it was gruelling to watch this. The main characters that we loved so much were either gone or took a back seat to other characters that I couldn't even relate to. I really hated this 8th season and I hope they do better with the final season. I will only watch the last season if I can see it for free.

The music is not that bad its just the style has totally changed and it doesnt even sound like yesterdays rising. I think it would have gotten better reviews with a different band name.

It sounded pretty good, so I purchased one container of Blue Job Chrome Polish and 2 packages of Blue Job Pipes Wipes. The total cost was $24.50 (pricey), but the promise of having shinny pipes on my BMW R1150R was worth it. When I opened the container, I was immediately taken back by the small amount of polish sitting in the bottom this oversized container. The container could have been a fraction of its size and still have held the polish. I followed the directions and even used an orbital sander with the pipe wipes as instructed on Youtube. I was expecting to have enough Polish to do both pipes, but I ran out before I was done. The pipes looked better, but not $24.50 better. After riding my bike, my pipes were blued again. I have seen a lot of BMW motorcycles with blued pipes. Due to a lot of good reviews, I suspect that bluing pipes are inherent to BMW pipes on boxer engines."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time and money","review":"A complete waste.

So by the time I tried Blue Job on my headers they were an ugly shade of brown from burned on mud and road grit. After washing off the crud and getting down to the metal I gave this stuff a try. Two words of advice to those who feel it doesn't work. 1) Read the directions, especially the part about making a thick paste. 2) Be patient. I sipped a beer and listened to the radio while working one small section at a time.

The real trick is all about engaging the listener or the reader...grabbing hold of them in such a way that they set aside the hustle and bustle of their lives and become engrossed in the story. This is the storytelling skill Petrakis has demonstrated throughout his long and illustrious career. Tales of the Heart exhibits all of Petrakis' power as a storyteller, but it goes much farther. When I was young, my dad, an educator, used to stop every once and a while, in the midst of some thankless task, glance sideways at me, and say: \\"This counts.\\" He wanted me to understand that we were engaged in something bigger. Tales of the Heart points us all toward something bigger.Petrakis, whether writing fiction or essays, or whether delivering a public address, is one of my favorite storytellers. Tales of the Heart provides an inspiring look into the heart of a superb writer, the likes of which may never pass this way again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book","review":"I had the honor of meeting Mr. Petrakis at my school just a short while ago.

His comments are supported by numerous references and sources so that the serious student may research his conclusions on their own. The history of Baptists, as shown by the author, did not begin in the Reformation, but their roots go back to the first Baptist baptizing in the Jordan River. Mr. Torbet traces the roots of the Baptists through the Montanists, Novatians, Paulicians, Anabaptists and others, who though not called Baptist by name, hold the same historical doctrinal beliefs as today's Baptists. This is an excellent book for anybody searching for a credible Baptist history book without the modern leanings toward ecumenicalism."},{"rating":"1","title":"Comprehensive and dated","review":"Tolbert's book is comprehensive and does a good job of overviewing Baptist groups in Europe and North America. The book is dated and does not include any of the important developments among American (Northern) Baptists and Southern Baptists of the past 25 years.Tolbert seems to write from a northern perspective and seems to view Southern Baptist history from a distance fueled by a distaste for the American South and a lack of understanding of the deep role Southern culture has among Southern Baptists.Difficult to read and unnecessarily repetitious in his history, Tolbert's is still a standard in Baptist history. Though Leon McBeth's history is more readable, it is also much more liberal in its leanings and transparent in his opinions and perspectives, hurting the contribution in his monumental work. Thus, Tolbert remains the standard in Baptist history."},{"rating":"2","title":"owner","review":"This item was just like the one I lose....Programming only took about 30 seconds and it works.

I then used an old blade and got no burning. Today I called Freud. Answer was, \\"That's the way it is designed, coating is to eliminate burning(?).

It sells itself as a do-it-all blade which it can do but not as well as a blade designed for that task. My 40 tooth ripping blade rips better than this one. My 60 tooth Hi-ATB cross cuts better than this one. Other reviews have said that the teeth break off and if I didn't see it happen with my own eyes I wouldn't believe it. A tooth broke off right at the braze point.

But you have to have a saw powerful enough to run a 40 tooth blade. it burned out my 3/4 HP motor on my old contractor saw.

It works the best on sheet goods (plywood, ect), I prefer the 24 tooth blade from freud for hardwood lumber - oak, walnut, maple.

I used the blade on my 3hp Delta Unisaw (USA made)with a Beis rip fence. Upon receiving the blade, I removed my FWWII and replaced it with the Fusion. Ripping several feet of white oak produced moderate to severe edge burning which would indicate an alignment issue.I used a TS Aligner (basically a dial indicator) to realign both the blade and the rip fence. I always toe out the rip fence perhaps 1/64\\" at the end to prevent binding. Upon starting the alignment process, my dial indicator had the Fusion blade all over the place indicating the blade was not flat. I retuned it to Amazon - why really bother?? I threw my FWWII back on with no problems. I rated the blade a '1' because it did produce incredibly smooth end cuts. I must have received a bad blade.

There is one co-author whom I did not care for. One of the books was \\"By The Horns\\". I don't remember The title of the other book.

In fact, even Elmore Leonard has praised him for the way he can craft a tale. The interesting thing about this book is that he manages to examine and address one of the more pressing social issues of our time. This story about a hangman, takes a long look at the death penalty. Thankfully, it's done in a subtle matter. On its face, this is not a \\"political\\" book. Instead, it's an interesting read that will make you think long and hard about the death penalty when you finish the book at the end.I downgraded the book to 4 stars because the chronological flow of the story was sometimes confusing, but overall, this book is worth the investment and would be a great book for discussion in a book club."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ruben Gomez Rocks","review":"Hi, I think that this CD is Great!!!

Corey Haim plays the title character, he falls in love with a wealthy girl, of course he tells her he is wealthy too which is a lie on his behalf. Lucas does whatever he can to get his dream girl to fall for him. Keri Green, Charlie Sheen, a very young Courtney Throne-Smith, and Winona Ryder(her feature film debut) round out the cast. I love this film so much, it's smart, well-written, and makes you a believer that even a nerd can have his day in the sun. I highly recommend this teen comedy/drama."},{"rating":"2","title":"Been a very long time","review":"OMG!!! I have forgotten all about this movie \\"Lucas\\". It's been many many years!!

I am very happy I own one of the dvd's."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Throw it to Lucas!\\"","review":"The DVD has both full-screen & wide-screen editions on opposite sides. Video quality is what you'd expect from an 80s movie. There are no extras, but I didn't expect any. Disc is in a keeper case (not the half-paperboard variety). The movie, itself, is exactly as I remembered; a surprisingly confident nerdy kid tries his best to catch the eye of a girl. You can't help but like almost everyone in this movie.

This movie has heart, it brings you back to that time in high school when you loved that one popular boy or girl and he or she was in love with the jock, or the prep, or the cheerleader and you were just the quiet, band geek as Lucas was. The characters are so well developed and intelligent the actors are so in tuned to their parts it is as if they aren't acting at all.

This was one of the more touching movies I've ever seen and it made you just want to be poor Lucas'(Corey Haim) friend. I really didn't see any flaws in it. Kerri Green and Charlie Sheen also had really good performances. I will not forget this movie soon because it's really touching. It's a film that says don't change who you are because you're wonderful and someday people will love you for that and it's okay to be different. I'd recommend it to anybody who has been the the oddball and just needed to be accepted somewhere. This film should have gotten more praise in the 80's because it really deserves it.

There really is alot of information, with enuff depth to help you understand, and it tells you books to look at for more in-depth information.

Nothing in this movie is suspenseful and again just a lot of people sitting around talking with hardly any action happening.

There are MUCH better B horror movies out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a horror movie...","review":"This movie is soft core porn, not a horror movie. It's plot (and I use the term very loosely) is centered around numerous soft core porn scenes with some random violence, ridiculous dialog, and terrible editing - not to mention the characters seem to drive on the wrong side of the road throughout the entire thing (just one example of just how bad this one is).

Skynyrd's unfortunate demise led to them being canonized, though they certainly had several wonderful songs to justify it.The Outlaws' first 3 Albums (Self-titled, Lady In Waiting, Hurry Sundown) were amazing LP's and this \\"Best of\\" CD captures most of their high notes. Its missing a few great tunes (Holiday from Hurry Sundown immediately comes to mind) but overall is a good survey of their music.The quality of their music tailed off quickly after Hurry Sundown -- partially due to Henry Paul leaving, but probably due to burnout on several levels. Billy Jones was an amazing guitarist with a unique voice, on par with Neil Young. Its too bad he wasn't with us longer.These guys were the 'metal band' of the Southern Rock area, so if you enjoy loud guitars and Skynrd-esque music, this CD is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"obviously early work","review":"Needing some summertime reading, I decided to dive back into Delinsky's early works for ones I had missed.

When the male protagonist (Daniel) calls the female protagonist (Nia) \\"Babe\\" at the start of every conversation, it is jolting to me how out of character he seems.Anyway, it's nice to see Delinsky's writing has improved over time.

For one thing, you can't even understand half the things he'ssaying. The only songs on the album I like are \\"On the Freeway\\" and \\"Social Studies\\". I have to say \\"Social Studies\\" is tight because the beat to that song is hard and I can really feel what he's talking about and relate to his anger. So, to put it simple, Bone is not the same as they used to be. (I guess it's because of the unfortunate fact that Easy E is no longer living). They don't have to speak as violently as they once did but I wish they could have kept the beats hardcore on at least most of their songs of today.

The book is character driven, but it never gets deep enough into the characters to make them interesting. It's overly wordy and too descriptive to the point that it is excessive and overloaded beyond the point of being able to draw an accurate image of what is being described. I only finished the book because it was pretty short, but even that took me a while because it was so slow and boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Both very enjoyable and highly useful","review":"A very useful book. It was an excellent idea to include a CD-Rom with Helen Vendler reading a good number of the sonnets. Hearing them with the book in hand made for an absolutely wonderful afternoon. The introduction provides interesting ideas - among them, that the sonnets are meant to be \\"said\\", not \\"overheard\\", as Eliot says of lyric poetry, which makes the CD-Rom all the more valuable. It also provides a bird's eye view, and brief but authoritative critical appraisal, of scholarly publications on the subject - no mean task. However, I felt the need of more reference to the baroque context in which these poems were produced. For instance, thinking in the antithetical mode is not an individual trait: one remembers Donne, or Quevedo, or Sor Juana In��s de la Cruz, and realizes that many of the forms of construction, and of the images, etc., belong not to personal choice or preference but to collective baroque practice throughout Europe and (even) America."},{"rating":"1","title":"A potential 5 star volume that ultimately failed","review":"Helen Vendler is surely a brilliant satirist whose goal is to skewer pretentious academics. I am stunned by her ability to cook up a consistently hilarious porridge of ivory tower gobbledygook. The comfort in poring through these dense pages of litcrit mumbojumbo comes from counting oneself lucky never to have had to sit through a lecture delivered by the kind of pompous professor that Vendler so brilliantly parodies. Every aspiring academic and every serious psychologist should invest in this perfect example of how a tone deaf literary pretender can seize the spotlight from the greatest poet who ever lived. The ultimate tragedy of Dr. Vendler's work is that genius of her caliber is underestimated. And so, alas, currently anyway, too many gullible readers fail to get the joke, and the brilliance fizzles. Or, as William Shakespeare noted, \\"Some rise by sin, and some by virtue fall.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"The Most Readable Edition","review":"Many of the customer reviewers have discussed the merits of this excellent book. I would like to emphasize that of the many editions of Shakespeare's Sonnets, this is the one that is a real pleasure to read. Exactly one sonnet on a page (in Quarto and modern typefaces) with no distracting footnotes or explanations. Keep a dictionary or an annotated edition handy if you're new to these poems."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't stop playing it.","review":"Just last week I felt like getting a new CD.

I'll be in line for tickets if they make it back to Seattle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does not dissapoint!","review":"This album was a strong, emotional, but more upbeat answer to Strong Enough.

Right Where I Belong is a wonderful album that you can listen to over and over. Thank you Wendy for such beautiful music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended","review":"This publication has not been subject to technical editing, or if it has, the staff performing the edit were definitely unqualified. The book contains literally dozens of errors, most of which should have been caught before publication. In many cases the text refers to a figure the contents of which bear no relation to the text. As an experienced VB.NET developer I was able to resolve most of the amomalies but anyone attempting to use this book as a migration aid from VB6 to VB.NET would really struggle. When I emailed the publisher (WROX) they displayed a distinct lack of interest, suggesting I compile a list of errors and send it to them and they would, if they agreed, add them to the errata on their website."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a good board","review":"I iron my clothes while sitting on the floor. This board does a pretty good job with that.

I also have spare room for my flash light and eye-glasses. I like it very much."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Ancient Age of Reason","review":"This book has two outstanding strengths:First, its argument: That the Hellenistic era (ca. 330-30 BCE) saw a flowering of science that outstripped anything before - and for 1500 years after. Lucio Russo is convincing in that - even if he carries it sometimes too far (Darwinian theories, for example). His notion of \\"real science\\" combines an abstract model with a logical apparatus that can develop that model into novel (but real) consequences.Second, its style: Russo describes mathematics, the core of Hellenistic science, in a way that should be comprehensible to both scientific and literary readers. Histories of science are seldom so artful.These inherent virtues are reasons enough to read this book. Its relevance to today is something for readers to discover for themselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Story about lost wisdom.","review":"This books presents us very neglected topic concerning Hellenistic science. It is really sad that we have lost so much from this great historical period, in which science as a servant of the power had its greatest development in the antiquity, comparable to this from modern times, like enlightenment age. Development of science in enlightenment was possible, because of the Hellenistic knowledge, whose small part was saved. It is worth mentioning that Russo notices the strong correlation between the development of science in recent centuries and the exploration of different ancient Hellenistic sources. It is really very depressing that only so few facts about Hellenistic science are known. This book tells us a story about lost wisdom of great civilization. Wisdom, which was almost completely lost. But even its small parts, which were saved till modern times enabled us to reach present level of civilization, which is really high."},{"rating":"2","title":"Will appeal to any reader of fiction","review":"Tales Out of School is a wonderful, able, mature first novel, easily one of the finest debuts in recent American fiction. As other reviewers have noted here, the prose is marvelous--delicate and sinuous--though the book is far from a stylistic exercise. Taylor's investment in language and his story are never at odds, one always seems dependent on the other. With intriguing asides on history and mythology, and a wide cast of characters, men and women of diverse age and temperament, Tales Out of School can be read in a day or two, for the book's pacing is as much of an achievement as its style. Both concise and languorous, it holds more power and intelligence than most novels three times its size."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth It","review":"In my fourtyfive years as an editor for my local paper I have not yet found a novel that starts with such promise as this one. The unfourtunate thing is that by the end of the book Taylor's prose becomes quickly messy and overly-explanitive. Dissapointing for such a promising author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bold, but dissapointing","review":"Ben Taylor's first novel seems ambitious at first but quickly falls into strange, muddled, and weak prose. An Ambitious undertaking, however Ben seems to have forgotten that less is more. Overall, like the man himself, I found the novel too weak and pretentious to get through.I know you can do better Ben."},{"rating":"1","title":"inconsistent","review":"Stay away from this. A much better choice is \\"An Archaeological Guide to Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula\\" by Joyce Kelly. This one by May is inconsistent in delivery and descritption. It is a waste of money. The book by Kelly is a far better one."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 essential discs however you get them","review":"One thing that appears to be missing here is mention that this is a collection of the albums Horses, Radio Ethiopia, Easter, Wave and Dream Of Life in digitally remastered form, and with the odd extra track on them. Looking at the descriptions of the current CDs of these albums, they're probably the ones you can get singly now (as opposed to the original versions without the extra bonus tracks). The additional \\"Disc 6\\" is tracks from the 5 albums, plus 2 tracks from \\"Gone Again\\". Of course, you do also get a nice box for them, and the words \\"limited edition\\" on it, and at $.. it's no more expensive than the 5 albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Saving Grace CD","review":"CD was perfect.

It takes you away from all your troubles.The one song no.3 is th one that i really go with,it nice, romantic, lovely,beatiful to listen to and i dont know what to say more about it.But the whole cd is really a romantic one.I like the way Kenny plays his thing,he knows what he is doing and i think he is the best of all,if we compare him with other players.This cd is the BEST!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Brittany Spears of jazz-e pop","review":"Yuck, its definately not jazz and anyone who says it is doesn't know what jazz is and has most likely never listened to Sonny Rollins or John Coltrane let alone Charlie Parker or Wayne Shorter. Not even Kenny G(odawful) himself calls his music jazz, rather he calls it instrumental pop. Pop as in elevator music, its just trite, unchallenging, though relaxing musical fluff. What a shame and a travesty that this purveyor of sugary insubstantial preproccessed junk food for the ears is the biggest selling sax player in the world. There's no nutritive value, just empty calories. This is not art. As to the reviewer who says that this album is good for sex, oh my god, are you kidding?!?! Sex with what?"},{"rating":"2","title":"a HUGE Kenny G fan","review":"My fiance is a jazz altoist, and trust me, it's great sax. I, myself, am a jazz vocalist and I absolutely adore Kenny G's music. Though he may not be the personification of what most jazz musicians view as jazz, he is still a great musician nonetheless. \\"The Moment\\" is his best CD yet. It's tempo is easy to get into and to tell you the truth, it gets me \\"inspired\\". To all the jazz musicians that don't like Kenny G, my fiance included, don't listen to him. But don't drag him and his followers through the mud either.

It's more of a jazzy pop or something like that--or maybe how singers might sing if they could sing as quickly as Kenny G can play, and if they had the range of a saxophone.If you're into jazz, you probably won't like this, and if you're into rap/heavy metal you probably won't like it either. But if you like easy listening music--the kind that you can get lost in and that brings the most wonderful thoughts and images to mind--then you very well might like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Calm Listening...","review":"When it comes to Instrumentals, I am sure fond of piano by Richard Meyrick, John Mitchell, Richard Claderman's music, Yanni, Pan Pipes etc. but Kenny G is my one choice alongwith Richard Claderman. Kenny G The Moment is a an excellent saxo cum piano with not too much of electronic sounds. A light listening playing in background of your thoughts while having cool lunch or dinners alone in recluse. I would not say this jazz coz that kinda music I ain't fond of much! Real Jazz isn't Kenny G style. The duetswith Toni Braxton & Baby Face are wonderful though in this album. The moment is the Best I would rate 5 Stars closely following Havana and Innocence, a number for soft n cool feeling. Always is another fav of mine and I luv playing The Moment & Always on my synthesizer esp.when it comes to chase the blues. Another Kenny G choice is Montage with cool songs like songbird and silhouette. A pick for a calm n cool collection!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Moment","review":"Great music. Brings back memories.

It's not like I haven't listened to his albums,...I own a few. One or two bought in my un-enlightened years, the rest were gifts by well meaning folks. I really have given this music a chance, but I am sorry, it does nothing for me. Every track sounds much like the other, and he's the only one I know who can make a tenor sax sound like a soprano. This music is so boring and soulless. It can't even lull me to sleep because it makes me tense. I have this cd on now to review it, and it's worse than nails scratching a blackboard...music is supposed to relax you or make you feel good. This music just makes me a nervous wreck.

I highly recommend the book to anyone interested in golf lifestyles, golf history or the courageuous story of a working-class hero."},{"rating":"1","title":"Film crew visits Alaska and films themselves","review":"The concept of this video is actually quite intriguing and about 5 of the 45 minutes is spectacular. The film crew seemed to be quite enamered with themselves. There are too many shots of them walking, standing, sitting, falling down and the backs of their heads. There are only a few unique locations in the film. When they visit a tram, we don't even get to see the view from the top of the mountain. Nearly the entire film is shot in 2D, but when it is 3D it is truly amazing. Not worth the price of admission by any means. Too bad because there are very view 3D selections available."},{"rating":"1","title":"not comfortable","review":"They hurt to wear -- the soles create pressure points all over, inherent in the design."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not comfortable but well aerated","review":"I agree with the other review, you initially don't find the ridges to be that uncomfortable but the more you wear it the less comfortable it becomes, it always makes a lot of squeeky noises on my flooring and loves to collect hair on the rubber \\"gills\\" on the bottoms. The only thing good about these is they do breathe and dry off quickly, they're good for the shower, pool or gym and they look cool but just aren't comfy.

Recently I was traveling with my daughter and the car we rented had XM. She is a country fan and found the country channel and, lo and behold, on comes Honky Tonk Badonkadonk. We stayed listening to that station hoping they would replay it. That is one of the best country tunes I have ever heard. I love it. This is a very visual song. As soon as we got home I googled the lyrics to find out who the artist was. I haven't bought a country album in 30 years but I'm going to buy this album.

I have recently aquired a taste for some country music, but the level of religion in most country music is downright obnoxious. I just have a hard time getting into forced faith in my music. I know that christianity has long been a staple in country music, but it is really becoming stale and lame in the manner that it is being used anymore.

Is this some kind of joke or novelty album? No, I am not hallucinating, this is supposed to be taken as a serious album. This album will be scooped up by all the millions of mouth breathers out there who have no idea what country music sounds like. The word Badonkadonk has no place in a country song, EVER. I know they are trying to make country music all hip and cool and appealing to all the clods out there.
