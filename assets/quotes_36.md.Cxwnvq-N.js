It has a sexist leaning, which I was able to overcome, but the simplistic advice was very disappointing. It offered nothing new and only touched the surface of the concepts it did introduce.

Basically, if you're stuck in a job that you want to bust out of, and think you're ambitious but don't know how to get from here to there, this may be the book for you. If you're already on a career arc and ambitious, it would be better to read a more challenging book like \\"Good to Great\\". Another thing I noticed, almost all of the examples cited in this book were about men, women did not make many appearances. I also noticed a focus on \\"make more money, get a bigger house, live the good life\\" kind of thought process. It seems to advocate that you have to be \\"successful\\" to be happy. Dislike.

A man of courage and determination to free Scotland of their English oppressors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Braveheart","review":"Reviewed Date: November 2003Studio: Paramount StudioGenre: EpicExposure: ColorRunning Time: 177 minutesRating: RRelease Year: 1995Directed By: Mel GibsonStarring: Mel Gibson and Sophie Marceau.Within the movie Braveheart there is a story of heartache, love, destruction, and war. The movie is taking you back into time to the 13th century in Scotland. Mel Gibson plays William Wallace. Wallace finds love more then once in the movie. The movie has a lot of blood shed with the wars that are fought. Wallace is portrayed as a mad man in some parts of the film. He was drove to madness with the lose of loved ones. Wallace is a very intelligent man with a wisdom the enemies could never compete with. This is a very excellent movie. If you can withstand the dramatic portion of the movie that includes the bloody scenes. Mel Gibson did not only star in the movie he also, directed the movie.I give Braveheart a 5 star rating, because it is a well put together movie with a love story with in itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"All I have to say is, Wow! Great digital remaster transfer. I'm pretty sure I've already done a review for the film years ago, but I'll just comment on the special edition picture quality itself.The colors are richer and deeper, dark and light variations are more pronounced, and the picture looks crisper. Also less artifacts...Great for people like me who still have Standard Definition TV's and DVD Players.Over the course of 2 weeks, I watched the original presentation 3 times, and the new special edition 3 times as a reference.Oh yeah, the sound is just as good as before too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flawless","review":"I don't have anything new to bring to Braveheart the move itself,as it is phenomenal. The story line, the characters, the epicness. Its a winner of 5 Academy awards for a reason.THis movie downloaded flawlessly and quickly. the picture was perfect, and never went of focus. Well done Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Braveheart","review":"My husband and I just love this film, a film about what matters in life for all of us- faith, family and freedom. Everyone should be inspired by this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"ACTUALLY 3 1/2 STARS:","review":"The movie was pretty good...and kinda depressing. The James Horner film score was very cool. A sad story about a real character. I liked the way the crowds enjoyed his execution: typical Talking Ape reactions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Bluray, but Amazon doesn't pay attention.","review":"This transfer is fantastic. It has some grain, but it's supposed to have grain. Grain is what gives film it pleasant look. The colors are bold and vibrant. The black levels are deep and inky giving the picture a nice three-dimensional look. A great film that looks great on Blu-Ray.But avoid purchasing this product from Amazon! I ordered and it didn't come with the slipcover that all Sapphire Series Blu-Rays are supposed to come with. I told Amazon customer service and they were quick to respond. But my replacement still didn't come with the slipcover. I don't feel like telling them again. After two tries, they should've sent the complete product. I'm keeping this copy, but I will not be buying anymore Sapphire Series from Amazon if they're not gonna include the full product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Movie","review":"When first saw Braveheart i thought would dumb,but i was absolutely amazing. Powerful and funny at parts. Every time i watch it i love it even more. If you haven't seen Braveheart see it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Movie","review":"If you are into fighting and war movies pick this one up. It has some of the best fight scenes to ever be in a film. Mel Gibson being one of my favorite actors playing the lead role in my favorite movie, it just doesnt get any better than this. If you have the time i suggest reading the books about Sir William Wallace. A little sidenote to biff or whoever it was that made the comment about him noticing about Wallace throwing rocks with different hands, maybe you should know that back at that time in the late 1200's men were encouraged to use both hands equally as good, just a little lesson for you today. Check your information before you put it down in writing. I'd like to thank Mr. Gibson for taking the role as Sir William Wallace i dont think anyone could have done it better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I have always received good products from Amazon.

It was filmed in Scotland which really gave the movie an even better look and scenery. The acting was wondereful, especially by Mel Gibson. There was some humor in there that really cracked me up. The story was very powerful and compelling. The battle scenes were brilliant, it was very realistic. The costume design was another hting that I really liked.

It's exquisite. Then, the production. Fabulous! Finally, the direction, the cast, the extras ... the entire movie. Best epic ever!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An epic tale of bravery ...","review":"Braveheart (1995), directed by Mel Gibson is an epic tale full of war, drama, and action. The movie has a run time of 177 minutes.Braveheart is set in Scotland during the Dark Ages. It is about the true story of William Wallace (Mel Gibson) who was a famous commoner who led his people in a rebellion against the English.This is a great movie for history buffs and those who love war pictures. It is rated \\"R\\" for a reason though. It is a very graphic, gorie, movie that shows the horrific nature of what actual battles in that time period would be like.The cinematography does the movie justice by showing the natural beauty of the Scottish countryside.I rate this movie a 4 star, and would recommend it as at least a one-time must see."},{"rating":"2","title":"Full 5 for this gem","review":"I love it when a period film has it all and Braveheart is one of them. It deserved it's Oscar! It has a bit of something for everyone. Any time that an actor steps into the shoes of a director and makes something as wonderful as Braveheart deserves our homages. This is one to have in any serious film buffs collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extreme Violence","review":"Buyer beware: if you do not equate \\"entertainment\\" with graphic violence, you will not enjoy this movie.

Mishy mashy history lessons presented as entertainment like this seem a bit pointless. History from books is sterile, so this film is supposed to be an exciting alternative. All history is a big fib so its difficult to tell what the truth of the subject matter really is.The film is overlong, by about 2 hours and the blue football make-up on Melvyn Gibson looks silly. The Welsh didn't wear skirts, even for fighting in and the battle scenes are a bit amateur, like a fake battlers weekend caught on a cheap vidicam. Gladiator did battles far better, although that's a trashy, self indulgent waste of time too.Avoid this film, and Wales."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Man's Film.","review":"The best guy's movie ever? It's hard to say. Some things are so subjective it's tough to make any determination. I personally just bought it on DVD and watched it for a third time last night. Loyalty, honor, virtue, desire, love, and the experience of platonic friendship as being an end in itself; these values are the embodiment of what makes us men. I'm very glad it was made. It may well not be the greatest movie ever but there can't be too many that rate higher. It's incredibly entertaining and the ending foreshadows what Gibson (and his ICON Films) eventually did with \\"The Passion.\\" A must see."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible realism","review":"If you have read any of my other reviews you would know that realism is something that i hold in great esteem, this movie is practically nothing but. The way Scotland is seen in the movie as well as the hero William Wallace is incredible in terms of how accurately it's displayed. Mel Gibson, excellent actor and even better director. Do yourself a huge favor and purchase this movie immediately. I don't know if the sale will still be there when you're reading this review but as of July 28th 2005 it's over 50% off, and that's an excellent deal. By the way, I'd like to finish by warning you NOT to buy this movie in addition to The Patriot in some feeble attempt to save money. Overall you'll just be wasting it because The Patriot is quite the opposite of this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best history lesson I ever had.","review":"This is by far the best history lesson I ever had. The story is invigerating, the action scenes ar great, and the love story is very emotional. When I first watched this movie I thought it would be boring because it was three hours long, But when it ended I wanted more and thought it was too short. You must see this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"7 stars!","review":"Yes, that's right' 7 stars for one of the greatest(and my favorite) movie of all time. Not to say that it is the best movie of all time, but it is my personel favorite. As far as some people giving it 1 star, I am in complete awe. The cinemotagraphy alone makes it at least 2-3. The story is not meant to be true either. The first lines of the movie will tell you that. Plus, if you buy the book, you'll notice that it's FICTION. And yes Randell Wallace wrote the book and the screenplay. Freedom. That's what this movie is about. A commadite that a lot of people take for granted. It shows it as something far more important than life. And it is. The point at the end when Mel screams this simple word, you can't help your heart from stopping. You have to watch it. Even people that I know who hate movies set in medival(or anything closely related) time periods, like this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Excellence","review":"Seems to me that several folks have axes to grind in reviewing this film poorly. This is a very, very good film for people who like history, costume dramas, \\"English\\" -- pardon me --- novels, and stirring stories of patriotism and passion. Gibson has proven he is more than just a Lethal Weapon-Bruce Willis type clone. Maybe not Olivier, but who is? What a good movie. I have bought it and watched it several times over. There is much to be enjoyed. Lovely score, excellent attention to detail, high ideals and heroes... and just enough romance to keep my heart swollen and my throat choked up. And Stephen, the Irish hero... WHAT a great addition. I want to take him home and have a few beers with him.Thank you, Mel Gibson. What fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"FREEDOM for sure!","review":"WHat bad things can you say about a movie that has englishman getting there butts kicked! and Need I say that the insane irishman stole the show from Good ole mel? hehehe not that mel didnt do a fine job, that mooning the english army scene was priceless and should go down as one of the best scenes ever made... almost compareable with the \\"you talking to me..\\" denero scene. ^5 to mel... a masterpeice for himself surely!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mel Gibson delivers in every sense of the word...","review":"William Wallace's story couldn't have been depicted more powerfully than it was in this film.

A must-own for any Blu-Ray collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"THANK YOU!!!","review":"Very happy.

One of my favorite movies. First mel gibson movie I have seen. I have seen this movie ten times and I still love and never get sick of it and it's an awsome movie. the Dvd is great it has so many features.The movie just rocks. the part i didn't like is when he died at the end of the movie. Best scene is the first war because he seems very tough in that scene. Mel gibson directs this great picture. Best feature in this dvd is mel gibson interview. See it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie","review":"Good lord did i enjoy this great film. mel gibson gives a great performance as the brave William Wallace, the leader of the infamous scottish revolt against england in the 13th century. terrific battle scenes you gotta buy this movie just for the history alone."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Movie Not To Be Missed","review":"Between the sensational acting, the astounding costumes and effects Braveheart is a historical saga not to be missed. Mel Gibson plays a reblious Scottsman fighting for freedom from England. The king a merciless ruler with a feeble son is heading straight for death without and aire. Sophie Marceau portrays a princess who falls in eternal love with Gibson, a role that did not quite fit her but she made the best out of a flaw. Braveheart is undoubtablely Mel Gibon's best work ever. A few historical flaws here and there, but otherwise a perfect must see movie of the year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coulda been better...","review":"The picture quality kind of stinks, but the sound is great, especially if you've got Dolby 5.1 running. Mel's commentary is fair, you won't learn a whole lot about the film by watching it with his commentary. The 30 minute \\"how we made the film\\" sequence is pretty good and typical with what you see on most DVDs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding film","review":"I am constantly amazed at the comments of the gay person and the other viewer who list the inaccuracies in the movie.

It is people like you that we are afraid of..."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best films of the mid 90s","review":"A beautiful combination of a love story and a historic war epic. The real charm from this film that gives it character is the intentional lack of dialog. So much of the magic of this film is the things that are said without words. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Braveheart is an interesting film","review":"Braveheart is one of the best films that I have ever seen. I like the story because it is true and interesting. It's very interesting to see how the people fought and lived in that time. There are also beautiful pictures from the nature in Scotland. In this film you learn something about the history of Scotland. It's good that the film has no happy end, because in the real life it gives not always a happy end. In the battle and in the end of the film there are very terrible situations, which I think is the negative point of this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"An action packed thriller and heart breaker","review":"This is a great movie this is one of the few movies that tell it how it is how often does the hero die. I loved Mel Gibson in this he really put enough feeling in this to make some one cry. The lines were superbly spoken (Escpecially William Wallace& Robert the Bruce). The battles and the gore of this movie may be overwhelming but I suggest you see it any way. I'm not much a fan of love stories but I must say this is the best I've seen. This has been my favorite movie since it first came out I even like the previews more than some movies. I and all my friends suggest you see it"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of the best.","review":"I have made many top 10 movie lists, and they have changed over the years. There is one movie, however, that has never been moved and that movie is Braveheart in the number 1 spot. Many shy from the movie because of it being 3 hours long without even giving it a chance.I think everyone should watch it. You never think the movie is as long as it is when you actually watch it. The battle sequences were the best I have ever seen up until the release of Return of the King, but the battles are still the best in their own light. Every characater is played well, Mel Gibson playing especially well as the lead character William Wallace and his directing is flawless as well. I loved every minute of it and it will most likely always be my favorite movie of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing movie that brings Scottish history to the viewer.","review":"Mel Gibson and cast did a excellent job with Braveheart. Braveheart is filled with a vast aray of emotions. You see William Wallace's deep love and affection for Murron. You also see his love of Scotland and hatred for England and the King. The battle scenes are as amazing as the love story portrayed by William and Murron. I do not feel that William Wallace loved the princess as much as he loved the innocent sweet Murron. Check out the Soundtrack. It is amazing. Braveheart is a must see."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big, bold, beautiful, pointless","review":"This big budget historical epic, complete with the most explicit maimings ever captured on film, and Patrick McGoohan's portrayal of King Edward as a villian so foul you are surprised he does not cackle, is big, broad spectacle in the Cecil B. DeMille tradition. Alas, it ultimately fails to give a reason for William Wallace's fight and fails to give its hero's cry of \\"freedom!\\" any real meaning. Apparently, \\"freedom\\" means Scottish women would be abused and debauched only by Scottish men and not by English ones. Wallace is definitely a figure worthy of a film like this, but I think this film misses the chance to explore the nature of Scottish nationalism, and it misses the chance to explore the remarkable example of a peasant who came to lead armies. It misses the chance to explore the collision of a tribal culture and a feudal one. It's a good movie, but nowhere near living up to the hype."},{"rating":"2","title":"The GREATEST movie ever made.","review":"Without a doubt, the best movie I have ever seen. After living in Scotland for a couple of years and visiting the Wallace monument, only a movie like this can depict how horrid the English treated Scotland. You could say the best part about this movie was revenge. I say it was the general truth.

The wide screen vistas and fight scenes are intense in the theater. Although they are also spectacular in a smaller format, it just isn't the same. With that aside, this movie has the most intense and realistic battle scenes ever before shown. Braveheart has many dimensions, the plot is exciting and suspenseful, the characters are well defined and portrayed, and there is an unparalleled scenery and musical accompaniment. A movie complete with everything it needs to make it memorable and special."},{"rating":"2","title":"Braveheart","review":"A fabulous movie made better.

Furthermore the special features included, such as Mel Gibsons commentary, make this a must have for any DVD aficionado."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie, disappointing features","review":"If you're going to buy this DVD, buy it for the movie, not for the extra features. The 28-minute \\"making of\\" documentary was moderately interesting. The greater disappointment was Mel Gibson's feature commentary soundtrack. Not only were there large gaps of silence (you'll sometimes wonder if you've got the right audio channel selected!), but even when he did speak, he doesn't provide any great insight to how he approached a scene. His explanations of some of the technical aspects fall short, too. Frankly, he sounds bored through most of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mel Gibson has done it again!

It has it all, great acting, engrossing storyline, excitement, romance, laughter and above all, fantastic battle scenes. Despite the militaristic nature of the topic this movie goes down well with both men and woman. This is not solely because it stars the good looking Mel Gibson (so my wife tells me), but it's because he excels in his role and is aptly supported by others in the cast. I know of a number of people who have watched this movie well over 50 times and can recite the lines verbatim. Okay, we are not all that devoted to the movie, but it goes some way to conveying how much this movie has captured most peoples imagination.

He brings an sense of dignity to the role, while playing a warrior. The story is one of great proportions.It involves Scotland trying to win it's freedom from England in the 1200's. A leading force in this struggle is a group led by William Wallace (wonderfully played by Mel Gibson)and many others. As his wife, we find the lovely Sophie Marceau,who is excellent. Her character meets a tragic end at the hand of an English soldier. This only fuels Wallace's conquest further. What really makes this film great is wonderful actors like Gibson and Marceau. As well as the storyline, which is just about as good a Historical Drama as they come. I recommend this film to anyone who wants to swept away into a great film"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Entertainment - but also pure rubbish","review":"There's no denying the film itself is a ripping yarn, rousing and exciting - as well as at times brutal and downright gorey - from beginning to end.

They are only seen fighting or running. What I wonder about now is, how do they manage to spend always that masses of energy? I really like this film, but I always watch out for the little impossible details in films. I must admit Braveheart is one of the best films with very few such details. I really enjoyed it, watching a scenery in the Scottish Highlands and an elegy telling the story of a man that is so convinced of his ideals that he is ready to die for it. And with his belief he can convince a whole nation and give them the pride to fight for their right."},{"rating":"2","title":"Braveheart is an interesting film","review":"Braveheart is one of the best films that I have ever seen. I like the story because it is true and interesting. It's very interesting to see how the people fought and lived in that time. There are also very beautiful pictures from the nature in Scotland. In this film you learn something about the history of Scotland. It is good that the film has no happy end, because in real life there isn't always a happy end either. In the battle and in the end of the film there are very terrible situations, which I think is the negative point of the film."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Epic Story that will be Remembered Forever","review":"This movie is pure genious. The epic saga of William Wallace and his fight to free Scotland is an engrossing tale of love, betrayal and freedom. This movie will make you shed tears, laugh, and cheer. The battles are incredibly well done and incredibly gorey as limbs fly across the screen (Not litterally). The story has plot twists and elements that will keep you deeply involved in this 3 hour masterpiece. This movie easily ranks with Gladiator and Patriot but is my all time favorite movie. I reccomend it to anyone. This movie is easy to watch has beutiful scottish scenery. Buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A bit gory and a bit long, but what the heck. Fun film with Gibson's eye for history, too","review":"Well filmed and made (real actorsdoing real roles) but not 100%historically to point. So what!A fine actioner-drama that showswhat kind of good work Mel can dowhen he isn't doing 'Lethal Trash'films...(Heck even Sam Jacksonand Emilio Estevez in Loadedweapon One are better!). Pat Mc-Goohan is outstanding as evil King'Longshanks'. Gibson's \\"Frreeee-dooommm\\" is a haunting reminder ofhow ours is slipping away! And heardon several shortwave radio shows!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bloody, Gory, Totally Awesome","review":"This is definitely one of my favorite movies. Mel Gibson does a spectacular impression of a Scottish warrior. The basic theme is one we can all relate to--freedom from an oppressive government. The battle scenes are realistic and very gory for those of you with bloodlust(You know who you are). Great story, wonderful cast, all the action you could ask for. The ending is heart-wrenching but at the same time leaves you with a feeling of satisfaction. This is definitely a movie you gotta buy. I have seen this movie many times but I still enjoy it each time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top 10 of all times","review":"Since so many people have already written so many great comments, I would just like to say this movie is one of my top 10 movies of all times and everyone should see it! This DVD version is excellent. I especially like the special feature - making of Braveheart."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best","review":"you have got to get this movie it is the best movie i have ever watched. the fight scenes are great. music is awsome. this is a must have for anyone who likes action movies or mel gipson."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"Just brilliant from the acting to the directing.Best Film of the century for me. Romatically none of this happend of course but Mel Gibson will be praised by the Scots for the true portrayal of the english."},{"rating":"2","title":"Braveheart","review":"The Braveheart must be simply THE best movie I ever saw. It is very touching and heroic and there are no silent scenes. All are packed with action and betrayal, hope, love, passion and fight for freedom.It shows what life was really like for Scots in the 13th century. It was very cruel and hard for Scots to live in! It portrays the Englishmen as the most ruthless people on Earth. Of course, that is not so now in 21st century, but in that time period it really was like that!The music of the movie is very beautiful as well - mix of Scottish pipes and chilling tones. The special effects and the gory bloody scenes are completely effective!!!When I watched that movie for the first time, I felt like I was really among the Scots, in the middle of the battlefield, staring at the brutal fight.For anyone who has not seen Braveheart, there is only one thing to say: GO GET IN ON THE VHS!! You will not find another movie with so much good acting, great music and passion as Braveheart!"},{"rating":"1","title":"An historical mess!","review":"There are so many historical inaccuracies and outright lies in this movie that it boggles the imagination. This is way beyond the usual Hollywood \\"artistic license\\". The battle of Stirling, as depicted in the film is not even close to the truth other than the fact that the Scots won. King Edward I never through his sons male lover out of the tower window........the list just goes on and on. I am consigning my DVD copy to the trash can where it belongs."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't really like this movie","review":"Maybe I would be more interested in the story of a man SO HAUNTED by his wife's murder that he leads his country to war if the protagonist wasn't smirking and looking quite care-free through the entire film. Maybe I would think him more heroic if the movie didn't show him, inside, on HORSEBACK, killing an old man who was IN HIS BED... from the perspective of the old man!! It showed Randal Wallace, the \\"hero,\\" killing a bed-ridden geezer from the OLD MAN'S view-point, I'm serious! Am I the only one who had trouble rooting for the elderly-man-crushing hero, telling a few lame jokes to his mates before lightheartedly rushing out to very violently kill dozens of people? The movie can't decide whether it's lighthearted comedy or gripping drama. If you like the movie, don't be offended, I just can't relate to it I guess, mostly because of Mel Gibson's Christ-like killer/hero; he doesn't seem all that brave to me, just really really fake."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible","review":"Some times I feel that Hollywood should stay away form European history altogether.The movie is so boring and so hollywood. It did not impress me,and did not decerve any oscars."},{"rating":"1","title":"See Rob Roy Instead","review":"Rob Roy is a more interesting, memorable, and accurate way to inform and entertain yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do something better with your 3 hours","review":"Is it possible to give no stars to a film? Here are 3 hours I will never have back. The ham-fisted direction of Mr Gibson leaves no cliche untouched and does in 10 minutes what can be done in 1. I have come to expect unnecessary blood and gore from Mr Gibson so this is no surprise but the swelling music and apparent lack of historical accuracy are new. I am still wondering why I bothered sitting through to the end of the film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alba gu bragh!","review":"\\"Scotland Forever\\" is the translation of my title. William Wallace is one of my personal heroes. \\"Braveheart\\" tells the story of his life ... with some definite fiction thrown in for dramatic license and to move the tale along. Even with the factual inaccuracies (e.g., Wallace was a Border scot ... he wore trousers, not a kilt), this is a brilliant, moving film. All cast members played their roles very well. Cinematography and soundtrack are outstanding as well. \\"Braveheart\\" was highly deserving of every accolate it received. I recommend this film to anyone with an interest in medieval history, battle tactics, and Scotland."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of theTop 5 greatest movies ever!","review":"How the heck did Mel Gibson not win best actor for this. He gives one of the greatest acting and directing performances ever. The dialogue was great, it is fairly historically accurate (although William Wallace was actually like 6 feet 8 inches. It has the war scenes to rival Saving Private Ryan, testosterone to match Fight Club and great characters. It is one of the most powerful movies ever in the last scenes and during William Wallaces speeches. They fought like warrior poets, they fought like Scotsmen"},{"rating":"2","title":"This Movie Will Change Your Life and The World","review":"\\"Every man dies - Not every man really lives.\\"\\"Aye, fight and you may die. Run, and you'll live... at least a while. And dying in your beds, many years from now, would you be willin' to trade ALL the days, from this day to that, for one chance, just one chance, to come back here and tell our enemies that they may take our lives, but they'll never take... OUR FREEDOM!\\"This movie changed my life. It made me realize that it would be better to live one moment as a champion than an eternity as a slave. Whenever I feel scared or down, I watch that battle scene, feel that speech, and act that soul."},{"rating":"2","title":"a great movie","review":"Yes, this isn't historically accurate, and yes, the common laymen shouldn't use this as historical reference, but I think this movie does show medieval warfare quite well, not just medieval warfare in Scotland, but just generic warfare. It is horrible close combat slashing, and actually, this movie gets yer adrenaline up better than SPR. Yes, it's patriotic, and I dont like patriotic stories, and yes, it has (as usual) a cheesy love story, but what do you expect?? This is a hollywood movie DIRECTED by a Hollywood star! How could you possibly expect better? This is still a great movie in that it shows medieval warfare better than any other movie ever made."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best movies!","review":"I just had to get a DvD copy of this movie, just so I can watch it whenever the \\"Braveheart\\" in me comes out."},{"rating":"2","title":"A work of art","review":"This movie is truly a work of art...sure, it might not be historicly accurate, but who cares...it's a movie and not a history lesson, get a life people.Anyway, this movie is a work of art..from the set design, cinematography, music, acting, directing, dialouge, and the story all make this film worth watching...I loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must see!!!","review":"Braveheart is one of those movies that you will never forget once you have seen it. Gibson brings to life a moving saga that will leave you breathless. It's a long one, but worth every minute. If you are not a Gibson fan yet, see this, and you will become one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mel: you have to direct another movie!","review":"BRILLIANT! This movie is absolutely brilliant.Mel Gibson's acting is amazingly touching,and his direction is awesome.All performances are excellent.Well-written script,excellent acting,brilliant direction and based on a true story,what more could you ask?"},{"rating":"2","title":"13 yr old girl","review":"I may be only 13 but I appreciated this historical movie. It's really touching, and it's well acted too. This was a man who fought for peace and freedom, not for power and domination. The only strange thing was that the young W.Wallace didn't look at all like Mel Gibson. But for the rest, it's really good and there's a lot of suspens."},{"rating":"2","title":"Braveheart is a wonderful movie.","review":"I have watched Braveheart at least 5 times and it's still just as good as the first time. I like the battles and the action. The drama is pretty good also."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"A good movie...\\"","review":"I learned sometime after I saw this movie that Wallace was a 'low-lander,' which means that he actually would've looked more like the English (wearing plate armor, chainmail, carrying shield, etc.), instead of the raggedy, barbaric-looking 'high-lander' dress they made for the movie. Oh well, I guess if they had called the movie \\"William Wallace,\\" then it might be unrealistic and a crime/tragedy to the historians... However, this movie probably has the best combat scenes ever made for the time period they are portraying... I recently finished a book on warfare in classical greece, and although a different era, found that the emotions, situations, and realism portrayed in the movie is a good representation of what it might have really been like at the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"FREEEEDOM!!!","review":"I think this is definitely one of those movies you either love or hate. I loved it, but I know some people who thought it was crap. Well, those people probably don't like a lot of movies because this flick was better (in my opinion) than many others. The length of it didn't bother me at all....I felt that this movie was appropriately 3 hours long, unlike many other long movies that could've been shorter. No, this one needed to be long. Definitely worth seeing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every Man Dies...Not Every Man Really Lives!!","review":"Best movie ever!!! Even if the historical facts represented in the movie are not entirely accurate, it portrays the harshness and brutality of the time very accurately. Anyone who takes any Hollywood production, fact or fiction, to be the absolute truth is very naive. Mel Gibson rocked and should have won best actor. James Horner did an amazing job with the soundtrack and every time I hear bagpipes I think of William Wallace. This movie has the best ending, the best action scenes, best drama, romance and even some comedy. I can't think of a more complete movie that I have ever seen or that has been made. They only allow 5 stars, but it deserves many, many more!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AWSUM CLASSIC IN NEW SKIN!!!!!","review":"The movie first off is a classic...as anyone knows by now!!!As for the BluRay \\"Sapphire Series\\"....hopefully they will re-release a Golden Plated edition or sumthin!!! like everyone else has kinda mentioned...not so hot upscaling effects on sum spots - but great graphics overall!!!!

But his real talent seems to be realistic looking gore and who needs that?? I don't. I just don't need to entertain myself watching someone build an argument for a violent campaign of revenge and bathing in blood. Who knows who will build some argument in their heart like him and go postal, unloading on the innocent, unknowing public.And Mr. Gibson is having his own crisis personally. Perhaps he doesn't need to be submerged in violence either.... Poe."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Graphic Experience","review":"BRAVEHEART is a lavish production. It depicts medieval warfare fairly accurately in all its bloody glory. Moreover, William Wallace was a real-life Scottish folk-hero. On the other hand, the events shown here have little relation to actual historical events and the graphic bloodiness is almost overwhelming. The end is a visual tribute to man's creativity in finding ways to inflict ghastly physical pain on his fellow man. I watched this once, found it quite interesting, and have no desire to repeat the experience. As a cinematic effort, though, it is beautifully done. If you like lots of blood and gore, you'll love this movie. If not, steer clear."},{"rating":"2","title":"A entertaining movie","review":"Loosely based on the historical figure William Wallace and the Scotish struggle for autonomy from English rule during the 12th and 13th centuries, Braveheart is an action-packed, sometimes moving, epic film. I tend to be leary of such Hollywood renditions of history, but I have to admit that I enjoy the movie. In particular, I think that the graphic fight scenes are a fairly good portrayal of what such hand-to-hand fighting would have been like, although it is likely that in reality it would not have been as dramatic since the crush of men would have been somewhat restrictive. My only complaint is the sappy romance between William Wallace and the Princess of Wales--the movie would have worked just as well without it. Overall, though, a very good and entertaining movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utter Garbage","review":"I don't usually write reviews, but I couldn't let this pass. I knew going in it would be a dissappointment, but the story of Scotland's wars for independence is so important to European and American history that I figured I had to watch it. Setting aside the historical innaccuracies, the assassination of Wallace's character is worse the barbaric execution that Edward I put him through. History reports Wallace as a knight, a brilliant tactician, and more importantly, a gentleman. Nothing like Gibson's adulterous schizophrenic savage. The story of Wallace would be extremely compelling without embellishment. To substitute this garbage is a crime against history and the civilized world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap thrills for mass market minds","review":"Mel Gibson seem to be a mesochist determined to impress the world with his willingness to protray himself suffering with make-believe valiance in some cheezy pretense of historical settings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Braveheart - Unforgettable","review":"Probably my favorite movie, but I enjoy so many different types of movies it really is difficult to list them in order of preference.Mel Gibson and Catherine McCormack, a winning combination. This movie was released in 1995. I can't believe it's been over 10 years! It should capture audiences with at least one of its story ingredients (romance, action, adventure, epic, battles, based on the life of William Wallace for history buffs), and will succeed in several at once.In particular, the love theme encompassing the two stars, whose characters are William Wallace and his wife, Murron, is quite memorable and poignant. A good movie score adds so much to our enjoyment, and this one delivers. It is rated \\"R\\" for \\"brutal medieval warfare,\\" and yes, there are some pretty vivid injuries in the battle scenes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Movie","review":"By now I imagine most people have already seen Braveheart.Although much of the history isn't accurate, I watch it repeatedly. Seeing the scenery takes me back to my trips to Scotland to research my books. The countryside is beautiful, and that beauty is captured in the movie.Randall Wallace freely admits the history isn't correct, yet in the telling of this great story, it's brought a Scottish hero to the hearts and minds of everyone who sees it.If you haven't already been fortunate enough to watch this movie, I heartedly suggest you take the time to do so. I don't think you'll be disappointed.~ Leanne Burroughs, Author of HIGHLAND WISHES and HER HIGHLAND ROGUE"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Greatest Movie Ever","review":"An unbelievable story about a man of bravery and courage.

We once watched watched this movie 8 times in one week. The Scottish Pride is totally moving, and the absolutely wonderful soundtrack emphasizes it perfectly.

They got the names right, but that was about it. For example, Sir William Wallace was a junior lowlands nobleman, not a kilted highland peasant - that's a bit like portraying George Washington as a Native American. Then, yes they did once paint their faces blue in battle - but against the Romans, not against the English. Only about 1300 years out there. And so on throughout the film. The sad thing is, the actual story is so good in itself, there was no need to take liberties with it and mess it all up. But then, what can one expect of a director (Gibson) who managed to confuse the 18th Century British Army with the Waffen-SS in Normandy? (The Patriot) Giving this one star only because the review system won't let me award zero."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST FILM EVER MADE!!!!!!!!","review":"Braveheart is the best film that has ever been made in the history of film-making!!!

First of all, Mel Gibson shows (once again) why he is one of the best actors ever to grace the big screen. Even though his Scottish accent was a little thick, I think he pulled off the role of William Wallace to perfection. But what really makes this such a great movie is it's contrasting scenes. There are very few movies where you can go from a gruesome battle scene one minute to a romantic love scene the next. Two thumbs up for this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great work of fiction based loosely on history","review":"From the bloody battles to the excellent acting, this movie stands as one of my favorite. It's not historically accurate nor should it never had been thought of as. After all we are talking about Hollywood, and Hollywood is about entertainment. The portrayal of a homosexual as a bad guy seemed to be a rather lame attempt to attack the rather oppressive Politically Correct attitude that has spread through American society in order to stir up controversy and, as a result, sales. Whether this was a historical fact or not about the King's son I do not know so I may be wrong.

His uncle came and trained him for awhile. William came back to find his countryman still under Engish. He went back not for his countryman but for a girl but soon enough his love dies and he goes after the english.

The writer himself said that he \\"...never lets history get in the way of a good story...\\"! If you can't make the REAL history of these times into a good story, then perhaps screen writing is NOT your true calling!The plot is perfectly adequate, as is the acting. The action has little to do with \\"realism\\" or true medieval warfare. The history? Just plain WRONG! Wallace was not a Scots/Pict warrior in woad, but a KNIGHT in ARMOUR.

Sure, the movie had decent acting and cinematography but all of the facts and the storyline of the movie SUCKED!I really did not like how he William Wallace got married and then just ends up doing the princess soon after his wife dies, in real events William and the Princess were not even anywhere near the same age. It really took out of the movie for me also because William has all of these epic battle scenes but then he just ends up getting tortured and dies and that made me think a lot less of William as a hero. Overall the movie had some okay fight scenes and the dialogue wasn't bad but this movie to me definately did not live up to the hype."},{"rating":"2","title":"Braveheart","review":"I loved it!

Blue Velvet in Kilts","review":"This is one of the most bizarre and disturbing films I have ever seen. A fairly predictable little story about a specific fight for freedom is turned by Mel Gibson into a picture of twisted masculine desire that makes Blue Velvet look like Barney's Picnic Adventure.

Its high RPM and light weight make it great for accessories like wire brushes and other paint removal products. The keyless chuck is great for changing bits. I use it for projects where I will be using it for long periods of time, like driving lots of deck screws, or removing paint/rust with a wire brush...places a cordless just doesn't hold up. It's a lot better value than a lot of cordless drills, which have their own place. With this drill you get the great Dewalt design and reliability. I have had no problems with mine."},{"rating":"2","title":"If God used a drill, this would be it","review":"WOW! Best value of any corded drill. It has power and easy features.

Most of these songs were big hits in the U.K., but not in the U.S. The album works pretty well, for the most part. He has a top notch band, and the arrangements are good, if occasionally a bit \\"busy\\". Bowie is in good voice, although sometimes his vocals get a bit too \\"hammy\\".

I haven't been the same.This album is fantastic. I cannot stop listening to it. It's that good. Do yourself a HUGE favor and pick this one up. It really really rocks.I cannot BELIEVE that no one has mentioned the incredible drumming of Aynlsey Dunbar on this album...Incredible. Put this one on at your next party, or throw it in with a stack of CDs and press the 'mix' option. have FUN!"},{"rating":"2","title":"objective","review":"Bowie proved his ability to tap into popular culture rather than his musical ability with Pin-ups. It certainly represented a musical zeitgeist at the time and just beat Bryan Ferry's equally nostalgia-filled These Foolish Things to Number 1 in the UK album charts. It contains classic versions of The Kinks 'Where have all the good times gone' and of The Merseys' 'Sorrow'. However, Bowie was not scaling the musical heights that his later work would and this album ranks among one of his weakest of the seventies. It really is for Bowie nuts only."},{"rating":"1","title":"David Bowie Pinups.","review":"The marketing surrounding this item led me to believe (whether my mistake or not) that this CD contained the single \\"Port of Amsterdam\\". That is what I wanted. That song was not on the CD and the CD contents were unappealing to me to the point that after listening to it once completely I have not had any inclination to play it again. I later purchased the CD David Bowie at the Beeb which contained the desired song and I am pleased with it and play it often."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be Warned!","review":"Judging from the five-star review that currently exists here for Pin-Ups, it would seem this is an album you will either love or hate. Personally, I hated it- as much as I love Bowie, I can't deal with his James Dean-inspired take on '50's bop music, which frankly is what you'll find in Pin-Ups. Saturday night brawls, drive-ins, fast Chevys, Betty and Veronica- this is the order of the day here, and sadly David Bowie just doesn't fit into the role. The lyrics and music, coming from Bowie, are ridiculous at best and horribly inappropriate, annoying bubblegum bop at worst. Whereas at the album's release this one could have been dismissed as a bad take on a currently-popular genre, listening to Pin-Ups today is a horrible, horrible experience akin to having one's skin peeled off with a rusted bottle opener. Bowie does not have the energy to make this sad collection of lackluster '50's bop tunes even remotely interesting. First Bowie album I've nearly tossed out the window."},{"rating":"1","title":"'Money-maker'-","review":"is all that comes to mind with this album. Cover albums are not only tacky, but unexpressive, mostly effortless ways for a musician to cash in on songs that as far as I'm concerned aren't theirs to perform or record (live is one thing, this is completely different). I can understand an artist who plays, say, heavy industrial music performing pop songs, because it's a unique take, but this album is a rock artist playing other people's rock songs, umm, wow?Don't get me wrong, Bowie is one of my all-time favorites, I practically worship him, but during the time that this was made Bowie seemed to be in a rush to continue Ziggy's success instead of making great music, though I do love Alladdin Sane and Diamond Dogs and Hunky Dory, but honestly I don't care for Ziggy Stardust very much minus a few very great moments.I do like a couple of cuts on this album, but, like other reviews have stated, it is disappointing not to hear 'Port Of Amsterdam' on here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Odd Collection - Great Band!","review":"Bowie's first and only complete 'covers' album was a mediocre sales item, as most people wanted Bowie tunes. Taken from UK sixties hits, Bowie brandishes a cracker of a band and ups the ante with every song. Updated (at that time) to modern hard driving rock and roll, Bowie improves (in his own way) each song. \\"Sorrow\\" may be the slowest song here, but it's one of the best and one that's been chosen to represent this album on later collections many times. It's easy to argue with the choices, but not with the delivery. The band is tight and the sound is perfect. Not bad at all for a covers album. Definitely deserves a listen!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely superb","review":"This is an album of cover material by one of the great masters in rock history. Just like Let's Spend The Night Together, from his Aladdin Sane album also released in 1973, every cut here leaves the original version in a cloud of dust. Next to Ziggy this is his best effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best in Show,I was 23 the year this came out!","review":"This is my favorite album of all time. It rocks. I know it was only intended as a stocking stuffer,but it is as fabulous as a Faberge egg.I guess it had more to do with living through the sixties and knowing all of the songs on the album, and realizing how progressive and pushing the envelope David's (Mick's) versions are. I give this one as a gift to people, no one has ever said a bad thing about it. The cover is cool,too. That's Twiggy next to him. This one was punk before there was punk by at least two years. Sorrow was performed on the Midnite Special with Marianne Faithful sitting in an enormous swing waving a six foot magic wand all shinny and glittery. Fantastic imagery.

Lo, a lone cloud idling across a mountain peak does not care whether it stays there or passes on; while the bright moon hanging in the firmament is indifferent as to whether the world is silent or noisy.To be circumspect makes one's spirit hard pressed; to be carefree makes one's mind innocent. Do these apply only to the elegance and crudity of poetry and prose? I often see that a wary man acts with artifice, while an unrestrained man reveals his true nature.

You keep expecting the characters to evolve, to grow into something better, or at least different, and none of them really do. Doolittle is still lazy, Pickering always the gentlemen, and most frustratingly, Eliza and Henry are never truly able to understand one another. In the beginning I was an immediate fan, but as the story continued I grew more and more dissatisfied, and by the end I felt that it was a complete waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a piece of crap.","review":"This play was very, very horrible. I give it a second star because at least Shaw (being a dramatist) at least had the sense to realize that this was long enough as it is, why make it longer by making it prose. It was boring, and frankly, I hated EVERY LAST CHARACTER. Shallow, self-absorbed, and the odd thing is, Shaw was celebrating these traits, rather than mocking them. For a while, I thought maybe I was missing some kind of sly mockery, but I went back and checked, and I hadn't. Shaw--who was a socialist, which should tell you something right there--probably should've gone with his beliefs celebrated the worker a little more (he got his licks in with Mr. Doolittle) and the elitist, idle rich a little less, in order to make me believe he was something other than a hypocrite and an elitist himself. And everyone winds up idle rich in the end, after all.

I think it's stupid, to tell us, that only the speech is important to be somebody. We also didn't like to read a play alone. It would have been much more interesting and funny to read it in class, everybody is a certain person. G.B.Shaw seems to know very much about the way of life in every class. He shows the differences in a pretty funny way, and we could get a good idea about those persons. The film is really too long. We didn't like the songs very much, perhaps they are important for understanding, but we think it was not always necessary. We think, today the world is much more complicated, it's not enough to have a good pronunciation to get a good job. And there are too few Higgins-like people in the world.

The answer is \\"not very\\".The songs of course, and many of the scenes they were in, were added, but the main dialog was straight from the original.The biggest difference, and one that I assume most of the fans of the musical wouldn't like, is the \\"sequel\\" written by Shaw that describes the characters' lives after the end of the play. I know my wife will be disappointed if she ever reads it.As for the edition: I noticed no problems with it and it's hard to argue with the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a fairy tale!","review":"Contrary to what many people believe, this is not a rags to riches story. Anyone who reads it will see that it is certainly not a Cinderella story. They changed the story a bit for the movie \\"My Fair Lady,\\" so be careful. (Do not just rent the movie for English class!) The story is about the ridiculous shallowness and stupidity of the English upper class. Most of the characters are self-involved, so don't expect a romance. The play is still very good. Shaw is a very witty and enjoyable writer. I reccomend him highly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wonderful play, but this version...","review":"I know many will look at my low rating and think, \\"What!\\" However, the rating is not based on the play, which is wonderful, but this version of the play. Many will be attracted to this version because of the price, but there is a reason why this book is so cheap. There are several humorous or key scenes missing from the Dover Thrift version. Just to name a few: the bath scene, the whole ball/party scene with Nepommuck and Freddy's proposal.If you're looking for just a taste of the play or if a reader has low/limited attention span, than this might be the version for you. But if you are looking to read the play as it was written, to enjoy the humor and satire of Shaw, than I suggest a different version--perhaps the Penguin Classics edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Work well","review":"Installed them on a fence for my router table.

Therefore, like I had previously thought,this book is not at all true! Sanchez is a good writer and he must be given credit for that. But, he shouldn't have written this story as his own true-to-life events, when in fact it was based on happenings that occurred to a few of friends.

He explains the cycle of poverty, abuse, drugs, racism and violence in one of the many inner city gulags in America. As i was reading this book i created a soundtrack to it by making a play list on my ipod of music by Immortal Technique, Welfare Poets and Mobb Deep, there are times when he talks about how he was proud of being violent when intoxicated but the second he's sober he would feel awful about the crimes he commited.

Using the unsolved infamous Lost Colony of Roanoke in the late 1500's, writer/star Scott Cooper weaves a psychological tale of paranoid SCHIZOPHRENIA. Cooper utilizes gloomy settings, often incoherent passages and a totally ineffective conclusion. Cooper himself is totally wrong in the leading role. He has little emotional range, stiff and unconvincing. More talented actors are wasted in cardboard caricatures: Tom Skerritt as the credit-stealing father; Kris Kristofferson as the enigmatic homeowner; Rachel Nichols as the tolerant wife; Scott Wilson as the country doctor; Tom Bower as the disgruntled sheriff; Joanna Cassidy as the registry clerk, and an unrecognizable Skeet Ulrich as the redneck mechanic. And what happened to the whistling realtor?I did find myself involved in the movie, which is mild in terror/gore which is often refreshing. But it's not scary and the payoff is disappointing. Rent it, but don't buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ghostly and hauntingly Movie","review":"This is a movie about a guy that lets his mind run wild and ultimately loses it.

This book was a complete a waste of time and money.

Vampires, \\"witches\\" (we won't even go into the gross distortion and perpetuating stereotypes here), demons, devils... wasn't this supposed to be a \\"scientific\\" book about Ghost Hunting?!? I can't help but wonder if all those \\"rave\\" reviews are personal friends of Mr. Brandon... Not worth it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointed","review":"I bought this book on recommendations from other ghost hunters on-line. I was truly disappointed. First, the book is full of spelling and grammatical errors. So much so that it distracts from the reading. Second, what appears to be hypocritical content. In one place, the author rips apart the Amityville horror case, basically calling it a fraud. He doesn't even mention that one of the foremost demonologist couples, the Warrens, visited the house and was convinced. But later, he uses the Warrens as they dealt with other cases, treating them with the respect they deserve; but only, apparently, as long as they covered cases the author was comfortable with. Third, he quotes the Bible in several parts of the book, and slams Witchcraft. As a Wiccan, I was offended to read that I was being duped by demons, practicing what I thought was positive magick. I am very disappointed in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Low","review":"Low being Bowie's 1977 release and his first in the Berlin triology and it did very well in the UK charts peaking at #2 and reached #11 in the Billboard 200 and #10 in Norway. \\"Sound and Vision\\" being the only track release as a single did quite well and peaked at #3 in the UK Singles Chart.

Its one of those albums (for most people). Personally, I went off on an Eno tagent for quite some time before I came back to this one. Truly brilliant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vocal and instrumental music in a brilliant combination","review":"This is the album that finally convinced me of David Bowie's genius. Of course, he has help from people like Brian Eno and Iggy Pop (who sings backing vocals on \\"Sound And Vision\\"), but this is very clearly a David Bowie album.The songs are epigrammatic - short terse lyrics - with colourful and interesting instrumental accompaniment. The instrumental pieces (they are NOT songs! and should not be referred to as such) range from disco styled pieces (\\"Speed of Life\\" and \\"A New Career In A New Town\\") to more pensive, ambient styled and lengthy works on side two of the original LP.One wonders what Mr. Bowie was listening to during this Berlin period? Gorecki, perhaps? It doesn't really matter because this is a splendid album from one of contemporary music's greatest figures. I feel that his previous albums became 'mere pop music' after the release of Low."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Bowie's 2 best, must-have albums, along with Ziggy.","review":"This album lays down the foundation for ALL electronic music in popular music. Depeche Mode, Nine Inch Nails, Blur, some Smashing Pumpkins, Marilyn Manson... All benefit from this album's sweeping vision. THE greatest Bowie album in my opinion. It has opened me up to SOOO much music that is out there including Roxy Music, Brian Eno, Kraftwerk, Faust, etc. If you own this and The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and The Spiders From Mars, you need no more Bowie. It's a treat, but unnecessary. I'm repeating myself, but if it weren't for Low no techno, industrial, or ambient would be around in popular music today. This is one of the 10 greatest rock records of all time, PERIOD."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my personal favorites!","review":"I am so happy that David Bowie's 1977 album Low is finally getting the attention it deserves after all these years of neglect.This is Bowie's opus magnum, masterpiece, creme de la creme,...[insert pretentious laudatory phrase here], etc.This is Bowie for those who want a little more substance than Ziggy Stardust or Young Americans.Please buy! Buying this album was one of the better record-buying decisions I've made. Very worthwhile!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Two sides to the synth!","review":"This marvelous album consists of short, melodic songs like Speed Of Life, Breaking Glass, What In The World, Sound & Vision and long, dark pieces like Warszawa, Art Decade, Weeping Wall and Subterraneans. My favorites include the catchy Sound & Vision with its poetic lyrics and brilliant guitar hook and of course the atmospheric Breaking Glass which inspired Nick Lowe's \\"I Love The Sound Of Breaking Glass\\" on his Pure Pop For Now People album. The short pop pieces are strangely addictive in their robotic minimalism, while the long instrumentals are quite evocative but they would probably appeal more to lovers of classical music than your average Bowie fan. (Those who like Gorecki's \\"Three Sorrowful Songs\\" would love them). On Low, Bowie took synth music in two very different directions. This was a groundbreaking album for its time and remains a remarkable listening experience although I definitely prefer the first part."},{"rating":"2","title":"only one word for this one:","review":"WARSZAWA!!!this must be the most stunning piece of music ever written byBowie,the rest of the album is also VERY good but this trackis so beautiful it almost leaves me with tears in my eyes(andI'm definitely not a big fan of instrumental music)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Original, on the edge","review":"The first half of \\"Low\\" is original and cutting edge stuff. Lyrics that could mean anything serve as a Rorhshach for the listener to make out of them as he wishes. The music is wonderfully avant garde-short, dynamic pieces that stick with you long after the cd is over. If you liked Gary Numan's \\"Cars\\", you will have a fair idea of what this album is like-new sounding even years after its release. This is \\"New Wave\\" at its best. I must have played these songs hundreds of times. The second half of the CD is not as successful as the first. After the fast paced, quick changing, break necked pace of side one (on the record album), side two contains long, brooding pieces full of synthesizer and odd vocalising. Some of it is enjoyable, some of it I never returned to after two or three listens. Essential Bowie. This was made when he was interested in and able to produce strikingly original records."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Stepping Stone","review":"\\"Low\\" markes a major artistic change in Bowie's musical cannon.Leaving glam rock almost totally behind the artist nuckles downwith an album the features short,simple pop/rockers on the firstside with side 2 dominated by several Boie/Eno synthetic ambientsoundscapes.The first side is slightly fun yes but side 2 ismassively influencial on both modern new-age music and industrialambient-good stuff to relax to,mabye with some bird sound effects.Those interested in David Bowie as an artistic leadershould go no further!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the greatest piece of music EVER.","review":"For those who listen to music in a more evolved way, Low will please on almost as many levels as the insturment layering."},{"rating":"1","title":"lung sounds","review":"This product does not come with the cd like it promises.

Well then, you haven't seen Vampires vs. Zombies. This is the second worst movie I have ever seen, (Troll II being the worst). This must have been filmed in somebody's back yard. If you enjoy zombie movies, do not bother with this. If you enjoy vampire movies, please stay away. The only thing keeping this from being the worst movie ever is that fact that there is a little bit of comic self-awareness. And, I hesitate to mention this, because it will lead to some hard-up teenager renting this movie, but there are a couple of topless shots included. The director was not a complete dunce, which is why this is second only to Troll II as the worst movie of all time.

Consequently, Vampires and Zombies battling never transpired in this film, if you choose to call this rubbish a film. Therefore, I am a bit disconsolate that I was misdirected by the alluring title of this movie. I feel like it lied to me, like some women I have dated. The type of woman who presents herself in one manner and really is the complete opposite, well that is Vampires and Zombies in a nutshell.There were a couple of cute girls in this movie, but if I wanted to observe a movie with cute girls I would have shopped other genres of cinema.

I only watched about five minutes of it and stopped it. I didn't think there would be any movies made in 2004 would be low budget crap. It's usually movies that were made eariler. But, I was wrong.

The metal is of poor quality, not like their usual silver products, The globe itself actually looks really cheap and ugly. I'm thinking that maybe if I found a round stone to fit inside and glued the lock shut then it might work, depending on if I can get the metal shined up to standard.

The globe inside is a deep blue, and the continents are made up of different stones. The quality of the chain seems good, and the globe is not too bulky, so she can wear it comfortably without feeling like there is a giant ball hanging around her neck. The bad thing about this item is the lock that keeps the stone globe inside the case. It is just a little tab that clicks into a hole, but either the tab is not big enough or the hole is not deep enough. We have had the globe pop out five times now. Luckily it's been in the mall or while we were walking through a parking lot, so we were able to retrieve the globe every time.

Clark's strengths are in her plot lines and her pacing. But with boring dialogue and shallow characterization, I just don't find myself caring about the characters by the end of the story. This will be the last one I bother reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Suspence Book","review":"This was the 2nd book i read that mary higgins clark has written. i thought it was soooo good i enjoyed trying to guess who did it. as in most of her book that i have now read the one who seems innocent is the guily party. this book is no exception to that!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read, but not recommended","review":"***NO SPOILERS***This is the first book I've read by this author, and I must say it was a very enjoyable read. I constantly found myself saying, \\"One more chapter... one more chapter...\\" because some chapters are only one page long! At this point, you're probably wondering why I get it 4 stars? Well, I didn't find the ending to be awesome, which is what I think it needed to be 5 stars. The author sort of built the story up, and up, and up.... and then BAM! Here's the bad guy! Thanks for reading, bye!Good read, but not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Good, Not the Best","review":"Clark is very talented, but doesn't show it in this book compared to some of her others. At some points the different stories all blend together and get rather confusing. If you love Mary Higgins Clark, I'd go for a different book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pseudo-personality. . .?","review":"While being a regular reader of Mrs. Higgins-Clark, I just couldn't get myself to understand how a talented lady like herself could write a book like Let Me Call You Sweetheart. While the idea behind the book is quite good and original, the building of suspens is mediocre and her character cartoonish. This is not what she usually writes. That brings us to ask ourselves one question... Is that the same Mary Higgins-Clark who brought us such succulent novels like Silent Night and Moonlight Becomes You, or was this written by a low-budget copy-cat. The ladder would seem the saner thing to think.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"I'm not sure which of Mary Higgins Clark's booksI read first but when I opened it and read on thefirst page Rt. #4 and Bergen County, N.J. I knewI was home. I now live in Grant County, Wis. butwas born in N.J.( and went to the same high school as Ms. Clarks's daughters). All of Ms. Clarks books take me back and I can vividlysee where the action is taking place. Besidesthe familiar surrounds, I truly love all of thesebooks and there story lines. I look forward toeach new novel. I have read them all and don'tknow which is best. Each is better then the onebefore it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Was a dissapointment, not MHC's best","review":"I've read about 10 Mary Higgins Clarks books and many people said this one was great. It was not. The story jumped around and got confusing and the end was a total disappointment. It was like she couldn't think of an ending, although she dropped lots of hints what it would be, but you just didn't believe she would do it. Don't give up on her, just don't bother reading this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lukewarm","review":"Well, rats . . . this book had so much potential. The idea was great and there were good characters: an old murder that resulted in an innocent man being put in jail, a freaky plastic surgeon \\"re-creating\\" women's faces to look just like the daughter he had been grieving over, an aspiring politician facing consequences of a renewed investigation and of course, there's an assortment of slimy criminals and all kinds of secrets that unfold throughout. The middle of the book is about where it's at it's best, but it just seemed sloppy and rushed at times, especially the ending. If you're looking for a fast-paced whodonnit and a quick read, you'll probably do fine with this. If you would like a little more depth and suspense, though, Mary Higgins Clark's \\"Moonlight Becomes You\\" is great or as another reviewer suggested, pick up any classic by Agatha Christie."},{"rating":"1","title":"is this all there is?","review":"so many holes you could drive a truck through the plot... soft, sappy and silly... is this the best this author can write? i was surprised this wasn't her first book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A perfect mix of supence and mystery.","review":"I already love Mary Higgins Clark,but this is my favorite book.

The triangle shape makes them easy to grip, and they seem to last longer and be sturdier than other brands, breaking far less easily. Colors are also just as bright as other brands. The tray is sturdy and the lid is great for viewing colors, especially on occasions when you only want them to pick out one color at a time. Great product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great set of crayons","review":"I purchased two sets of these crayons. Overall, I'm very pleased with them.What I like:No wrappers!!They are more durable than normal crayons. My kids have broken some but nowhere near as fast as they normally do. The shape and thickness helps distribute the pressue better.The triangular shape keeps them on the table and off of the floor.The color variety is brilliant. The set offers a better variety of hues than average crayons.They are easier to clean off of surfaces.What I'm not crazy about:The smell. I can't stand the way these smell. It's not offensive, just not pleasant. My kids could care less.The case is difficult for smaller children to open. This can be a pro though because my kids can't get into them when I'm not nearby and this puts a damper on any wall coloring plans.Although I like that there are no wrappers, it is sometimes difficult to distinguish some of the darker shades.Overall I give this 5-stars and I will purchase these again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible crayons-Don't understand other reviews!","review":"I bought these crayons for my daughter based off of the very good reviews they received from other people. I honestly can't even begin to understand WHY people say such good things about crayons. They are NOT durable...maybe they are more durable then the thinnest Crayola crayon but certainly not the jumbo crayons. The color is so light and barely there, it's not fun for young children. The crayons feel weird and are not at all like the color of the actual crayon when the color is on paper. These are the worst crayons I think we've ever used and that includes cheap crayons you get at a restaurant for kids to color with. I usually love Melissa and Doug but I am HIGHLY disappointed with these crayons."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Crayons!","review":"My daughter loves these! The draw nicely and have a great feel. She sometimes steps on them so they have broken, but I don't think that's the product's fault"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Crayons.","review":"I got these crayons for my 2 year old who loves to color! I really like the lack of paper, and the inability to differentiate some of the darker colors doesn't bother me and definitly not my daughter. It's not that hard to get the color you want anyway. I love that they are non toxic and they are more durable than regular wax crayons. Not a single one broken yet with plently of use and leaving them on the floor. The colors go down smoothly enough and are bright enough. We did have one crayon that wouldnt write at all, but with a little whittling by my husband, it works fine now. I guess there was a plastic resin peice that didn't get colored. Once it was removed, the crayon writes fine. I like the hard case, but it is difficult for my 2 year old to open on her own - not necessarily a bad thing! I wish the lid of the case flipped all the way back to lessen the required space for the case to sit.

The center CZ stone is very large, and does not look like a diamond. So far, so good, I've had it a month, and have not lost any stones or seen any signs of it falling apart. It's great for a temporary ring or for occaional wear as a cocktail ring with some bling! I love the filigree setting, it's very vintage-looking, and the sterling silver also gives it an antique appearance. It's true to size, it has a very thin band, and is comfortable.

I'm not much into piano music in general, however, when I heard his piano playing, I became captivated, and decided I must have his music.

What sentence would you neglect to underline? I defy you to find one.Russell's passage describing the fatigue caused by restless worry hit extremely close to home. And his passage describing the child of two from the city experiencing a \\"primitive, simple and massive\\" joy during his trip to the country was exhillerating for this reviewer.After reading this book, and rereading this book, I felt like shouting: \\"This is why we have great philosophers -- to express these ideas in these words.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"gloriously obvious","review":"Essentially a self-help book written by the hypereminent philosopher Bertrand Russell. I have not read any other self-help books I don't think but from what I know this one is completely different: well-thought out, insightful and completely lacking in poppy answers. My real pleasure was getting an insight into Russell's way of thinking, his humour, his zest for life, his outlook which may seem simple or naive but is in my opinion far superior to most.The book is very dated - from the 1930s. However the advice is not - in fact I have nothing but admiration for how far ahead of his time Russell was. Those few actually-dated passages only serve to endear the book more.Heartily recommended. Contrary to popular belief, it often takes nothing short of genius to state the obvious, especially if an entire society is blinded to it. In the Conquest of Happiness, Russell does exactly that."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Enduring Secret of Happiness","review":"This is a great book that I got to read when I was in college. Betrand Russell boils down human origin of happiness to some basic things in life.

Every now and then, Russell does tend to be somewhat full of himself, and over-simplify or typecast the human psyche and spirit, but overall a very thought provoking book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book puts life in wonderful perspective.","review":"Russell makes a departure from philosophy with this work, which is really more akin to bibliotherapy. In various chapters, he discusses all kinds of things that make people both unhappy (e.g., competition, boredom, fatigue) and happy (e.g., affection, family, work). His focus is really on what we can do to be happy on a consistent basis; he's not looking for a temporary fix.Perhaps his 'philosophy of happiness' can best be summarized in this wonderful quote: 'Of all forms of caution, caution in love is perhaps most fatal to true happiness.' Succinct and true."},{"rating":"2","title":"75 Years Old and Still Poignant Today","review":"A nice combination of philosophy and self-help guides the reader through what makes a person feel the way they do and how to change it. It is divided well: because first you'll want to know what's wrong, then things that make it better, then the total person to walk away as. Many of his examples of what makes us unhappy are definitely around today, retaining much of what made the book poignant.Surely, it is dated. Russell explains to the reader how much of a stress it must be to see planes in the air. Stuff like this does not change the flow of the book to a modern reader though. My mind replaced Russell's old examples with new ones. His general arguments still apply."},{"rating":"2","title":"A clear vision in a clear prose style.","review":"So often we reguard happiness as something that happens to us, independantly of our mental and physical habbits. In the \\"Conquest Of Happiness\\", Russell refutes this fallacy, and encourages his readers to consider pro-active measures to both eliminate unhappiness and to ensure our happiness by rationally considering his advice, without self-absorbation or muddled thinking.The advice is very practical in nature and very much addressed to the general reader. Given the age of the book however, (first published in 1929), the language can tend to be a little malestream at times.However, if the reader is willing to wave a bye-ball on this minor draw back, Russell's prose style still is capable of charming and entertaining his audience, rather like a good parent might humor a disruptive child.

Yet Flannagan has taken scholasticism to the extreme, sacrificing all for footnotes in a mad zeal to, like the old Welsh poets, show off his research. Thus this book's perfect audience comprises graduate pedants lost in footnote fogs, loving every minute of brilliant insights like, \\"This comma was omitted in the 1676 Edition.\\" A high disappointment, especially since THE RIVERSIDE CHAUCER is very, very strong. But still, THE RIVERSIDE MILTON'S not a total waste (the introductions are well written and often insightful).Other reviewers have already identified the problems with so many footnotes, so I won't rehash.

Tracey Scoggins won me over with this episode, although I still like Ivanova better. As for \\"Tragedy of Telepaths,\\" also a good and interesting episode.

I would say buy this as a gateway drug to these wonderful pieces then go out and buy a great version - however, just enduring these performances has killed my desire to hear these works again, and given me the image of Mozart dressed up in a red spandex devil costume and laugh laugh laughing at me.

Instead of taking the time to understand the key sources, the author makes use of low quality secondary sources combined with guess work and speculation. Sube'etei can be associated with more than 20 campaigns and more than 35 battles. The author deals only with a few of these and not even able to reconstruct these correctly.

Entirely missing are the engaging orchestrations and adventurous spirit of Arkenstone's other recordings. As background atmosphere for a TV special, I guess that the music is suitable, but for everyday listening this one is entire unmemorable. Save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"vintage costello","review":"This album found Costello at the peak of his songwriting powers. Nick Lowe's production give's the record a harsh sound when compared with Costello's first three efforts. The Attractions have never sounded better, as is apparent on exuberant 'Five gears in reverse'. Although there is plenty of up-tempo invective on display, the highlights for me are the record's more tender moments. I particularly like the uncharacteristically straightforward ballad, 'Motel Matches', where a woman gives away sex like motels give away matches. As in many of his songs, the narrator treads a fine line between revulsion and compassion for the song's female subject. This album is a study in conciseness. Costello demonstrates more songwriting talent on these twenty tracks than other artists manage over a whole career. The volume of songs here make this record one that rewards attentive, repeated listening. Treat it like a seven course meal to be enjoyed over several hours."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mr. McManus's Best?","review":"I was an Elvis fan from the release of My Aim Is True. By the time this album was released, I'd become convinced that he and The Attractions could do no wrong. First time I heard it was when a NYC radio station played it in it's entirety, and I listened on headphones while I taped it. That's how you should listen to it if you've never heard it before. To hear so many great songs one after the other, it makes you dizzy. I got the same feeling the first time I heard \\"London Calling\\". All these years later, some of the Clash music doesn't thrill me like it did then, but this album does."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spellbound","review":"There have been so many reissued versions of this album over the years, some with bonus tracks, that it gets confusing trying to keep up with what's in print and what isn't. But the bottom line remains: this is a flawless, fantastic, fun album. Surely a candidate for my favorite albums of all time. I've been listening to these songs for the past 30 years and they still sound fresh and exciting. Costello was on a roll when he recorded this collection of pop and soul masterpieces. Don't miss it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The rhythm, the lyrical flow, and the attitude","review":"Probably the most clever album I own; only to be followed by Elvis's \\"Armed Forces\\" and \\"Imperial Bedroom\\". Elvis and the attractions are more of a force on these 30 tracks than on any of his others. I bought this album before I really could appreciate the art of word crafting. It took reading many acclaimed novels, and sampling other hailed lyricists (Bono, Eminem, Springsteen, Dylan, etc..) to make my decision on who the lyrical King was; most properly the title goes to Elvis. In my opinion Elvis wrote the book on word play, and combined with the perfectly crafted accompaniment (provided by the attractions) we have 30 \\"stick it to 'em\\" bold and brazen classic songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Get Happy","review":"This CD was recommended to me by someone who I thought was a person of good taste: I now know otherwise. I don't know what you have to do to sit through this entire record but I barely got through the first five tracks before I was fed up. All I heard were a bunch of shallow, lyrical cliches; trite, undeveloped, unexplored tunes that were too short to be anything but shallow; and an overall delivery that was less interested in being interesting than it was in fulfilling some unfathomable whim of Costello's . I started playing it with high hopes, and after the first song I said \\"that's IT?\\" I kept listening hoping it would get better, but it went nowhere. So there I was, stuck with a CD I couldn't return: it went in the trash. Lesson: ALWAYS, ALWAYS listen to a CD before you buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elvis's best work ever - stands the test time.","review":"I was a pleasantly surpised at how good this album was when I first bought it back around 1979.

A well-researched, in-depth, scholarly account that seeks to draw as balanced an interpretation as possible from the legacy of evidence and testimonies that has survived the centuries, The Rise And Fall Of The Knights Templar will prove a valued addition to collegiate Medieval Studies collections and wonderfully accessible to non-specialist general readers with an interest in the fabled Knights Templar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Below average read","review":"This was a highly anticipated purchase and read for me but I came away very displeased with Gordon Napiers book.Rather than go into any detail, Gordon Napier skipped from one subject to another before the reader could catch your breath.

Coyote resembles nothing short of an agent of Bacchus, welding god-like powers of creation, with basal human desires and weaknesses.In his anthology, Lopez has focused strictly on the Coyote of Native American lore, and thus has attempted to filter out most of the more modern interpretations and spin-offs, as well as removing any european influences. The observation that Lopez was not entirely successful in this effort shows the difficulty of such a task. The last story, \\"Coyote Finishes His Work\\", shows a distinctly \\"Euro-christian\\" influence. However, Lopez was at least successful enough to distinguish this piece from Bright's \\"Coyote Reader\\". Both are excellent works, and deserve your eye."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book!","review":"The Dead Sea Scriptures explores the Qumran scoll writings which were found in the Qumran caves in 1940 by a young Bedouin boy. The Dead Sea Scrolls were originally a part of the Scriptures before it was removed by the unbelievers for whatever reason.

This violinist is comparatively young who looked to be in his mid-thirties. I first came across him right after I've heard Heifetz. Interestingly this violinist's hand/fingers resemble that of Heifetz, albeit it that his are slightly larger. Of course, he has less drama and less facility than Heifetz. But he didn't come out too badly in comparison. He reminds me more of Zimmermann who is of about the same age, and one couldn't really say who is better. But then the latter is so popular now. He also reminds me of Suk who shares his fate by not having the due recognition of the American market. Broadly speaking, his approach is more classical than romantic and he is just graceful on the stage, quite a contrast to Gidon who hops and gasps on the stage. The recording is very good but it's nothing like a DG.

In simple yet profound messages, Thompson communicates her belief that we must discard much of the traditional baggage with which we have burdened ourselves, becoming divine renegades.

Ms. Baird's voice conveys the full emotions that a mother feels for her new baby with clean and open singing. The first track in particular, \\"All Through The Night,\\" still makes me teary.

I am continually charmed and refreshed by the subtlety, taste and musicianship that has gone into these arrangements of well- and lesser-known gems. Apart from the joy of the simple yet perfect chordal progressions, listen to the warm, caressing tone imparted by the low bass notes in the piano in many of the tracks. The pace is so wonderfully leisurely, there is time to savour each song or piece, and yet each lasts only two or three minutes. The three diverse yet complementary singers, each with a tender and gentle presence suiting the subject matter, give a sense of a 19th century family musical evening. Magical."},{"rating":"2","title":"Musical Perfection","review":"This is our family's favorite music CD for a baby. Julianne Baird sings these traditional lullabies so sensitively and beautifully. She sings with the depth of interpretation of a classical singer but also with a warm simplicity and little vibrato. The book is a treasure (I agree with others that it would be helpful to have the lullabies in the same order as the CD, but there is a table of contents and an index), and if you can play the piano a little, the arrangements are simple and lovely. Listening to the whole CD is like listening to a wonderful concert.

Since Nintendo has the extra thick covers on the controllers, they don't fit in the spot for them in this case.

The songs that stand out the most to me are Chalk Dust Torture, The Lizards, Collective Soul's \\"Shine\\" (which features Tom Marshall, who wrote many Phish lyrics), and The Lizards. The jams on almost every song are incredible. This is far better than Hampton Comes Alive and (the practically flawless) A Live One. Buy this show. It's worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hands Down Best Offical Live Phish Release","review":"I just finished listening to MSG NYE '95 and I have to say that this is hands down the best of all the Phish live albums released so far. The sound is fantastic, far better than any live Phish recording that I have ever heard (and I've heard hundreds). Page's keys, Mike's bass and Fish's drums shine through brilliantly (Trey's guitar sounds fine too, it's just that Trey is always high in the mix).Phish is firing on all cylinders: the song selection, energy and theatrics are top notch. Coming off the heels of the Halloween Quadrophenia and a great fall tour, the end of '95 finds Phish, for the first time, peerless in the jam scene after the demise of the Grateful Dead five months earlier. This is Phish fully coming into their own after 10+ years as a band leading up to their '97 peak, and it is an exciting time indeed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best shows ever","review":"Just got this for Christmas and haven't stopped listening to it for 3 days. Better than Hampton comes alive at almost a third of the price. Trey proposes the question what if we were forever stuck in 1994 as the band begins playing Shine by Collective Soul... need I say more?"},{"rating":"2","title":"the best there is","review":"if there ever was a show that NEEDED to be released from the soundboard, it is this one. The Grail of shows. The energy was purely tangible. Not to wax poetic but MSG shook that night like it never had and never will. Whether you are new to Phish or an old head, this is the one to hear. The YEM is worth the cost alone. One of the best nights of my life, hands down. Anyone who was there would tell you the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"As overrated as it gets.","review":"The last 6 minutes of a 25 minute long \\"You Enjoy Myself\\" - so loved by Phisheads that it's been nicknamed YEM - are 6 minutes of my life that I will never get back. They're almost as bad as Lou Reed's Metal Machine Music.If you want to listen to what *can* be done with 20+ minute tracks of live rock, please turn to Built to Spill's Cortez the Killer, or to any old Allman Brothers.And as for the rest of the album? It's mostly just boring.If you're not committed already to loving Phish - be warned and stay away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow, just wow","review":"Great, if you're an insomniac.

BUT due to the mounting points being too close together the poles are not held up at all and i may as well have just put them in the back with the rod tips hitting the roof on the way towards the front seats. It did come with custom mounting points that can be installed in you attic garage or otherwise used in an old vehicle to add correctly spaced mounting points.

Unlike reading, Word Spin won't make you carsick, and will not easily bore. If being able to rotate the pieces wasn't enough, they also come off of the rod in the center, adding more challenge to this already somewhat-difficult game. Yet another great aspect of this toy is that the pieces are magnectic, therefore making it harder to lose them. I'd recommend Word Spin for kids age 10 and up, especially those who have good vocabularies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solidly constructed","review":"Simply put, this tool does the job. It is well constructed and built for heavy-duty use. I found out the hard way that the only reliable way to get quality cuts is to use a feeder. It's also a terrific safety device. It keeps your hands from getting anywhere near the cutter. Without it, you must stop feeding the material to reposition your hands and results in imperfections in the final product.I gave it 4 stars only because the gear cover is plastic and the knobs/studs that hold it in place are cheaply made. These items were damaged when I received the feeder and replaced under warranty. The rest of the machine is excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bobby McFerrin (Wizare of Oz) and others","review":"Had this as a cassette--ah, remember those?

Once the driver was installed, I was immediately presented with a list of networks including the one I never ever was able to connect. Funny one of the reasons I got this card was possibility of connecting the external antenna but seems like I really don't need it. The signal quality is excellent and the connection is as stable as with a wired network. I'm surprized to read the review where the card couldn't see some network. Oh well, it worked for me.

This book is relatively short and absolutely eye-opening in concept and detail. Jean Gimpel's essential observation is that the 11th-13th centuries were ages of consistent technological advancement and standards of living, and really aren't the 'dark ages' at all. Much of this technology/knowledge was lost during the subsequent continent-wide warfare and black death of the 14th-15th centuries. In terms of large scale industry (e.g. the thousands of labor-saving water mills catalogued in the Domesday book) organization (some of the earliest corporate structures were these same water mills) Europe was already very advanced 900 years ago.This book provides great data on the period while forcing us to rethink how primitive those times really were.

I find the instructions to be informative and the sections on recognizing foods, grading foods and storing foods to be exceptional. The explanation of techniques is informative and cumulative; the techniques used in later chapters build on earlier ones. There are hundreds of classic recipes which help you exercise technique. My main complaint is the lack of a measurement standardization. Dry goods can be measured in weight or volume, sometimes in the same recipe! Some of the recipes occasionally need a taste \\"pick-me-up\\". Still, its an excellent reference and I would recommend it to any serious home chef or would-be professional."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of techniques I never heard of before","review":"This book is a great reference guide and I needed something to help me once in a while because I am in the restaurant business.

While this book is certainly a superb introduction to the theory of infinite abelian groups, it does a better job of teaching familiarity with the methods of proof commonly used in more advanced mathematics. As such, the book is extremely accessible, requiring only the absolute basics of group theory. On the other hand, it does require a certain level of \\"mathematical maturity,\\" the ability to learn with a minimum of motivation and fill in gaps in proofs. For the specialist looking for a reference on infinite abelian groups, I would recommend both volumes of Laszlo Fuchs'Infinite Abelian Groups, Volume 1, Volume 36-I (Pure and Applied Mathematics), which is aimed more at the professional mathematician than the amature."},{"rating":"1","title":"I do not recommend this video.","review":"Poor animation, hard-to-understand narration, and unimaginative story lines did not hold my son's attention - nor mine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this video!!","review":"This video is horrible.

I found the vocal ensemble undistinguished, the orchestral sound and conducting unremarkable at best. \\"Matrimonio\\" is a piece I know well; the score has tremendous charm and many beautiful and witty moments throughout. It does need a very strong ensemble equipped with pretty voices and solid technique, strong personalities, and theatrical flair. It doesn't survive a mediocre recorded performance well. I'm hopeful of finding a better version. (I haven't heard the Barenboim in decades, but I remember its being very well sung.

As I listened, I was so let down. I thought this album was a noisy mess with weak songs. As time passed, I thought perhaps I'd been subverted by my own high expectations, so I bought the Ryko reissue and gave it another chance. Well, my opinion hasn't changed.

It shows, through winsome narratives, how God gently works in the inner places of human hearts, in ways that are visible only to Him. This spiritual process is much like the physical conception of a baby: new life is growing within a person long before the rest of us can see obvious evidence of that fact. SPIRITUAL BIRTHLINE is thus a great encouragement for youth leaders, missionaries, pastors, lay people . . . every believer who desires to see others come into the family of God.

The tasks in the game were very unimaginative, and very little fun.The only good thing about this game is the graphics. they are pretty good, but, they should have spent more time making the game FUN!...I would not recommend this game to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"a Captain's Tale","review":"the Kansas band maybe from the heartland, but thier music and lyrcs has the flavor of the sea. It's strange and unknown(I'm not just referring to Point of Know Return). As bands like Yes incorporated the medieval harpsicord, harp ect, Chicago the flutes and wind instruments(trombone and trumpet), Kansas incorporates the violin or \\"fiddle\\" as we Okies call it. Robbie Steinhardt and his rapid and very coordinated fiddle playing is the best part of the band and he plays with the ferocity of electric gitars. As Niel Peart is to drums so Robbie Steinhardt is to the fiddle(violin). He's also a good singer along with Steve Walsh. Steve Walsh does the lion's share of singing. Steinhardt sings Tempus and many of the Point of Know return songs not too many Leftoverture songs though."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO MORE COMPILATIONS PLEASE !!!!!!!!!!","review":"THESE GUYS HAVE THE MOODY BLUES DISEASE- YOU KNOW THE ONE THAT MAKES YOU RELEASE TONS OF COMPILATION ALBUMS...TOUR ENDLESSLY FOR NO APPARENT REASON OTHER THAN TO \\"SURVIVE ANOTHER YEAR\\"...TOUR WITH SYMPHONY ORCHESTRAS TO DO WATERED DOWN VERSIONS OF THEIR SONGS....ENOUGH ALREADY...HAVE YOU GUYS RUN OUT OF IDEAS?????

I also love Elvis Costello; for the past week, I have listened incessantly to his collaboration with Burt Bacharach, \\"Painted From Memory.\\"*So with that as a perspective, I have to say that this may be the weakest effort in the entire Elvis catalog. Getting Billy Sherrill in Nashville surely was the right thing to do, but these songs don't click, and about none of these covers can stand along side the original. I can't specifically carp about the playing or the vocals, but where they fail is in capturing the heart, the spirit, the feel of country music. They sound too much like an experiment. Years later, Van Morrison, another giant, would fail in a similar effort.*For sure, this is not a \\"bad\\" album, but there are 20 better collections that Elvis has recorded and thousands of better country albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"so bad it's kinda good....","review":"\\"Why Don't You Love Me (Like You Used to Do?)\\" and \\"How Much I've Lied\\" -- the tunes that open and close this collection, respectively -- are bold, affecting interpretations; but the ones that come between them are misguided, poorly performed horrors.

I grew up on country music. I use to love it. But after hearing the sound mold into something hideous such as The Dixie Chicks and Faith Hill I just lost all interest in listenin' to what they claim is country music. Elvis Costello, has done basically every type of music you can think of. This is his reworking of country music and let me tell you. it's country alright...but it's Costello for a country. everyone will admit Elvis doesn't have the right 'voice' for country music but he still succeeds. some songs on here are a bit too 'twangy' for my taste and that's the reason for the 4 stars. but it doesn't matter when or where, Elvis is excellent. he can always make you laugh, cry, break something, or just relax. So I say if you have no interest what so ever in country music...I'd stay away from this. But if you like Elvis and you're flexible...go for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the hell is this?","review":"Hmmm like some kind of experiment that got away, Almost blue is just plain weird.

This album is a slap in the face to those people as well as to authentic country music performers who come from places like Birmingham, Alabama instead of Birmingham, West Midlands. This is a narcissistic, self-indulgent musical vanity project of the worst kind - an idea as stupid as Loretta Lynn rapping or Sean Combs attempting to sing Ella Fitzgerald or Roberta Flack songs. The more you like his first records the more you'll hate this one - don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"What A Mess","review":"Ol Elvis wasnt up for this one. These songs need someone to SING them, and, at the time, EC didnt have the voice for it. The song composition is rather weak both for EC and the other writers.

Tim Finn of 'Split Enz' fame (infamy-?-) sings on many of the tracks and is painful to hear. John Wetton contributes one of his trademark Greg Lake vocal impersonations on 'numbers'. Really, the only listenable songs on the record are the instrumentals, 'k-scope' and 'n-shift'. The ultra cheesy production duo Godley and Creme make contributions to several tracks, and the fact that they are invisible here leads one to realize that most of the album is just as cheesy as they are; gorgonzola just can't compete with limberger, can it? In layman's terms, this album sucks; ignore any praise it may receive from essentialist rock critics who got their copies for free and don't care if you blow 14 clams on this slicked-out wank fest."},{"rating":"1","title":"ugh","review":"Let's get two things straight:1) There is no such word as \\"ufology\\" nor could there ever be.

Every review about the instructions is true.

Some of the pieces that look metal are plastic around the seat and the round pedal covers.Is this the Unicycle that you'll end up with? Probably not. It's a great cycle to start with. It's held up to the abuse I've given it and my son. If you can use basic deductive skills to get it together and want something cheap to start, this is the way to go.

The picture quality is fantastic for any camera available today and for a camera so small and light weight it is just what a traveling photographer needs. This camera is all metal and as rugged as can be. I am no expert, but the Olympus C-50 is the best camera I have ever taken on one of my trips.When I got home the downloading to my PC was a breeze.

I have tried to get the sensor part required to fix the problem, from Olypus, but they say the only thing I can buy is a new battery cover. I told them that I was recently advised that poor sensors is a common problem with their retractractable lenses and replacements should be made available. The representative said I could send the camera in to them and they would fix the problem for $125.00 What nerve! I will never buy another Olympus product and I will tell everyone I know about this issue."},{"rating":"1","title":"huge disappointment","review":"I just received this camera, I ordered this one after I dropped my power shot elf - 2.1 from canon, I loved this camera and thought I was ready for an upgrade. Well not this one. The Olympus S50 did not do what I thought it would.Almost all the pictures I took were blurry, took to much time in between the images, soft ware has a lot to be desired, manual in the package is flimsy - not at all what I am used to from the user friendly canon.

In the intervening 20 years, I forgot about it, preferring Get Happy or Imperial Bedroom, or wandering into the earlier stuff.When I came back to \\"Trust\\" I was struck by what a magnificent voice EC brings to it. It's got all of the energy associated with the first 3 records, AND the musical inventiveness that made Imperial Bedroom a standout. The strength of that voice! 'Shot with his own gun' sends a chill up my spine!The sparkle of the piano and clarity of the vocals make almost every track worthwhile. Listen to \\"Clubland\\" and wish that pop music sounded like this NOW.Bottom line:If you're into Elvis at all, this is an overlooked gem and worth the price. Plus: the cover has the most beautiful photo to appear on an EC record. You shoulda seen it poster size!!!! Stunning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes, This Is An Essential Recording","review":"Trust was the point where Elvis started using the piano to expand on his musical ideas, and Steve Nieve was the right person to do it for him.Trust often gets overlooked, perhaps because at the time it wasn't a popular hit (during a period when Elvis did have popular hits), but also because his next album of originals would be \\"Imperial Bedroom\\" where the piano really took over.But Trust has tighter songs, and it rocks so much harder than \\"IB\\", in much the same way that makes me consider the Beatles' \\"Revolver\\" to be a slightly better album than \\"Sergeant Pepper\\".If you are an Elvis Costello fan, this album is essential."},{"rating":"2","title":"unstable, unfocused, & totally essential","review":"this is truly a \\"transitional\\" album. both the young, snotty elvis and the middle-aged, bitter elvis can be heard in these intricate, claustrophobic songs. elvis sounds like he's not entirely in control of his unruly band or his thorny, difficult songs here, and he doesn't really seem to care. the end result is rewarding, but only for the previously committed. trust me...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"This is one of the best albums in history - buy it!There are not many albums that are almost exclusivly on base piano and drums."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of The Best!","review":"One may say that this album is the first Costello made without his original, and indeed brilliant, punch.

However, he does not have a natural feel for these pieces or if he does, it is not evident in this recording. The rhythm and the maintenance thereof is not necessarily strict and makes the listener feel uncomfortable. The violin playing and especially its double stops are not well-executed and many of the tempi appear contrived and unoriginal. The only redeeming feature is the recorder playing which is just gorgeous.Not the most outstanding buy, but the price is right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best, not the worst","review":"Well, Richard Kapp is still a \\"hot head\\" unfortunately. His ego makes communication difficult. One need not praise him because he is adept at praising himself.

My experience is that it's difficult to know whether or not a person will like MOUTH MUSIC. Their work is sometimes a little eccentric and tough to digest, although the more I listened to this album, the more I found myself playing it. If you're looking to expand your cultural musical palette, this is definitely a sound to look into. The track 'Waiting' is one of the most beautiflly painful ballads you will ever hear."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasant Celtic Afro-pop","review":"This was the second album from Mouth Music, but with some personnel changes. Half the original duo, vocalist Talitha MacKenzie, left, replaced by Scottish vocalist Michaela Rowan and Scot-of-Ghanaian-descent Jackie Joyce, while Martin Swan stayed and brought in several other instrumentalists. So there's some further development of the basic concept of building out from a Celtic base to a broader world music.The result is at times rather like a lighter, peppier kind of Peter Gabriel music. The women take most of the vocals, which are often ethereal. There's always a funky bass groove, plenty of Afro-pop, some overt French influence, and a little hip-hop, which syncs well with the \\"mouth music\\" (the name the band takes from the Scottish practice of wordless or non-lyric-intensive highly rhythmic singing). Another reviewer mentions techno, and you can hear some of that too in a few places. It all mixes well.

I never felt close to the characters. Normally in Sue Civoil-Brown's books..TEMPTING MR. WRIGHT and CHASING RAINBOW...you felt like you at least knew the characters involved. Samantha's character was alittle understandable but somewhat shallow. The real difficult one to understand was Derek. He just seemed to appear in Florida, crew and everything. I wont go into the plot because it would ruin the story....if you can call the plot a story. I'm very sorry to say that the book did absolutely nothing for me. The ending was very bland and silly. It didn't even make sense. This was a big disappointment for me and I feel let down by the author.

The Caracters were interesting, and it was good to see old Paradise, FL favorites, like Miss Mary Todd and her Hole in the Seawall Gang, and the DustBuster Brigade, who discover seamontster footprints in the prologue. The hijinx only gets worse from there, as Miss Mary concocts all inds of ways to keep her nephew, a prefessional phenonenon debunker, and Officer Sam Barrett together. Sea monster eggs, alien abductions, the z-files, and Godzilla references abound as a local crisis turns into a circus with Sam, who desperately wants to be loved, and Derek, who desperately wants to believe in something, right in the center. Miss Mary Todd is, as usual, on the sidelines pulling strings.

It flows out of the side in a little arcing stream when the valve is completely closed. As an added bonus, the valve is right at the end of the tube where it meets the attachment, so you have to have your hands all up in your business while trying to use this as opposed to most other types that have valves or clamps slightly up the tube to make them easier to use. At any rate, I would not recommend this even a little and think you should avoid it at all costs unless you like ending up soaking wet in the process of using it."},{"rating":"1","title":"save your cash","review":"I bought this even though no one else had reviewed it thinking I could save some money.

The CD Volume II, however, probably does contain several pieces O'Brian had exactly in mind, including the full oboe quartet featured in The Yellow Admiral.

Some were charming, some self pitying, and some \\"Gee, how exotic it all is! Lucky me!\\" Well that's not what this is about.It is really the memoir of a house, an inherited house developed in a somewhat great ( not quite grand) style, written by the heir at the end of a long and interesting intellectual life. The various fameous and not so fameous, the hangers on and the local villagers enter into it all and are portrayed along with pictures of the grounds and some of the convivial rooms in what must be described as a family album in the middle of the book.A word of warning. This is a quirky book, sometimes a bit annoying: reminiscent of an elderly aunt telling the assembled family stories about childhood adventures with great-grandfather as the sun sets.

I was interested in the author's description of post-World War II life in Sicily, but her condescending comments about the \\"child-like\\" Sicilians (who made her life easier) were rather surprising. Her very obvious disdain for them reduced my enjoyment of the rest of her writing. Not recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"British Raj Goes To Sicily","review":"This book is exceptionally anglo-centric. Miss Phelps' readiness to use the term \\"padrone\\" when referring to herself is telling. She is very much the Queen Mother ministering to her poor ignorant subjects.

As someone who has restored a number of bikes myself I could really identify with Haefele's struggles to find parts and service providers. To the reviewers who said Haefele didn't restore the bike, that he just sub-contracted it out to others, I say \\"humbug.\\" Very few restorers do everything themselves.

As a mid-life motorcyclist (Harley) and pilot, with a penchant for old airplanes and motorcycles, I have long harbored the dream of restoring something really classic; a Harley J, a '32 Ford, a Stearman biplane, etc. So I grabbed the book without a second thought, anticipating a real restoration chronicle.

Buy and enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book. The characters were well developed and likable. I liked the ending. You end up understanding how each character became who they were and yet there was healing in the end. The mystery was interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting reading","review":"This book kept me guessing, over and over again, who the killer is. I changed my mind so often! Couldn't wait to see the ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Felt like a waste **SPOILERS**","review":"I love a good mystery & thriller, but this felt like such a waste...The story felt scattered, & felt like so many stories thrown into one book.SPOILERS!!! DONT READ IF YOU DONT WANT TO KNOW!!!!!!The one thing I didnt appreciate, you read the book, only to have the 'bad guy' someone that was never mentioned in the book. And then you get a quick back story to his crazed mind. It just felt thrown in, like a different book... & then a waste of time.Then the main idea of the young girl that was murdered -we dont find out the truth until the last few pages. Really?I usually like every book, but honestly, was like \\"Really?\\" at this one & was so glad it was over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read!","review":"This was the second book I've read by this author (the first beingHush) and both were fantastic reads for the genre. This book has a great set of characters which develop throughout the read. The plot was well thought out, and wasn't obvious so there are surprises in store for the reader at the end. The book is written in the third person and alternates between characters (including the killer). In both books I've read, the author does an awesome job of coming up with sick and twisted killers and really letting you get inside their head, which is both interesting and maybe a bit disturbing, but I enjoy it nonetheless...I loaned this book from the kindle owners lending library, and while I did find a few typos the digital edition was fairly well edited. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes the crime thriller genre and is a fan of authors like James Patterson etc. I will definitely be reading more of this author!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good","review":"I just couldn't stop reading, suspense, mystery... the details of the crimes and how they found the murder is just epic"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbelieveably Wise","review":"I found in Milton Steinberg what I had yet to find in any other 'Basic Judaism' type book.

Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made me Want to Beat My Head Against the Wall","review":"I am using this book in an Intro to Judaism class, so have a certain amount of required reading in it each week, as well as in several other books on the topic of Judaism. Every time I have to pick this one up, I groan. This has to be the worst written book ever. You can read three pages to find out what he could have said in three sentences. The author REALLY likes to hear himself talk. Boring, boring, boring, boring. The only reason I didn't give it no stars is because if you can FORCE yourself to keep going, you do eventually get some useful info, but only after the author beats the point to death, revives it, and beats it some more...."},{"rating":"2","title":"cry heart","review":"Excellent reading!

God bless"},{"rating":"2","title":"It made me cry, laugh, and triggered every other emotion.","review":"I first read this when I was 15. I am now 18 and have read it 3-4 times already. I'm lingering in his other excellent novels as we speak. I love them! Cavanaugh has a beautiful talent given from God that lightens his pages and my eyes. The charachters became a part of me that when they end I cry because it's such an enlightening story! I recommend this to anyone and everyone to all ages! Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Suspenseful, romantic, something for everyone","review":"Jack Cavanaugh really struck a cord with me in this book. His intertwining of history, romance and suspense is masterful. The historical explanations in the afterword are great even if history isn't one of your loves. This is a large novel but you don't notice it as the story is written so well that you just sit transfixed as time flies by. I fell in love with the characters and willed them to make the right decisions. Jack Cavanaugh has written a great first book to his American Family Portraits Series, this book leaves you desperate to read the next."},{"rating":"2","title":"For History Lovers","review":"For those of us who enjoy reading about the days before we were even thought of, this is a great book about out beginnings in England. It is difficult for us to understand the hardships our forbears endured. It is not only well written but Jack Cavanaugh brings us along very well in this series of events."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Loved It","review":"I really liked this book. It was very easy to just put myself in the situations with the characters. I also liked how Mr. Cavanaugh explained why he wrote what he did. I'm glad this is a series and I can't wait to read the next ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"I did not enjoy this book at all","review":"I did not like this book at all! It gave me a weird feeling as I read it. Sure there are certain aspects of the book that are not all that bad, such as, the historical significance intertwined within the story. But, for the most part, the story weirded me out. There were certain events that Cavanaugh described in such detail that it made me sick to my stomach. I couldn't get some of the things he described out of my head. And still, I remember certain things that are just not worth the reading experience of this book. If you do want to read one of Cavanaugh's books, I suggest \\"The Allies\\" or \\"The Victors.\\" They, in my opinion, were good historical books."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've read better-written cereal boxes","review":"I love historical fiction, and a friend suggested The Puritans to me. Despite my reservations after thumbing through it, I gave it a whirl out of respect for him. I have been sadly disappointed. The writing is stilted and barely literate; I found myself fighting to get through awkward phrasings and junior-high level prose. I could care less about the Christian overtones, though the labored scriptural references are hamfisted at best. For those with an interest in adult-reading-level historical fiction, let me recommend the well-researched and engrossing works of Jeff Shaara, Patrick O'Brian, CS Forester or Gore Vidal. For those unable to stomach occasional depictions of such unrealistic human experiences as sex or violence, perhaps Mr. Cavanaugh's See Spot Run Series fills the bill."},{"rating":"2","title":"A comfort book","review":"In an era when we are bombarded with gratuitous violence and sex, \\"The Puritans\\" is a welcome respite. While it may be Christian historical fiction, please don't think that plot and character have been sacrificed. In fact, Cavanaugh does a superb job of creating characters we really care about, and the plot is anything but predictable. Plus, all this is happening in front of an historically accurate setting. It's just nice to sit down with a good book that you know isn't going to surprise you with a lot of unnecessary vulgarity, violence, or sex. I intend to read the entire series."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites!","review":"I loved this book--it's one of my favorites in the series, and one of my favorite novels! It's just so emotional and deep and exciting...It also has romance (maybe a bit too much), adventure, and Christian values. I was brought to tears, and I laughed...all of The American Family Portrait series is good, but this is one of my favorites, as I've said. The characters in all of his books are so real!Yes, there were some rather violent moments, almost gruesome, but it just brought me more concern and appreciation for the characters and all they went through.I read it first when I was 14 or 15, and I'm looking forward to reading it again in future years!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Inability to communicate","review":"The ability of the author's to communicate is about the worst I've come across. Anything by Kimball is more understandable and readable. Also, by way of comparison, Ken Henderson, of SQL Server Guru fame, knows how to write. These people don't. The lack of practical application is striking, and you will not \\"Master Data Warehouse Design\\". Any concept introduced is never exemplified, and the amount of contradictory statements is off the charts. Note how I've failed to show examples from the book to back up my statements, well, they're entire book is like that. Do yourself a favor and read Kimball's texts, at least he can communicate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Resource for all Data Warehouse Developers","review":"This is an excellent book for all Data Warehouse Designers and Devleopers.

She complains that it is gboringh but then keeps playing it for more than an hour after her complaint. I think her frustrations come from being unable to easily and quickly navigate around Miafs world. Sometimes when I come to help her because she is stuck, I see that she has clicked on everything too quickly while trying to find what she needs to do next, so the game cannot properly respond. So far the math in level one has been no trouble at all. The difficult part was the days of the week, which she is now learning thanks to this fun, educational program. I look forward to seeing level two soon! The Math Rabbit program we had before this was truly boring for her. This is a welcome addition to our CD-ROM case."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy","review":"Unfortunately, we were sucked in by other \\"good\\" reviews but when we got it, it was a disaster. First, it took forever, to install. Second, it will not install on the hard disk and requires loading the CD-ROM each time which means the adults must do it. Third, the user spends very little time doing math problems because the user must go through first a lengthy story which cannot be skipped each time a new game is loaded, and then must spend an inordinate amount of time taking a journey between phases of the math game trying to locate secret clues as to how to open the game. There are no solutions available and the user can get stuck . Next, the program can be adjusted for different levels of ability but when we set it at seven years, it went to third and fourth grade math. Maybe, in Japan but not here. Moreover, the program sometimes locks up. There are much better programs available which do not have these hang-ups and are a better buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Base Premise: \\"Your House Burns Down and Your Family Loses Everything\\"","review":"Base Premise: \\"Your House Burns Down and Your Family Loses Everything\\". You can't make this stuff up! Love to find a video game to help my daughter with Math, but one based on, literally, HER WORST NIGHTMARE might not quite make the grade. Perhaps one based on going to a combined funeral for her grandparents and pets might be even better. Guess the designers don't have kids. Oy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be fooled by the positive reviews","review":"I agree totally with the negative reviews posted. Where IS the math?? Having to install the DVD each time you play the game is at least inconvenient, if not aggravating. And most of the time the student has to follow around that stupid mouse, clicking on everything in site, trying to find the next LITTLE bit of math games.

Let me start by telling you that I have been programming for 20 years. Everything from Cobol to html. I find this program a bit complicated.If you are an experienced web developer than this is probably a good option. I am looking for point and shoot.

I wasted time reading the instructions to figure out how to develop a commerce site and realized that numerous steps were skipped or out of order. I contacted technical support with questions and suggestions and their response was just as vague/unhelpful as the lame manual.

While the quality of the songs and songwriting is as great as the other reviewers state, many were turned off by the 'Wall of Sound' production values introduced on this third album. I still feel that all of the reverb and track layering, although often suited to the thematic content, mars my experience of these great songs, decades later."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Pop/Rock/New Wave tour de force (4.5 stars)","review":"While dismissed as Costello-Lite by some, this is arguably EC's masterpiece. While retaining the feistiness of his first two albums, Armed Forces showcases Costello's evolving prowess in crafting really good pop(ular) songs. 'Oliver's Army' and 'What's So Funny...?' shine here, but there are another half dozen or so excellent cuts.The Armed Forces bonus disc is likely the best in the Rhino reissue series. Alternative versions of 'Busy Bodies', 'Accidents...' and 'Goon Squad' are interesting. 'Stranger in the House' and scorching, live performances of 'Lipstick Vogue' and 'Mystery Dance' are classics.Excellent value here at $14.99. Add another one of Rhino's 2-disc series and get free shipping!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Possibly my favorite Costello album","review":"Whoa, this totally rules. I won't say if it's better than This Year's Model or not, but I love it. Sure, it covers the same ground as the first two, but it's pretty well a perfection of Costello's mix of Stax-Volt licks, raw punksih energy, weird keyboards and paranoid lyrics. The singles (Oliver's Army, Accidents Can Happen, a cover of Nick Lowe's (What's So Funny 'Bout) Peace Love and Understanding) are all the best of the album, but listen closely to other songs: the brutal Senior Service; paranoid Goon Squad, satires Green Shirt and Big Boys; the bouncing, ironic Sunday's Best; and the sardonic, unsparing reggae ballad Two Little Hitlers. And Costello's signature sneer is in full force, which certainly rules.I don't think every track is great per se, but there's a minimum number of duds: Party Girl and Busy Bodies are far from Costello's greatest contributions to rock, but they're tolerable. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"emotional facism!","review":"Amazing! Abba meets kraftwerk as sung by a twitchy paranoid buddy holly/woody allen composite.

Lots of interesting details about Tibetan religious practices are interwoven with a well-told tale centering on the hero, and a young Indian who makes his trip possible. The last part drags a bit (escaping Tibet when the Chinese invade), and at the same time evokes a feeling of anger at the invasion and its aftermath"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the best adventure fiction of modern times!","review":"Although this is a fantastic tale, much from it isechoed by current events, from the Tibetan persecutionsto the ongoing struggles of modern Himalayan climbers.This gripping adventure story is set amidst the quite realChinese suppression of Tibet, although it evokes manyparallels with Kipling's \\"The Man Who Would Be King\\".I only wish John Huston was still around to direct this bookas a film, and Sean Connery young enough to play the lead;Kipling would be rightly envious - this book is better!I like most of Davidson's books, but the only onethat's on a par with this is \\"Smith's Gazelle.\\"His political thrillers are quite enjoyable, but not upthe the level of LeCarre or Trevanian."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book, poor edition","review":"I have read this book (in hard copy) before and enjoyed it immensely, interesting plot, unique location and nice device of introducing the author as a character.But... this digital edition which I bought for my e-reader while travelling is dreadful. Full of typography and spelling mistakes to a ridiculous level.

In trying to broaden my scope in the type of books I read I chose this one based on the recommendation and the synopsis. It is not what it seems. It is a rambling, sometimes incoherent, boring tale of a man's life. I was not able to identify nor sympathize with the author and his trials in life.

Authors with one great story to tell - Exley only wrote 3 books and the other 2 are not noteworthy. The quintessential entry in this category would be Harper Lee's \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\".2. Books that either speak to you in a sort of miraculous way, or completely miss you all together. There are many books that meet this criteria, perhaps none more so than Pynchon's \\"Gravity's Rainbow\\" (Gravity was unreadable to me, but to the friend who recommended \\"A Fan's Notes\\" it was transcendent).I think maybe the closest comparison to \\"A Fan's Notes\\", though still a ways off, is \\"Portnoy's Complaint\\", Roth's equally deeply personal masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best novels of the 1960s.","review":"Fred Exley writes a moving and dark tragicomic indictment of life and aspirations of America in the decades following WWII. The \\"fictional memoir\\", as he characterizes it in his introduction, traces the life of a NY Giants fan, a worshipper of the great football running back Frank Gifford, through a life of teaching, mental institutions and failed relationships. It is the first, and best, of a trilogy set in and around the environs of Watertown, NY and Alexandria Bay, on the St.Lawrence River.

A Hemingwayesque verve, a Faulknerian playfulness, and a Nabokovian look at the underside of American life, this book should be read by men, women, and children (over 18 years of age, of course), after which they will know not only much more about narcissism, alcoholism, sex, friendship, celebrity worship, suffering, gluttony, satire, and wit, they will have experienced an important excursion into a truly literary and literate sensibility: less polished but deeper than updike, less funny but wider ranging than cheever, less grand but more poignant than fitzgerald.... a grand, flawed maw... to be read and savored like an oversized plate of ribs or, if you're a vegetarian, like a mound of fried sweet potatoes.

All thaumaturgy is is using the power of vampire blood to power magic. It's like magic in Mage basically, except it uses vitae instead of quintessence or tass. Koldunic sorcery is the same thing. It is using blood to power magic. Simply enough, it is just an ancient form of thaumaturgy that is not as polished as the Tremere form (they had been Magi for quite some time before they became Cainite).I think it wouldn't make sense to call Koldunic Sorcery as thaumaturgy, mainly because the former predates the later. But, as stated previously, they are basically the same thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't wait as long as I did....","review":"When guys like \\"Norm\\" and others recommend the Unisaw, they are not kidding about how nice and smooth they cut compared to contractor type saws. Unisaws and all cabinet/type table saws are made for woodworkers. You can balance a nickle on it's edge, turn the saw on, shut it down, turn it on again - the nickle doesn't fall over. It's that smooth. I expect that most all cabinet saws are this good - I really don't know. The reason I like and recommend the Unisaw is that they are pretty much unchanged as far as internal parts are concerned. In other words, if your 1950 model Unisaw needs a new trunion - chances are it's still in stock. This tool definately falls into that category of \\"expensive but worth it.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Don Rose needs to look for better than Delta and DeWalt","review":"I finally gave up on Delta power tools due to poor quality and reliability.

(I did not even know what a \\"bobbin was!) I sat and read the entire book first, and by the time I was finished, taped together enough freezer paper to my wall to draw an 80x80 inch design. Yes, it took time, but since I read the book thoroughly, I already had answers to all the minute details that were required to make my quilt successfully. And yes, it was at least 200+ pieces. It was my first quilt and sewing project, and my friends and family were amazed. I think the process is worth it if you are looking for a unique, one of a kind design. Since then, I have made a second quilt by the same technique, and am currently staring a new one. Great reference guide. Good book for very creative people who can make their own designs; for those who have an idea in mind but don't know how to achieve it. BUT READ IT COVER TO COVER FIRST!!!

I just pulled the CD out for the first time in years, to see how it stands up to the test of time. The album still sounds fresh to me. This is some of the most focused and powerful guitar playing, and writing Mould has ever produced. Every song has a strong melody, and great lyrics. One of my complaints about his work over the years has always been that his songs sometimes drag on too long, almost as if he didn't know how to wrap it up. There is a little bit of that on Copper Blue, but the melodies are so good, it doesn't bother me as much. Most of the songs pack their punch in 3 or 4 minutes, and then make way for the next treat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bob Mould at his best.","review":"In my opinion, this is the best album of Bob's discography. Every song has a pulse but it could still be filed under easy listening. I 1st got Copper Gold on cassette tape after seeing them on 120 minutes.

Give me a break, REM blows this away. I never heard of this group Sugar before, and I know this junk dont sell. I guess there is some cult following of people who think this guy Bob Mould is good.

The parallel worlds of white and black that have emerged from a Confederate victory in the Civil War are unveiled in an intriguingly gradual fashion, allowing the reader to ponder how this America is different from our own. The whole is packaged in a thriller whose pace never flags. I found myself thinking about how much race relations in our country actually do, in practice, resemble Means' fanatically separate but equal order. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crooner Extraordinaire mixes a jazz and rock tonic.","review":"Imperial Bedroom counts among the most polished of Costello's collections. Shaking and stirring, the songs on this album pull in listeners via sordid tales of spoiled love, lust, and human fallibility. While Mr. Costello's poetry is first-rate, the Attractions do their part by setting up a rocking and jazzy stage for Elvis' fine lyrics.For all Costello fans who are not familiar with this album nor jazz, Imperial Bedroom provides an alluring introduction. Old favorites such as Almost Blue transports its listeners to a former era colored by smoky clubs, polished shoes, and possibilities."},{"rating":"1","title":"Imperial heresy? (2.5 stars)","review":"Costello fans will likely brand me a heretic, but 'Bedroom' seems to me to be one of his more overrated recordings. 'Beyond Belief' and 'Man Out of Time' certainly rate consideration in a 'Best of' compilation. 'Long Honeymoon', 'Human Hands' and 'Every Home' are somewhat interesting. However, beyond that I find little that's especially compelling here.There are treats on the bonus disc that I enjoy more than much of the original 'Bedroom' recordings, thanks in part to Steve Nieve's scorching work on the ivories. In fact, the alternative version of 'The Town Where Time Stood Still' and the toe-tap inducing \\"From Head to Toe\\" merit inclusion on my desert-island list of Elvis favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent","review":">Even Columbia's \\"Artist...Masterpiece?\\" ad campaign was begging the question. Was this the album...Sorry, \\"begging the question\\" does NOT mean \\"asking the question\\" or \\"provoking the question\\"; it means assuming in your argument a priori the very thing your argument attempts to prove. \\"Begging the question\\" is a logical fallacy, more formally known as \\"petitio principii\\".In any case, this, in my opinion, is clearly Elvis Costello's best record. I have it on vinyl and don't know the second disc, but I'm very glad the extra things WERE relegated to a second disc (at no extra charge it appears) so that the integrity of the original record was not compromised."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cut to the chase....","review":"The other reviewers are spot on: this is a brilliant album.

Connect the dots."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unless I Missed It...","review":"This album is the worst of all of EC's albums, but this is coming from someone who enjoys the less liked, later albums.

Offered to give me a replacement camera, I declined. On 1/12/04 contacted them for the second time. It was only then that they told me that the parts could take over one month to arrive. At that I agreeded to get a refurbished camera. They told me that they would ship the next day and I would have on 1/16/04. Called on the 1/21/04 only to be told that they did not have any refurbished cameras in stock and that I would have to wait, 1-2 weeks.Purchased the camera in July 2003 and by the time I get \\"my\\" camera back, Olympus will have had possesion of it for over two months.

That's the reason I post this as a Negative review although I think this is a very good camera when you understand how to use it. Here it goes. Read my lips: do NOT use Auto ISO - you'll get a lot of noise in your pictures. Configure you own settings (using My Mode) and set your ISO to 64 at all times. Any ISO higher that 64 (even 100) will produce noticeable noise. Also, while configuring \\"My Mode\\", set Noise Reduction to \\"On\\" and, the most important, set Sharpness to \\"-4\\" or \\"-5\\". If you do all the above, Canon G3 owners will be jealous of your shots."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as robust as you would expect","review":"The functions and features of the Olympus 5050 are superb - and so is the picture quality. However, when relative dropped the camera just 4 inches onto a table top the program selector button broke off. The plastic shaft that had held it in place turned out to be constructed having a very, very thin diameter. I had to pay $180 to get it fixed at Olympus original service. They said it had happened to other users as well, it was a typical error. I didn't expect this kind of problem from a magnesium body camera claimed to be \\"robust\\". My old Canon SLR cameras have had much more rough handling without any trouble. Olympus said they had checked the camera from a to z when fixing the broken button, but 1 month later the lens operation jammed for no apparent reason.

I adjusted everything from AF spot to Sharpness, but seemed to get the same results. Comparing my old pictures from C-3040 to C-5050 I am very dissapointed. I returned it back to the store and waiting to either go with the Sony DSC-F717 or upgrade to the New Canon Rebel digital which is due mid-sept. I wish I never sold my original C-3040.

The camera takes wonderful pictures, has a feature set to die for, and all around is a fantastic product...except. about 40-70% of the time it takes pictures completely out of focus. If you're careful and setup the shot very carefully the pictures are fantastic. If there is a fore-ground and a background the camera tends to focus on the background blurring the foreground. After 4 years of digital photography this is the only camera that has ever behaved this way.

This is important when a child is trying to look over the buildings in order to see the full distribution the board.If you've bought cathedral to leave it in your living room as a coffee table game and let it sit there for ever, then you will enjoy this game, since it looks nice and it's not a chess board.If you are still interested in cathedral, then try the blokus online version to see if you like it before buying it.I like Reversi (othello), mancala and backgamon, chess, but this game I did not enjoy that much.

We both like strategy games, and Cathedral is fun and fast -- gameplay lasts maybe up to 10 minutes, but there are many different strategies to employ, making mini-tournaments interesting. It is also a very attractive coffee table piece!Only problem -- because they are wood and not molded plastic (which is nice for a change) the pieces can come apart.

It's a thinking game, but not one that is overly-taxing. Relatively simple to learn.

Even in a peacetime movie this would be tiresome, but to have someone sitting more or less safely in London whining about his foot pain while so many fellow Brits were dying by the thousands is pretty annoying.The climactic bomb disposal scene is great, but it just hints at how good this movie *could* have been.The DVD extras are superb, with interviews with a cameraman and snippets from a biography that talk a lot about Powell & Pressburger and their other films."},{"rating":"2","title":"I would LOVE to own!","review":"I have been trying to purchase this product.

This feeder performed without complaint.I have also used it on the jointer with good results.Setup is a little bothersome because the feeder has little weight of it own and must be preloaded so that the feed wheels will stay in contact with the stock.

It's a bit tricky to adjust and I usually burn a couple of pieces of scrap wood to dial it in, but after that it's excellent. The wheels could be a bit grippier, but I'm sure with some light sanding they'd be better. The adjustable feature is great.

In the first week of use the arbor (sticking out on the right side) caught the power cord as I pulled the blade toward me. The protective plastic had spun off the arbor earlier... so the metal chewed right into the electrical wire. The biggest concern I had was the potential run-away blade due to the wire wrapping into something. I called customer service and they didn't seem to care. I visited a big chain store recently and tried to see if anything had changed... it hadn't. On a display model I easily replicated the incident (without the power on). Delta needs to make the cord coiled, or shorter, or longer. Maybe the Consumer Product Safety Commission will tell them so after someone gets hurt. I sent mine back.

The production is spare and dependent on light and the mood the singers can create. It adds up to an exceptionally moving performance, one that is very sensitive to the rarified atmosphere that makes this opera such a unique experience. The singing is uniformally good and the acting under the direction of Keller is insightful. The big moments like the death of the old prioress and the monologue of her replacement are inspired, as is the handling of that final wrenching scene. The latter is not done literally but is in keeping with the more interior mood that is sustained throughout.

On the plus side, the fixed portion of the table extension is very handy and the folding feature works great and is very stable. I'm glad that I've added this feature to my Unisaw."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful packaging, unlikely to survive UPS","review":"This is one item I would recommend people purchase from a local dealer not Amazon. Like another reviewer mentioned the packaging is terrible. I received mine and the small stationary wooden top of the table was broken into three parts even though the external packaging showed no real damage. This part breaks where it has grooves routed into it across its width, it is so badly supported I would expect it to get broken in shipment more often than not. The movable part of the table top also had some cosmetic damage. Amazon has been helpful but a replacement top arrived damaged as well. I just ended up making my own parts to fix it. The table is actually pretty good and I needed a fold down table given lack of space in my garage."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great design .....BUT!..........Poor Packing , MDF Junk,","review":"I hate to talk bad about an American company But this product is Junk, South of Boarder, Bargain basement 99cent store junk, Shame on you Delta.

But the design it self is great, it folds away with ease and has channels for the miter gauge and blade guard. Delta just got cheap with a product that isn't cheap to buy ,,,,,,,,Just be aware it's function is great the hardware is great, the table...!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Buy","review":"This outfeed table is well worth the price paid. Assembly took me about half a day, but I wasn't in any rush. It color-matches the light grey of the Unisaw nicely. I really like the 12\\" fixed portion of the table- it helps on follow-through for smaller work pieces which don't necessarily require use of the full outfeed table. I'd like to reiterate what one of the reviewers said earlier that, unfortunately, when the table is not in use and hanging down adjacent to the saw, the single support leg of the table completely blocks the saw's exhaust port. I would rather see a support leg on each corner of the table, which would allow access for a 4\\" hose to attach to the exhaust port AND would provide a bit more stability for the extended outfeed table. A hose can still be attached, but the lowered table will not be able to drop to a completely vertical position. I would still recommend this table."},{"rating":"2","title":"great accessory","review":"Real good addition to the table; set up was simple; I think this is a must for this table given most users will probably by laying full size plywood sheets on it; you really need the stability to safely work; I tried a single roller stand initially but it was unreliable and unsteady which is why I bought this table; one gripe is my saw is on a moving platform, the standard leg for the extension table has these rubber feet that drag along the ground as I move the table; when I lower the table the end actually rests on the ground; I don't think it's a major problem though since I can probably replace them with wheels later."},{"rating":"1","title":"jumpstart guide pentax k 10 d","review":"This product is a sham.

We have it in the same room with our primary TV, and on the lowest setting (it has three fan speeds) the fan noise is barely noticeable. The improvement in humidity (in this 600 ft^2 room), on the other hand, is very noticeable.The tanks are easy to remove and refill. They hold ~2 gallons each (the size statements are typical of the industry), and on the low setting have to be refilled once each day; at the highest setting, they last only 6 to 8 hours.

It is extremely slow moving and the interesting parts are few and far between.

An example of the author's failure to provide details: upon describing the births of the Queen's second and third children (Anne, Princess Royal, and Andrew, Duke of York), he didn't even bother to tell us the names of the children!!

I have used it in college classes for several years, and most students enjoy reading it. It is a good example of how studying the same activity (firewalking) in two different contexts (Greece and the U.S.) can shed light on the practice in both cultures.

So many of the s-hooks are gone now, it has no tension. For the 80$+ we had to pay for it, this is not worth the money. They should at least sell replacement hooks and a net. They give two stakes to anchor the pitch back to the ground, but it is not really enough. They need to give more. If you use it for anything besides a baseball (soccer for example, they say you casn I think), the rebounder will fall off. This is my first time writing a negatvie review, annoyed enough to do so.

We got around this by choosing a shaded window facing a wooded area. The result? No glare or way for birds to mistake a window for the sky or reflected space.Placement did not seem to decrease the bird population which stopped by. In our case, we bought the feeder to provide variety for a bird lover who was too ill io leave bed. It did the trick-and wonderfully. We all loved watching the birds as well as a squirrel which (luckily) seemed far more intent on pulling stuffing out of an old porch pillow.....for a nest?.....than raiding the feeder. We are very satisfied with our purchase (we are keeping an eye on that squirrel,though, in case it starts diving for the feeders) .Happily, our bird lover also enjoys watching squrrels so we have an additional spot for them.

The birds get acclimated to it in a week or two and come right up to the window. I've placed it on the window by my dinning room table and can watch the birds chow down as I eat breakfast. It's great for attracting small birds like finches and sparrows, but I also get a lot of cardinals and even doves and large pigeons have squeezed onto it. It's a little small for large blue jays, but I've seen a couple eating at it as well from time to time. My cat loves swatting at the window and scaring away the birds, which adds to the enjoyment of the thing. It's really a great, peaceful, enjoyable little product that I highly recommend.I put a couple of brightly colored children's stickers on the window around the feeder to make sure the birds don't run into the window (which some reviewers mentioned being a problem), but this may have been an unnecessary precaution, and I have had no birds collisions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Got cats? You need this.","review":"This feeder is great for bird lovers and folks with cats - it keeps our felines entertained all day long (or at least until the seed runs out). In fact I'm back on Amazon tonight looking for another one because it's been such a hit.I'm amazed by how well the suction cups hold. The feeder hasn't budged a bit since we put it up last fall, even when it's full of seed plus half a dozen or so squabbling sparrows. We have not had any trouble with birds running into the window when trying to get to the food.I will say that it took much, much longer than I expected for the birds to find this feeder. We are on the 3rd floor and there's not a lot of cover too close by - but still, it took about six months (and winter months at that!) before we saw our first bird at the feeder. Be patient and they'll discover you eventually, and then you'll be in the same boat we are - constantly running out of sunflower seed."},{"rating":"1","title":"window bird feeder","review":"It is nice that it sticks to the window, but it has been up for 3 weeks and we have yet to see a bird land on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Book","review":"I did not like this book. Not worth the price. No matter how many Nihon Goshin Aikido students write good reviews, it still stinks. I know someone will jump all over me for being honest but I don't want people to waste their hard earned cash. It dosent matter when this martial art was founded and by whom. The book is whats in question here. Nihon Goshin Aikido might be a fine system but this book is not a good example of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fair Book","review":"I have studied Nihon Goshin Aikido. I enjoyed it for a while, but like most, I realized that I would have to study something \\"more effective\\" to be able to defend myself. I don't think it makes a difference if the authors of the book are great martial artists or not. I'm sure they \\"think\\" they are. Whenever anybody writes a book like this, it is a futile exercise in ego. Do we need this book? No. Do we have enough lame books like this, Yes. Its amazing how many offshoots of Aikido there are. And when you look closely, they are all the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"GIVE ME A BREAK!!!!!!","review":"These reviews below are so self serving its sad.This is one of the worst books on Aikido I've ever read. This Kopycough guy has some nerve writting a book on martial arts. The photos are grainy and out of sequence. The english terms like \\"Arm Bar Takedown\\" or \\"ABT\\" Please, its called Ikkyo. Its called Nihon Goshin Aikido yet it uses no Japanese terms? Hmmmm, strange. Why not call it American art of spirit and harmony? Because you cant rip of Real Aikido that way.

I had the feeder a little over a year when the squirrel started investigating this feeder.They started by enlarging the slot hole and eventually made it a large gash that the thistle seed would pour out of.One thing to note is the diameter of the feed tube. The thistle feeder diameter is only about 3\\". I have another Droll feeder that hangs alongside this this thistle feeder (for larger bird with sunflower seeds), and the due to it's much larger diameter (~6\\"), the squirrels have been unable to chomp on it (thusfar).So now I'm looking for a new feeder, and probably one with a larger diameter."},{"rating":"1","title":"needs to protect the seeds from moisture","review":"The bird food is not protected from moisture.

The stand pictured above is gray and it has two boltsfor each support upper and lower. Mine had one bolt persupport. That in itself would not be a major problem but whatis the problem is that the metal they used is around thethickness of cheap sheet metal.

It was the exact stand I needed for my bench saw...Very cool!(Update to other comments...The stand I received is the exact one pictured above. Gray with enough bolts to properly secure the stand and bolt down my table saw. I have used it with my saw for over two years and it has not fallen apart and I have not needed to tighten it. Very dependable however I do agree about the feet. My stand's feet are plastic which does tend to cause it to slide when I am working with large pieces of wood. Rubber feet would have been better.

My favorite track has to be \\"Who's that Girl\\", which had radio play, but desrved more, other good tracks include \\"Cowboy\\", \\"That's What it is\\", \\"Got what ya need\\", \\"Be Me\\" and of course the big hit off the album \\"Let me Blow ya mind\\".

He made hit after hit. Then one day he ran out of creative juices. Yet he still makes music. Eves album w/o swizz would be 4 stars. The two bangers produced by dr. dre make you realize how good eve could be. The lead single produced by Teflon is highly listenable as well. But when we add swizz subpar production added in, the album begins to drag. None of swizz's contributions are noteworthy except thug in the sreet. That song is alright, but the rest of his beats are basically recycled old beats. Dont get me wrong, eve is probably the most talented female emcee out there, she just needs to work more with dre and less with swizz. Eves lyrics even seem to be energized on the dre tracks.

He plays them at full speed then slows it all down for us to understand exactly what is going on.I am hoping you already know how to play because there is some advanced technical picking and fingering going on from time to time.From his killer melodic sense to his brutal diminished attacks, anyone can learn something new here. Take little bits and pieces of what Jeff is teaching and add it to your own playing.I gave this DVD a 4 star rating because I was really hoping he would have broke down at least one song from start to finish....so we could have a better understanding of how he builds a song but....he does get us pretty close.If you are looking to improve your playing and want to add something new to your arsenal, buy this DVD....I did!"},{"rating":"1","title":"dont waste your time","review":"this dvd was terrible, all it is is jeff loomis showing off.i think he is a great guitar player but the lessons were not done well. the free access to the rock house web site is a waste.if i could give it less than a star i would.if any one wants mine they can have it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sex and Politics","review":"Her first cd stopped us dead in her tracks. It was as imaginative, innovative, and impressive soul music as we'd heard in years. So there is no way this, only her second studio recording, figured to have the impact. Similar in style and tone to her first record, it's just that now we have heard it before. Scott remains an immense talent, nevertheless. She is a dynamic singer, a distinctive and sensuous song stylist, a poetic and illuminative songwriter, and an inspiring performer. Scott's organic blend of sex and politics continues to make us think of her as a female Marvin Gaye...without the demons."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jill,","review":"You kept me waiting for a long time, but it was worth it!!

I was pretty worried about this CD. Even though I like her single \\"Golden\\", I kept hoping that she hadn't gotten on the pop bandwagon like everyone else. A whole album of \\"Golden-type\\" songs would have devastated my soul. But instead she has made a perfect combination of \\"Words and Sounds\\". There is not a single song on the CD that I don't like. When I think about the title of the album I can't think of a better name. Every emotion and feeling that rings out of every song is so human. Love, pain, sex, finding yourself, freedom, perseverance, family and friends. It's all so \\"Beautifully Human\\".

Amazing! Can't wait to see you when you go on tour!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful singer, beautiful voice, beautiful sophomore cd!","review":"Jill Scott is one shining gem! Her rich, silky, soulful voice adds so much beauty to this untouchable disc. Talent like this can't be taught. Jill was put on this earth to be a soul singer, PERIOD! The album as a whole is superb, like her first album, and worth every penny. I love the vibes, the jazz, the soul; hell, I love everything about it! Experience the pure pleasure of Ms. Scott's music. Music this soulful and retro is as authentic as it gets - and few can compete with Jill's level of artistry. If you are by chance not a Soul/R&B fan, you will be after listening to this album. Beautiful music from a beautiful singer. DIVINE EAR CANDY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Exceptional Effort from Jill Scott","review":"I'll keep this short...this is an exceptional album.

It was the last copy they had in the music store and I only bought it because a friend said it was the bomb. I loved it, especially Song #7, He Loves Me...man she really kicked it there. I didn't think she could top that CD til I was on vacation the last week in August 2004 and bought the new CD. Beautifully Human is just that. Jill croons about life, love, living and relationships. I listened to nothing but that CD in my car for 6 weeks. The whole CD makes you want to sing, cry, reminisce about your own crazy family.

Has a Minnie Ripperton and Curtis Mayfield combination air to it\\"Not Like Crazy\\" - Crazy about this melodyThe photo on the flip side of the insert is beautifully Jill.

I strongly recommend jill's fans to not approach this one so you can be left with the sweet taste of the past.hearing the love shmaltz over and over again makes you sick, and it seems as if her label know this album is lame so they put all the PR on \\"Golden\\" which is the only loveable-reminds-the-past track.Zack."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sophomore Slump","review":"As a HUGE fan of Jill's first effort, this offering was a big disappointment.Everyone needs a little uplifting in their lives but ever so slowly, literally, preachy, and \\"sap-happily\\" done?

And the repetition of certain lyrics and notes is mind-numbing.I'm glad she's happily in love (with her man and G-O-D). I only wish she could remember all those other complex emotions with her music and put Jazzy Jeff on to backing her voice with more interesting tracks, as well.And, while I'm at it...How many times can the word \\"Golden\\" be repeated in a song?Given that hearing only the first 47 utterances, in the song of the same title, tends to induce vomiting and spontaneous ear combustion, the world may never know..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Regretful!","review":"Very disappointed in Ms. Scott's second offering.

However, this CD was NOT on her better efforts. What made me crazy was all the songs talked about her man, their love and the hot sex they have.I tried 3 times to listen to the disc and I couldn't take it. Clearly, she needs to have a conversation with Angie Stone about how not to annoy her fans. To be fair, I love \\"Golden\\", Cross my Mind and Whatever....very well executed and enjoyable. Hopefully next time she will find something else to make music about. I still love her and will remain a fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT","review":"ooooooooooh I love this CD.

And the voice: crisp, amazing, unique! Kinda of a cross between Billie Holliday and Erykah Badu with a little Sade grove thrown in!

I hope you continue to create music for years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happiness is a Jill Scott CD","review":"With all the junk out there that's being called music, it is so refreshing to have a cd like Beautifully Human. This is the feel good cd of the year. When I first heard Golden on the radio ,I went on a desparate search for the single. You see I am from the 45 generation. I counted the days until the cd dropped. I think every one on my Christmas list is going to get this if they don't already have it. This ranks up there with Songs in the Key of Life. If MS. Scott doesn't clean up at the Grammy's next time, something is terribly wrong in this industry. They dissed her first CD.

Jill Scott opens up the woman's heart, body, mind, and soul unto herself...out loud, and then unto the man who has an ear to hear. And if he hears that understanding of himself and of the woman, tears of joy as well as sorrow will flow down his cheeks of times past and opportunities missed by both. Yet sorrow only endures for the night, joy comes in the morning. So good morning Jill...good morning my new woman, I am your new man."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"This album is beautiful and so is she.

I just can't and it has nothing to do with the material but more to do with my life and where I was when W&S; Vol. I, hit the street and where I am now. W&S;, Vol I, called to me, wrapped me in its realness and newness! This CD, while extremely good and well produced, just doesn't grab me in the same fashion and yet that has nothing to do with the direction Jill took on this project, but more about where I am as an individual.Don't get me wrong or get this review twisted because I definitely play the heck out of this CD. My shortcomings as a listener has no bearing on her talent because she indeed lays it down. Thanks Ms. Jill for producing quality, adult music for us grown people regardless of our personal demons!

Tracks 4 I need you, 07 - Cross my mind, 09 - Family reunion, 7 - Bedda at home and 11 Whatever stand out for me. Want smooth music to chill out to, wind down with a glass of wine (red or white your choice), choose Miss Jill Scott :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet bread it is","review":"This album is very good. It is more instrumental than her previous. But I am not addicted to it the same way I was addicted to her first album, and so I can only rate this a 4. Perhaps it is because I also recently purchased the album That Day by Magic Number, which raises the bar for comparing neo soul albums. Nevertheless, Jill Scott reaches perfection on tracks like Golden and Family Reunion - rich, original, and prolific. The rest of the album is also exceptionally strong. I would have liked to have heard one or two acid jazz/house influenced songs on the album, a peaking genre that neo soul artists are dabbling into with more frequency, but I can't fault Ms. Scott for sticking with her bread and butter - and sweet bread it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hum Drum...","review":"I really like Jill Scott, but the sophmore piece was not at all to me a great work coming from her. I bought this cd for a road trip, and I coulnd't stand it. Every song sounded like the one before it. There was no true median in her approach. Im sure she can do much better. But as a listener and fan, I was very much disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy it and find out for yourself.","review":"\\"Beautifully Human: Words & Sounds 2\\" is easily one of the most interesting and thoughtful R&B releases of 2004. Ther's no denying Jill Scott's talent as a performer and a writer. I fell in love with more than half of the tracks within the first five listens."},{"rating":"2","title":"the most beautiful and musical r&b record of the decade","review":"This album is full of r&b jams with live instruments especially pianos that beautifully mesh well with jill scotts vocals of strong and energetic melodies speaking of love, life and spirituality. This one was definitely worth my money and Jill gives hope to r&b music fans that this genre is still alive and going strong despite what we are bombarded with on BET when it comes to r&b. This album flows even better than the first one too and is much more musical. Get it today"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Soul Classic Indeed","review":"WOW! I thought she could not do better then \\"Who is Jill Scott:Words and Sounds Vol 1\\", but she exceeded by expectations.This is definitedly on of those disc you can play from start to finish with out skipping (although I can play \\"Golden\\" a thousand times over. It's the jam!. Hands down this is an R&B; Soul Classic to enjoy for years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album","review":"I never liked Jill Scott's last album, but this is so much better. She truly redefines neo-soul. She tackles a great deal of topics and the sound is so diverse, there's soul in there, there's jazz, and almost anything good I can think of. I would usually give a few standout tracks, but this album is great to listen to all way from beginning to end."},{"rating":"2","title":"TOUCHED BY AN ANGEL!!!!","review":"This woman is unbelievable.

This CD is absolutely awesome!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply fantastic - again!","review":"No one can write and sing like Jill, whether about love or sex, with so much inspiration and from a place of such power. And do it to tunes that are totally compelling. I agree with the reviewer that the only thing wrong with the disc is that it ends too soon...and it is not a short disc!Once again, another superb release from Jill that will be on the player for a long, long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"The saga continues on a high note","review":"This is a wonderful CD that takes up where Volume One left off. The amazing thing about this music is the insight which it gives us into the world of Aubrey-Maturin. My only small complaint is that both volumes feel as if they were pasted together from exsisting recordings, although it is my understanding they were not. I would have liked to see the music scored as it is in the book for 1 violin, 1 cello. Of course that is a minor gripe.Buy the CDs...they are a great addition to any collection and the perfect backdrop to a winter's night, curled up in chair by the fire.

Even though I admire Mr Mendez for his difficult work as a CIA operative, the book did not keep my interest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining","review":"It isn't a masterpiece. However, it is very entertaining. Sometimes it is straightforward and sometimes it goes backwards but it somehow gets the point across."},{"rating":"2","title":"Provides a frank and interesting story of what it was like to be a spy during the cold war","review":"The book provides a frank discussion of his life as a CIA officer. The book describes his time in Washington, Southeast Asia as well as Russia. Provides interesting detail about certain missions and how they were accomplished. No nonsense description of events and what works and what doesn't in espionage and how things have changed since he joined."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fills in the backdrop to some well known historical events.","review":"The history of the CIA's development of disguises and certain ways to run operations against the Soviet Union was especially interesting.

I really like true stories rather than fiction. It was very informative and factual."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down.","review":"Besides being a great read about exciting real events in espionage, this book gave me a new appreciation for our intelligence agents. While I've seen my share of spy movies and read my share of spy books, somehow it never registered with me that the CIA is filled with incredibly brave and patriotic men and women who deserve the same respect and gratitude I already grant to veterans. I am grateful for Mendez's service, and for correctly this flaw in my outlook."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent True Story of CIA Operations","review":"Mr Mendez gives us a real insider's view of how CIA operations were carried out during the cold war and later. It doesn't contain all the shoot-em-up stuff that most movies would have us believe is real. But it is a facinating look at how real spy business is performed. Since I am a contemporary of his and was in southeast Asia at about the same time (as an Air Force flyer), I frequently ran into some of his \\"partners\\" and admired the work they did. That part of the book was particularly interesting to me. He is also the real hero of the operation that the current highly-rated movie \\"ARGO\\" depicts and it is described in detail in the book. This is a great read. If you are at all interested in how our Spy Agency really operates, this is the book for you!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very interesting book about CIA disguises and missions","review":"True life story written by the man who actually developed the Fake Documents and Disguises group in the CIA. Many interesting details and anecdotes. If you like the movie \\"Argos\\" you'll want to read this book. Of course, the author doesn't give away tips on disguises and faking documents. The CIA and others are still using those methods! But it's good for a general story about how important documents and disguises became. Also how an ordinary guy without spy skills became a power in the CIA. He participated in some missions, but running the group (too many acronyms!) is the focus of the story. I found it entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Master of Disguise","review":"For obvious reasons not much is really known about the CIA. \\"Who Paid the Piper\\" by Frances Stonor Saunders throws some light on the psychological \\"warfare\\" waged by the CIA. \\"The Master of Disguise\\" throws light on other aspects of the CIA's activities. These books viewed in conjunction with snippets which become known now and again by possibly inadvertent statements by US officials gives an insight into just how powerful the CIA is and how far into activities of other countries the CIA stretches. This book is well written and is one of those books which should perhaps be required reading for everybody."},{"rating":"1","title":"Come On, Tony","review":"Come on Tony! How many times can you wave your medal around and make money on books that compromise tradecraft? I don't care whether or not Langley approved your text or whether or not the Russians already know about CIA disguise methods. If you hadn't noticed, they are not our number one problem any more-- its the cut throats (literally) of the terrorist world who would gain by your revelations, and who would surely relish the chance to unmask one of our officers. \\"Secrecy is the lifeblood of intelligence.\\" So you say. A true clandestine warrior keeps his mouth shut, bud."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much detail for me.","review":"Not enough action. It is more of a history of the writer's life than stories of his exploits. Did not finish it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast-paced & Factual","review":"This book is fast-paced by keeping the facts brief and relevant. It's not an expose so much as a pleasant example of an agent who is sharing his more interesting missions in a catchy, intriguing style. A quick, worthwhile read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow! Very impressed with Mr Mendez' story.","review":"Amazing where we find such people! He has shown himself to have been not only a credit to our country, but certainly a demonstrated asset."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT BOOK","review":"This is an amazing book!

Great to read some of the cold war escapades."},{"rating":"1","title":"EXCELLENT IDEA BADLY EXECUTED","review":"Although this book does shed light on a few details of tradecraft and mission, it is poorly written and has nil factor in entertainment value (except chapters 8 and 9 about work in Moscow and Teheran). I read \\"Master of Disguise\\" while also rereading Pete Early's \\"Confessions of a Spy\\" and I couldn't help but to think how wonderful \\"Master\\" could have been with the level of scholarship and thought in Pete Early's book. On top of it all this book doesn't have an index and in a book this boring it would have been really nice to have one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment","review":"i bought this thinking it would have some really thrilling stories about actual events in the life of a CIA agent. Instead, it's page after page of boring recounts of basically administrative events, and really gets boring! I couldn't come close to finishing it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough meat here","review":"Unfortunately, because of the author's position as a forger and disguise-master, he didn't get the plum assignments. No tales of break-ins or derring-do here, but rather hours spent behind a magnifying glass creating documents. The most exciting cases here involve exfiltrating spies and others from behind unfriendly territory. This usuallly involves making a mask for them and walking through an airport. In fact, there's about 3 tales of making masks and walking through airports ... and the author can't tell you the details of the masking technique, because it's secret.I can't help but think that any CIA spook who did see REAL adventure couldn't tell about it anyway because it would be classified. So this is the best we'll get. I'll stick with John LeCarre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very little about the CIA but all about how good the author was.","review":"All we learn in this book is how clever the author was during his years in the CIA and i suspect he had to write a book because his wife did do earlier.

There is very little real 'meat' unless you are interested in becoming a hollywood makeup artist!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste of Time","review":"As another reviewer has noted, there is a paradox in involved in \\"insider\\" stories from the espiocrats. It is completely understandable and commendable that the intelligence community seeks to inform the public of the original, brave work that goes into serving the country's security, but, considering most of the successful work must occur secretively, such promotional efforts ultimately make for dime-store dramas. Such is this book, which I found to be a complete waste of time. I intended to drop it off at the Strand, NYC's great used bookstore, but they already had nearly a shelf-full of these. I was forced to dispose of this book more permanently."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth reading","review":"By sheer coincidence, I happened to buy this book from Amazon the day before I saw the movie Argo, not knowing that the main character in Argo was the author of this book. I found this to be a very interesting read that provided good behind the scenes insight into CIA operations. While there were understandably details that weren't shared, this book provided enough detail to hold my interest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting read","review":"an interesting and real world look into the world of espionage. get the real story from the horses mouth .."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stories poorly told","review":"Very dry to read.

Exceptionally interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"not for everyone","review":"I love spy movies and crime shows. True crime fascinates me and if I could be a spy I would be. I thought this book was wonderful. For those that don't know who Mendez is, he did Argo. As in real life, he planned and executed the actual extraction that Ben Afflec turned into the movie of the year. Mendez breaks down his tactics and his life in the CIA. Its not full of frills and bull, its accurate and interesting and intense what he had to do to make sure people lived through the day. He changed how the CIA operated during the cold war and there after. If you want to know the man behind ARGO, read this book. you might learn something about what ARGO stands for too...it will surprise you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great first hand account","review":"I really liked this book, because it gave a behind the scenes view of being a spy.

I recommend this to all who are interested in the history of the cold war and the role the CIA played in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't miss this book!","review":"All Americans should be aware of the work done by the CIA behind our usual screen.

The book has lots of interesting nuggets of information, on very diverse subjects, but is not at all well-written. Mendez had obviously spent too much of his life with The Company, and apparently has forgotten some of the English we all know and love in favor of CIA alphabet soup, and he has also lived too closed to the operations he described, which makes some of the descriptions essentially incomprehensible. Plus, the book is more a collection of stories than a coherent whole. S"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Read","review":"Haven't finished the book yet, but it is quite interesting.

If you want to become engrossed in a good story of life in the CIA, this is not the book instead he tries to give you a history lesson of CIA life with tidbits here and there in between telling his story.

Whoever says Dre did a bad job with production is crazy. Dre is one of the, if not the best producers out there and his production is off the hook. Granted the beats are more mainstream, but there ain't notin' wrong with that, all it's gonna do is sell more records and get X's great lyrical content out to the public eye.

The Black John McClain lays down some tight tracks on this one. You can tell this is his make or break album. Enlisting the best producers on the West( Dre, Quik and Battlecat) along with the East's hottest( ROcwilder, and Erick Sermon).

Too much bravado, too less substance. I guess the album title for this CD suits it since Xzibit and his production team seemed \\"restless\\" in the studio while recording these lackluster tracks. The only people who get \\"five stars\\" in this case is his record label for overhyping and overpromoting this unworthy album like crazy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plummet","review":"Xzibit's Restless gets worse and worse with each listen. The first time I was a little generous on this album and it received three stars. But now going back trying to listen to it...it just aint hittin on nothing. This album is complete garbage. I had so many high expectations for this album...but am extremely disappointed. There's only about three good songs. Xzibit's aggressiveness and lyrical prowess is nowhere to be found, the beats are too commercialized and poppy sounding...it just makes me want to throw up. To me this is the equivalent of Faboulous' album, in terms of wackness...and I wouldn't recommend it all....not even to burn it from a friend. His other albums are exponentially greater than this trash...Lets just hope his next album \`Man Vs. Machine' is nothing like this.

Though this work may surprise some, others of us in the know fully expected what is revealed herein: hysterical panegyrics to ecstatic catamitical experiences, obsessive referencing of his intercrural initiations, and dreamy fantasies of The Glory That Was Greased [sic]....Young Kyle's revelation was a long time a-comin'...and the comin' has definitely exposed his position as deeply in arrears. This is a seminal work, no doubt about it. But years of rough treatment by the critics has left a gaping hole in Kyle's oeuvre, with no one now who can fill it. Perhaps only G-Unit can measure up to the task, which requires the utmost probity. It would seem to be fertile ground to plow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gone downhill","review":"Xzibit's debut was awesome. his 2nd was very good. this being his 3rd was OK, nothing special. and obviously man vs machine has to be his worst album. Anyway, onto the review, this overall was a major disappointment - it just doesn't have enough good songs on it. Sure, there are some gems, such as X, Kenny Parker Show, Get Your Walk On, and Sorry I'm Away So Much, but thats just about it. There are some not bad/average tracks, then the rest are pathetic. Alkaholic is one of the worst songs, it has one of the most corniest beats ever, and the lyrical content is pathetic. Only buy this if you are a die-hard Xzibit fan. If you want Xzibit at his best, then get At The Speed Of Life, and 40 Dayz 40 Nightz, because they are both far better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Finish Listening","review":"Since the first ten tracks were so uneven, there was really no point in finishing the album, which I bought because of \\"X,\\" which I have learned is a mistake.

This would be a cd I would highly recommend to the true fan of Xzibit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Xcruciating. Xcess. Xcrement.","review":"Being the biggest Xzibit fan that exits, I am sorely disappointed with the album and direction Xzibit is headed. Restless will sell more albums than his previous releases, but the quality of his lyrical work has drifted into what is wrong with L.A. rap now. Too much gloss, not enough substance. Weak attempts at funk don't manage to measure up to the excitement of Xzibit's character. Lyrically, he's pretty decent, but not great. The hooks are too wordy for what he's attempting. He's been saying this album is 120% better than his last album- he's dreaming. E-Swift, Thayod, Sir Jinx and DJ Muggs brought real heat to those previous albums. Dr. Dre and company don't really do anything for this album that is senses shattering. It's an attempt to include Xzibit to the \\"L.A.\\" sound, but that sound is played. It's time for new music, something exciting. This ain't it. \\"Only in the money for the fame Xtra large, that's Paparazzi.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"You know whos runnin these F(_)cking streets","review":"This album has a bunch of dope songs these are my ratings.

It features Christmas songs played in the group's trademark instrumental style. Most of the songs start with the first few seconds of a familiar rock hit, before transforming into a Christmas song. Some examples: \\"Sleigh Ride\\" opens with \\"Walk, Don't Run\\". \\"Santa Claus is Coming To Town\\" opens with \\"Wooly Bully\\". \\"Jingle Bells\\" opens with \\"What'd I Say\\". \\"Jingle Bell Rock\\" opens with \\"Memphis\\". \\"Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer\\" opens with \\"I Feel Fine\\". And \\"Frosty the Snowman\\" opens with \\"Tequila\\". Frequently, riffs from the rock hit that opens the song will be repeated later in the song. The song titled \\"Snowflakes\\" is really \\"Greensleeves\\". \\"Scrooge\\" is an original tune. This is a really fun album, which will bring a smile to the faces of fans of instrumental rock. The Ventures version of \\"Sleigh Ride\\" happens to be my favorite version of that tune."},{"rating":"2","title":"the ventures christmas album","review":"Even if you did not grow up with the Ventures, you've heard the music!

Furthermore, the voices just don't match what you are seeing on the screen its like a Japanese B-movie.On to the content: in the ten minutes there were at least 40 one-liners that were supposed to get laughs. I did not laugh at one of them, not a chuckle.

Spoiler alert from here out.The main character gets thru the whole movie never learning his damn lesson but in the finaL scene everyone is just like whatever it doesn't matter.Another low point for me was the scene that lasted forever too long about Tucker pooping his own pants. If you want to watch a guy literally crap himself for about 3 minutes this is the movie for you.

I spent the entire 104 useless minutes of the movie wondering when they would show something even close to anything contained in the book.

I'd recommend this book to anyone interested in truly understanding the concepts behind this upcoming technology."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very pretty, very very slight defect.","review":"These earrings are great. It's nice to have such pretty studs. However, I am nit-picky. One of the pearls is slightly off as far as symmetry goes. It's something that bothers me because they are a $50 dollar pair of earrings (not earrings from Claire's or Target). Still, they're beautiful."},{"rating":"2","title":"History of Creation","review":"Colin Gunton believes (and rightfully so) that creation cannot truly be understood except in a Trinitarian conception. Understanding God as the Holy Trinity lays the foundation for all other theology and in particular creation.Gunton weaves together both Historical and Systematic Theology to present a case for understanding the Trinity and Creation. He intertestingly notes that when the doctrine of the Trinity fell into dispute or was just placed upon the shelves of church history to collect dust that the effect was evident upon man.Only a proper understanding of the Trinity will bring balance between the transcedence and immanence of God. God and his relation to his creation can only be properly understood when God is TrinityThis is an excellent book, but one that will take work to get through. In the end the effort put out will be worth while."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Case","review":"I have the PSP version of the Intec Pro Gamer's Case, so with my PS3 purchase, it only came natural to me to also purchase the PS3 version. I was not disappointed by any means, with ample room and protective abilities. A must-buy for the PS3 gamer on the go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great ravel aide","review":"This item is plastic with very little padding. The dividers inside of the case are made of thin wood with a thin felt covering. Do not plan to drop this case with your PSE# packed inside and expect 100% or even 80% chance of finding no internal or external system damage. Do not ship this case or toss it in as a seperate luggage item at an airport. This case is best used for personal transport, from one location to the next. You will still need to treat this case with care, and it both looks and feels like the case it easily damaged.Despite this, I am still glad I purchased this case. It will be packed inside of a larger case when I return home. After that, this case will be great for tossing the PS3 in the back of my car, if the need ever presents itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Like Abraham Lincoln","review":"Mr. Potts not only looks like Abraham Lincoln but is a confirmed Lincolnphile who shares many other attributes of Mr. Lincoln's with his young neighbor who in turn shares Mr. Potts with his schoolmates for a special program on Lincoln's birthday. A clever story that presents pertinent facts about a beloved president for young children. As a school librarian I enjoy reading this to kindergarten students for Presidents Day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Cheap, Like a Toy.","review":"This screwdriver was very disappointing. I was shocked when I first handled it. It could honestly be considered a toy screwdriver. Ratcheting gear is extremely weak and shaft is very hollow. Like I say very cheap, I have never used a Klein tool before and I doubt I would ever use another one after this. If you are looking for a professional tool.. Beware!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Album of the Year contender","review":"Kim Richey's third album Glimmer is a brilliant and beautiful effort. For the uninitiated, Richey is a softer Sheryl Crow but a more road-weary Mary Chapin Carpenter. She writes all of her own material, and what fine material it is. This is my early choice for album of the year. All 14 tracks are true gems exploring relationships, old friends and the gravity of life. \\"Keep Me\\" is one of the finest songs to grace my car stereo for some time. You will not be disappointed; buy this album today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazon reviewer missed the boat!","review":"I heard a Kim Richey song on the radio and, since I had never heard of her, I didn't know which album it was from but I wanted to get it. (Turns out the song was \\"Come Around\\".) I got both Bitter Sweet and Glimmer, and listened to Bitter Sweet first. I was pretty disappointed; it was way too twangy country for my taste. So I was doubly surprised by Glimmer - an all-around terrific album. Great vocals, great lyrics, great musical performance. I'm not a big fan of straight pop either, but this one's way up there on my list."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST","review":"Kim Richey has done it all! She has been a country singer and now she has done a WONDERFUL crossover into pop with her new album \\"Glimmer\\". This is the best CD of her career. The standout song of the album is most definetly \\"Come Around\\" (which also appears on the \\"For Love of the Game\\" soundtrack). It is a haunting song that deals with the ups and downs of love. This CD is the best. If you love a little bit of country and a little bit of pop, then you will love the new one by Kim Richey!"},{"rating":"2","title":"For those burnt out on country chicks","review":"I stopped buying country ladies last year: the Martinas and Saras and whatnot were all starting to sound alike. I got Glimmer as a Christmas present from my brother-in-law, thank you, thank you! Smart, soulful music with a lot of minor key harmonies. I play it at least twice a week; you will, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Music.","review":"Just want to say this albumful of voice, music and songwriting is just what I needed this summer. I just keep listening to so many of these songs, Kim has finally come into her own and added a nice tasteful mix, this one is a winner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Album of the Year?","review":"Of course not. This album doesn't have a snowball's chance in hell to win Album of the Year honors from any awarding body. But it's *that* good. I also own the first two Kim Richey albums, both of which I enjoyed thoroughly. Yes, \\"Glimmer\\" is decidedly more pop-oriented. And after one or two listens it just didn't click with me. But after a few more listens, this collection grew on me to the point that I can't stop listening to it. All of the songs--all written or co-written by Kim--are brilliant. Catchy melodies, great lyrics, great playing. I can't say enough about this album. And to think that Kim thought about getting out of the music business after her last album. Boy, am I glad she stuck with it. This is a wonderful album by a terribly under-rated, under-appreciated singer-songwriter. I'd recommmend it highly to anyone (and have a dozen or so times already)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly disappointing.","review":"I like Kim Richey a lot. This collection is not representative of her spunk and unique character. The arrangements are boring and the lyrics uninspiring. Pass over this one. Just about any of her other albums are better than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"COME AROUND IS HAUNTINGLY BEAUTIFUL","review":"PULLING INTO A NEW TOWN I FINALLY GOT INTO MY HOTEL ROOM AND THE RADIO WAS PLAYING \\"COME AROUND\\". THE SONG HAUNTED ME SO MUCH I CALLED THE STATION UNTIL THEY ANSWERED AND TOLD ME WHO THE ARTIST WAS.MS RICHIE HAD ME IN THE PALM OF HER HAND WITH THAT SONG, BUT GETTING THE CD WAS LESS HAUNTING THAN HOKEY.... SEEMS SHES CAUGHT BETWEEN SINGING JINGLES ,TWANGING COUNTRY AND DOING MIDDLE OF THE ROAD POPTOO BAD INDEED."},{"rating":"1","title":"major disappointment.","review":"After buying and loving Kim's last two albums I looked forward to this eagerly. What a bummer! This album stinks. The production completely loses what this lady is about. They have completely lost direction - its so different from the last albums - unrecognizable Kim Richey. Yet another 'Country' artist tries to crossover to mainstream pop - why bother! I'd like my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"better luck next time","review":"So, let me make sure I have this straight: Country music is too bland, Mercury Nashville wants all its girl singers to sound like Shania. So, in a burst of artistic independence, Kim Richey hightails it for the label's NY pop division, and puts out what sounds like a bland collection of Shania Twain ballads. This is progress?I even wonder if this really is her. Has anyone else noticed that the the photo of the singer on the back cover doesn't really look like Kim Richey? Perhaps this is a charlatan, posing as her. That could explain it.Note to record buyer considering purchasing his/her first Kim Richey CD: Get her self-titled debut or Bittersweet. Skip this one"},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment","review":"Kim Richey's new \\"sound\\" is a huge disappointment. My whole family loves \\"Bitter Sweet\\"... the tunes and words stick in your head; the banjo, guitar and dobro and Kim's voice rings true. \\"Glimmer\\" is just one more boring concession to some producer's idea of what sells (please, not another Sarah McLachlan!!!), and Kim's heart doesn't seem in it. Not one song is memorable. The next thing you know Allison Kraus will go mainstream... oh no, not her too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zzzzzzz","review":"I am in more of an agreement with the Amazon reviewer. This is a good album if you're looking for substitute sleeping pills. (Warning -- if you're going to drive, play her first album instead.) There's nothing here that grabs me like the first two albums did -- it really does feel overly produced. In reference to our local station, WXPN, I did hear them play something the other day and my first thought was \\"great! - Kim Richey\\". That didn't last long as it was followed by \\"why are they playing this watered down pop?\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Crisp, clear and amazing","review":"The whole set is wonderful. Her clarity is in the vein of Maura O'Connell and her voice reminds you of a young, vital Linda Ronstadt with some Kelly Willis thrown in for good measure. Great stuff. She just keeps getting better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Emerging Talent","review":"I really liked this album from just listening to it at the record store sampler kiosk. Never heard of her before. I emphatically agree with the customer who disputed the negative Amazon review. This lady has tremendous talent. Perhaps she has the talent and ability to create at a much higher level, but this CD doesn't deserve to be dismissed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Toddler Toy","review":"Santa brought this for my youngest son (he's 1). He loves it! I is so versatile and easy to play with. My four y.o. likes to play with his little bro, with this table. Full of activities. I do wish it cam with more blocks though. I will recommend this toy to all my girlfriends for their little ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very challenging and not enough blocks","review":"I love Chicco toys and I have bought more than a few for my daughter. I ordered this flip table online when she was 21 mos old.I was so disappointed when I saw it. The \\"activity\\" portion is very simplistic and not very challenging for a child who is over 1 1/2. When it is flipped to build blocks -- well, there really aren't very many blocks provided. I even tried to find out how to order more blocks but I haven't been able to. I do not think it should be suggested for any toddler over 18 mos and certainly not 3 years old as indicated on the website."},{"rating":"2","title":"He thinks it's a ride on toy!","review":"We bought this for my son for his first birthday and it took him less than one week to figure out that he can remove the flip table and crawl up into the table base. He then tries to shake the base to get it to move like his wagon. (Once propelling himself and the table base backwards onto the floor.) I now have to remove the flip table every morning and turn the base upside down so that he will not injure himself. However, he still loves to play with the table top activities on the floor! It's a fun toy, even though he is not using it as originally intended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Gift Idea!","review":"My parents gave this to my daughter as a gift for Christmas,it stays at their house so when she comes over she can play with it.It is such a neat table with lots of interesting things to do. My daughter especially loves the train and the sound it makes. I think she will get alot of use out of this table for many years to come!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fun and learning, but tips and comes apart.","review":"This is a fun toy that teaches cause and effect as well as helping to build motor skills. The only downfalls are that it can tip fairly easily on little ones just learning to pull up and stand (although it's lightweight, so not too dangerous), and the legs fall off pretty easily when little ones turn destructive. Neither of these pitfalls would keep me from buying this over again as it's still a great toy, but I think parents should know in case they have a climber who requires a sturdier toy."},{"rating":"2","title":"My son loves it!","review":"I got this toy for my son when he was 9 months old to give him something to pull himself up on. He loves all of the activities, especially the train noises. It's also a big hit with our play group!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too infantile for toddlers","review":"It might be fun for younger babies, but for my 18-mo-old, it was too infantile. (I've noticed the enthusiastic reviews on this product come from moms of babies under 1, although the recommended age by mfr. is 1+.)Not much different from what was on his old exersaucer. Yes, it does have the lego-style blocks, but he has a separate collection of those that are more sophisticated and to his liking. In addition, the height of the table is too low for him (he's 33\\" tall) and he was awkwardly bending from the middle of the waist to play with it. In all, his interest lasted a few days, and then we gave it away to a younger neighbor."},{"rating":"1","title":"too late for my 1 year old!","review":"I think I missed the boat on this one; I bought it for xmas for my 13 month old and the only real play it gets is when my daughter and her 3 year old brother take off the \\"play top\\" and sit inside it! They think thats fun but thats about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Correction","review":"Just wrote a review and misnamed Chicco blocks as \\"mondo\\" when \\"Modo\\" is the correct name. Please correct! Thanks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Grandson was not interested in this toy","review":"My 15 mo old grandson was not interested in this toy, except to pull the top part off (which does not attach in any way, just lays down on top of the table). The blocks are too advanced for his age, and the train only makes a hoot sound-no songs as advertised. Money down the drain. Too low to sit a childs chair up to it as the picture shows"},{"rating":"2","title":"Watch the legs","review":"This is a fun toy and my 3 children play with it a lot but since the top comes off to flip over, my baby likes to take it off and sit in the base as a chair and this is NOT safe. the legs come off too easily. any amount of pressure and they flop out. so even if you have a little one leaning on it for balance trying to play the legs fall off and they end up on top of the toy on the floor. so the top is lots of fun just take it off the base before the recommened age plays with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loves that train!","review":"We got this toy for my son on his 1st birthday, and he loves it! He stands up at it and plays with the train and makes the choo-choo noises! He had never seen a train before this toy, so this thrilled us. Now he loves trains. He loves to play with the blocks on the part with the train also, putting them in the slots and banging them together. He can't build things with the building blocks yet, but he loves to play with them. This toy will be around for a hwile because he can grow into the blocks. It's the best toy, and well woth it! We've given 2 away as gifts already!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Getting a lot of use out of this tool, but not without flaws","review":"I am a novice woodworker and received this miter jig with my Delta CS. I've gotten a lot of use out the tool in a pretty short period of time, which is why I gave it 4 stars. However, I've had some of the same problems as others - unit is very heavy, so getting it on and off the table is a bit of pain. The weight should make for smooth travel, but I still get a fair amount of resistance - slot key is set to minimum width. BTW, first slot key I received was warped and I had to get a new one from Delta (who were very helpful). Also find you have to be careful with the stop because it moves 1/8\\" or more as you tighten it down. Those issues aside, the unit functions well - I've used it to crosscut plywood panels and hardwoods and have been happy with the results. This is the only sliding miter jig I've used, so I cannot judge how it compares to others."},{"rating":"1","title":"James Flannery: Master of the Fermata","review":"Do these songs have rhythm? You would never know listening to this disk. Flannery's voice seems overly pleased with its ability to hit pitch - so much so that he can't resist holding just about every note beyond its allotted time. Kudos to Janet Harbison for putting up with it long enough to finish the album. If you're looking for good Thomas Moore, seek out theInvocation recordings, which sadly have been discontinued by the manufacturer . If it's good Irish Blarney you're looking for, stick with McCormack - he at least could control his vibrato."},{"rating":"1","title":"A cheap , ugly production.","review":"From a group that is recognised for their early innovative concert visuals I cannot believe the tawdry product they have served here. The visuals look like the were produced in the early 80's on a commodore-64 computer. Why the repeated images of the female musician on sax and other reed instruments when none are featured on the soundtrack? (granted she is easy on the eye compared to the other two heaps).Avoid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"I happened on this book by accident and was thrilled. The title is somewhat deceiving because sex is only a part of it. The main theme of this book is female empowerment, which involves making good decisions and being true to yourself. This book touches on all aspects of any woman's life and I got as much out of it as they will. Hopefully it will inspire my girls to realize the importance of a strong, smart woman and aspire to be her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great variety of True Art","review":"You can't get a handle of Dan Schwartz without The Art of Making Fire. The Art of this album is creating organic songs that explore themes like racism, decision-making, teachers, memory, family, feeling numb, living your dreams, and taking a joyride! And every song on this album is great. This album gets some play on Cities 97's Acoustic Sunrise, but it should be played on a regular basis. It flows in a style similar to Dave Matthews Band, Joe Nicola, and Sharon Isbin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Roadster was a big Hit for my child","review":"Very satisfied with the scooter.

The valve stem is significantly shorter than the tube that came out of the wheel. It is also significantly shorter (by about a third of an inch) than an XLC branded thorn resistant tube I purchased for another bike.I purchased 4 of these tubes to fix 2 bikes. The stems were all the same length.Because of this, the stem does not stick out from the rim far enough to get an inflation valve head on it to inflate the tube.Other than that it seems sturdy enough and is on a par with other thorn resistant tubes I have purchased."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much padding, too many typos","review":"While this book does provide a reasonable overview, I found it rather disappointing.It has too many errors. With highly technical material, it is imperative that the information is correct or else you can't trust it. For example a minus instead of a plus does not help when explaining terminology.Only half the book is really about fuzzy logic. There is far too much padding eg. 1.large diagrams showing Moore's Law and the layers in an IC gate. These are not subjects that should be covered in a book on fuzzy logic and one is forced to conclude that the author had a page quota to be reached and did it by adding these secions and large verbose reference sections.A worked example or an appendix showing an algorithm in C would have been far more useful."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT the official version","review":"911 Mysteries Part 1: DemolitionsThe official version from director Sofia Smallstorm / Avatar LLC is the one linked above.

IT'S ONE OF THOSE NIGHTS(yes love) and GIRL YOU MAKE MY DAY are excellent tunes.

Although, I was a loyal fan of the hit show \\"The Partridge Family\\", and of course, David Cassidy, once I listened to this, I became even more of a fan. David has always put his whole heart & soul into all the songs he sings, and so, his voice blended very well with all the many others that contributed their vocals for his records. \\"shopping bag\\" record is upbeat and fun to listen to.

Too long for a 'thin' plot."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fast read that I couldn't put down...","review":"First I must tell you that I don't typically read books like this one, but I love it! It is fast-paced, based in historical fact, suspenseful, and romantic. The imagery really takes you back to 1945 Berlin as it struggled to find its way, despite the ravages of war. You can empathize with the soldiers (both Russian and from the Allied Powers), and the German citizens as they dealt with death, distruction, poverty, guilt, and violence. In every chapter there is something to keep you reading and wanting to know more.

It's really terrible. Jones was sinking deep into his own private, self-destructive hell at the time, drinking, drugging and missing shows left and right. And, for once, he let it get to him in the studio as well. This is a slapdash, what-the-heck record, with covers of old rock songs like \\"Roll Over, Beethoven,\\" \\"Maybelline,\\" \\"Tutti Frutti\\" and \\"Kansas City,\\" banged out in the studio with a heavy blues beat, and Jones and Paycheck swapping lines as the songs thunder past. Doubtless they had fun partying together, but the results weren't so great as far as the rest of us go. Sigh. On the other hand, it's all up from here!

Do not waste your money buying or even renting this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Funny at times, but it went nowhere quick","review":"This movie did have some really funny moments in it, and overall, I thought it was funnier then its predecessor, Barbershop. The acting was pretty solid, to. However, Barbershop had something from start to finish that this movie completely lacked, a plot. This story really went nowhere because there was a lack of a goal throughout it. And after I came to the end of it, I realized why this movie probably didn't get picked up for theatrical distribution, it felt really short! If the producers would have put as much effort into improving the script as they did with getting name brand people in it (stars) then it probably could have went somewhere. Oh well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre! 2.5 stars","review":"I think this film a great story but the writing wasn't thatinteresting to really pull it off. The director in the specialfeaturette says the idea to write it came from the fact thatBarbershop made a lot of money and felt that it was obvious aBeautyshop counterpart needed to be made. However, Barbershopwas not that great of a film to begin with in my opinion and you really can't compare this film with it. Notably this film wasn't really funny. Although I'm crazy about Jenifer Lewis (Nora), she's not given a good script to work with here. It's also nice to see Tatiyana Ali. I will say Nora's Hair Salonseemed to be on the right track but something is definitelyamiss. It needs more juice."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great read! All fun!!","review":"What a great book!!! All fun and I really liked the ultra resourceful female pilot. I imagine Capt Kim Kaneda to look like the female Marine Corps Jag Officer on the TV show \\"JAG\\". Knight Hawk reads like one of the original Clancy novels but without all the convoluted political machinations. It is very believeable that we might have a weapon like the Knight Hawk.

Another reviewer noticed the similarity of this book to Tom Clancy! Stolen nuclear bombs sounds like 'Broken Arrow' - is this greatest challenge the end of history or a new world order? The author's technical knowledge obviously came from his years as a USAF Officer, working with all types of aircraft. When's the next book coming out?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor effort...","review":"I didn't have high hopes for this book, and it didn't disappoint me. The F-15 pilot can apparently fly halfway around the country on afterburner before fueling, and can defeat many-on-one scenarios at will. Anyone that has the slightest knowledge of modern day fighters and weapons would know that this scenario could never play out. The book seems more like some daydream of a teenager than a well thought out techothriller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely unbelievable","review":"In order for someone to buy into the plot of this book, several things must be true. 1 - The majority of US fighter pilots are incredibly inept. 2 - The majority of US fighter weapons are incredibly inaccurate. If you can ignore the spelling errors, as well as the improper use of terminology, and have absolutely nothing else to do, you may enjoy the book. I found that reading it was actually a chore, and that doesn't happen to me often. Don't bother.

As one who originally hailed from Kansas and had been in and out of Tulsa twice a year since 1947, I was certainly familiar with the Oil Capitol; thus, Madigan's book spoke to me from the book rack. However, I found myself frustrated by the lack of a map of the Greenwood area. I actually had to buy a map of Tulsa and sit down with underlined passages in order to recreate exactly where Greenwood was. This is not the author's fault but it certainly is the fault of his editor at Thomas Dunne Books. (Too be honest, other books about the same subject also see maps as expendible). In any case you can smell the smoke in Madigan's account and you get a viseral reaction to the whole sad scene. The book is tangible proof that Ben Jonson was correct when he said that \\"Sunlight is the best solvent.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting subject, poor book","review":"I frankly had never heard of the awful race riot in Tulsa on May 31 and June 1, 1921. This account is slipshoddily written by a journalist, not by a historian. The book has no footnotes and no real bibliography. So much of the account is devoted to guessing and while the book is rightly sympathetic to the black victims the account often lapses into juvenilistic maudlin journalism. The story is important, the event is full of horrific atrocities by white people, but the telling is not done well. Instead of expatiating on how awful things were I would far rather the author had laid out the facts, complete with footnotes. ...I simply have no faith that this account is objective and accurate.

This was my second book by Jon, my first being \\"Into the Wild.\\" This book was probably the most incredible book I have ever read.This book shows how people actually think while at 25,000 to 29,000 feet. This book will either draw you closer to climbing Everest, or push you farther away (probably the latter being the most acurate!)This is a non-fiction novel that is not boring. It will keep you hooked until the very end! It adds an entirely different twist to climbing Everest, coming from first-hand accounts of the 1996 disaster. This is a definite buy!!I would also recommend seeing the IMAX, \\"Everest\\", before reading the book. I did and it helped me visualize each step they took and I also see who some of the characters were he talked about.Great job Jon, keep up the FANTASTIC work."},{"rating":"2","title":"A moving, thrilling, & informative climbing adventure story.","review":"I'm not a climber, and probably never will be. However, I thoroughly enjoyed reading Jon's account of the Everest disaster. The best part of this book was being able to re-live the adventure from beginning to end. The author was very graphic in his descriptions; it was almost like being there except without the cold. I empathize with the author and those who survived (especially Beck--that would be me). Sure, mistakes were made...that's humanity. Extreme sports always carry a risk. Thanks to the author, I can imagine the extreme conditions, physical/mental exhaustion, bitter cold, and a host of other difficulties which these climbers experienced. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A thrilling intesting Story about Everest","review":"This book is the best book I have ever read in my life.

The kindle version of this book contains missing sentences every 500 words or so. In effect, the kindle version of this book is not this book, which I first read on paper.Suppose Amazon shipped you a paper copy of Into Thin Air that was redacted like a classified document released under the Freedom of Information Act. That is effectively what this kindle book is.Yes, I know it's the publisher's fault.

I don't know a thing about mountain climbing, but now I find myself haunted by the events I've read about. One thing I feel is sadness that some of the people involved feel compelled to point fingers and \\"blame\\" one another. How could you possibly judge someone's actions when they are freezing, oxygen depleted, and incoherent? It's hard enough to (emotionally) let go of these experiences. People do what they can in the circumstances. It's a sad thing to see these survivors bickering over who didn't do enough, who did more, etc... They should just be glad they've survived and not lay blame. The photo book \\"Mountain Without Mercy\\" with the photographs of David Breashears is also beautiful."},{"rating":"2","title":"A amazing book, you won't be able to put it dowm!","review":"This was a great book.

We are just in the post-Titanic months, and we are thirsting for life-death adventure. We enjoy reading about people who see the face of death and tremble. It is definitely a catharsis for the author. It is his cleansing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gripingly suspenseful novel","review":"I often read alot of novels, but nothing has intrigued me more or captivated my attention as much as this book! The novel is filled with detailed and suspenseful accounts of his climb to the top of Mt. Everest, which captures the imagination of the reader.

I definitely recommend this novel to someone who has alot of time on his/her hands and enjoys a good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful book","review":"I can't understand the yo-yo's on this review page only giving this book 2 or 3 stars. Just because it is a factual account of a tragedy on Everest and isn't jam packed full of fictional action doesn't mean it's a bad book. In reality, this book is wonderful and amazing. John did a great job writing the book, especially after all he's gone through. I would recommend this book to anyone who found the tragedy unbelievable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intense reading!","review":"Fantastic account of this story, on the edge thriller and especially intense reading on the decent back down from the summit. This book only lasted 30 hours from when the box arrived from Amazon!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a way to make money","review":"The author claims that he is a liberal. He critisizes people like Sandy Pittman, who in his opinion was unfit to climb Everest. She was there only because she was rich and able to pay 75,000 dollars. At the same time, however, he wrote a book about the tragedy, which made him a lot of money. He was no different then the rest of the paying customers. As much as he is trying to convince the reader that he is a professional climber, it is obvious that he has no idea how to behave on the mountain. 90% of the story is full of self pity and excuses for not trying to help the others. All he thinks of is his own survival. He also critisizes the brave Boukreev, who rescued three people (God rest his soul) while Krakauer was sleeping in his tent. This book is the work of a mediocre go-getter. Read \\"the Climb\\" and forget about this pot head."},{"rating":"1","title":"Out of Thin Air","review":"This is the type of book where you can't wait until the wheels start spinning, problem was the wheels don't start to spin until the final three chapters. I was VERY disappointed with this \\"masterpiece\\". Not only was it too detailed, but it seemed like the author just wrote words for the sake of proloning the book. Don't get me wrong during the end it does get a little better, but absolutely not worth the first two hundred and some odd pages it takes to get there. My recommendation is this: unless you're the hiker/climber type, I wouldn't waste your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent account","review":"Well written, easy to follow. The authors story is very believable. I would recommend it to anyone that enjoys adventure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating","review":"I read this book when it was first published, and more recently when it was a required selection for my 7th grader. The timing of the second reading coincided with the deadly climbing season of 2012. Interestingly, many of the recent deaths were eerily similar to the events that unfolded in 1996. Krakauer's writing is candid, thrilling, and doesn't disappoint. A truly terrific read."},{"rating":"2","title":"INTO THIN AIR","review":"This is an incredible detailed account of a life and death expedition up Everest that went very wrong. Jon Krakauers' writing grips you from the very first page and doesn't let go, even once you've ended the book.The story and the characters haunts you in such a way that you are compelled to re-read it for a second time.......After finishing \\" Into Thin Air \\" I read \\" Under the Banner of Heaven \\" which was just as well researched, educational, and again haunting. This book is a MUST read for anyone planning on voting in the next presidental election."},{"rating":"2","title":"Riveting Account of Everest Disaster","review":"Full disclosure: I'm no mountaineer, and the only rock climbing I've ever done is inside, but Krakauer's book is one heckuva read. I've been following the stories recently in the news, detailing 150 climbers making the ascent, and each article referenced this account of the 1996 disaster.Krakauer's descriptions create memorable images, from his time in Lobuje at the base of Everest, to the chilling events at the top of the mountain. There is a marked difference between the opening chapters- and the vivid, Technicolor descriptions- and the detached, still-in-shock tone after his descent.One additional note: I didn't get the anti-Boukreev slant some other reviewers are noting- in fact, Krakauer calls his actions \\"heroic\\" more than once."},{"rating":"2","title":"Into Thin Air by Parker Kemp \\"from The Walker School\\"","review":"I thought Into Thin Air was a good book, but could do without all of Mount Everest's whole history. In the beginning, the book was mainly the history with just a little bit of the main story. But, later on, the book really got into the action and adventure of this Mount Everest disaster. I thought that this book did a great job of allowing the reader to imagine what it would feel like to be on top of that mountain. In the end, this was an excitng story about a great adventure. If there was a little bit less history anout previous expeditions, I would have given this book 5 stars, but for these reasons I gave this book 4 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull as Dull can be","review":"I can't help but falling asleep when I read this book!

It does have some language in it but other than that, it was really good. It doesn't hold up to Into the Wild, which is awesome, but Jon Krakauer is a great writer and I recommend this book for anyone who enjoys reading, nature, and being outside."},{"rating":"1","title":"Account not truthful","review":"I have read \\"Into thin air\\" by Krakauer and \\"The Climb\\" by Anatoli Boukreev, and I think Boukreev does a far better job of telling the truth about what happened on Everest that day. Boukreev saved several lives that day at risk to his own, while Krakauer was selfishly trying to save his own by borrowing oxygen and hurrying down the mountain. He accuses Boukreev of hurrying down to save himself, but Boukreev went early so he could then go back out with more oxygen to help other climbers. I reccomend The Climb as a far better, and truthful read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a book, but a Personal Vendetta","review":"What a joke. This book is not an \\"account\\" of the tragedy on Mt Everest, but, rather, an attempt by Mr Krakauer to lay all of the blame for the events at the feet of Anatoli Boukreev. Fairly ironic coming from the guy who slept in his tent while Boukreev, oxygen or not, was out searching in the blizzard in the middle of the night. I guess this was how Krakauer decided to sensationalize the book to maximize his profits from the tragedy. If you want to read a better book about it, check out \\"The Climb\\" by Boukreev. His account seems to match more closely with all of the other newspaper and magazine accounts that were written about these events. I only wish I could have given it zero stars instead of one."},{"rating":"1","title":"exciting storytelling but dishonest","review":"Krakauer tells an exciting story, well-written and captivating. But what is for real and what is fanciful writing? The lack of truth and credibility took away from my enjoyment of the book. This book caused so much outrage that Anatoli Boukreev and others who were involved in this disaster later wrote their own books to get the story straight. Krakauer makes assumptions and implicates people as at fault, mainly to have a good protaganist in the story. Its disturbing that this book has won so much acclaim. Exaggeration is one thing, but ripping apart people who risked their lives to save others isn't meritted. Krakauer certainly wasn't out there rescuing people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Questionable","review":"It seems de riguer to have a magazine writer expand his favorite disaster into a book. I think chest beating, hair tearing accounts of watching other people die under the geographically distant and convenient bubble of journalism suck.Although most people agree that this book is a very profitable damnation of adventure gone bezerk shouldn't the author and the readers be included in this rogue's gallery.Maybe Jon (who makes his money writing about Yuppie adventure) would like to donate all his profits from the book (and I would assume movie) to redirecting people's adventurous pursuits into helping people in hard places, instead of using up their precious resources, enslaving and endangering their people.This book makes money from the very thing it says it despizes. Meaningless adventure pursued by ignorant self centered people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Entertaining, but...","review":"Krakauers account of the 1996 Everest disaster is a one sided, egotistical tirade. While his writing style is easy and fluid, it is the underlying tone of Krakauers story that I found offensive. Too be sure, I could not put the book down as Krakauer is an expert weaver of tales, but upon reflection, the book was nothing more then one mans attempt to assign blame for the events on Everest in May 1996. Read the book, but realize all the time that there are two sides to every story. \\"The Climb\\" by the now deceased Anatoli Boukereev is the rebuttal to Krakauers \\"In to Thin Air\\". Read back to back, you are assured of many entertaining hours."},{"rating":"1","title":"A long magazine article about stupid human climbing tricks.","review":"If this book serves any purpose it will stop people from taking the foolish risks these people did in the name of . . . um. . . I don't know. Professional guides take $25,000 to lead people to the summit of Everest where the oxygen is low, the winds high and common sense absent. What a waste of human life there is in this book. If you want to read adventure that examines the human condition try Joseph Conrad or Jack London. I recommend you spare yourself this indulgent, overgrown magazine article about supposedly intelligent people who climb to 28,000 feet and find out why there is no sign of life way up there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like \\"Into the Wild,\\" \\"Into Thin Air\\" was way too long.","review":"As I was reading each, I couldn't help but think I was reading an elongated version of his \\"Outside\\" magazine articles, painfully stretched out into a book version. Both books he claims he \\"had to write\\" -- \\"Into the Wild\\" for the family's sake, and \\"Into Thin Air\\" to get it off his chest. I think maybe he had to write them for the money -- and/or fame. Both books would make fairly good reading if 50% shorter (like forget the first half). It made me angry that I had to waste my time reading the fluff before I could get to what the book, its reviews and its cover promised it would tell me. Shame on Jon Krakauer! Next time I'll happily settle for the \\"Outside\\" articles!"},{"rating":"1","title":"readers of outside magazine alert!!","review":"If you have read Krakauer's account of the disaster in OutsideMagazine, then you have no need to read this book.

Enough is Enough. Buy the magazine-it's cheaper."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'd like to empty a whole box of stars on this book!","review":"ANYTHING Krakauer writes is at least a five-star project, but this book is his best. Hearing him re-tell the story (as opposed to just reading it to the audience) is an added bonus. What happened on Everest is fascinating anyway, but Krakauer's account -- in such detail -- actually puts the listener up there with him. I've never been a fanatic about outdoor sports, but I listened to this audiobook three times -- and enjoyed it just as much each successive time."},{"rating":"2","title":"The story was chilling","review":"Just finished the book. Could not put it down. Couldn't wait to read the next step in climbing up the mountain. Once at the summit, the book is just starting to build to its climax.

All of the reviews written here, besides the one from the reader from New Hampshire, all glorify the deaths of these climbers. None of you seem to realize that this really did happen and lives were lost. This was not a movie where anything can happen and the actor walks away at the end. Krakauer should be ashamed of himself, writing a glorified and \\"Hollywood\\" account of one of the worst expedition experiences in recent memory. The only reason for two stars is because Krakauer survived and maybe one person will get the true picture of the story.

As a non-climber, it gave me a fascinating insight to the psyche of those who knowingly take huge risks in the pursuit of something seemingly intangible. It really brought home to me the human cost that these expeditions can sometimes incur, and at times reads as though the author is trying to rid himself of the demons of having been there and survived.Note: I also posted this review on Goodreads."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Krakauer Disaster","review":"I have to admit that I was rather frustrated with this book. Krakauer actually shows how thin hir report of the 1996 Everest desaster is. Nothing against his points of view but this book contaisn too much the word \\"I\\". I did this, I did that... Not to mention that Anatoli Boukreev's heroism is totally overlooked. Nonetheless this is a book worth reading. However, if you are interested in the persue of what really happened above 29,000 feet on the Everest summit, please don't stop at this book. Read also \\"The Climb: Tragic Ambitions on Everest\\" by Anatoli Boukreev and G. Weston Dewalt. I would personaly start with the Boukreev account."},{"rating":"1","title":"slow start","review":"The book was in okay shape; it's not as if I need a book in perfect condition to read. Really good turn around time at purchase.The book itself is decent if your into alot of geographical names and alot of informative facts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Book Based On ONE Man's Account Of '96 Tragedy","review":"This is the very best account of the May 10, 1996 epic story of survival on Mt. Everest. Jon Krakauer is an outstanding writer who can paint a picture with words that is unparalleled among the \\"climbing epics\\".It should be noted that Mr. Krakauer tries to provide a true accounting of the events of May '96; however, he speculates on other \\"key players\\" thoughts and reasoning, and the odds are his speculation isn't 100% accurate (but who can be 100% accurate when relating events from extreme altitudes).I also highly recommend Mr. Krakauer's book \\"Eiger Dreams\\". It is a compilation of shorter stories that don't 'leave you hanging' like many climbing compilations."},{"rating":"1","title":"I think the author is too self-serving and biased","review":"I was looking forward to reading Into Thin Air, I love mountaineering and Mt. Everest, and the life & death struggles that come with it, and nothing like sad tragedy to make me feel...alive and thankful.I read this book in 2 days, but went from enthralled with the mountain drama to disappointed with Mr. Krakauer's growingly evident biases.I wish he could have been more objective, and less self-serving.Once I sensed his own selfishness coming through the accounts of this journey, the book and his writing turned me off, completely."},{"rating":"1","title":"......I would have put it down after page 5.","review":"I give \\"Into Thin Air\\" two stars because it was a decent story, but seemed to drag on and on. If I would not have been required to read it for English class, I would have put it down after page 5. The first 200 or so pages are all about what happened up to the summit, from the plane ride across the ocean to what equipment they have at base camp. The last 178 pages cover who dies, how they die, what the bodies look like when they're found, and who was probably going to die next. The whole book was depressing. I knew from the beginning that I was forever discouraged from climbing Everest. It makes me wonder about the sanity of those who do try it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lot of mistakes ignoring apparent tragedy","review":"A very gripping book. So many things would be different if only all involved had payed more attention to what Everest was telling them along with a little attention to that \\" little voice \\" that we all have ignored more than once. I remember when this happened so many year's ago, it still grips heart today, if not more, after reading this terrifying yet terrific book."},{"rating":"2","title":"There but by the grace of God...","review":"I'm fascinated by this subject and story.Although I hate the cold, I can't help feeling that, given a differentstation in life, I might write a check and take my chances. While reading the book on a plane, the pilot came on the PA and reported that we had reached cruising altitude over Missouri and were now flying at 28,000 feet. It was partly cloudy and, after looking out the window at the farmland 5 miles below, I decided that I wouldn't care to step outside and take a walk. I am looking forward to the IMAX film. I will go to see it, and I will cry like a baby. ABC's Turning Point on the 1 year anniversary affected me in a similar way. I have a lot of Walter Mitty in me, and thanks to writers like JK, I can scare myself at home... and dream. Thanks Jon, C.

You learn about the personal sacrificies people made just to attempt the climb, and then how something good can turn very bad.

And it should be read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Book","review":"Reading this great novel, made me feel like I was there with the whole expedition trip.

Knowing what would make a person climb the largest mountain in the world is more exciting. Excellent Book !!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WHAT A BOOK!!!","review":"I really did enjoy this book. I did not give it a fifth star, because it was a bit slow starting. But it was very informational. Mr Krakauer did an amazing job of setting us up for the end of the novel. He described each character so well. At the half way point of the book, I simply could not put it down. I wanted to know what was going to happen to each character. I would like to thank Jon Krakauer for sharing his heroic and frightening story. And may Rob Hall, Scott Fischer, Yasuko Namba, Andy Harris, and Doug Hansen rest in peace."},{"rating":"2","title":"A gripping tale","review":"If you have any interest in Mount Everest, climbing or real life tales of tragedy then this book is a must read.

One of the first mountain climbing books I read as a child was about Mallory and Irvine on Everest. I also read about a Matterhorn disaster (\\"White Spider\\"?) The tragedy of what took place in May 1996 will be with me for a long, long time thanks to Jon Krakauer's powerful writing. Nevertheless, I hope to see the Imax film of Everest to see the mountain close up from the safety of the theater. Hats off to the Imax crew and all the others who helped in the rescue or who suffered and endured on the mountain. And hats off to Jon Krakauer for writing so convincingly of the climb and the emotions left in the wake of the tragedy. I hope amateur climbers will be more realistic about their goals in the future. Everest proved even the professionals don't know if they will come down from the peak."},{"rating":"2","title":"An honest account of a disaster.","review":"This book moved me greatly as the impact of what happened on that mountian 2 years ago sank in. What impressed me so much about this book is the honesty with which it was written. Krakauer made it clear from the beginning that he was presenting his view of the events as he can recall them. I was very disappointed to see so that so many people have taken this book as an attack on others. If anything I got the impression he blames himself more than anyone. I found it to be fair and as objective as a tragedy such as this can be reported. To those who have accused Krakauer of negligence, please put yourselves honestly in his shoes. I know that I would have done far worse after 57 hours without sleep, adequate oxygen, and high altitude illness. This on top of climbing over 3000 vertical feet and back, being in the middle of a blizzard with -100 degree windchill factor on a mountian where one misstep can result in a very painful death."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lucid remembrance of a nightmare","review":"People do stupid things, and INTO THIN AIR recounts a fairly deadly instance of this on one of mother nature's obsticle courses.

He takes you from hopelessness in one chapter to triumph in the next chapter. I couldn't put the book down. Its an amazing piece of work. Great Job Jon!!! I reccomend it highly"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely riveting. How could so much go so wrong?","review":"I commend John Krakauer for undertaking the enormity of this book. Not only the writer's aspect of it, but because he must have had to goldmine for the courage to tell the truth and face it all again in the retelling. What a detailed and often horrifying account of a miserable, frozen, and unwelcome place."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lifetime lesson","review":"This great book, beautifully written by Krakauer, deals with the deadly experience of a group of climbers (leaded by experienced mountaineers) on their journey to Mt. Everest.Values as humility, respect, perseverence (and also flaws as greed and selfishness) are neatly described.If interested in drive a team towards an objective, it teaches on how to achieve it by showing what hasn't to be done: Krakauer's mates, they learn it the hard way.A book you won't stop reading until finished."},{"rating":"2","title":"Riveting","review":"This book is the best written novel I have ever read, and at twelve I have read a lot. The details are so amazing. He takes the accounts of what happened on the mountain and added a personal history to every single thing that added another world to the novel. A type of world that lets you get up close and personal with the real life people this novel is based on. Krakauer vividly describes the beauty of the mountain and the terrifying nature of it at the same time. His details allow the reader to experience things only a few hundred people in the entire world have experienced. When you are reading, you can feel the cold of the below zero temperatures running through your bones. You feel sad when a person gets left behind but you also feel sorry for the person leaving him behind. He portrays the characters in an incredible way that catches every emotion. The story of what happened is astonishing by itself, but when Krakauer adds his journalistic touch it becomes even better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read - sparked my interest in Krakauer and Everest","review":"This is a great read. This was the first book that got me hooked on Jon Krakauer's writing, and I have not looked back since. Very gripping, hard to put down, and well worth the time. Read it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Adventure!","review":"I personally love to read biographies and real life adventure stories. Jon K's book is an extremely vivid story about his excursion on Mount Everest. Turning each page is exciting and keeps you 'on the edge' of your seat.

Highly recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forcing myelf through","review":"I'm on page 143 of this book and am pondering throwing it out. I've had many friends tell me this was one of the best books they had read. But, so far it is quite boring. I'll probably end up skipping every few pages until the drama hits. Then I won't feel so bad about wasting the money I spent to buy the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"this book is really good /Boukourev's THE CLIMB is better!!","review":"this is a must read story. and Krakauer is an exciting story teller.In particular, is his focus and critical commentary on the actions of Anatoli Boukourev. This topic surely must have been nearly over-discussed around the world by now; but this created one of the most exciting reading opportunities i have ever enjoyed:..because you can also read Boukourev's side of the story in The Climb - we get 2 expert views of the same exciting story; from 2 expert climbers' viewpoints - except that Boukourev's carries more weight because he was probably like the Kelly Slater of climbing(i.e. better than anyone else forever).Boukourev is vindicated. He is T H E man! He saved lives / Krakauer collapsed - i'd be dead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Writer / Unfair and Unbalanced Account","review":"Krakauer is a superb writer, as evidenced by this compelling read. The book does not appear to present a balanced or fair account of what went on during Krakauer's time on the mountain, however."},{"rating":"2","title":"FANTASTIC, (& TRUE) of an Everest 1996 tragedy for 2 teams.","review":"It sets a fantastic standard by which other \\"based-on-rea-lifel\\" events (especially because of the tragedies involved) should follow. It provides enough motivation to spark interest in the topic (for books & movies). (The only current downside is that NOTHING else has met the same standard yet!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Into Thin Air","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It was very interesting to learn all the difficulties faced by those who climb these extreme mountains. I never realized how many other dangers were involved other than falling yet those who face the challenge are obsessivley pushed to put their lives on the line for that moment of glory at the top of the world. Sadly May 1996 took it's toll on so many, both the seasoned climbers and the less experienced. It definately makes one respect the power of nature."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Captivating Story--5 Miles High","review":"Want to climb a really tall mountain? This book vividly describes high altitude mountaineering and offers a safe way to mentally experience the horrors that can happen when things go terribly wrong in thin air. The writer, a survivor of the single worst Everest climbing tragedy in terms of lives lost, chronicles events that took place in May 1996. Other survivors and observers may see things differently, but this saga will certainly keep your interest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Home Sweet Home","review":"Krakauer makes one dread the thought of climbing Mount Everest. A very interesting book that can be followed up with internet research to confirm or discredit the author. Krakauer's arrogance makes the book that much more interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book I have ever read.","review":"Into Thin Air, by Jon Krakauer is a remarkable look at the hardships of mountain climbers, specifically those who climbed Mount Everest in May, 1996. This book's concentration on emotion rather than action sets it apart from most other books of this kind. Jon Krakauer explains to the reader the foolishness involved in deciding to climg Everest, yet the reader realizes it is just one of those things that has to be done. After reading this book I find myself more aware of the carnage and sacrifice that is Everest, yet I now have this strange longing, despite what I know, to go and to climb. Into Thin Air is an incredible book that MUST BE READ!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally absorbing -- riveting!","review":"Few books have ever captivated me the way \\"Into Thin Air\\" did. There's not much I can add to the praise of other reviewers except to say that reading it while flying to the Rockies (to ski, not climb) made it even more incredible. No doubt the runaway success of this book is largely to blame for the fact that my wife and I drove two hours to see the IMAX movie \\"Everest\\" at the Smithsonian Air & Space Museum, only to be told that it had sold out FOUR HOURS IN ADVANCE. And this from a movie that's been out as long as the book has. We chipped in and bought the video with our friends for the same collective price we would've paid to get into the IMAX version.Bottom line -- read the book! (Unless you're a mountain-climbing fanatic like a friend of mine, who got partway into the book and threw it down in disgust at the irresponsible decisions that were made by many of the doomed climbers of \\"Into Thin Air.\\")"},{"rating":"2","title":"I felt as if I were there","review":"I felt a part of Jon Krakauer's climb - I could feel the excruciating cold along with all the emotions he experienced on this climb - the exhileration that turned into fear and survival and the painful, emotional frustration that no one but the mountain was in control. Mr. Krakauer's book gave incredible insight into the climbing\\"industry\\" and the driving force behind the climbers themselves. The book was excitingly informative and definitely left me with the feeling that I wanted to learn more about the hold Mt Everest has on its climbers - and also wanting to read MORE of Mr. Krakauer's books!."},{"rating":"2","title":"Riveting","review":"Even non-outdoorsmen (that would be me) will enjoy this true story of triumph over the mountain.

He truly brought a feeling of being there to the reader. It was great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb Book - Jon is an excellent mountain writer","review":"All three of Jon's books are very good, but this is at the top of the list. I am currently finishing \\"Eiger Dreams\\". I'm really interested in visiting some of the far away places he describes. Another good book on the life of a more down to earth mountaineer is TJ Burr's \\"Rocky Mountain Adventure Collection.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Hey man, It's not my fault!","review":"This should be the title of Krakauers book where everything and everyone except John himself is faulted for what happened. He has to live with his selfishness the rest of his life for turning his back on the others. I got the impression that this is a guy who is a loner, self absorbed, and probably never been a close friend to anyone. His line about never being to a funeral before in his life prior to Everest spoke volumes. When the going gets tough, John gets going. Thank god for John that the S Africans where there to be the greater villians. A decent read though even if you don't like the author. Happy Memorial Day folks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best of the Climbing Genre","review":"Krakauer was writing an apologia but his story captures the imagination - and I believed his protestations that he was being honest, accurate, in his depiction. If you enjoy the subject - mountain climbing, Everest in particular - or if you are interested in the most deadly year on the mountain, 1996, you must read this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thrilling","review":"Into Thin Air recounts the trials and tribulations of the many expeditions assaulting the summit of Mount Everest in the Spring of 1996, but focuses on the team led by Rob Hall. Krakauer brings a very knowledgeable background to the book as he was an avid climber even before the Everest disaster. Instead of using solely secondhand accounts to tell of the debacle, Krakauer was actually on the mountain making the summit push himself. Krakauer is able to tell of all the difficulties one can run into on the way to the summit among them, frostbite, exhaustion, wind and the thin air. Along with his own recollection of the events, Krakauer borrowed from his comrades on the mountain and even included stories told by relatives. It is a story of success, failure and heartache. In the end, even if you aren't a climber, it is well worth the read. If you like Krakauer, I would also try \\"Into the Wild.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"The depth of this tragic tale exceeds the height of Everest.","review":"Totally engrossing story about the fragility of life in the Himalaya. At times, the true life account seems unreal, leaving one emotionally strained and questioning the sanity of life on the edge of chaos. I'm not even sure how I feel about the author and his role in this story. I'll be thinkning about this book for a long time to come. Also, this was my first mountaineering book and it will not be the last. I loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"it surprised me","review":"I expected an account of what happened on the mountain, but didn't expect to feel the cold. The author's description of what it's like to struggle up the side of a mountain, what the cold feels like, what it looks like, and what a lack of sleep and oxygen do to you - all make for interesting reading. That would have been enough. But wrap these details around the human tragedy experienced, and you've got one great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a very good, but not great, book.","review":"Into Thin Air by Jon Krakauer was a very exciting and enjoyable read. I was able to feel the tension and the pain that he was trying to convey. It was also very educational, as I don't really know that much about mountin climbing. I am now more interested, and I plan to read other climbing and Everest books. The book's major flaw, that which prevents it from being a 5 star book, is the way that Krakauer lightly discusses drug use by some of the people discribed in the book. That whole topic was handled irresponsibly. Putting that aside, this is a fine book."},{"rating":"2","title":"WONDERFUL!!!!!!!!!","review":"I love mountain climbing so this book intrigued me. I would recommend it to anyone who has ever dreamed of conquering the elements."},{"rating":"2","title":"On Cloud Nine","review":"Reading \`Into Thin Air' was like being on a flight from say... Akron, Ohio to New York, flying at a cruising altitude of say 29,028 ft., to look out the window and see someone standing out on a cloud, smiling and waving looking eye-level back at me. --- Picture my expression as I read.I can't explain it, but Mt. Everest has always been a subject of awe and fascination for me. And anyone who has a deep passion for climbing, or who craves an amazing adventure, or seeks a better understanding the gripping allure these mountains hold, and why climbers are drawn to them will appreciate this account too. The only misgivings reading \`Into Thin Air' was that in effort to show this great mountain in all of its grandeur & magnificence, its death-gripping power had to be explored.Without doubt, a tremendous read."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of its kind","review":"This is one of my favorite books of all times. I think have read this book three times and all the other books that came after it and never managed to match Into Thin Air."},{"rating":"2","title":"An chilling account of disaster expirenced first-hand","review":"It took me a long time to actually purchase this book and read it. I, like many people, was captivated by the story of the climbers stranded on Everest. I kept up with news as it was unfolding via traditional media and I was left to wonder what was happening to the poor souls trapped on that mountain.After reading Jon Krakauer's article and subsequent blasts by other surviving climbers I decided to stay away from the book but something drew me back to it. I was impressed with Jon Krakauer in that he attempted to right some wrongs brough out in his article. It's always hard to admit you we not right, espically when you caused a family unnecessary heartache.Into Thin Air takes you right into the heart of the Everest tragedy and makes you thank God you were not a part of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A well-written, vivid look at a very serious topic.","review":"Into Thin Air takes an up-front look at the perils one faces by climbing Everest. Author Jon Krakauer, a frequent contributor to renowned magazines such as Outside, Rolling Stone and yes, Playboy, was only taking the journey up the mountain for an article, but it turned out to be one of the saddest, and unforgettable times of his life. Just as he got to know his companions, the storm took nearly all of them.This book is so well written -- I can't believe Krakauer has such vivid memories of it all. You don't need to be a wilderness buff to enjoy this book, I would recommend it to just about anybody who enjoys good literature. Into Thin Air also taught me a very important lesson -- I'm never going to climb Mount Everest."},{"rating":"2","title":"breath taking.. up lifting... really down to earth !!","review":"unbelievable adventure...very sad and yet inspires a lot of respect for the mountain(s).."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh my god!

The horible outcome of the expedition aside, Krakauer does a spectacular job of describing the ascent to the top and, if the story had ended there, would have been a very interesting account of high altitude climbing. Though, the description of the resulting tragedy was a little less clear than I would have liked, the story was gripping and unforgetable. True, there were a lot of names thrown around, but the \\"Who's Who\\" at the beginning made this much more managable. This is great reading and nearly impossible to put down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book - hard to follow with Books on Tape","review":"This was a good book (kept me awake on night drive from MSP - STL!) but there were ALOT of characters and perhaps having the book in regular format would have been easier. I found that there were times when I was confused on which team a character was with when he would discuss the fate of a climber."},{"rating":"2","title":"riveting","review":"I read Into Thin Air in one sitting. I could not put it down. In the end I was very disturbed by the actions of the author and some of the others on the mountain. I've thought about it for days wondering what I would have done, I would hope I would have acted differently. I think I would rather have died myself,as Hall did, then not do all I could do to save the others. It seems Jon thought little about is comrades on the mountain on that day. The author seemed to be a strong climber and the most capable to rescue the others. He didn't. If he were in battle he might have been court marshalled for cowardness. I do however give him an A for candor and I now wonder if my lack of experience in such overwhelming situations has made my judgements too harsh. And I continue to wonder. A must read"},{"rating":"2","title":"Immersive experience","review":"I liked this book quite a bit. When I was reading it, I felt I was watching the whole experience as one of the climbers. The whole story kept moving and kept me reading. I really couldn't put it down. I finished it after two days of intense reading. I did find some things I didn't like too much, such as a couple of places where things were repeated (which I know is for clarity sake, but still, I didn't like it), too much dwelling on personal background (some of which were quite interesting, but others were bothersome). All in all, it seemed to have been well researched and is pretty educational. I would absolutely recommend this book to anybody."},{"rating":"2","title":"I wish it were a thousand pages longer.","review":"I am not a climber, and I share several reviewer's opinions that an Everest attempt is self-indulgent risk for no good cause. That said, Krakauer's account of the climb was the last really riveting book I've read. I felt I was on that mountain. I kept wondering why they did what they did, but I could not put the book down and would have read for hundreds more pages if he'd written them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Motivating -> Speechless -> Sadness in short Must Read!","review":"This accounting of the terrible ordeal was well written and spoken in the audio book.

Everest books","review":"Upon hearing the news about the deaths that night on Everest, I thought this is to be expected unfortunatly when trying to conquer Everest. Doing the impossible encourages hardships such as this. To read about it in such great detail, to relive the entire expedition step by step was truly one of the most riveting experiences of my life. I found new respect for these people for what they must endure to reach the summitt is truly unbelievable. This book is fantastic, every step of the way. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A well written, slick portrait of some of the facts...","review":"I have read this book, dozens others about Everest and the account by the guide Anatoli entitled The Climb. It seems to me, that the facts that John Krakauer chose to include and the ones that he chose to leave out misinformed the public about the horrible tradgedy on Everest. Anatoli's discription of events, albiet less well written, not slick, picturesque writing, was much more convincing of the facts. I feel heart sorry for any of the survivors of the victims that Everest claimed on that fateful journey. Even more sorry now that John Krackauer has belittled the vicitms themselves in his story version of the event. It is sad when Disney choses to dramatize historic events, it is far sadder when a good writer like John Krackauer does it. If you like this book, and I am sure that you will, please do yourself a favor and read the real story by Anatoli entitled The Climb. It is the real deal"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good book... on a terrible and very fascinating subjet","review":"I am a french reader, and I have read the french version of this book.

Hikers: this book is definately for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent--Poses Many Questions","review":"This book poses many questions as to why the disaster on Mt. Everest even happened. Why did experienced guides ignore their own turn-around time? Why were inexperienced climbers allowed to attempt this physically demanding task? Krakauer has written a riveting account of the disaster--a real page-turner. I enjoyed it more than \\"Climb\\" however both books offer different views of the disaster and both are worth reading. Krakauer alternately sets himself up as both hero and villian, but it's obvious his soul is torn and he will never forget the events of May 10, 1996. Excellent in every way."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a guilt trip!","review":"The only thing this book has to give is a guilt trip to the other members of the team as Jon never takes the blame. Because he is one of the only survivers his word is taken as the truth. Read this book with an open mind-- open to the fact that Jon could be making most of his sorry little story up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Obviously...","review":"Hall was not going to leave Doug behind knowing his business depended on getting people up and down that mountain. When he found out the fate of the others in his group that probably died... well, that cinched the deal. A good captain chooses to go down with his ship. Who can live with the knowledge that your poor decisions led to many people's deaths. All in all I couldn't put it down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tragedy of May 11.","review":"The book \\"Into Thin Air\\" was a story of a man and a dream. This man was an experienced climber and this dream was to reach the summit of one of the tallest mountains on the earth. This book entails all the events leading up the the tragedy of May 11 and of the people involved. I personally did not like the book as much as I though I would because there is a lot of detail and history throughout the entire book. I was not very interested in the story by the time I reached the middle of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT WORTH THE TIME","review":"I know this is a popular book, but perhaps our standas have dropped. I stopped reading the quotes at the beginning of each chapter after the first half. They were filler. A long, tedious book that would have been better left as a magazine article."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jon Krakauer: An Epic Coward","review":"You don't have to read \\"The Climb\\" to see that Jon Krakauer is an epic coward. You can read it between the lines right here in his book.The truths he distorts and the truths he completely leaves out--it comes through in this book.No wonder he can't sleep at night.\\"The Climb\\" is much better. The story of Anatoly Boukreev--it's much better written, and Boukreev was awarded the American Alpine Club's highest honor, the David A. Sowles Memorial Award for his heroic actions on the Everest in 1996. Krakauer distinguished himself for his cowardice.This book left me feeling sickened, sickened not as much by the deaths of the climbers at Everest, but by the thought that some of it would have been different if Krakauer had lifted a finger. Boukreev's book is much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Real Snoozer","review":"This book was a waste of several hours of my life. Jon Krakauer rambles on and on about things that don\`t make the story progress. Krakauer\`s uselss imformation is the bulk of this book. Spare yourself from several nights of misery by not reading this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick with the facts, Jon","review":"I fully enjoyed reading this book - until I later read other related books, magazine articles, book reviews, articles on the web, etc. How disappointed I was to realize that one of my favorite climbing authors was willing to bend the truth in order to make his story more thrilling to read. It's a pity, but I guess Jon decided it was more important to sell a ton of books than it was to treat others with the respect they deserved or to just stick to the facts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fiction told to be fact.","review":"It's not a bad book if you don't mind being lied to.

This sellers description was USED-VERY GOOD. This book arrived with the packaging ripped, the inside full of pencil/pen markings, as well as highlighter markings throughout the book (which weren't mentioned in the ad). I buy books from amazon all the time and this was not what I, or a majority of the sellers on amazon, call a USED-VERY GOOD book."},{"rating":"2","title":"incredible story","review":"this was a incredible read of survival, tragedy and sadness. i couldnt put it down. why anyone would attempt to climb that mountain is beyond me. i will stick to my trail climbs thank you very much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read 'The Climb' by Weston DeWalt Instead","review":"Reading 'The Climb', you will come to understand that Krakauer is another overpaid Westerner, full of hubris.

Alone, Anatoli Boukreev attempted a rescue."},{"rating":"1","title":"How a 7th grader sees a vacation","review":"As you read this book you feel like a kid on vacation in a station wagon. You keep saying are we there yet. This whole book should have been made into a 6 page pamplet. The best parts are in the final 3 chapters. But like the trip in the station wagon, you're so tired of the trip you've forgot why you're there."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a WASTE","review":"Well...beggining started off slowly...the end was ok but it wasn't really my kind of book I don't recomend it unless your an insomniac and need something to bore you to sleep."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gasping for air","review":"I purchased this audiobook for listening while running. The author, Jon Krakauer, is a natural reader and his voice was very soothing.Into Thin Air is a timeless tale about ego, death, and trauma. From a psychological standpoint, Krakauer truly captures the essence of death and destruction. Likewise, he's quick to point out his own faults and guilt along the way. By the end of it, I had nothing but respect for who he is and the journey he took. It's clear that the tragedy left a permanent mark on his life and climbing career.Thank you for your story, Jon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grasping Story","review":"I read Into Thin Air in school. After hearing from many other students, I wasn't really looking forward to reading this book. After getting into the story, I changed my mind.The story starts off somewhat slow, as they are not on the mountain yet, but picks up after the 7th chapter. It is one of those books that you want to read straight through. It always leaves you on the edge, wanting to read more. This book is about the true but sad story of climbers from everest expeditions. They summited at a bad time and got caught in a horrible storm, leaving many climbers behind. I don't know if this book is completely accurate, as it has been challenged many times but no one knows what happened that year for sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"totally cool","review":"trek up everest. great job describing scenery and weather. Book of the year at College of the Redwoods in Eureka. Many people dies on climb. Many people should not have been there in the firtst place. Very intense riveting book a real page turner. If you like hiking get this book. you may not want to climb everest though but its a great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!","review":"I could not put this book down. From sheer terror to sadness this book brings it all out. Brillantly written and told first hand by Jon K. who was there and saw this tragedy with his own eyes. A must read for everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tough to put down","review":"Very compelling book- well written, exciting. Covers technical details in a way which makes them exciting and understandable to non-climbers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Characters hard to follow and writing on first grade level","review":"This book was not bad, but it was not what I would call a classic either. The story was interesting, but everything was glossed over so quickly that by the end of the book where the author is talking about characters doing this and that, I did not know who most of them were or were they came from. The writing level of the book is amateurish at best. For those who like simple reading and a quick story this may be a good book for you. For me it was a bit of a let down and I thought the author of the book was a big part of the problem on Everest and ends up profiting from it."},{"rating":"1","title":"$6.39...Into Thin Air!","review":"For all the hype, I couldn't for the life of me figure out why this book is so highly rated. This book is a prime example of what happens when you take a magazine \\"journalist\\" and give him a contract to write a book. This thing has so many footnotes (some of which are half the page!) that the experience becomes incredibly distracting. If he felt compelled to do half-page footnotes, why not just do a #@!& side-bar, like in a MAGAZINE!See the Imax movie called Everest...and save yourself from burning a $6 hole in your pocket."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting Read","review":"I found \\"Into Thin Air\\" to be a completely enjoyable and enlightening book. Mountain climbing is not a topic that ever interested me, so if a friend had not recommended this book to me, I never would have read it.Like so many others, I found myself completely into this book once I started reading. The characters, the circumstances, and the predicaments all become very real. The author tells a story of actual people facing life and death situations, and the decisions they make are the difference between living and dying."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a fine narrative of the Mt. Everest disaster.","review":"It was very hard to put this book down. This book focuses on the mountaineering industry that guides high-income clients to the top of Mt. Everest. INTO THIN AIR provides an outstanding narrative for the sport of mountain climbing. Mr. Krakauer gives a first hand view of the \\"ins and outs\\" for climbing Mt. Everest. I was, however, disappointed that the author provided very little detail of the summit. After I finished the book, I had to go back to see if I accidently missed the account of the top....There is no description whatsoever....Maybe, this is intentional? Maybe, this is reserved for those who have conquered this peak?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book I have ever read!","review":"Into Thin Air is the most thrilling, impossible to put down book that I have ever read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"what a great book","review":"Read the book in 2-days because I couldn't stop. You know the outcome within the first five pages, yet you can't help wonder how it all happened. Simply one of the best works of non-fiction I have ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"If you enjoy hiking or mountain climbing you definitely have to get this book. I first saw \\"Everest\\" at the IMAX theater. From there I was lead to Krakauer's book which I found very difficult to put down. There isn't a dull moment. You will become very intimate with what went on that fateful day when 8 climbers lost their lives on the highest mountain in the world. The events leading up to the disaster almost sounded like it was made for a novel. Plenty of negative foreshadowing occurs before the disaster, including a Puja that normally gets performed before each and every ascent. This Buddhist ceremony is considered very important and some Sherpas will not ascend unless one is performed. It just so happened that the Rinpoche was sick so it couldn't be performed. You will also get a glimpse of the heroics of America's foremost high-altitude climber, Ed Viesturs and the IMAX \\"Dream Team\\" as they helped to rescue Beck Weathers and Makalu Gau from almost certain death."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yowza!","review":"I couldn't put this book down. I've often wondered why people put themselves through these extreme experiences and I was fascinated by Krakauer's description of his own reason while unfolding the story of this \\"doomed\\" expedition. Really scary stuff, for me anyway. I can't imagine doing it so I'm glad someone has written about it. I'm happy to have the opportunity to sit on the summit of Mt. Everest in my own armchair, next to the fire."},{"rating":"2","title":"Into another adventure","review":"As a 9 to 5 office person I've found \\"Into Thin Air\\" extremely adventurous and inspiring. A reminder that the world is much more than our developed cities and office cubicles.

As you read it, it almost seems as if you're on the mountain along with the characters. This book is very vivid and compelling, and I recommend it to anyone wanting to read a good action book."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was an satisfactory read","review":"I didn't really enjoy INTO THIN AIR. It was very slow-moving and it didn't strike me as being exciting in almost any way. Krakauer dragged out what should have been small supporting details into whole chapters; things like describing EVERYBODY'S life who was on the mountain at that time, and even some who weren't on the mountain. However, there were a few exciting scenes - like when the Chinese lady was freezing to death and when Beck was very close to dying. Only read this book if you a mature adult who has the time and patience to listen to a long exposition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another hiking book I enjoyed","review":"Tragic story told from one of the climbers. It is an amazing story of several of the climbers that year, what went wrong, what could have been better, and just how crazy dangerous Everest is to those fanatics that want to climb it. I mean you cant even see off of the summit to even know you are there!"},{"rating":"2","title":"As I had heard this book was a interesting","review":"Into thin air gives some insight into a world most people would never try or think about. The book is a fast read and helps you realize you are not as crazy or driven as other people on the planet. It was fascinating to look into another dimension of life"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a Beck Weathers fan","review":"I read INTO THIN AIR and learned alot, both about geography and about a sport I've never explored before. The biggest flaw to me in this book was the character development. As he introduced the people they began to blend together and didn't distinguish themselves until chapter's later...some of them didn't develop at all. As a journalist I was intrigued that Beck Weathers graduated from a high school just 10 miles from my TV station and graduated from the university in our town. I contacted him about doing a story that most are unfamiliar with in the area and he declined with a sense of arrogance. Krakauer also saw that arrogance and mentioned it in his book.Other than some confusion with character development the book played out as a thrilling drama. I would definately give Krakauer another shot at entertaining me."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWSOME","review":"Great book!! Never a dull minute, Wasnt hard to keep up with the minimal bouncing around. Seemed to be pretty factual, have heard different sizes of Mt Everest, but hey after 29,000 feet does it really matter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mans Will To Survive","review":"I was astounded by the breadth of the subject and details described in this book, and find it mind-blowing how Beck Weather managed to weather the storm, when a man like Rob Hall inevitably sucuumbed to it.

If you are into the outdoors, and you like exploring nature then this book is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"I felt like I was there, on the peak, looking out with Jon","review":"I was so into this book and this story. The developement and buildup of the events are so well written, that I found myself yearning to be on the peak with Jon and the others...I wanted so bad to be there and help Rob Hall and Fischer...I felt the pain of the wife having to beg her husband to come down, for her and their child.This book motivated me and moved me. I would recommend it to anyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Difficult to Put Down","review":"Although familiar with the 1996 expedition to Everest, and having had this edition for some time, this is the first time I sat down with Karkauer's book. Prompted by the Discovery Channel series on climbing Everest I decided it was time to read the book.Five hours later I finished - a marathon session of reading and wonder. The story is well-crafted and to the point, reading like excellent fiction, with the under-current knowledge that it is fact, the book pulls you along.A fascinating story about a terribly tragic event - made more so by the possible clash of egos over tackling the mountain and not paying careful attention to time and clients.Highly recommeded."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Breathtaking Adventure","review":"When I started reading the first couple chapters, I could not put this book down. Into Thin Air is definitely a page-turner. It is a great story starring Jon Krakauer as one of the great climbers of a Mount-Everest expedition in 1996. He is also the author of this exciting book. Through this climb there is lots going on such as frostbite, shortage of oxygen, much suffering and a blizzard that kills many people. This book made me feel like I was on the climb with Jon Krakauer. This is also one of those books when you will always want to know what is coming next. Be careful when you're planning on reading this book. I guarantee you will not want to set the book down until it is finished."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book proofs that we are not as Invincible as we think","review":"Mr. Krakauer's account of the tragedy he lived, shows us, normal humans, that we have limits, and that we aren't \\"Kings of the World\\".

It is a breathaking book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Krakauer's Writing Summits","review":"Jon Krakauer captivates his audience with his vivid description of the tragedy of '96 from the face of Mt. Everest. Mr. Krakauer's detail of the events, as well as a history lesson on climbings of Everest, interest anyone from a book worm to a seasoned climber. As far as keeping one's attention and interest, this book is one of the best I have read. A rookie climber, I was given a greater understanding of the risks and demands of world class climbers. This book is very hard to put down and it adds to the impressive writing skills of Jon Krakauer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Riveting","review":"Like other readers, I have been unable to stop thinking about those involved in the 96 disaster and wondering what I would have done in that situation.

A must read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A tragic, and personal account of a life experience","review":"I absolutely loved this book, and though that the author did an incredible job describing the the emotions, and views of all. I loved the way that he included not only his personal opinions, but those of the whole groups. Yes, it was tragady that something like this happened, and yet, we came to understand the world because of this. A must read for anyone that enjoys adventure. I cried outloud!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Into Thin Air: All Time GREAT!","review":"Into Thin Air : A Personal Account of the Mount Everest Disaster, is an outstanding book. Jon Krakauer does a terrific job of bringing the tradgedies on Mt. Everest on May 10, 1996 to life. I read all of the other books about this tradegy, but Into Thin Air : A Personal Account of the Mount Everest Disaster stands out in my mind. It tells a story from Jon Krakauer's perspective who is the only person who published a book on the team with the 5 climbers deaths. Mr. Krakauer allowed the public to read about something that only a matter of people would have known the whole story about if this book would not have been published. Into Thin Air : A Personal Account of the Mount Everest Disaster is a must read for any veracious mountain climber, anyone who is the least bit interested in climbing Mt. Everest and to anyone whop would just like a nice fairly quick pleasent read. Thank you for your time and I hope that i have been helpful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Into Thin Air vs The Climb","review":"I've read all the accounts of the 1996 season, not just these two.I've also climbed three mountains including Mt. Kilimanjaro to 19,340 feet.At no time in any of my mountain experiences were my guides ever out of my sight if not roped directly to me.Fisher's attitude was, \\"we have Big E wired\\" and it fueled Boukreev's oxygenless scamper to the summit and back. But Boukreev's \\"freshness\\" at the South Col couldn't save Fisher or the others. He later saved several lives but it didn't help Fisher.I'm with Jon and others, guides should be with their clients and breathing O2."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning","review":"This book should leave any reader stunned and saddened. Great writing, although I think calling it an adventure story may be a little bit of a misnomer. It is truly a tragedy. Krakauer understands the audience he is writing for, but also tries to be sensitive to those who lost their lives on Everest and those who have been left behind in the aftermath of the disastrous May 10th expedition to the summit. Compelling and a page turner."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Account of a Real-Life Adventure Tragedy","review":"To give you an idea how much I loved Into Thin Air -- I first listened to it on book tape, then immediately bought the book and read it, and then followed up by buying more non-fiction \\"adventure\\" books on mountain climbing. I know that \\"A Perfect Storm\\" was very well liked by readers, but I think Into Thin Air beats it hands down. You might seriously consider getting the audio tape, which is read by the author. Something about his emotionless reading of what happened to the group of climbers make it especially haunting. (I know normally emotionless doesn't seem like it would be good in a book reading, but in this case it does.) The main thing you realize on reading this book is, why would anybody want to climb up a snow-covered mountain that has a 1 in 4 chance of killing you. These people are so stupid, which makes for good reading. Get the book or audio tape, and be spellbound by the narrative."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic, could not put it down","review":"I saw the IMAX movie made at the same time of this tragedy.

This is one of the best books I've ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm waiting for the book from Beck Weathers","review":"This book was absolutely incredible. It amazes me that people who were in no way involved with this disaster have been placing blame on certain individuals on Everest. Unless they were there (or atleast get some insight from the book) they will never understand how unimaginely horrible this was. People go into survival mode, they are suffering from lack of oxygen to the brain, they're in pain and desperate.The person in this book who amazed me the most was Beck Weathers. I would love to hear his story. I wonder how he survived the conditions and how it felt to be left to die (twice)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Krakauer Takes Readers Along a Harrowing Journey of Everest","review":"Imagine yourself alone, surrounded by nothing but blinding snow. In the midst of hurricane force winds and sub zero temperatures you are all alone, 8,000 meters above the rest of the world. Home is only a picture in your mind, your body aches with agony.After completing Jon Krakauer's book Into Thin Air, I breathed a sigh of relief that I had made it off of Mt. Everest in one piece. Krakauer's description of the events that took the lives of several of his comrades will leave you breathless.Krakauer's book combines his oustanding journalistic talents, climbing expertise and his experience of the real life crisis that took the lives of 12 people in the Spring of 1996. No one could tell this story better than Krakauer.With poignancy and compassion Krakauer takes the reader up into the heart of the mountain to explore what drives women and men to push their minds and bodies beyond the limits-- to stand atop the world.This book is a must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worthy","review":"A good read for around the campfire. I found the events a little difficult to follow at times."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEAUTIFULLY GRIPPING","review":"Like Krakauer's \\"Into The Wild\\", this book is a stunning description of the events leading up to unnecessary tragedy. The manner in which he writes brings the reader closer to these events than you can ever imagine and leaves you yearning for more. It is without question one of the most incredible pieces of literature I have had the priviledge of reading (several times)."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was terribly boring, I hardley fascinating.","review":"I thought the book was fair. It gives an inside and personal look at climbing Mount Everest that is somewhat interesting. The mindset of the climbers was the most interesting part of the book. Although, I liked him analyzing the decisions of the guides and trying to figure out what was going through their minds he didn't need to do it twenty-four hours a day. It became boring and I lost interest. Jon may have written the book to free his feelings and give some detailed insight as to what happened up on Everest in 1996, but was unsuccessful due to the discrepencies.It made the book more confusing. I feel this book is not worth taking the time to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed and bored by this story","review":"I found it VERY difficult to follow at times. I kept waiting for the pages to grab me right through the end. I expected more thrills and heart pounding excitment and instead got extremely in depth details that were totally unnecessary about climbing tools. If you are an avid climber then read away - if not, take a course and then try to relate. Krakauer relates this to a small percentage of people who are climbing enthusiasts rather than to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worthwhile","review":"Good, not great.

I just wouldn't say it was a MUST read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book","review":"I mean if I like it who since childhood had healthy disrespect for any kind of sports, then anyone can like it.

It is so good that I'm reading the book slowly, sort of masticating it in my mind.I would like to go to the base camp at least one day...."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book has it all!","review":"Into Thin Air is a very good book. I have read other books about Mtn. climbing and this ranks at the top. The story is so exciting that it's hard to believe that this is a true story. I have read one of Jon Krakauer's other books and I really like his writing style. I think the fact that he was actually there greatly increased the detail of the tragedy that struck on Everest. This brings a realism that cannot be imitated or reproduced. Overall I found the book to be exciting and realistic. I would recommend this book to just about anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"I could have been there","review":"Krakauer is an excellent writer; blending the history, the present emotions, personalities, and also information specific to climbing all into a single volume which is hard to put down. Each aspect of the book is fascinating and he interweaves into narrative that unravals at a steady pace. His ability to express how climbing, the mountain, and the other climbers impacted him places the reader right there in his shoes. As I read this, I found myself driven to reach the summit and yet I longed to return to someplace more comfortable. What a powerful way Krakauer has of recounting a true story. Excellent research and excellent story telling. And you leave the book knowing a little more history, a little more about Everest and a little more about mountaineering."},{"rating":"2","title":"balanced account, gripping story-telling","review":"Jon Krakauer does an excellent job of describing the horrors faced by climbers on Mt.

He is very honest about his own, and others', shortcomings."},{"rating":"2","title":"The events in this book were book exciting and at the same t","review":"When I first got assigned to read the book Into Thin Air, I was unsure if I would like it. One reason was because it was a 400 page book and also because mountain climbing did'nt really interest me. I started reading it and it seemed a little boring and drawn out. As I got halfway through the book, it became really interesting and full of action. Some of the things that happened to the climbers amazed me and were very frightning. What I found interesting about this book was it wasn't as if you could predict what was going to happen next, as in other books I have read. It was all in the hands of nature. The people in this book, in my eyes, are definitely heroes."},{"rating":"2","title":"okay","review":"The book, Into The Air was a good book. I gave this book four stars. The first part of the book is pretty boring. He mostly talks about how he got into it and what he had to do. The middle part of the book was really good. He talks about what it was like up there and what he had to do. The end was okay. He talked about about coming down and what it was like coming back. Some parts of the book were pretty confusing. The author would be talking about one thing and then all of a sudden he would switch to a totally different subject. He was talking about going up to camp three and then he started talking about the people he was with. It was pretty weird. I learend that it takes a lot mote than physical strength, it takes mental strength too to get the summit. I liked the book a lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breath taking figurely, I feel like I climbed Everest","review":"Words are difficult to desribe what I am feeling after completing this book. It is a five star experience, I hunger to want to know more about really happened in the thin air of Everest. I find my self wanting to meet Jon, sit down and talk with him about the experience. I also believe him to be VERY creditable, his personal knowledge of climbing, and a trained eye to detail brings this account right into our hearts and tugs hard. I guess the question never to be answered is why did Hall violate his own Time deadline? Thank you Jon for having the courage to write an account that has cost so much in human life."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book knocked me out of my climbing shoes.","review":"I read Into Thin Air the week it came out ,because I had intently followed the whole story from when it had begun to unfold.I was so excited when Jon decided to turn the magazine article into a book. As a climber the book ,oddly, seemed to completly fuel my own personal dreams of climbing big mountains. It has something to do with Krakauer's keen ability to put the reader in the middle of what is going on.Into Thin Air is an excellent detailed representation of the events and people surrounding the May 9 tragedy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbelievably Scary","review":"I couldn't put this book down and was amazed that anyone survived this ordeal. Jon Krakauer excelled at describing the mountain so I felt like I could see it. This book gives a frightening glimpse into the most extreme environment earth has to offer. I trembled when Krakauer described the night climbing, which was hair-raising enough, and the 100-mph wind storms.And, of course, I really got a sense of the mind-boggling height of Mount Everest. Take for example the Petronas Towers in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Each one stands 1,483 feet tall, the highest building in the world. Now, in order to reach the summit of Everest, you would need to stack 19 and a half of those towers on top of each other! Or to put it another way, Mount Everest is taller than the 24 tallest buildings in the world put together! ............This book will be topped by the one written about climbing Mount Olympus on Mars, but not by any others. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why do so many people like this book?","review":"We all know this type of book. It looks interesting, people are raving, so you pick it up and begin reading. Starts off slow, you think \\"ah, it's just getting started.\\" 100 pages into it, and it's still getting started. 200 pages in, and you consider dumping it. But you keep reading anyway, people love this book, it'll get better, right? At some point, you notice there's only a few pages left and then you realize with that slightly sinking feeling that you've wasted your time on a book that goes nowhere.What people see in this book, I don't know. A story as good as this deserves a better storyteller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jon Krakauer dosen't know what he is talking about!","review":"The author wrote this with an extreme sense of knowledge about everyone who was on Scott Fischer's expedition, which is strange, because he was on ROB HALL'S expedition !!! He makes a lot of the characters seem like complete fools, ex.: Sandy Hill Pittman, which they are not. Also, he barely gives Anatoli Boukreev (d.12/25/97-climbing accident) any credit for saving numerous lives. Krakauer was in a tent for the majority of the rescue, asleep, and he knows everything that happened? Fraid not ! For the TRUE story, read Anatoli Boukreev's book, THE CLIMB."},{"rating":"1","title":"Into whine air","review":"The book \\"into thin air\\" is unabashedly depressing, thoughtless, and droll. Though adept at whining, Mr. Krakauer does not focus on the real story, that of himself, rather the book quickly degenerates into a self gratifying attempt to remove blame from himself and place it upon others. Page upon page of statements beginning with \\"if only\\" does not benefit the survivors or dignify those who lost thier lives. In short, Mr. Krakauer has done little to honor those who died and much to hurt those who survived."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fiction and Libel written by a snake","review":"The story is entertaining, but sadly lacking in fact. Krakauer spreads gross lies about Anatoli Boukreev in this work of fiction. When Anatoli Boukreev responded to this slander, Krakauer shut up, until Anatoli Boukreev tragically died, then Krakauer opened his lying mouth again. Krakuer is a man without honor and this book should be recognized for the lie that it is.

It's obvious this book was written simply to make money from the tragedy.If you want a better accounting of the events (and not so obviously self-centered and one-sided, read Boukreev's book \\"The Climb.\\" Boukreev's book is considered to be a much more accurate accounting of the events of '96, whereas Karakuer has been criticized by mountaineering associations as not being faithful to the events as they occurred, especially since it was Boukreev going up and down from Camp 4 to rescue climbers while Krakauer was sitting...waiting to be rescued.All this aside, it's worth reading but only with a critical eye.

He rambled on about useless information that had no great impact on me besides losing my interest completely. Yet, I had picked this book to do a project on for english, so I had to read all of it. Once I got to page 207 it wasn't that bad. The pages before that however were pure torture.I also questioned how true his account of the event was. He seemed to shine a light on himself throughout the book. He made it seem like he was the only one on the mountain who know what was going on.

You really couldn't get into it until after about chapter twelve. The author gave you a lot of facts about the mountain and the expedition but he said so much that sometimes you became confused. After you get through that though the book becomes very exciting and interesting and you start to like it. I liked the facts very much and it taught me a lot but in ways it is somewhat sloppy.

Jon Krakauer takes you on a step-by-step ascent up the world's tallest mountain, never leaving-out relevant details. Krakauer then takes his readers on a cold, horrific descent into the base camps as the size of his expedition slowly withers.His words and pace match his state of consciousness throughout his trip up and down Everest. The only downfall are some overly explained details in the beginning of the book. It picks-up quickly towards the middle.Maps in the middle of the book explain the detailed route that he explains at some length.A wonderful read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Haunting","review":"I read this book when it first came out in 1997. I live in Dallas, which is where one of the climbers lives, and was saturated with news media coverage on the disaster. Even though I seemed to know EVERYTHING there was to know, I could not put the book down. There were many comatose days at work due to staying up way too late. It has been over a year since I read the book but I can still remember the way that I felt as I read it. It is one of the best books that I have read and haunts me to this day. Bravo, Jon Krakauer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Interesting Book","review":"Not being a mountain climber myself, I was worried that I might not understand some of the more technical terms, etc. that might be associated with a book like this. However, I was happy that the author made this an easy read for inexperienced readers like me.The book caught my attention right away and I got to know the characters and felt for them. I did think that the author held back quite a bit when talking about the characters' true personalities though.Overall, I thought it was an easy read, very interesting, and had a very moving storyline to it. I would recommend it to anyone interested in the fascination of pushing one's body to the ultimate limits."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING!

I thought Jon Krakauer showed guts in telling his version of the story, knowing that many readers may condemn some of his actions or lack there of. I felt like I knew the members of Rob Hall's team and I climbed that mountain with them. I enjoyed this book, it was a good adventure but mostly it defined what it means to be human."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great education in high-altitude mountaineering","review":"If you want to read mountaineering books, or you have read some and don't understand all the terms, read this book! Krakauer takes the time to explain climbing terms and phrases to the layperson in a way that is informative without slowing down the movement of the story. His honest, straightforward writing explains the 1996 Everest \\"disaster\\" in a way that is personal, but surprisingly objective. I enjoyed his writing style immensely and found it a fascinating, hard-to-put-down story.

If you like simple, unembellished writing and gripping true stories, you will love this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Story!! Great writing!","review":"I read this book three times in a month! Part of what made it so good was the story and the unbelievable turn of events.I also read two other books about the 1996 disasters on Everest and the other authors aren't half as good as Krakauer.

I read it twice and will do so again. A true top adventure story that will never age. I held back one star because the dozen or so characters were too many to know. The writing isn't great lit but more like a long and good mag article. It's an exciting, gripping story of human endeavor."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for non-fiction fans","review":"This is a story that had to be told and should be read by any non-fiction fan.The expedition to the top of Mt. Everest and the resulting tragedy could fill a book twice the size. In fact, I was thirsting for more details of the preperations, indivdual climbers, and the mountain as well as the disaster itself.The book ultimately was about the power of the moutain and nature; how man is never in control as much as he might think he is.At the same time the unbending will of man to survive is graphiclly displayed in the person of Beck who simply refused to die on that mountain.In the end, putting aside the questions about who was to blame, we are left with a profound sence of tragedy and loss of life.The whole account is told in a straight forward and gripping manner by the author.PS: The TV movie did not do justice to this compellig book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Egosentrisk, men gripande","review":"Gir eit godt bilete av eit svaert saa kommersielt ekspedisjonsmiljoe.

Jon Krakauer gives a detailed, journal like account of the amazing and dangerous events in 1996 with a slightly more personal flavor.The fact that Krakauer was acually on the mountain and expierienced all the pains and satisfactions of going from base camp to the summit, and back down in a terrible storm makes it a very good book. Also, the fact that he was on a personal level with the climbers, he was able to recount their personal feelings extremely accurately.The only things that I did not like was unneccesary profanity from Mr. Krakauer. Although he was going for a realistic portrail, we don't need to know everything. We also didn't need to know about how he relieves his stress.Overal, I think that \\"Into Thin Air\\" was a well written book.

His novel uncovers the peril of life at 29,000 feet. He not only touches on the dangers of mountain climbing, but the sheer will, and greed of the men climbing Everest. It amazed me to see how they actually leave men to die in order to reach thier goal. It makes one of the most challenging obstacle on earth appear as a fool's paradise, and will absolutely spellbind you."},{"rating":"2","title":"A gripping tale of life at the extreme","review":"Inspiring.

Also, too many terms for mountain-climbers only and not enough definition to tell non-mountain-climbers what the terms mean. Other than those things, an excellent account of an adventure which went awry for some and awry for the survivors. Even I was in shape, I wouldn't try the climb. I hate garbage, and I'd hate finding a body. Climbing Everest would lead me to tons of both. How depressing, as was the book which I couldn't put down."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fantastic read...","review":"Really enjoyed the book.

It is a gripping and startling account of a 48 hour period on an Everest asscent where disaster strikes.Learning some of the history of climbing Mt. Everest was fascinating. Also, hearing Krakauer describe his asscent as a veritable test of wills and war of attrition strikes me as being both horrific and strangely compelling. What the people in the book endure is truly terrible (even just being so high above see level can bring a person to their knees!), and yet having completed reading, I can't help but stare with longing at the peaks of the mountains around me.Krakauer's narritive is easy to read and solid, but certainly nothing special; it is the events themselves that make this book worth reading.And yes, I will even deign to give this book a letter grade: B+"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the greats!","review":"If you like climbing books, asventure books, or just like to read. This book is very suspenseful. It's hard to read in less than a week. Into Thin Air is an excellent book. It's about a journalist that is sent to Nepal to climb Mt.

Find out how Jon and everyone try to cope with this disaster."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unnerving heroism","review":"A wonderful gift from my father for my birthday. Every page you turn - the perilious journey continues. Absolutely lucid, this is an incredible book that moved me to the limit. Jon Krakauer's 1996 Bestseller Into the Wild was just as gripping, but this story was based on both the psychological and mental health of other climbers. Unfolding his step-by-step encounter of climbing the mountain's deadly pinnacle made the picture seem so real, so vivid. Jon Krakauer's Into Thin Air painted the most spectacular pictures in my head, it felt like he had taken a reel of film and placed the exact same text into my head transforming it into pictures - and I was there. As a 14-yearold, I now have a real appreciation of high altitude mountain climing, and that one small step or miscalculation can result in death. Sadly, for nine intrepid mountaineers they paid the ultimate price with their lives."},{"rating":"2","title":"How could you not like this book?","review":"This book is not supposed to be about being funny and fun :) while sport-climbing :) in the sunny springtime :). It is a serious story of expeditions gone wrong. His blame was duly placed and he can't be blamed for giving his own opinions. Whose do you want him to give? What is wrong with the people who rated this book? It is spectacular."},{"rating":"2","title":"YOU GOTTA LOVE IT, BUT IS IT THE WHOLE STORY?","review":"I read the hardback; I read the paperback; I read the (Illustrated Edition); and still I am impressed. Without a doubt this is one of the most extraordinary adventure stories ever written. Krakauer's skill at spinning at tale is exceptional. But, still, I have several questions. Why so much focus on Scott Fischer's expedition and not his own? Why was Beck Weathers not given more attention after he wandered into camp? What's the deal with the Russian, Anatoli Boukreev? The American Alpine Club recognized his efforts on Everest as heroic, but in his book Krakauer never says a thing about it. Did Krakauer offer to take Beck Weathers down the mountain? Krakauer says yes. In \\"Salon\\" I read that Weathers asked for Krakauer's help, but Krakauer declined. -- As impressed as I am with INTO THIN AIR, I am left with these nagging questions. I wonder if we will ever have the whole story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the Car","review":"I am an avid reader, and lately have been spending lots of time in the car commuting. I was recommended this book on multiple occasions but with my school work and other pieces of work coming before it I never seemed to get to it. But when I bought the audio version I was finished with it in less than a week, I found myself sitting in the car even after I got home to finish the next chapter. The way that Krakauer narrates is amazing and emotion filled. I love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tragically Romantic","review":"As someone who loved \\"Into the Wild\\", I equally enjoyed this deeply personal story of tragedy on Mt. Everest. Krakauer's investigative journalism is to be lauded, especially since this event was so personally painful to him. I am not an avid reader, but I tore through this book. Its vivid imagery of life and death on the mountain was amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"a very engrossing mountaineering book","review":"I had already seen the PBS show \\"Storm Over Everest\\" and read publically available parts of the book from the internet. The book was definitely worth the read for me. The book fleshed out more details and provided motive for these brave people. Climbing these 8K meter peaks fascinates me now where before hearing of this 1996 expedition to Everest I did not pay that close attention to mountaineering. You get a sense of the real danger involved and the amount of courage necessary to summit. I think I have a grasp of the term \\"summit fever\\" but I am sure I don't understand it as Everest climbers do. I recommend this book to anyone interested in thrilling adventures intermixed with tragedy."},{"rating":"1","title":"interesting but slanted","review":"When I first read this book, I thought it was an interesting although not outstanding bit of reporting. Then someone gave me a copy of Boukreev's \\"The Climb,\\" which appears to be an honest but completely non-self-aggrandizing account of how Boukreev, in the face of spectacularly awful conditions, single-handedly rescued other climbers who surely would have died otherwise. It objectively recounts what one can only, realistically, call heroism. But while Boukreev risked his own life to save others, Krakauer slept in a tent; and afterward, despite receiving much direct evidence to the contrary, Krakauer insisted on casting aspersions and innuendo on Boukreev. Realizing Krakauer's lack of honor detracts significantly from any enjoyment of his work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Know what you are reading","review":"I would not recommend this book to anyone who wants to read the truth about what happen on that ill fated 1996 expedition to Mount Everest. In this book the author makes many assumptions that were not his place to make, as well as ignoring the truth when it was given to him several times. His portayal of Mountain Madness Guide Anatoli Boukreev was horribly unjust. Let it just be said that while Jon Krakauer was asleep in his tent at Camp IV Anatoli Boukreev was selflessly out in the blizzard rescuing clients from both the Mountain Madness and Adventure Consultants Teams by himself! The better book to read for a better and more truthful account of what happened would be The Climb by Anatoli Boukreev and G Weston DeWalt."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a poor book...","review":"I do not agree with the majorities of reviews: 1. Krakauer is no good writer - compare him to other classics of mountaineering 2. Just by reviewing articles and other books on the tragedy on May 10th you will find out that he keeps A LOT of events and facts out of the story. The biggest mistake probably is to present Boukreev as the scapegoat... the one guy who did more for the rescue of all the remaining climbers than ANY OTHER PERSON up on the mountain at that time. Sad that he seems to need that to create a Hollywood like drama..."},{"rating":"2","title":"wow not me","review":"Great for anyone who likes adventure.

This book is a great read, but read The Climb by Anatoli Boukreev and you will feel as if JK has taken you for a ride with his good story. This is because a good story does not need to stick to the facts. It is clear from the reaction of the American Alpine Club to Boukreev - awarding him a high honour for his actions on Everest- that they did not share JKs view of Boukreevs conduct.In short JK uses Boukreev as a stooge/villian around which to base his most gripping narative and in doing so absolves himself of blame.

Gripping at the time but deeply flawed and overly emotive. For a fuller account, I recommend The Climb by Anatoli Bukreev, the true hero of the day, and A Day to Die for by Graham Ratcliffe, for a full understanding of the events on Everest in 1996.

I was impressed by his original story in outside magazine, this book didn't add much (apart from the fact that the second time around he got his facts straight).Near the end of the book he endlessly whines about the fact that nobody tried to wake him to help with the rescue, despite the fact that he already mentioned that someone tried (and failed) to wake him to help with the rescue. In the end I was surprised that I hadn't really learned any more from reading this book than I had in reading the original story in Outside.It's a good story, if you aren't bothered by Jon's ego trip.

You'd also be participating in an injustice to the unfortunate people who lost their lives on Everest, people that Mr. Krakauer would not help in their hour of need.

And, yes, it's hard not to feel empathy for those who lost their lives and [moreover] for their friends and family, but.......... that empathy is tempered by the realization that these people decided to put themselves in deadly peril, NOT to explore new paths, NOR to accomplish something of benefit to humankind, but merely for RECREATION. To me, it seems terribly hubristic and self-centered, not to mention costly. In a way, this is a paean to death as the ultimate \\"thrill\\".A note to educators: PLEASE do not ask your students to post reviews of books you have assigned them! I'm sure I speak for many in saying that most people read these reviews for the opinions of people who have actually chosen to read these books, however much they may eventually regret the choice.

It is unfortunate that Jon K made wrong remarks about Anatoli. If it werent for Anatoli's heroics in putting the fixed ropes, nobody would have made it to the top that day...even Jon K and he wont have his lying book. Anatoli wasnt a selfish guide. He was with a client on the way up and down. It is plain common sense and good mountaineering practice to have one of the guides lead the trail up and down in case there is an emergency. The bottom line is Jon K's team got obliterated in Everest. Mountain Madness were successful except for Scott Fischer because of Anatoli who unfortunately died a year later. The awards from the mountaineering community says it all about Anatoli. Jon K did not get any awards from the climbing experts except from the money hungry publishers and media."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly Book about silly people","review":"Only those suffering from total hypoxia(a word used 400 times at least in the book} could possibly enjoy this vain attempt"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, sad story","review":"This book brought back memories of a trip I took back in theearly seventies. I climbed Long's peak in Colorado. A foolhardyventure to be sure. The mountain was only 13,000 feet high and yet we climbed it with no gear, trudging up ice fields stepping in other people's foot prints. There were rock slides, thin air etc. We were foolish to be sure but the drive to get to the top was unstoppable. We just had to do it. Luckily we all survived. There have been a few deaths even on that mountain. I kept thinking of this as I read this book. I couldn't put it down.

It is important that all who undertake dangerous thrills, especially those found atop mountains or in dense woods, share in this story, and the dangers that we face. Some of us are naive enough to think that nothing bad can happen, even when all plans and protocols are strictly adhered to. This book brings us the harsh reality that even the most experienced climbers, naive or not, can succumb to the perils that we face in our own quests.

I am so very grateful!! What an epic saga! Krackauer is a superb writer and this literally leaves you hanging on his every word. I have read all his books now and can't wait for more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-have for climbers!","review":"Into Thin Air is a true story about an expedition climbing Everest in its deadliest season yet. The Author, Jon Krakauer, was one of the climbers on the New Zealand expedition and he recalls the incident through his own eyes. Every detail is included in this book, as if this experience happened just days before the book was written instead of months. Quite often, Krakauer will stray off of the storyline to give some background information instead of just pushing on. A well-written story, Into Thin Air is a must-have for any mountain climber. Another account of the dreadful climb is by one of the few survivors of the storm, Beck Weathers, who was another person on Krakauer's team. The name of the book is Left for Dead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Into Thin Air","review":"In this book, Jon Krakauer takes you step by step through a thrilling adventure about climbing the highest mountain in the world. Everest. He portrays the harsh storm that the climbers encounter which takes the lives of five of Jon's friends. Driven to reach the top, the mountaineers proceed to climb for the summit of the mountain, despite the high winds and deathly conditions. By doing this, the get caught in one of the worst blizzards ever recorded in the history of Everest. By now they are at the peak of the mountain and have no way down. You will be lead through the heartwrenching experience first hand in this book. If your interested in reading a book where the action never ceases, this book is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Non Fiction Book I have Ever Read","review":"I am a 13 year old boy and this book is right up there with harry potter you feel that you are right up on the mountain with Jon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating","review":"I agree with most people that have reviewed this book. It is absolutely captivating as well as horrifying. Krakauer helps you to strap on your crampons and take the climb with the expedition. As the horror evolved, I found myself not able to put down the book. Especially once the climbers found themselves struggling for their lives during the decent. Definitely a book for adventure/nature people!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gripping Narrative","review":"This is a gripping account of danger, death and survival. In 1996 author Jon Krakauer went on assignment for OUTSIDE magazine and joined a group of amateur and professional mountaineers on the trek up the world's tallest peak. Led by expert climbers Rob Hall and Scott Fisher, and assisted by native Sherpas from Nepal, it would seem to be a safe trip. But a violent winter storm hit just as the group was near the peak, leading to tragedy. Contributing to the danger was a lack of oxygen, which can lead to faulty judgment in a highly unforgiving place. Krakauer shows how sadly, eight climbers would perish in the blizzard cold, and how a couple others overcame long odds and survived.This remarkably readable account is one of the most gripping narratives ever penned. Readers might also enjoy THE PERFECT STORM about deep-sea fishing in the Atlantic and ALIVE, the true story about death and survival following a plane crash high in the Andes Mountains of South America."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent mountaineering adventure","review":"One of my hiking friends recommended this book to me. It's the tale of the 1996 expedition to Mt. Everest -- the highest peak on the planet -- which lost several lives during a storm on the return from summiting. While reading I couldn't help but be awed by the incredible strength and stamina of these adventurers. You really don't get a feel for just how hard high altitude mountaineering is from the movies. Jon Krakauer tells this tale in a brutally honest fashion, not even sparing himself from harsh criticism. I enjoyed the read so much, that I am now addicted to mountaineering adventure books."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Captivating Story","review":"This book was purchased to replace the one I lost in a flood. I have already read it twice, but it is such a captivating story, I know I will be reading it again, and lending it out for others to read. It is well written, and the story is gripping, so it makes it hard to put the book down, once you begin reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely wonderful story!","review":"This was a book that I didn't think that I would like that much. Sure it was an adventure story, I liked that idea but this was from one of the survivers' point of view, just how honest could that be? Well he didn't try to make himself look good. He was a loner, a self serving person in a sport that required that people watch out for each other to servive. He is living with what happened up there in an unbelievable adventure which surely has made him think retrospectively about all of our selfish and unselfish feelings that we all have. Great Adventure!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Exhausting!","review":"My first thought upon finishing this book: \\"Why?\\" However, having not been there, I can't judge what really happened. I loved this book. I loved the struggle and the attempts at heroism in such extreme conditions. Jon Krakauer has achieved success in defining his opinion and view of these tragic events. READ THIS BOOK!"},{"rating":"2","title":"For a balanced account, read \\"The Climb\\"","review":"This was a great book, albeit a little melodramatic. I just finished reading \\"The Climb\\" by Anatoli Boukreev and I have a whole different perspective of the diaster. Read both books, Into Thin Air and The Climb for balance."},{"rating":"2","title":"An experience I couldn't get enough of.","review":"I read most of this book on a plane cruising at 33,000 feet. Every now and then I would look out the window and try to imagine people trying to survive at an altitude where NOTHING does! A great book that moved me. I question the interntions of those who summited, died and those that lived. I could never but my family through the horror that unfolded some 29,000 feet above sanity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling","review":"I think that to risk life and limb just to reach the top of a mountain is the height of egomania. Reading this book has not changed my opinion in this regard, only reinforced it. A well written, compelling story, maybe it will dissuade others from taking these risks. I somehow doubt it, though. Young, healthy people seem to be immune to their own mortality until it jumps up and hits them in the face."},{"rating":"2","title":"Courage still exists!","review":"Courage still exists in this world! I couldn't put 'Into Thin Air' down. The bodies of those left on the roof of the world are a monument to the spirit of these men. What better way to leave this Earth then by doing something you want to do in a noble effort. I pray that I will not die in my bed, but die climbing my own mountains of life in the same way 'Into Thin Air' so dramatically describes. I've given this book to everyone I care about. It's not just about climbing Everest, its about how you live your life!"},{"rating":"2","title":"IT DOES NOT GET BETTER THAN THIS","review":"To Play the King is interesting because it so happens our vile \\"hero\\" is standing upon firm UK constitutional principles.....ironic twist....this series is SUPERB.....a 20th c. version of I Claudius......enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"2nd Series Better Than the first","review":"Tension builds and I began to read this even during the day! It is hard to leave off each night. Odd ending for the king - don't want to give the ending away for anyone. Actor who played the king was so handsome - he needed to be firmer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Goldsmith Borrows A Little from Himself","review":"With a career spanning over four decades, Goldsmith has attained a position as one of the movie's most prolific and innovative composers. Although his work during the past ten years does not compare to his landmark work of the 60's and 70's, he did do two exemplary scores in the 90's: one is the music to \\"The Ghost in the Darkness\\" and \\"Total Recall.\\"What makes \\"Recall\\" such a winner is that it seems to pay homage to Goldsmith's earlier triumphs. One can hear \\"The Omen,\\" \\"Planet of the Apes,\\" the underrated \\"Secret of N.I.M.H\\" and even \\"Gremlins\\" in the otherworldly melodies used to complement the film. There is much originality in this composition with the opening and closing themes being especially awesome in their execution. But it is the patented Goldsmith \\"touches\\" that make this one significant and a worthy, albeit unintended, \\"introduction\\" for those who are just discovering the composer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Total Recall","review":"This is one of Goldsmiths best work ever!! I do not have the orinigal version however so I cannot compare the two. But if you dont have the orinigal and if you like goldsmith. get this one now"},{"rating":"2","title":"Undoubtedly, Goldsmith's Best Action Film Score","review":"'The Dream' opens what is perhaps the best action film score ever in Jerry Goldsmith's long career. This main title track is very catchy thanks to its pulsating percussion and synths that accompany the orchestra extremely well. Then there are propulsive tracks such as 'For Old Time's Sake', 'Clever Girl', 'The Big Jump', 'The Massacre', 'The Treatment', and 'End Of A Dream', that make this the most exciting album ever. All of them pretty well balanced with ethereal and glorious tracks such as 'The Space Station', 'The Mountain', 'Without Air', 'The Mutant', and 'A New Life'.Thanks to the people of Var��se Sarabande for releasing this wonderful expanded edition to Jerry Goldsmith's spectacular score. This is definitely a true gem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Informative","review":"I have a history of memory trouble in my family and I had many questions about what I could and could not do to prevent this problem. This book answered all my questions and gave me a ton of useful suggestions for staying healthy. It is a must for anyone with family members who have dementia or are suspected of having dementia. It covers everything from the most modern medication to herbal remedies and explains them in language that anyone can understand. It certainly made me feel well informed, and a little more secure about an issue that had puzzled me for a long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad product","review":"I purchased 4 additional 4 channel unit westinghouse intercon in different sellers and they don\`t work at all.

I took it to a tournament (indoors) and recorded our dogs passing to see if we could improve our skills. The lighting that this camcorder picked up was very warm (red tones) and the overall quality was not sharp as I had hoped. Once we recorded our dogs passing we would reivew the recorded material and slow it down to see how close the dogs were passing. Once we slowed it down they dogs were fuzzy and not in focus. I had recorded at the best quality the camcorder had to offer but I will be taking this one back for a refund.I loved being able to get to certain recordings through the index and loved the ease of everything else it had to offer. Easy startup and transfer but the quality was just not in the picture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy from this Guy","review":"One star instead of negative star, only because the main product essential works. The main charging unit was not included. Seller said it was. After contact, he said he put it in the box. The box was tattered, no charger.

I have 3 hrs of my son's black belt test on the camera but can't get it to DVD. He successfully completed the 29 hour test and I'm spending more time with no success. Others have found the authoring program equally as difficult. Its just plain slow and you need to wait until the end of the process to find out it went wrong. The help at JVC said with a very rehersed tone \\"You're the first person I talked to with this problem.\\" Yea right. The sad part is that he at age ten is the first black belt of his school's program, his instructors are as proud and elated as I, he is held as the example for others to emulate and the only footage is locked in this blasted JVC.

That's all they do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sophie's debut wasn't so great","review":"\\"Damn I wish I was your lover\\" is the best song on this debut album from Sophie. She's got a great voice and she sounds very emotional when she sings these songs, but for some reason I just couldn't get into the rest of the album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trite and over-produced","review":"I really tried to give this CD a chance, but the lyrics make me cringe. The over-the-top production on most of the songs sound ridiculous and highlight the weaknesses is Sophie Hawkins' voice. She sings in a whiny drone, as if she's constipated, and when she attempts to sound hip by adopting southern or urban black expressions, she sounds like a total phony. Many of her songs are unintentionally funny because they're so cliched. Sophie might have a few good songs in her, but they're not here. Her next album, \\"Tibre\\" is dull and irritating too. I wonder if she drives her record company crazy with all her constant bitching and poor sales."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sophie B.'s Best...","review":"She's an original in her own right ! Sure, critics will and have compared her to the likes of Joni Mitchell,Wendy & LIsa, Alannis Morissette, the list goes own. She mixes it all up to perfection with her unique blend of pop-rock,alternative,folk,r&b,.Likewise,she assumes different vocal identities for each style of song or mood.One moment she's sounding like a Prince protogee (singing a song that could have been written by the Great Purple One) on Damn I Wish I Was Your Lover and then recites part of the Our Father in California...Ashame this has been her only big top selling album.She explores musical territories without sounding brash or bitter.Instead she's seductive and soulful !Her recitations on a couple of tracks are fitting.She goes from subtle seductive whispers to hard rockin' throaty vocal exercises...I'm still curious as to what Sophie means exactly by the title Tongues and Tails...I doubt it has anything to do with family pets (dogs)..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Give This a Try!","review":"For those intrigued by \\"Damn\\", Sophie is the rare artist who's album does her great single justice. This remains my fav Hawkins CD, and for those beginning their collection of her, I encourage starting with this instead of the Best of(which only covers this and two other albums, anyhow), and then moving to Whaler next. She has Madonna hooks with the lyrical density of Dylan and the musical complexity of, well, somebody(Peter Gabriel?). I can play this one again and again. The fact that she is not a bigger star just tells you that she is too much a real artist to be a Mariah or Britney(not that she'd probably want to be:)"},{"rating":"2","title":"a true masterpiece album","review":"It's difficult to summarize Sophie B Hawkins' debut album, Tongues and Tails. It's in the rock category for sure... with strong pop elements... yet full of soul, taboo, sexual energy, and power from both vocals and instrumentation. Really, for me this has it all, and deserves the label of a masterpiece. I got this back in the early 90s after hearing the hit Damn I Wish I Was Your Lover. Then I discovered there is so much more to this album and Sophie B Hawkins. If you enjoy stunning lyrics, with heartfelt emotional vocals, and outstanding musicianship, check out this CD. My favorite tracks include Mysteries We Understand, California Here I Come, Saviour Child, I Want You (puts Bob Dylan to shame), Before I Walk On Fire, We Are One Body, and Listen. Yes that's most of the songs that I listed - it was too hard to pick just a few. This CD is a solid pleasure from the opening note to the closing one."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Gem for Mining","review":"Overproduced and overwrought, Tongues and Tails nonetheless has one certifiable, should-be-in-everyone's-collection gem, a cover of Dylan's I Want You, which in Hawkins' version becomes a bitter, longing, slowed-down torch song. The way she spits out the line \\"You know I wasn't very cute to him, was I?\\" is reason enough alone to give her a listen. Three other cuts also succeed -- the infectious Damn I Wish I Was Your Lover, Before I Walk on Fire, and Saviour Child. As for the rest...she often sounds like Enya on steroids to me and the production relies way too much on synthesizers, overmix, and a really annoying tendency to use spoken dialogue. Saviour Child in particular is damaged by this last effect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Value. Fast Service. Perfect for leveling floors","review":"Typical adjustable column.

Standard tube thickness etc. Fast Service made me a repeat customer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Sylvers Greatest Hits...","review":"I have a sentimental weakness for this group, as they made an impact upon my teenage soul, back in the early through mid 1970's. I play their music, look in the mirror and see what I was, what life was, and life to me was sound. The only reason why I won't give this collection 5 stars is simple. Where's the song \\"Keep on, Keeping on\\"? You can't find it anywhere. I can't be the only one waiting on the \\"Showcase\\" LP to be released to CD (hopefully re-mastered!). My favorite tunes on this collection are the following:1. Through the love in my heart (Nice mid paced song!)2. Fools Paradise (70's pop song with a message)3. Wish that I could talk to you baby! (Nice pop ballad!)4. Misdemeanor (Foster's hit - Need I say more!)If you can get it at a good price, I say, buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Has the good stuff not found elsewhere","review":"While no cds currently exist of an actual Sylvers album (such as \\"Something Special\\" from 1976), this Cd is good as it contains the Sylvers tunes that people loved, but cannot find on most such compliations. Namely \\"Fools Paradise.\\" the lovely 1973 summer hit \\"Misdemeanor\\" (credited to brother Foster, hiphop fans will recognize this as the sample for the DOC's \\"Getting Funky\\"), and one of their last hits, the wonderful chant \\"Don't Stop-Get Off\\", one of those seventies tunes known onkly to us who were there at the time. Most Sylvers cds contain the familiar stuff like \\"Hot Line, \\"Boogie Fever,\\" and \\"Cotton Candy,\\" etc. but this has what is usually left out. Get it while you can!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Collection of Music","review":"Brought back a lot of memories for me from the 70s.

Rainmaker, I'm On My Way Back Home and Love Is All That I Ever Needed would all have been sucessful singles. I Would Have Loved You Anyway is the only song I don't really like but the lyrics are unintentionally funny. All the lyrics seem more suggestive now than they did then but that's ok! The background singers get a tad tiring but Go David Cassidy! I don't care if it's the memories or not, I enjoy putting this on and turning it up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ick!","review":"The lyrics are trite and sappy. The music bland and generic.

Rap's no. 1 sidekick the past year being guided by Jay-Z had many antcipating a posssible heir to the throne for '99. But after a few listens you realize that this debut from Memphis Bleek is a forgettable collection of uninspired music. Lacking little subject matter, Coming of Age depends on unoriginal lyrics and hooks that barely keep the listener's attention. For what it's worth, the album does not linger in complete mediocrity. Good but not great guest appearences from Jay-Z, Noreaga, Ja-Rule, Bennie Seigal, and Swizz Beats (production) does the album some justice. But overall M.B. appears to be still coming of age.

The only good track came out 2 months ago on the ja rule album. He's a wack version of jay-z without the blazin beats, hooks, and rymes. Plus, this fool left his family in Brooklyn to move to NJ.

Also, it's priceless to hear their manager (I assume it's their manager, or agent, or some sort of promotional record person) scream \\"LEVITATION! LEVITATION! LEVITATION!\\" as they begin said song. They really knew how to make squares and used-car salesmen back then... You can just SEE this guy (I imagine him looking like John Goodman wearing a \\"Used Cars\\" Kurt Russell plaid sports jacket) jumping around on stage thinking that he's hip, or something (\\"Yeahh! Energy, THAT'S what these crazy kids are into! Just a lot of yelling and Beatles-screaming! I got 'em pegged!\\") Hilarious. And the album's worth the price. I WOULDN'T MISLEAD YA, KIDS! LEVITATION!

Beautifully layered sounds, with unique timing and styles makes for a really exciting listen. Then Lou, the vocalist, gets jealous and screams--no, wails like a BANSHEE is more like it--for attention like some kind of tortured child. Stick with Portishead, if you want some sincere vocals, or get this if you can mentally ignore the howling of this inhuman wannabe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant!","review":"I love Lamb! I absolutlely love their debut album. This time around, their music is a bit more intricate, yet the vocals were a bit of a let down, at first. After a while, I got to thinking that Bonfire just wouldn't be Bonfire if Lou sang it with that soft beautiful voice she shared on their first album. Maybe pregnancy and the birth of her son changed her vocals a bit? All in all, the album is great. The new hard edge in Lou's voice takes some getting use to (you should hear Gorecki from LAMB with Lou's \\"new voice\\" at www.cottonwool.com . Masterpiece) but in the end, not a disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent sophomore effort from this Manchester duo","review":"Lamb's self-titled debut was a great mix of trip-hop that was fused with the energy of an extended jam session. You never quite knew where the music was going to go, but you were sure it was going to be cool. But on \\"Fear of Fours\\" this is abandoned for a more collected, methodical pop sound. This may be a good thing, mind you, as the biggest fault to the first album was that none of the songs were very radio friendly in the United States because the entire album had to be taken as a whole. \\"Fear of Fours\\" learns from this mistake and gives each track it's own individuality, but loses some of the greater warmth in the process. Outstanding tracks included \\"Softly\\", \\"Little Things\\", and \\"b-line\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stale Roast Lamb","review":"This clunky follow up to their smooth debut would best be served on a skewer, rather than endured on a stereo. It's obvious that they've run out of creative spark here; Most tracks offer pale echoes of previously charted territory. And \\"B-Line\\" has to be one of the most annoying songs of the year(Their trendy nod to swing, me thinks). They've sacrificed the jazzy/sultry/after-hours moodiness of their debut for radio friendly blandness. Much of what they're gunning for here is handled better by another act worth checking out--12 Rounds. Interesting sidelight--Their \\"new\\" label (Seagrams) has been pushing tracks mostly off of their first album on a promo video for this new album--a bad sign for sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"A HUGE WASTE OF FIFTEEN BUCKS.","review":"I'm a great fan of drum n' bass and the likes, but I'd have to say this is quite possibly the most annoying album I've purchased recently. Her vocals are totally annoying in the same way that Alanis Morrisette's is. I can't recommend this album to anybody who enjoys good music of any sort. Sure, the drum n' bass parts are exquisite, but all the tracks are quite frankly ruined by her straining, cat-choking lyrical style. If I were you, I'd spend the fifteen bucks on Mu-Ziq's Royal Astronomy or even Bogdan Raczynski's Samurai Math Beats for a taste of true musicianship and drum n' bass."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somebody pass me the earplugs","review":"This feeble attempt at a second album is disappointing to say the least. Their debut album was a bit more tolerable, but this time they went way over the edge by keeping the vocals. I would've hoped in the years that passed between the first and this album, the guy in the band would have come to his senses and kicked the woman out, but alas, this has not happened. Instead, the girl's vocals are pumped up and shrill at all the wrong moments disallowing you to enjoy the suprisingly catchy beats that thump behind the cacophony. I pray that the next album will have no sign of the voice."},{"rating":"2","title":"This IS a relatively good album.","review":"Anybody seen the \\"B-Line\\" video? It kicks my *ss.

After arriving, I opened the package and was anxious to see if my ps3 would fit in it, because other people left feedback saying that it didn't fit too well. so i put my ps3 in it and it fitted like a glove. I was a little disappointed with how the controller stand was on the backside of the ps3 and the light doesn't seem to work, but I didn't order this for those things anyway. All in all this stand serves it's purpose and I would recommend it to anyone with an old style ps3."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Suitable for 60GB","review":"This product is very slick looking and does increase the stability of the PS3 when in the vertical position. It is powered by a USB port but has a pass through port on the stand, so you don't lose any ports. I never did see my stand alternate between blue and red.

(2) The six stream-connected lights at the bottom of the unit make for a very Playstation-like feel, this glow stand is the only one which matches the PS3 perfect. (3) The lights aren't too bright, I play in complete darkness with my PS3 directly under (but in front of) my 40\\" Sony Bravia and have no visual impairments towards play OR Blu-ray movies. (4) It connects into any USB port and doesn't interfere with any other connection (like a certain competitor does).CONS: (1) PS3 has to be in vertical position for usage w/ glow stand. NOTE: The PS3 cooling ability is actually improved in the vertical position because of a reduction in static electricity (Try to avoid placing PS3 on a carpet at any time). So, I don't view this as a CON, BUT I have to put it in here because I've read other consumer reviewers who do, so that's up to you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Media Door is accessible","review":"The door IS accessible depending on how you place the PS3 in the stand.

There is almost an inch wide gap between the edge of the PS3 and the edge of the stand, so unless I cut a piece of wood to fill the void, the PS3 can still tip over.

Like Allan Holdsworth, he mixes lightning-fast arpeggios with unusual chordal voicings and off-kilter cadences. That which a mainstream audience might hear as cacophony is really a purposeful mission of spiritual celebration akin to what Coltrane was seeking to do with the sax in the 1960s. Tom Kennedy is one of the few like-minded bassists of the day (as was Jimmy Johnson with Holdsworth) who had the musical intelligence to follow suit with Connors' vision, and helped make this trio format not only viable, but hold-your-breath exciting. Unfortunately, Connors became disillusioned with the music biz scene, and abandoned his public art after his three poorly promoted Pathfinder/Evidence fusion releases, \\"Step It\\", \\"Assembler\\" and \\"Double Up\\". I still hope for the day when he considers coming back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Boys can play good Hard Rock??????","review":"Sincerely...

The DVD I received from Amazon has no bonus materials (one of the reasons I wanted the DVD)and states at the end of the DVD that \\" this DVD is a work in progress\\". I wonder if this is a pirated copy without the Bonus material. Also, the DVD did not play well. I had to watch it on my computer and even then had some trouble with it stalling. Buy from Icke's site if you want this DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Your kidding...right?","review":"If anyone thinks this book is the best they are fooling themselves.

The Droll 52\\" Sky Hook fits the bill nicely. Well made and I like the fact that they are aluminum and will last a little longer than the steel ones will, here, next to the ocean. They apprear to be quite durable. I hooked 2 of them together to get the feeders down to a reasonable height. The birds say Thank You and I say Thank You now that I don't have to drag the ladder out anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"HOPE YOU DONT WANT YOUR TEETH ANYMORE !","review":"This album is kick-you-in-your-teeth, smash-your-nose-in-your-brain raw hardcore! If you like Rage, Korn, or Limp, you won't after listening to this one. The other flower-smellin' bands cower in the corner with their heads covered in shame. This is NOT your average hardcore band, nor is it an album for the meek and mild; it is raw, unleashed hardcore with a Message of Hope that the world needs to hear...if they can get past the \\"music\\" and realize we are all children of God with something to add to society rather than the misconception of taking away from it. Take my word for it, you will fall in love with the band and the album and it'll make you come crawling back for more. But, don't take my word for it, I'm merely a messenger."},{"rating":"2","title":"GrYp=God","review":"My friend first picked up this CD at a christian concert last summer, Creation, not knowing what is was. He took a little listen and liked it, he brought it to me. I thought, \\"christian,no way\\", but i was wrong. Until you read the lyics, it is not christian to you. I enjoy bands like Korn, Deftones and Incubus, and i can now add Gryp to that list. Songs like, \\"Ungreatful\\", \\"Go Against the Crowd\\", are some of my favorite all time songs. But the killer song on this CD is, \\"Real\\". I was blown away, just amazing. One of the best ever! If you're looking for something new and good, buy Gryp."},{"rating":"1","title":"whaaaat!","review":"I almost couldnt believe what i was seeing when i checked out these reviews. I'm putting this cd on my big list of really bad cds with horrible lyrics, vocals, and music. Dont tell me i dont know my music because it sounds like they threw this cd together in a basement in the dark while they were constipated, but hey, thats my opinion. That squeaky little voice the guy sings in just gets really annoying. Anyway, I hate this cd and i threw it out a week after i bought it, I would give it 0 stars if I could. Theres much better music out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome!","review":"These guys rock!This cd has the adrenalin Korn, manson,limb-bizkit, I have hade the cd for about a year now and are still loving it.Highly recommend it to all hard music fans"},{"rating":"2","title":"GRYP-christian band with attatude","review":"Just a few words: this is a pretty good CD and i like it alot. they sound somewhat like korn. i probably wouldnt like them but they are local so i do. \\"Against the Crowd\\" is a awsome song so is \\"Real\\". If your a christian and into metal or just wanna hear some tunes that grow on you, buy this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"this is music that christian guys have been waiting for","review":"this CD is awesome Gryp ranks up there with Newsboys and DCtalk this MUSIC (not the lyrics the lyrics are awesome)although i consider it great might be questionable for certain persons so do sample it before you buy it. It has a simularity to music such as the \\"Deftones\\" & Rage Against The Machine with lots of yelling and screaming (of which I like) but I think its one of the best"},{"rating":"1","title":"Some nice special effects, but poorly acted / written","review":"Contains some nice work by Harry Harryhausen in creature animation, but this movie has a very weak Harry Hamlin in the lead role (he makes Arnold in Conan look like John Gielgud). Hey, I like the mechanical owl though. Too much of this movie is also very slow-paced and even though it is essentially and sword and sandal adventure spends way too much time being talky. Jason and the Argonauts & the Sinbad movies were alot better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harryhausen's best film!","review":"Ray Harryhausen has entertained us with his wonderful stop-motion photography long before computer-generated special effects became the standard. In contrast, they may not be perfect, but they conveyed an imagination and a dedication to a craft that no computer ever will.CLASH OF THE TITANS is simply the culmination of years of hard work, which included THE SEVENTH VOYAGE OF SINBAD and JASON AND THE ARGONAUTS.Here Mr. Harryhausen has a wonderful script to work from, and an absolutely perfect cast to carry it off. The production values, the cimematography, costumes, great action scenes - well, who could ask for anything more? Don't pass up this great fantasy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great movie","review":"I totally love this money back in the day. It finally being available on DvD made me finally add it to my collection.

This is one of his best films for both story & special effects."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic of titans","review":"This is probably the classic of its gender. Clash of the Titans shows a little bit of the Greek mythology with the characters that you won't forget: Calibos, Kraken, Perseo, medusa... For its time has the most wonderful visual effects. Imagine if the movie were made today...UPDATE: after seeing the 21st century version of Clash of Titans, the original movie doesn't lose its feeling and power. Please keep in mind this is THE original Clash of Titans, the father of the new one and forthcoming versions"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally got i!","review":"I have been meaning to buy this for some time. This is a great childhood memory for me. We are so spoiled today with the movie magic. This movie takes you back to when film makers had to try so hard to make it look real. Although many scenes do not look very real, it is a fun movie to watch. I am very happy I got it."},{"rating":"1","title":"In spite of nice packaging...","review":"This cannot possibly be a Blu-Ray disc. The quality is the worst I've ever seen - I had to stop watching after only 10 minutes because it was so grainy you can't even tell what's going on!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great movie but the conversion to Blue-Ray is terrible!","review":"The only \\"actor\\" ever to steal a movie from the greatest Laurence Olivier is the mechanical golden owl in this movie. Charming and enchanting from beginning to end is this great movie! But the conversion to Blue-Ray is very poor, grainy, blurry, and the background often looks pasted on. A real shame for this movie is timeless and far superior to the 2011 remake."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD-Clash of the Titans","review":"Very disappointed! The DVD skipped continuously throughout the movie. I was trying to show it to my class who is studying mythology. I had to change my lesson halfway through because it was so interruptive. There wasn't any instructions for returning it either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh please!","review":"God I hate this movie. The [bad] special effects (if you can call them special) make this film about as entertaining as Attack of the Killer Tomatoes. And the acting - B movie caliber. I think I have seen better acting on Jerry Springer. I cannot believe they would waste time and money re-releasing this horrible piece of Hollywood!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nudity definitely NOT for Kids and Families","review":"I was SHOCKED as a teenager when I saw this movie in the theatre by the nudity which was NOT brief or appropriate. Pass on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great classic","review":"If you like the new one give this one a try! I've been a fan from the first time I saw it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clash of the Titans","review":"I remember seeing this movie when I was a kid and being enthralled by it - not to mention scared to death by the 'Medusa scene'. So that statement of course makes me biased to the point of nostalgia, but I'll review this anyway. I'm also a 'fan' of Greek/Roman/Norse mythology, so seeing all these mythological creatures was an added treat. While this film is very good, simply because of it's easy-to-follow familiar plot and uncomplicated characters, it pales in comparison to 'Jason and the Argonauts' which enthralls me more today than it did when I saw it as a kid (though I always like the giant stone golem guy in J&tA). So in conclusion, I liked 'Clash of the Titans' less today than when I first saw it, mainly because now I appreciate better acting, deeper characters, and more complex plotlines, but there is a certain 'innocence' in it that almost makes up for all that, you just have to lose yourself in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just as I remembered.","review":"Saw this movie years back and after seeing the new version, I missed this one. Although corny, it includes a lot more mythology and has a more interesting plot. Had to include this to my blu-ray collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crappy transfers SUCK!","review":"This is the same issue I have with one of my favorite guilty pleasures...DEATH BECOMES HER. It's pretty sad when your VHS looks better than the DVD.

I received this movie just in the nick of time! Great job!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Movie, But It Doesn't Have The Story Straight","review":"The movie Clash of the Titans was wonderful but imaginative.I liked the movie very much even though some of the movie wasn't what the Greeks believed.For instance Perseus didn't meet Andromeda until after he cut off Medusa's head, and the whole purpose of cutting off Medusa's head was because the king of Seriphus told him to.The Titans were not even monsters they're gods that were put into Tarturus by Zeus."},{"rating":"1","title":"What do you consider a keepcase?","review":"I am curious of what is called a keepcase. I received this movie in a regular plastic case, nothing added about the movie or how it was made. Nothing to consider this a keepsake. Please advise what you call a keepcase?I love the movie. I would like to know if this will be rereleased with updates to the color, etc?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Movie, Terrible Blu-Ray","review":"I've owned Clash of the Titans on DVD for years and was excited to see it come out in blu-ray with much promise of a brilliant new transfer. What I got was half the film with such bad snow that I thought I was watching a movie on some old TV with rabbit ears. Terrible transfer. Did anyone who made this blu-ray actually watch it when they were done? And did they think that this was okay given the vast quantities of superb blu-ray movies? While I struggled through the movie and watched the extras, I thought to pop in my old DVD and found it was far superior in quality to the new blu-ray. Warner should be ashamed for attempting to foister this junk on their fans. The only reason I am keeping this is the nifty little book included with it, and the extras with Ray Harryhausen. I'm thinking about putting the DVD into the blu-ray case and being happy with that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clash of the Titans Blu-Ray (English) DTS-HD Master Audio","review":"I currently own a DVD copy of, \\"Clash of the Titans.\\" Last week I saw that the original movie was released in Blu-Ray so I purchased a copy.Video Transfer. As others have noted- HORRIBLE! So much grain that it's a distraction.Audio (English): DTS-HD Master Audio is hardly audible. French, Spanish, etc. etc. is just fine- loud and clear.Note: Tarantino's Inglourious Basterds (English) DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 PERFECT and 300 [The Complete Experience] (English) Dolby TrueHD 5.1 Audio PERFECT.Gear: (Blu-Ray:) Pioneer BDP-51FD, to (HDMI:) Audioquest HDMI-1, to (Processor:) Pioneer VSX23TXHAll firmware is up to date.Verdict: If you still have the original DVD keep it. This Blu-Ray copy of Clash of the Titans is not worth the step up. In fact, it's a step down. If you've never owned the movie, it's a very good story. Just do not expect much from this Blu-Ray copy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hi def ?????","review":"I love the old Ray Harryhausen films but that's not what I'm going to talk about. I re-bought Jason and the Argonauts as well as this one on blu-ray and I'm quite dissapointed. Both don't look any better than my standard def. I mean I have older films than this on blu-ray that look so sharp and clear. A waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blast from the past.","review":"I couldn't believe that I didn't already have this one in my collection.

Ray Harryhausen at his best!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Blu ray quality I've ever seen !!!","review":"First of all I know I should do it more but I very, very rarely leave reviews. (I know I should to help others)However when I watched this movie I had to!! I saw this movie at the theater. Had it on VHS. Have it on DVD. I love the movie!Wish I hadn't spent the money to buy it on Blu ray though! The quality is so \\"POOR\\" I can't believe they would release something like this!I have over 1200 DVD's and almost 700 HD/Blu ray movies. This is by far the \\"WORST\\" quality of all based on what it's supposed to be!If you own the DVD and are thinking about buying this blu-ray, do yourself a favor and don't! The picture on your DVD is probably better!This is the biggest rip off for the dollar spent (because of the blu-ray quality) of any movie I have ever bought!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Why is there no dvd for this classic film?","review":"This is one of the greatest films of my childhood, but I dont want to buy it on vhs, I want it on dvd, and its not avilable"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great mythical classic","review":"Of course it doesn't compare graphically with the new improved Clash of the Titans, but the story is still a good one. I think the characters and plot are developed more in this older version. Good to watch before you see the new one. Gives you something to compare with and if you miss some of the characters in the new one, the old version fills in the blanks."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD LEGACY IS HORRIBLE!!! DON'T BUY INTO A SCHEME!","review":"They shouldnt' get any stars for anything. I am very disappointed in DVD legacy's manner in conducting business with their customers. Not only do they fail in customer service, I also never got my dvd. There was no reimbursement, nor was there any reply in the many emails I served them to fix the problem. My dvd is still not here, it's been over a month, and I have no sympathy towards a company that does not care about customer satisfaction. Please find a worthwhile company that is professional and doesn't steal from their customers."},{"rating":"1","title":"it was ok if you are a couch potato","review":"this was a very weird plot.bad graphics.bad acting bad cast.not even close to the actual legend.other than that it was great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete Failure of a Remake","review":"This was one of my favorite movies growing up. I don't even know how they give it the same name. Artistic license is one thing, but almost all of the original plot was completely changed. Character development was absent - what a disappointment. I have been going on and on to my kids about seeing the movie - they took me for my birthday. Luckily I purchased the download and they can watch the real thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rated PG??? I DON'T THINK SO. BEWARE TEACHERS!","review":"This movie is rated PG. I previewed it the day before showing it to my 7th graders and it has female nudity--female without her top on--full view of both boobs. Thanks a lot! I can't show this to my kids in class. What the heck. I purchased it for nothing--unusuable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mythological","review":"I am neither a fan of mythology OR claymation. I was curious about this movie, because of Harry Hamlin's role. Even though it was filmed only a year before MAKING LOVE, I found he looked so much younger as Perseus than his Maguire characer in Making Love."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor resolution and sound:(","review":"Great Movie, But surprised at the quality of the Blu-Ray! One star is even too much. Also where is the sound on the movie itself? The special features and new Clash of the Titans 2010 preview has sound, but not the movie. They need to re-release this and take time doing it so we can really see Hi-Def in all it's glory. This is VHS quality, if that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Transfer to Blu-ray is HORRID!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I love this movie but the Blu-ray transfer is HORRIBLE. I'm serious, it's awful as awful can be. Some scenes are OK but others are so grainy it is embarrassing. Straight disrespectful that they let this get to the consumer. Warner Home Video should be completely ashamed of themselves for this abomination. If you can't do a good transfer just leave it alone. Just buy the regular DVD and let your Blu-ray player and HD TV upgrade the DVD. It will be so much better. Not much more to say about this. Buyer BEWARE. You will be disappointed. Not worth it AT ALL. Anyone who says the Blu-ray is good is telling a flat out LIE. Trust me. From a honest movie watcher."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clash of the Titans","review":"This movie is awesome. Let your imagination run wild, open your mind. If you are into myths and legends than this is the movie for you. This movie is an all time favorite of mine."},{"rating":"2","title":"not for the new school kids","review":"its hard to say what a child born in the last ten years will think of this film. they'll probably laugh. and realistically unless you're a film student studying stop motion techniques im not sure any adult would enjoy it either. its target audience is children of the seventies who originally saw this film in the theaters as a youth. i am within this group and i love this film. for most 80's kids Clash of the Titans was the first film to convince us that greek mythology was as cool as Indiana Jones. granted, the film took some liberties with the history and added some characters that didnt exist but it was all done with good purpose. even in the 80's the film was really aimed at kids and only Ray Harryhausen's stop motion animation drew in the adults. the story was weak and the acting was passable but visually it was breathtaking even by today's standards."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Dog is Dioskilos! Not Cerberus!","review":"I just watched this film aired on broadcast television. It had been one of my favorite films in grade school so I was glad to have caught the movie from the begining. It's a great movie to watch with your family as it has something for everyone. Sure there's a little blood and lots of people die but if you know your kids have seen worse. Or at least will eventually. ^_^There are flaws but as long as you can't take the movie seriously. Just sit back enjoy it. It's also nice to see a very prestigious cast have fun with the melodrama of their roles. fans of the Harry Potty film will enjoy looking back at Maggie Smith as the almost villainous sea goddess.(Oh and by the way, the two headed dog is named Dioskilos not Cerberus. It's funny how the credits list the special effect monsters!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Classic","review":"I grew up watching movies like these. The special effects kept me on the edge of my seat when I was a child and love watching this all over again when I got older."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christmas Present","review":"I purchased this as a present for one of my sons.

This is a movie I enjoyed when I was little and I wanted to re-live the enjoyment and couldn't wait to see that little mechanical owl! the quality was good enough for me and overall the dvd fulfilled my clash of titans fix. there were a couple of scenes that i noticed looked a little strange but i didn't mind it. Great Movie! But I think I mostly love it because of the sentimental childhood memories it brings back."},{"rating":"2","title":"What can I say?","review":"This movie is one of my all time favs. I really wish it was on DVD, but the video is great just the same!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE this movie (Especially Bobo)","review":"I think the characters in this movie are very well portrayed and very fun, I epecially like the mechanical Owl bobo, he's just SO cute!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic","review":"I remember watching this and loving it as a kid. As cheesy the animation is, it's still a fun watch. A quick note on watching it with kids though; although this is a PG movie, there is some brief nudity."},{"rating":"2","title":"From VHS to DVD","review":"After watching this movie with my Latin classes on a 26\\" TV for years, I loved the DVD projected onto a big screen. It was great for comparing the Perseus myth to this Hollywood version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Feel like 12 years old again and...","review":"Ray Harryhausen's brillant animation technic is always exciting. To watch this little masterpiece is like you are 12 years old again in a room full of monster & hero toys and all of them getting alive.Decent - even if matted it is anamorphic - picture quality and terrific surround sound are better than you remember it as in old theatre. Long live Ray!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Done","review":"If you've seen this movie before, the DVD version is very good.The video quality is great, but the audio wasn't re-mixed to 5.1.It's stereo, and sounds pretty good. Also, the bonus features are OK. An interview with Mr. Harryhausen and some blips about how the monsters were created. They could have done more. (would have been 5 stars if in 5.1)If you've never seen this movie, it's great family entertainment. It's based on Greek mythology, complete with Greek god intervention and monsters. Very little gore, if any, and brief nudity."},{"rating":"2","title":"le choc des titans","review":"This IS a great movie. I almost know Clash of the titans by heart and everytime i see it i enjoy it a lot. As it was the first movie my parents ever videotaped( with our very first video recording machine!), i've watched it many times and almost grew up with it. My favorite is and will always be the little clockwork owl making this funny little noise and turning its head around! anyway, enjoy yourself, this is an all-stars movie, and don't forget the popcorn!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE MARVELOUS MEDUSA","review":"Don't worry about the list of big name actors here...this is special effects legend Ray Harryhausen's film. This is Ray's last film and the only one in which he used assistants, but the effects are just perfect for this kind of film: the horrifying Kraken; the wondrous Pegasus; the two headed dog; Bubo, the hilarious mechanical golden owl; the evil Kalabos; the killer scorpions; and of course, the movie's showpiece: the hideous and unique Medusa, snakes and all. Harry Hamlin, Judi Bowker, Burgess Meredith, Laurence Olivier, Maggie Smith, Donald Houston, Ursula Andress...they're merely human puppets to balance out the wonderful Harryhausen creations. This is probably the last of the great stop motion animated films and fans of this ilk will eat this one up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay","review":"I was pleased to get the DVD as I have been trying to get it for teaching Greek Mythology, but I thought the actual packaging of the DVD rather poor especially for transferring to and from my class. The disc is not properly protected in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not dts audio sound track","review":"I was looking forward to getting this. When I got it it had a cool book.

These companies make me wonder....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Cute. A disappointment.","review":"As a longtime fan of Ray Harryhausen, I found this film to be a great disappointment when it first came out and to this day. Every time I see the mechanical owl, I want to throw a hammer at the TV. It is sad, because when Ray finally had enough production money to make a great film, it was laden with juvenalia. Give me even the silliest of his early films, I would take any of them over this overblown disaster. I love Ray Harryhausen, but not this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ancient History","review":"This book has a beautiful cover. With that said, this book is a history of screen printing.

When can we get the third album???"},{"rating":"2","title":"Looks to humor as a tool for healing","review":"A good book to read if you are looking for some good laughs and a healthy way to help you through the ongoing trials of life. The author uses a lot of stories she has gathered from others as examples of successful outcomes. Mostly stories of mothers going through trials brought on by their children - either in death or rebellion, even homosexuality. Although i believe the author could have used more scripture: If you are looking for encouragement, laced with some laughter, grab this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"They sound like Farquhar","review":"Farquhar is a very similar sounding band with XTC like song stylings mixed with math-prog and punk.

This is an excellent record - powerful, driving, anthemic and epic, while at the same time delicate and musically profound. The playing is extraordinarily tight and pristine, the change-ups and musical adventures are liberating, exciting, and very often surprising. Imagine if New Directions in Music, Pullman, the Sea and Cake or Tortoise were to cross paths with Fugazi or Built to Spill. No - don't bother. Just buy this records - it's that good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing compares","review":"This is a must have next to Wormhole if you followed Ed Rush's releases back in the day.

But the soundtrack actually has a few highlights.Everclear's opening track is probably my favorite cover of all time, I can't even listen to Thin Lizzy's \\"Boys Are Back In Town\\" anymore without being reminded how much better Everclear did it. But Thin Lizzy's classic \\"Breakout\\" never sounded better.\\"Cat Scratch Fever\\" by Pantera is very faithful to the original, but the growl in Phil Anselmo's voice gives it a great edge.The Donna's version of \\"Strutter\\" is upbeat and fun, but not great.The other two cover's by Marilyn Manson and Drain STH are slow and dull.I almost wish this album was all covers, because the other tracks you pretty much hear on classic rock radio everyday anyway.But I say pick up a cheap used copy, if for nothing else than Everclear's stellar contribution-think of it as a single, why not pay 5 bucks for a single and rock on!"},{"rating":"2","title":"1978 kiss rules all","review":"The Hottest Band in the world KISS fans screaming girls taking off thier bras and exposing their breats hard rock blaring as ace frhaley sings shoc me fans holwing backstage partys and four 4 young men they must see kiss this soundtrack is the best hard rock soundtrack ever and the film is a little better than this is spinal tap It rocks again and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"I love this cd.

The outer surface is gently rounded, so it has more of a profile that a completely flat ring, but it's not obtrusive.

First it is almost impossible to get the machine out of the styrofoam. It took two of us pulling for a couple of minutes. The fences are extremely hard to aline. The edges are extremely sharp on the top and scratch your wood. You have to push the wood thru the bit so hard because the top catches the wood and won't let it slide. I have noticed the spindle actually moves backward when running wood through. I am a professional carpenter who was lookin for a light machine to use on the jobsite, so I guess I will have to just keep looking. This machine also needs a variable speed or at least a couple of more speed settings. does not produce a clean cut on smaller bits."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a PIG!","review":"If you want a router table and simply can't afford better then go for this thing.

The cost; it is at least $... cheaper than the cheapest shaper that I could find on the market. 2. Portability; my garage is my workshop, and I did not want an infrequently used piece of equipment (such as a shaper) taking up critical floor space. This unit fits nicely on the shelf.Another good point is the dust collection, which worked well for me.However, the fence is junk. There is no fine tuning adjustment, and it is difficult to attach feather boards in the right places. Similarly, the fine tuning on the cutter height is clunky; it works only on the way down (not on the way up). And the hole in the table top is not big enough to handle the panel raising bit that I wanted to use; I had to buy a smaller bit.But the unit did work well enough for me to build raised panel doors for my kitchen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Delta router/shaper model 43-505","review":"I too wish I had read the reviews about this machine before I bought.

In this book the authors discuss a systems analysis aproach to instruction that treats instruction not as an end in itself, but as a process that is trying to reach a defined goal. It doesn't matter what the goal is, but the establishment of a goal is the first step. Then following their model, their set of procedures to measure the attainment of that goal you can adjust or modify the goals or procedures to achieve the best results.The model they have developed is simple to follow and has been evolving over several editions of this book. The latest edition, the sixth, incorporates all of the changes brought about through feedback from using the system."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comprehensive","review":"This text is incredibly comprehensive! ...a bit repetitive, but that's probably more indicative of the design process than the author's style."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I definetly expected more from this textbook.

I have yet to discover a recipe contained in this book that does not elicit raves from all I serve them to. We never have a cocktail party without Checkerboard Cheese and Crawfish Struedel.

These songs are incredibly written and recorded well. I was a big fan at the age of 11 when I bought these two albums from the now defunct RCA Music Club. Now I am 45 and I still like to listen to the songs. The lyrics, chord structures, melodies, and background singing along with Mr. Cassidy's voice is just plain fantastic. I really miss this music and yes, its pop gummy music, but in this day and age of Rap music and with the low-moral and anti-authorities culture that goes with it, I'll pay my money any day to listen to clean and will written music.

Why? Razor & Tie did not tamper with the sound quality, as a result, Razor & Tie discs sound just like the records you remember. I made the mistake of buying the re-masters thinking they would sound even greater; NOT!I've heard both versions using top of the line monitor speakers, and these Buddha discs have too much bass added for their own good. They also sound flat, because too much noise reduction was used, thus taking away the sparkle which sounded so good on the Razor & Tie versions. You can still find these Partridge Family albums on Razor & Tie right here on Amazon.The Partridge Family albums on Razor & Tie were the debut album, Up To Date, Sound Magazine, Shopping Bag and The Christmas album."},{"rating":"2","title":"It takes me back","review":"I loved listening to these songs that I hadn't heard in years.

Covering new applications of measurement science in Biotechnology makes for a curious mix but 'Approaches to Physical Measurments in Biotechnology ' does it in an eminently effective way. A MUST for people in both disciplines - if only to see how it should be done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even the Masters are Flawed","review":"There are some minor howlers here (what happened to the errata sheet?) but on the whole this is a wonderful book. The chapters cover not only the more esoteric, but also the more common physical measurements techniques found in Biotech. The structure is logical and for those rusty in electrical science the first section provides one of the most lucid introductions to electronics and electrical science one could hope to find. The sections are not uniform - some are longer than they might be and dwell too much on certain methods. However, this does not detract from an eminently informative book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good - Very Good!","review":"Good, parhaps, says too little about a book which is seriously flawed by a scattering of typos, and yet when these irritations are ignored is essentially an excellent piece of work.

As expected assembly took several hours. Fussing to get table parallel and square to blade proved to be an execise in futility. Nothing on the unit is straight, square or flat. The upper bar the rail rides on was concave 1/8 th inch in on either end. Unacceptable when cutting sheet stock that needs to be square. The upper rail also tilted down several degrees when attached to the side of my contractors saw, I can't imagine that being part of the design. When I made crosscuts on material results were inconsistent. Overall quality and performance was poor. If I had known it was an import I would never have bought it.

I've found out over the years that this thing won't hold it's settings for very long at all. I'd have to readjust it about once a year. And of course it's complicated enough that I would have to learn how to do it again. It usually took about a day to get it right. I always seemed to ruin something before I would get frustrated enough to tune it up again. I finally just took it off and made a sliding cutoff jig,it only took me 7 years to come to that conclusion.

Moreover, my son took incredible pride at owning a \\"big league\\" glove.After years of hard use, the glove became just a bit too worn for continued service. Without hesitation I bought him another Wilson A2000. This model is even a little nicer than the previous one, as it includes a \\"finger holder\\" in the back (something that isn't really essential but my son seems to like it)These gloves are superbly crafted with high quality leather.

The only thing is that these versions are identical to the laserdisc versions from way back when; meaning non-anamorphic widescreen and Dolby 2.0. Yeah, I know what you're thinking; that Star Wars fans should be happy with what they get, but it's inevitable that all six films will be re-released later on with the original trilogy the way it was meant to be in anamorphic widescreen and Dolby 5.1. You know it will happen, as long as there is money to be made George Lucas will milk the franchise for every cent he can.

You need to be warned about this release, however:The chief selling point for this release is that it supposedly contains the original version of the film on the bonus DVD. This is not true. It in fact contains the Laserdisc version of the film made in 1993 on DVD and is not a dedicated DVD transfer of the original quality (if it were, it would most likely be released in the anamorphic DVD format).The only people who should buy this DVD are those who don't mind wasting money and those who either don't care about the original trilogy or want to support the original trilogy even knowing the details of this obviously substandard DVD release."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lucas Does It Again","review":"I'm going to make it plain and simple if you do not have the trilogy and want it buy these discs because you will get the same movies that come in the box set plus get the original versions for free. However if you own the earlier DVD box set do not bother waisting your money on these low resolution bad audio transfer original films. Lucas is at his tricks again getting more bucks out of Star Wars fans while holding out on us. I work in technology and I know that the transfer of these original films is low and was done on purpose. Could have been much better. True Star Wars fans just wait out the time because the originals will be released again when Lucas teams with Sony and Blue Ray and helps them in their push against HD DVD for the future of DVD viewing. As he has proven in the past George wants to get all out of us that he can so this current release is nothing but a teaser for what is to come in the next couple of years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Raping the original format...","review":"I understand that the original trilogy was not on par with Lucas' vision, but does that mean he has to ruin what they DID become to so many people?It's fine that he's redone and patched up some of the sloppy FX and sounds from the originals...but why has he denied us the originals on DVD, untouched and glorious?Empire Strikes Back is my favorite of all the movies, but I cannot truly enjoy them with the newly added material. It's the same thing with a song.Take a song. It becomes a hit. Remix that song. Is it still a hit?Blah. I'm just so very disappointed with all this.

Visually stunning and full of moving characterisation this is Star Wars taking itself seriously and the result is head and shoulders above not only other science fiction, but all film.

I made a big mistake yesterday when I dropped sixty plus on what I suspected might be trash. Video quality is horrible. Gritty and grainy with horizontal lines in places, vertical in others. Don't be like me and jump at the chance to get these. Let them rot on the shelves. I was a believer that these couldn't possibly be as bad as everyone said. Now I must admit that I was wrong.

Vader was Luke's father? Han was captured. The rebels were in disarray. I thought about the title of the film; The Empire Strikes Back. They sure did, didn't they?

The Best part I would say was the battle at Hoth. I was kind of bored during the part of Yoda and stuff, but with Han Solo and the rest, I had a blast!The last battle is amazing as well, and how could Luke survive with his hand cut off!!!!!!!

The DVDs of the theatrical cuts are transfered from 13 year old Laserdisc masters and not even getting the industry standard widescreen anamorphic treatment.

But they didn't, and by not doing so they lost their chance to shut up the millions of fans who have been clamouring for the original versions for years, not to mention all the Lucas bashers.Personally, I've always found the ESB special edition to have the least disruptive edits. I like the enhanced Cloud City, the redone Emperor scene fits continuity, and the added Wampa shots are over before you even begin to care about them.

This means that you not only get letter boxing top and bottom but also right and left. So if you've still got an old 4:3 ratio TV this will be OK (and thats all), but for those of us with widescreen TV's this means you either have to watch a tiny 4:3 image or use your TV's zoom facility to get the original 2.35:1 aspect ratio. However if you do this you are reducing quality, and as many other reviewers have pointed out this isn't the greatest transfer anyway.If you're happy with the digitally enhanced anamorphic version then go ahead and buy. However, if like me you want the original untouched movie as released at the cinema forget it.

It's amazing to watch the special effects from 1980, which are as wonderful today as they were when they were first produced. The settings are fabulous, from the ice planet to the Death Star to the creature whom Han accidentally flies into.

I remember well, visiting my family (south Asia) as a 14 year old and finding Empire at the local video store. How could it be - it's not released yet! That's when I discovered the wonderful world of black market video. The video that I rented was VHS and it was wide screen!!! In 1984, a widescreen version of Empire.Over the years, Lucas has managed to release and re-release various versions of the same film.Don't buy any more until you see this version of episode 4, 5 or 6:High DefinitionAnamorphic wide screenDolby Digital 5.1 or any variation 6.1, 7.1, DTS, etc.Fully restored 70mm PrintOf course THX transfersBorrow this from a friend..."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's been said a hundred times...","review":"...but I'll say it again.

Hmmm, Mr. Lucas? HMMMMM????For films that have grossed nearly $600-$700 million EACH, I would think that you could cough up a $1 million or $2 to give what we, the consumers, are demanding.I don't wish to hear any more reviewers calling us out as \\"whiners.\\" Yes, it's George's film. But it's OUR decision whether to buy it or not.Count me as one person who will not buy it.PS - George, have you taken the continuity error out of your Special Edition Empire Strikes Back yet?

The way George Lucas is going, we will probably see four or five more versions of Star Wars movies before he finally comes out with the Star Wars movies on HD DVD or Blue Ray DVD format.

He doesn't realize the technical inadequacies of the second disc with the Original Trilogy that is a direct laserdisc master transfer to DVD with NO Dolby 5.1 sound and is NON-ANAMORPHIC which means that when you buy a widescreen HDTV it will be letterboxed AND pillar-boxed so you will lose 33% of the picture. Believe us when we say that if you aren't whining about it now, you will be then. Totally unacceptable from Lucas considering his company has a reputation for being the industry standard for theatrical quality and sound.

The prequel movies were awful, the only thing worth mentioning was the Clone Wars cartoon. The original classics should have remained that way instead of having their corpses constantly harassed by a child-king and his meddlesome ways. The legacy that was Star Wars is dead to me, finally throwing a bone such as this is only an insult. The irony is that George Lucas is the worst thing that ever happened to Star Wars."},{"rating":"1","title":"An apology from George Lucas","review":"Greetings fellow fans,First, I would like to apologize for the miscommunication regarding the inclusion of the original theatrical films on these DVDs. Seems somebody at LucasFilm jumped the gun and decided to release these as bonus material. I want to assure you that I had NO INTENTION WHATSOEVER to make these versions publicly available again. Honest. Also, I would like to apologize for the Special Editions but see, my ex-wife Marcia was taking me to the cleaners so I had to make some changes for legal reasons so I wouldn't have to divvy up half the Ranch just to get her off my back. That is the reason why I will never let the original films out of the vault again. I swear.Oh, one other thing, I have just built a new complex for ILM at the Presidio and I just got the bill and it seems I'm a little short on cash so if you could all be so kind and buy these cheapo DVDs for me just one more time, I'd really appreciate it!MTFBWY!"},{"rating":"1","title":"nonsensical","review":"with all of these negative reviews, the continuous onslaught of george's biggest fans constantly BEGGING for the unaltered versions it is a true mystery as to why george is either so incompetent or just unashamedly uncaring. you can't win george - cannot you realize that you can't convert us into liking your awful \\"enhancements\\". honestly can't wait till you're dead, hopefully then the originals will be released (god knows they'd sell).

It looks like some kind of school project or something. Question 1: Why is Vader glowing purple on the cover? I do not recall any purple glow around Vader in the movies, or did George add a purple glow in this latest release? Oh yes of course it was always in Lucas' original intent to have Vader glow purple! Nothing suprises me anymore with this guy. Will this be the only DVD release of the original trilogy? Who knows and better yet who cares. Until people stop caring George da Thief will keep on releasing DVDs over and over again.P.S. Apparently the picture of Han Solo on the cover is actually from \\"A New Hope\\" so George can't even get that right or was it always in his original intention for Han to wear that vest in Empire?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bait and Switch!","review":"Lucasfilm is marketing this trilogy release on the inclusion of the unaltered versions of the films when in fact this is a shoddy laserdisc transfer on a bonus disc and the buyer is forced to purchase, yet again, the 2004 versions also.

Do not get too excited when you pop this DVD into your player to watch on a widescreen TV. The 1980 version will appear as a tiny, low-resolution image. It is a non-anamorphic transfer (which in 2006 is NOT an industry standard), so it is NOT enhanced for 16x9 viewing.

I have watched all three versions of the original theatrical presentations on disc 2 of each disc. My first surprising reaction upon seeing it again for the first time after all these years was the image quality. I was surprised, yet pleasantly. It was much better than I was anticipating from a 1993 master. However, there are drawbacks. There are tons of grain, tons of dirt, at times a shaky image. It seemed to me that due to the excessive grain, the playback wasnt a smooth presentation. As a consequence, at times, the playback appeared to take on a kind of mesmerizing slow motion effect. It's subtle, but its there. It didnt take away from my enjoyment though. I was taken back to my childhood again for 6 hours and that was what counted for me. These discs will be played many times in the future. So, enjoy!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ancient Video Transfer = NO SALE!","review":"The original versions being offered on a \\"bonus\\" disc is insulting.

It's also insulting for people who have already purchased the special editions in 2004/2005 to be asked to re-buy them at a higher cost to receive these \\"bonus\\" discs of a classic film in a less than pristine form. LFL needs at a minimum make a new transfer or the original trilogy. Release this on dvd and then later on hd dvd or blu ray. If that it done, I don't have a problem with buying them again.

I have rarely heard such an overproduced album. O. Lover is especially eggregious. The opera singer is really a nauseating addition. What's especially tragic is that you can usually hear a good song underneath all the excessive polish and pomp. Mraz's first album was a pop masterpiece, even with the justified criticisms of the juvenile humor. This one has been butchered.

He is not however a John Mayer. John Mayer creates memorable songs and he can back it up with his guitar. Mraz's first album had the memorable songs eventhough he's nowhere close to mayer in guitar department.

If it ain't broke don't fix it with s@#$."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I really enjoyed Jason Mraz's first CD as well as mp3's of his live performances that I heard. I do feel, however, that his second album is very much a tremendous letdown.As others have pointed out, the main problem here is that Jason Mraz spends too much of the album boasting about his supposed prowess as a musician (i.e. dubbing himself \\"the wizard of oohs and falalas\\" in \\"Wordplay.\\") Not only is this incredibly annoying, but it makes Mr. Mraz come off as incredibly shallow.The shallowness factor isn't helped by the fact that the album is so incredibly overproduced, either. One of Mraz's greatest strengths is his voice, and it's painfully overshadowed by the slick production here.In conclusion, I think that Jason Mraz has the tools to become quite an artist. I just hope that this sophomore slump is just that - a slump, and that Mr. Mraz will return to form for his next album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Bad","review":"Its such a shame that an artist with as much talent and promise as Jason Mraz put out such a terrible follow up album. I have been listening to and following the career of Mraz far before the release of Waiting for my Rocket, and Mr. Az belongs alongside Hansen albums at the pawn shops waiting for some poor schmuck to buy. The songs fall short of anything substantive and the music is over produced under thought schlock for those girls who used to rock out to New Kids on the Block in their headphones. Overall I wish that I could give zero stars for the utter disappointment and waste of talent, I really hope that he can do a follow up album that showcases his talents and true ability."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb CD, full of energy!!!","review":"This is Jason's second studio album, after Waiting for My Rocket to Come (check it out! it's also excellent!). The twelve tracks on MR. A-Z are varied in style, including hard rock (Please Don't Tell Her), his pop-y style reminiscent of his first single, The Remedy (Wordplay), and a blend of jazz, hip hop, and more.If you can appreciate this album for nothing else, you must admit that Jason has the most beautiful, strong, clear voice you will ever hear. His power and clarity make every song a gem. His lyrics are, once again, witty and sweet (some people think he's overly cocky, but I think that's part of his appeal... and that's what the rooster was for on his first album, anyway --> inside joke for Mraz fans bwahaha).This album is so beautiful and fabulous and you should definitely check it out!!

Waiting For My Rocket to Come, Jason's debut album, spent many weeks in my cd player and when I discovered Live At Java Joe's (by far Jason's best cd) I declared myself and avid Jason fan and was counting down to the release of Mr A-Z..So much so that we drove 35 minutes down the beach on vacation to get it the day it came out. This trip, however, turned out to be quite a disappointment. Mr A-Z is completely different from the mellow, mainly acoustic stylings of Jason and encompasses many genres which Jason just doesn't work with. His voice is still amazing, and a few of the songs are highly addictive (ie. Wordplay) but the CD as a whole, if you like Jason and his style, in my opinion, bombs."},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty good","review":"not as great as last but good~liked the tongue twisters in last album better!this is more ballads but OK"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sophomore disappointment","review":"I see there are a lot of huge Mraz fans out there.

About 90% of the songs are terrific, and the other 10% are good. Well worth the money. His voice is more polished and better sounding than his first album. It has a smooth and relaxing tone to it. 2 songs would be classified as pop in nature, but they are great lyrically. Those would be wordplay and the geek in the pink. The others are great change of pace songs and really showcase Jason Mraz's range of talent.

He has been the central character throughout the series and to remove him is absolutely absurd. It would have been different if he retired or quit on his own, but he was fired and a general took his place. Throughout the book I hoped that Hood would regain his job, or that the tyrant general would get fired. At the end I was thoroughly dissapointed to find that Bob Herbert, another main character, was fired. I felt as though the enemy had won for the first time in this series.

Of the ten or so that we have had, it is easily the best. I bought one three years ago and the other this year. It is somewhat expensive -- Often available around $80 (Amazon's prices change considerably, sometimes two prices on the site). The feeder is good for birds up to cardinal/blue jay size. Doves are too big/heavy. We used to have cage feeders; unfortunately if the cage mesh was big enough to allow cardinals to get through, some squirrels could also make it -- Then, often enough, the squirrel would get inside the cage. A squirrel will sometimes sit on top of the Yankee feeder, but will not be able to reach the seeds. We feed sunflower seeds; I believe that there is less waste. With seed mixes, some birds will reject the non-sunflower seeds --- Some smaller birds prefer thistle seeds and we have a thistle feeder as well; however, some squirrels are able to chew them open."},{"rating":"2","title":"1st truly squirrel proof feeder I've found","review":"I have bought so many feeders that claimed to be \\"squirrel proof\\" it's not funny.

One reviewer stated that it won't hold mourning doves, bluejays etc. They must come XXXL in his state, because here in Connecticut I have mourning doves, cardinals, and bluejays on the feeder constantly. I only use sunflower seed in the feeder - it has never clogged and I don't find it falls out easily. I've never had a problem with rain getting in or clumping the seed.

This time I also bought the \\"Aspects 182 Super Dome\\" its 18 x 18 x 6 inches, fairly flat on the top which allows them to reach over, then let go to try and go under but when they let go it flips them in the air. They can't even get to the feeder and it is hanging off the deck railing. The feeder is pricey, but worth it!

I could have shipped the unit back for repair or replacement, but who needs the hassle? My advice: stick with a feeder with no moving parts that also does not require charging.

Further investigation revealed that there was so much squirrel fur jammed into the device that it stopped turning. I spent about an hour ripping the fur out. One large piece of fur had some flesh attached!So not only does this product spin off the squirrels, it occasionally demands they pay a toll in fur as well. We haven't had that problem since.Once all your local squirrels are trained to avoid this product (takes a few months or so, as I recall), they'll never even consider trying it again. I haven't seen a squirrel try to use ours for several years.The battery charge seems to last about a year or so with no squirrel action.

Prior to buying this feeder, the squirrels would pillage my bird feeder like the Visigoths sacking Rome. They could literally empty it out in two days. Now I refill the feeder weekly, and the bulk of the birdseed goes to feeding birds, not arboreal rodents.But the real reason to like this feeder is the comedic value. For all their destructive cleverness, squirrels are surprisingly slow learners, and get flung off again and again.

After only a day, they had figured out that if a brave volunteer hangs upside-down from the top of the feeder, and quickly presses and releases the perch, the perch will rotate and the resulting impulse to the feeder will fling seed everywhere. I'm pretty sure another reviewer had observed this behavior too. The only way to counter this countermeasure would be to find some way of suspending the feeder so that the squirrel can't approach it from the top ...

Sure, it protects from the squirrels but it makes a huge mess on the deck. The feeding holes are really big and I have watched as the birds eat. The bird seed just flows out the hole to the ground and gets in every flowerbed and crack in the deck. It wastes the seed because it is then mixed with dirt, leaves and hulls and we really can't put all that back in the feeder. I hate it. We have now bought a seed catcher to attach under the feeder. I hope that works. It will take days to get all that scattered seed swept up to say nothing of the time spent pulling out the seedlings from my flowerbeds.

Only negative is that you need to make sure the feeder is anchored in a stationary position. When the squirrel is spinning the feeder is making an arc and the seed falls out very rapidly.

Now I have to fill the feeder with a small amount on a daily basis just to conserve feed and be able to feed some birds before it is emptied (usually within a few hours of being filled no matter what time of day). I will try the Brome Squirrel Buster next but it also appeared to have mixed success."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yankee Flipper vs Tenacious Squirrels","review":"I have had a Yankee Flipper for about six years now. It has performed as promised and we have had a lot of fun watching the squirrels getting flung from it. But, over several generations, the squirrels have learned to beat it. I used to charge the batteries about once every six months, but now I need to charge them weekly (I replace them regularly). One squirrel hits it over and over again until the batteries get weak enough for him to use his feet to keep it from spinning. He grips the perch ring with one foot and braces his other against a feeder hole. Then he has a nice lunch until his legs get tired. This weakens the batteries even faster. The Yankee Flipper has won many of the battles, but it appears that the squirrels are winning the war."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wastes bird seed","review":"Does this bird feeder twirl squirrels? Yes it does. However, its design wastes more bird seed than my prior bird feeders because there is no platform for the seed to fall onto. Therefore it all falls on the ground. I have to fill this feeder once a week. That is a LOT of seed. Most of the seed falls on the ground and gets eaten by.....yes, you guessed it, the squirrels.Oh, and by the way, I tried the other Droll Yankees bird feeder that has a seed platform, but the squirrels found a way to hang on to the platform and shovel seed onto the ground.So I am back to seed-on-ground zero.Don't pay the big bucks to buy this bird feeder. It's really a powered, twirling squirrel feeder."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yes, it's squirrel-proof, but...","review":"...it's not dove-proof. Doves eat as much as squirrels do, and the ones around my house have learned how to alight on the perch without setting it off. So, regretfully, I'll be selling my Yankee Flipper in the classifieds soon, and replacing it with something more pressure sensitive. The feeder is as sturdy and attractive as advertised, I must stress, and it didn't take long for squirrels to give up trying to get into it.

Transporting them can be a pain, but after catching and relocating about eight squirrels I notice few or no visits from squirrels to my feeders for a couple of months. Then I do it all over again. Relocation reduces the breeder population and I can say that I still have the occasional squirrel, but it is not a problem.

The squirrels may not be able to eat the seed out of the bird feeder but since it dumps most seed onto the ground they end up feasting anyway.

On the contrary our stresses are constantly trickling if not constantly full-on. This eventually throws our whole body into disarray.

Ben Affleck isn't a good actor. Uma should get on her hands and knees and thank Tarantino for the best roles by far that she'll ever have. John Woo is overrated because you can't do stupid junk and be considered a great filmmaker. I hope more Philip K.

Big names in front of and behind the camera, a big budget and a terrific premise, but the script sucks, Ben Affleck is a weak actor at the best of times, and Uma Thurman wasn't given enough to work with. At the end, I couldn't help be feel just a bit resentful that the time spent watching could have been spent doing so many other (less painful) things.

It jumped around way too much and the premise was just weird!!! The trailers really have a way of sucking you into \\"wanting to like a film\\" and then when you get there to watch them...they suck...some of them. This was not a film that I could stand to watch all the way through...I turned it off!!!!

So the transportation vehicles were over at the bowling alley.Anyone who compares Ben with Cary Grant doesn't have a clue about talent, style, stage presence and sex appeal. Ben has zilch. I also don't know whats up with Uma; she's bland, not pretty and was only good in The Truth About Cats and Dogs. She's a dog! The scene where she jumps off a moving motorcycle while be shot at, to go back and pick up the envelope she dropped was so ridiculous. A five year old could have shot and killed her on the spot. There were so many holes in this plot, they should have name it \\"Swiss Cheese\\"! B-O-R-I-N-G.

Once he figures that out, the companies who hire him erase his memory so that he cannot sell or trade that information to other companies. After a 3 year project, he is supposed to get a big paycheck, but when he goes to pick it up he finds an envelope with several ordinary items. For the first hour of this film I was really enjoying myself, I recall thinking that Hollywood had done it right. The story was pretty original and intriguing, it kept me guessing. I think they fired the writing team as they neared the end of the story, and left the special effects and action guys to fill it in. At the end we are forced to endure typical Hollywood-style explosions and fights. I was very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete fiasco.","review":"Another butchered Philip K Dick story turned into a big budget chase action movie with a hole-fille plot to keep adolescent audiences awake. No thinking is required when watching this movie.The essence of Mr. Dick's story about the nature of humanity and memory has been stripped and replaced by Hollywood empty glossy action scenes.Wooden acting by Ben Affleck, and Mr. Woo's cheesy signature dove shots makes this movie a complete fiasco, enough to make any true Philip K. Dick fan sick.Avoid if your IQ has triple digits."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cliche - check","review":"Wildly implausible and surprisingly boring.

About the only good thing is, it doesn't have Tom Cruise in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alright","review":"This movie reminds me of Independence Day with Will Smith.In this movie Ben Affleck tries to be like some action camera that can fight and win the girl; well, that did not fit him at all.Movies about the future are so played, every director seems to have tried it one way or the other."},{"rating":"2","title":"What's in your wallet?","review":"This is an excellent sci-fi film. A young man (Affleck) has his memory wiped after every job, but his paycheck more than makes up for all the lost time. But he becomes confused when he wakes up from the latest memory wipe and finds that he has forfeited his paycheck. He has to go back to a time he can't remember to find out what happened to his paycheck and how a mysterious woman (Thurman) fits into his past with only twenty items he mailed to himself to help him."},{"rating":"1","title":"PAYCHECK","review":"I was very dissapointed with this movie for one reason the principal actors and director are not suited to this type of film.Despite Ben Affleck's goofy reputation, he is a good actor; given the right type of role. As an action hero he is a total no-no, he just seems bemused for nearly two hours. He should stick with films like Dogma or Chasing Amy; where he can show his cynical side. As for Uma Thurman (outstanding in Kill Bill) she is just plain annoying as a spunky side kick. The real dissapointment is John Woo, making a light-weight action movie of MCG Proportions. Fair enough he certainly can't make another 'Hard Boiled' for the American market but he still made 'Face Off' and 'Windtalkers'. A diet coke action movie through and through!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting idea but......","review":"This is the sort of movie you could watch on a bus or a plane, or in a hotel room if you were desperate for something to watch. A good time filler and mildly entertaining, but not much else. The story idea is interesting enough but the movie itself doesn't really have staying power. 5 minutes after you've watched it you struggle to remember what the movie was all about. I must confess my main interest in seeing it was for the motorcycle chase, that didn't disappoint me, although the sound effects for the bike sounded a bit fake.But don't get me wrong, I wasn't disappointed in the movie. But that's because I didn't really expect too much out of it to begin with. And neither should anybody else who wants to see this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT IS THIS","review":"Am I the only one who doesn't get the plot of this movie its got to be the worst ever written.

Then Uma comes into the movie and she is like\\"I know you\\"and he says \\"no you doen't\\" so she says \\"I know your favorite team is the Red Sox\\"(The movie takes place in Boston) and freaks out and doesn't know how she knows his favorite team is the Red Sox, so he says \\"lets go get my paycheck\\".

Ben Affleck is his usual bland and boring self so he scores at least on consistency.But the real culprit here is John Woo. He takes a fascinating sci-fi story from Philip K. Dick, and squanders the possibilities with his usual overdose of wannabe, \\"look-ma-I'm-cool\\" gimmicks and completely pointless fight scenes. How many times can the hero be toe to toe with a villain, each with a gun in the other's face and then just walk away?Wait till you hear what was done to the plot. Our hero determines that knowing the future robs mankind of hope and will ultimately bring destruction and ruin. Yet in the end he inexplicably decides to fix the machine before he destroys it.

Stupid story full of gaping plot holes, wretched flat performances from both lead actors, and tedious stunts. It's time to admit that Woo is simply a bad director, unable to capture any of the qualities that made him good ten years ago. He's still into the sappy symbolism (a flying white dove! Means freedom!), stupidly big explosions, and puts not one but TWO references to the famous point-blank-guns-pointed-at-each-other pose from the Killers.The one redeeming thing is that Woo *didn't* use the alternate ending that's one of the special features on this DVD: a gut-churningly bad scene that has Ben recovering a diamond ring and proposing to Uma as she flutters her hands with joy."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's with Uma's hair?","review":"Paycheck is utterly atrocious. Please, please don't waste your hard earned money on this pathetic excuse for a movie. It's an INSULT to people's intelligence. Acting in this movie must have been hardly any work at all! No one had any complicated or lengthy lines to learn that's for sure!The most appalling part of this movie however is (the normally good looking) Uma Thurman's ghastly appearance, especially her hair; did anyone notice how dry, brittle, knotty and yucky it looks? Her face looks so weird. Her skin is so greasy and blotchy like she's having an allergic reaction to something (perhaps to Ben's acting or the claptrap script?). It makes me so annoyed that Bennifer has gotten a cool few million in his account for this tripe. Hey Ben! I hope you spend some of it on some acting lessons or shampoo and deep conditioner for Uma!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull, Duller, Dullest","review":"Formula: take an OK story snippet that involves enough sci-fi buzzing sounds and light effects, give it to John Woo with a huge production budget, add Ben Affleck, Uma Thurman, Aaron Eckhart, Paul Giamatti, Colm Feore, Michael C. Hall (each of whom is far superior to the tacky script and tired body shenanigans), add a very loud and noisy score by Paul Horn, James McKee Smith, John Powell and John Ashton Thomas, and mix it with tired contrived gimmicks that perhaps at one point in time were meant to defy belief, and voila! You have PAYCHECK.One wonders when Hollywood will realize that the market for this particular clone of movie is saturated and move on to something else. Or perhaps it is viewing this turkey immediately after viewing the brilliant and budget-limited film \\"11:14\\" that points out all of its weak points. But that is being kind.

An embarrassment for all involved. Why did Uma agree to do this? She's far better than this material, but she can't save a bad script.Was this based on a Phillip Dick story? If so, they must have mangled it somehow. But the premise of the movie is self-contradictory. The movie is partly based on the idea that the future is fixed and cannot be changed, and partly based on the idea that the future can be changed. Mutually contradictory premises. If the unfolding of the plot had not been so mindless, this small difficulty could be forgiven.Basically, this movie is for people who are entertained merely by things moving loud and fast, and people hitting and shooting at other people.

The acting is nothing special, even from Uma Thurman, who I normally really like. The fight scenes are very choreographed, with little realistic reaction from the fighters, but not as bad as \`Daredevil'.But the biggest problem I had was how stupid the bad guys were. I mean, talk about morons. Not only does one set try to follow Affleck's character through a small pipe -- in a car -- which they obviously can't fit through (and promptly spectacularly blowing up), but the Chief Bad Guy has poor deductive skills when it comes to predicting what Affleck's character is going to do.It wasn't a total waste of time, but it wasn't something I would have watched if I had something else to do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can I buy the memory-erasing technology?","review":"While the main character of this movie gave up 3 years worth of memories in exchange for $90MM, I am willing to give up the 2 hours worth of memory I consumed watching it for absolutely nothing.

Even the McGuffin, which should be super cool, is just blah and unexciting. The film makes no sense, includes plot holes aplenty, and doesn't have enough energy or fun to compensate.

The movie itself is a jumble of other, better-done movies such as Total Recall, T2: Judgment Day, Charade, Mirage and even North By Northwest. Also, as another reviewer pointed out, either the future can be changed or it can't, and the movie wants to have it both ways. Even John Woo, whose direction I usually enjoy, wasn't in top form.

Uma Thurman's dialogue was so contrived and wooden - it was almost painful to listen to it.

It's like they wrote this for 10 year olds...\\"I must destroy that machine\\"...Ben says. Are you kidding? What a joke.

The album has more depth and emotion than the last two albums. Listeners get a look into some of the hardships that she has had to endure and we appreciate her all the more for it.

She has certainly paid her dues and made a mark in the female rap game.

As I get dressed to head out tonite I'm listening to 'Na Na Be Like' and 'Tables Will Turn' and these tracks are still going hard in 2011. I am a true fan of Foxy's music, and I wish her nothing but peace and blessings in her personal life. If she never makes another official album again, I am still grateful and thankful that she shared her talents with us through this one.~ Lex ~"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Female Rap Album To Date!","review":"This is a wonderful album coming from Miss Foxy Brown herself. She is by far one of the best in the game. She could go toe to toe with any male in this rap game. Broken Silence is a very deep album filled with class and exceptional lyrics. She cannot be touched. People may say Eve is on top, Kim is the best, Trina is the nastiest, and that Missy is the Queen. People may feel that way, but Foxy is the chosen one. Foxy keep your head up and do not let the haters distract you because you have millions of loyal fans who love you dearly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pac's Female Counterpart","review":"Unlike many of her successors, Brown does actually have something \\"real and deep,\\" to rap about:\\"dear mommy,i apologize, i know it's because of me that your life is traumatized and it's cause of me that at times you wanna die, but you was always there when your little na na cried and when the media said foxy's ill, you was there when this fame almost got me killed, when i was in the hospital, could not be still, only you knew the reasons why i popped these pills...\\" giving light and hope to anybody in dire posistions, that the world is not against them...BROWN HAS LYRICALLY SURPASSED HER FELLOW HIP-HOP DIVAS AND MANY OF THE MEN IN THE INDUSTRY"},{"rating":"2","title":"Welcome back Foxy!","review":"I love this album! It comes mighty damn close to her 1st allbum Ill Na Na! Her best album by far. But Broken Silence comes mighty damn close to it. It's not to hear her ruff voice back & not the one she had in Chyna Doll. I couldnt tell if it was foxy I was listenng to or Lil' Kim. I really love Broken Silence. She can really do some reggae. BK Anthem, Letter, Hood Scriptures, & 730 are the BOMB! Look out Eve & K.I.M., Fox Boogie is claiming her spot back. Go get them Bonnie!

THE BEATS AND THE LYRICS IS HOT."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS FOX IS HOT TO TROT","review":"Foxy has more than redeemed herself with this new album. It helps that we have somewhat witnessed some of the issues and events that she has touched upon on this CD, that has plagued Ms. Brown for the last 2-3 years. With that in mind, her lyrics becomes more believable. Her Jamaican accent has improved dramatically, by the way. Once you get over that issue, whether she is real or not, you could move on to the hard-knocking beats produced by her brothers Gavin and Anton. Her guest artists does not disappoint with their tight contributions. The entire Ill Na Na collaboration produced a \\"heavy rotation\\" CD for the summer with everything from hip-hop, rap, to reggae. Being from Brooklyn myself, I couldn't be more proud!

The album is a classic because, as someone already mentioned, it is one of those cds in which you don't have to skip songs. offcourse the reggea influnced songs are off da chain (oh yeah, run dem, tables will turn, saddest day). and the emotional songs give a lil insight into her troubles (broken silence, letter, saddest). songs like 7:30, hood scriptures, candy and nana be like still lets you know, i'm still foxy (controversial, wild and crazy as ever). the album is really dope. it shows her strengths very well. especially since she has more industry beef than anybody, perhaps with the exception of eminem. with such odds against her, yet she still lays down a banger i must say that foxy is the baddest Bee hip hop has seen in a long time. she's like the courtney love, or angelina jolie of rap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Foxy's Best Album Yet","review":"I think Foxy's album \\"Broken Silence\\"is the best one she made yet.

Its worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Foxy Has Truly Broken The Silence","review":"I've always loved Foxy Brown. And I do call myself a true fan. She's been a major inspiration to me and she's overcome so much drama that is proved off her come-back album, 'Broken Silence'. I truly believe that this is her best album yet. A lot of the songs struck cords with me because she and I have certain things in common. And the deepest songs on here are: The Letter, which is backed up vocally by the very talented Ron Isley, Fallin', who's hook is performed by Young Gavin, Saddest Day, which discusses her former engagement to Kurupt, and of course the title track, Broken Silence which deals with her bouts of depression and inner termoil. It's a terrific Rap Album and I hope that those who dissed her before will take a new ear to her music. She's back everyone, just like I always had faith she would be...peace!"},{"rating":"2","title":"luv it so much gotta get it again","review":"I love this album so much, I wore it out in 2001 and up until it was stolen.

I decided to give Foxy Brown a listen and was not surprised! You would think after album flops and years of depression (as she describes), she would have grown up. But she is as unintelligent as she was when she first came out. I think alot of artist are selling themselves out just to make a quick buck. I can careless whether Foxy Brown retires or not, because she is a very unimportant person in hip hop. I suggest that Foxy picks up a book, and read to higher her vocabulary. Please, retire and leave hip hop. You are a disgrace! People, pick up some Bahamadia. She has made an E.P. 1 1/2 years ago that is far more better than what most of these so-called \\"female m.c.'s\\". She will be one of the best female \\"emcee's\\".

It's raw, it's real, it's Hip Hop at its best. If you're like me you hate spending dough on an album only to find one or two decent tracks. Well, you won't have that problem here, Foxy delivers on every single track. This is one of the most slept on albums ever. I think the people who handled this release messed up big time!!! A lack of proper promotion caused this album to stall early after its release; which is unfortunate for those who didn't get a chance to hear it. If you are a true hip hop or rap music fan, you'll keep this album in heavy rotation. If you're not, you'll play it a lot too; it's just that good! It's worth every cent! I just purchased my second copy cause I literally played my old one to death. COP THIS DISC!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Broken Silence a winner..","review":"Foxy's Broken Silence is a refreshing follow up from her sophmore album, Chyna Doll. Her use of reggae is clever and entertaining, and i think she held her own lyrically as well. Of course, she's still playing the ... card, but we all know that sex sells, thats part of Foxy Brown. Fans will not be dissapointed. I don't think she got the recognition she deserved for this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Damn Damn Damn","review":"Foxy has impressed me again.

This recording is just another release under yet another title from his 1970 Poor Heart recordings. Unfortunately, the masters of these recordings keep floating around out there and keep getting re-released in an attempt to capatilize on the Foreigner/Gramm name. Lou doesn't get any royalties for these songs, and he has frankly said that he hates the quality and performance of them as well. He'd prefer it if you DIDN'T buy these recordings, as he feels it is not representative of his talent and he'd rather not have people waste their money on them.You are much better off hunting around for his Black Sheep recordings from 74-75 if you want an excellent representation of his early pre-Foreigner career."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why would Lou Gramm want people to hear this?","review":"Lou Gramm was with a group called Blacksheep before Foreigner.

Each time he trudges up the hill he carries more and more files etc. until his little cart, rolls over from the burden into the street. Another favorite scene is the creditors coming to the door. The casting is great and the actors are very convincing. Dan wrote, directed and plays the lead character no easy feat. But, he pulls it off well.

In a book slouching in on itself with tautological non-events punctuated by silly moments of (sexual) violence, the author is the master of the obvious; he lacks any form of humanity and with it any humor. It is rare that I have wanted to recycle or burn a book, and so I regret buying Blindness in electronic form. Avoid this old buffoon's witterings on the cruelty of humanity, and in the meantime spare yourself the feeling of having your precious free time and life being pried away from you in extra slow motion.

I read it in 7 hours at a single sitting and was so impressed I started to urge everyone else I know to give it a try. The unfailing descriptions and memorable characters completely drown you in the story; you start to fear that you yourself might be struck by the white blindness at any moment but you still can't revert your eyes from the pages. Humanity in all its forms is on display here; from utter wickedness and selfishness to the example of the doctor's wife. Strongly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Grand Horror Novel... and also much more.","review":"This is perhaps one of Saramago's best books. In fact it IS a horror novel, but also much more. Behind the facade of apocalyptic turmoil, there is hope and feelings.

However I was unable to get past the first page of Blindness. The sentence structure was so irksome I couldn't conceive of reading a whole book written in that style. There were so many run-on sentences on that page I thought the use of periods had been lost in the translation. I know it's meant to lend a sense of surreal unsease, I know it's stream-of-consciousness. I just couldn't handle it.

To dislike a book by someone who has won the Nobel Prize?I just find Saramago bewilderingly obvious, unsubtle and boring to read. He also supplies the wrong details. Not the ones that are really emotional, not the ones that really matter. And if students in my writing workshops tried to write like him I would definitely try to lure them away from doing so by suggesting better models: Virginia Woolf, Kafka, Conrad, Jane Austen, J. M. Coetzee, Hemingway, John Updike, Leonard Michaels, Vladimir Nabokov, and Evelyn Waugh, since they are much better stylists. And more complex thinkers as well. So is Colette.

Maybe WAY before the middle. After they get all of these blind people together living in overcrowded and disgusting living conditions in a mental institution, it just got so boring.

I'm finally giving up. A friend who who grew up in a communist country said it was her favorite book. I don't know how this could be anyone's favorite book.

It's going to goodwill or the fireplace."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good ...","review":"Given all the rave reviews (which is partly why I read the book in the first place) I wanted to give a contrasting view. I found the style of the narative tiresome. There are not many paragraphs and you are left to work out who said what as the character's dialogues follow on from each other with little to distinguish them from each other. This you get used to. But it certainly didn't add to the reading experience. I thought there was very little humour in the book, and the sentences quite laborious. Maybe this is the fault of the translator. The idea behind the book is interesting. But I felt little really came out of it. There are glimpses of insight but this is not comprable to 1984, animal farm, or brave new world. But hey ... read it and make up your own mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay I get it there is poo everywhere","review":"This book drags quite a bit. Yes it has some great symbolism and yes ther is a deeper meaning, but seriously I got sick of hearing about how everyone is covered in poo. Worse yet, nothing really happens.

But unfortunately I already do. I regongnized each of the characters as people I encounter on a daily basis. From the weak to strong, good to evil, emotional to the resolute. I am amazed that I have never before thought about our world in such confining terms.

The author takes on huge social issues by describing a world within a world of the first victims of the blindness epidemic... not quite \\"the blind leading the blind\\" but not far from it. He explores what would happen to our humanity if we were thrown into the worst possible circumstances of filth and murder and rape. Although some of the story leaves you a bit skeptical (why wouldn't they have just...?), overall it's description is amazing. In fact, more than once, after being engrossed in the reading, I got up from bed almost surprised that I could see."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blindness is a captivating book","review":"It has been many years since I refused to sleep because I could not stop reading be, but Blindness is the type of book that has me captivated. Others here cite the novel's lack of clear punctuation and grammatical structure as a hindrance; I liken it to an intricate quilt--the more you gaze into it, the more you beauty and detail you see. Initially I thought that this would make a great film, but now realize that Hollywood would feel compelled to put a testosterone-charged male in as the lead, out to save America--and totally ignore the book's dissection of human society, its telling portrayal of human nature. All I can say is read it and try to get some sleep--truly amazing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It'll Never Put You Down","review":"I started \\"Blindness\\" because I was fasinated with the apocolyptic story; how would I feel? what would I do? Saramago's unique punctuation and story telling allow you to slip yourself easily into the story. True, some parts will be too graphic for some tastes, but it fits within the perspective that Saramago writes of the end of the world. When I was finished, my questions changed; how do I feel? what do I do? I put down this book weeks ago, but I still think about it frequently. It has not put me down."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Frightful Story","review":"A ghastly, horrifying story depicting the absolute chaos resulting from all but one person in a city going blind. As you can imagine, ALL systems broke down, people suffered terribly, deaths were frequent and gruesome. The love and caring of the one sighted person, the doctor's wife, was the only comforting thread in the story.The format and writing were just as difficult to stomach as the storyline - interminable sentences, and paragraphs, sparse and inadequate punctuation.Revolting as the scenes and events described were, I kept on reading as I had to know if there would be any reprieve for those poor souls."},{"rating":"2","title":"a few random thoughts","review":"In book 7 of Plato's Republic, Socrates uses the metaphor of the cave to illuminate the soul's journey into light, and the necessary journey back into the cave. At the end of Blindness, when the doctor's wife mistakes light for the onset of blindness, I felt a frisson of freezing breeze at the nape of my neck. We who see and do nothing - are we really any better? This book, worthy of a Nobelist, contains a chilling condemnation of our weakness. And it's not for the squeamish."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blindness","review":"Although Jose Saramago's novel, Blindness, was a difficult read, I found it to be quite enjoyable overall. The plot moved on rather slowly at times, which was not helped by the lack of grammar and punctuation, but it never ceased to hold my attention. I found the story to be quite effective, despite the translation, but there was one aspect that bothered me - the ending. For all of the challenges that this book presented in reading it, I did not find the ending satisfying enough to justify the lack of explination in the conclusion.Overall, this book overcame all of its minor downfalls, and was a very good novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scary but fun","review":"I found this book, both compelling and entertaining. It provided a real insight to how fragile and interdependent our society has become. There are many levels of caring and sharing demonstrated in this novel, a wife for her husband, perfect strangers with nothing else in common except a condition. How a group of people managed to band together and over come adversity in order to survive and prosper despite many insurmountable obstacles. I have come to appreciate Mr Saramago's use of language, I realize that he writes in another tongue and that approach does reflect strongly after translation here and other of his works. He has always been a challenging and fun read for me.You could also look at how this book worked out and ask yourself, what would you do differently."},{"rating":"2","title":"I continue to think about this book.","review":"There are so many levels on which this book makes an impact. Saramago creates a Hobbsian state into which society is plunged - brutish and cold. The stark reality is countered by the beautiful souls he creates and the thread of living events he carries them through. The story is magnificently enhanced by his prose. Once you get into the meter and the punctuation, the words draw you through the story. I can't remember the last time I read a novel that represented a new form and so well accomplished. He truly deserved the Nobel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chilling, suspenseful and engrossing","review":"I read this book in Portuguese. It's the tale of what happens when an entire country rapidly goes blind. Assuming that the translation does justice to it, it will be wonderful to read. It reminds me of Albert Camus's \\"The Plague\\" in that, although it's great literature in its own right, it could also qualify as a chilling work of quasi-science fiction. It's not for the squeamish, though, any more than \\"The Plague\\" was! I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I comment on the narrative style and imagery of the novel.","review":"\\"Blindness\\" is a fascinating novel. The premis is interesting and the plot plays out as it should, but what I find most interesting is the way in which Saramago leads the reader through the novel as if he/she were blind. The lack of character names and the non-punctuated dialogue make the narrative a bit difficult to follow, one has to grope around as if blind to keep up. And the inagery is wonderfully disgusting-smells and textures, sound. The imagery is appropriate given that the sensory experience described is from the perspective of a blind person; not much of it is visual. The novel paints a negative picture of human nature in general, but given the times this is appropriate. Definately a must read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-rated, irritating to read","review":"This was one giant metaphor, which would have been better suited to a short story, by an author obssessed by excrement (literally) and negligent of his punctuation. Concept is terrific - execution is dismal."},{"rating":"2","title":"A modern classic","review":"Saramago's Blindness is not the easiest book to read, but few great books are. There is a deliberateness in everything Saramago does, his words, his punctuation, etc. This book makes the reader confront his own \\"blindness\\" (on a much smaller scale than the characters in the book experience) and question society. Saramago gently hints at a need for social change through the experiences of his characters, however it is by no means preach-y. Blindness is reminiscent of War of the Worlds and Lord of the Flies, a general end-of-days theme. But it is definitely an original is this category. Hands down, it is the best book I've read in the past couple of years. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing","review":"I attempted to read this book to the best of my ability because the plot itself was very unique, and I was interested. However, the lack of proper grammar and no quotation marks... run-on sentences... abnormally long paragraphs... All of this turned me off, and I could not reach very far into this book. Although I am still very interested in the plot, but no rules of English writing seem to be followed, and I cannot therefore finish this book. As an English major, it drives me to distraction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different, and amazing","review":"This book is a tough read, and it is important to know that going in. Saramango uses long sentences, long paragraphs, and ignores punctuation (especially quotation marks). There were times when I had to go back and re-read passages because I completely lost who was talking.With all of the difficulty...this is probably the most amazing book I have read in a long time. The story is original. The characters are strong, vibrant, and alive. It made me think about human nature, about our society, and about how shaky civiliation really is. (akin to Lord of the Rings) I would recommend this book for anyone who wants to read something new, and different. The nobel prize Saramango won was well deserved, and if you read this book you will see why."},{"rating":"2","title":"As Good As It Gets","review":"Blindness is problably one of the best books ever written. A mesmerazing tale with profound characters; an unusual literary style used only to maximize the novel's brilliant point of view from which it is told. Comparable only to masterpieces such as \\"Lord of the Flies\\" or \\"1984\\", this novel is more complete than the first one (because it is filled with horror AND beauty), and more intruiguing than the second one (because the building suspense increseases in every chapter, without overlooking witty comments and heart breaking descriptions)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A harrowing trip into the depths","review":"Compelling reading, but sometimes so overwhelming that I had to put the book down and recover! Saramago plumbs both the depths and the heights of what it means to be human. None of the power of this novel is lost in the translation. Highly recommended, but be prepared!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a Stephen King plot by a Nobel prize-winning author","review":"A gripping, terrifying story of a contagion of blindness.

I just found it a frightfully, and frightening, good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRID WRITING STYLE","review":"I think this might have been a great book if I could have adjusted to the writing style but I gave up trying. The writer ambles on in long, never ending sentences without using quotations. It was exhausting!"},{"rating":"1","title":"a failed experiment","review":"All great artists have failed experiments. Unfortunately, this one was published ;). Not a bad novel, but in my opinion, Blindness falls far short of Saramago's other literary accomplishments. I respect him for going in different directions, but this one just never panned out for me. If you're a Saramago fan, give it a try, but if your looking for a starting point try Siege of Lisbon or the Jesus book. s."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring dialogue makes this a painful read","review":"Even if you can get past Saramango's complete lack of punctuation, you still won't be able to tell who is saying what because every character sounds exactly the same. They all talk like robots. No one has any personality, and it makes the book very dull.It could have been a great story..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thumbs Down: Save Yourself the Time","review":"I give this book one star on the basis that it qualifies as a book and because I admire the author's guts and imagination. For the most part I found this book to be long, tedious, and boring. Little changed during the course of the plot and I never discovered the \\"powerful portrayal of man's...\\" The bright spots in Blindness were few and far between. At best I would say that this book is a bland discription of everyday occurencences under a filter of blindness; neither the tone nor the rhythm of plot seemed to change at all during the course of this story. I am happy to be moving on from this disappointing epidemic of white blindness."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Star Too Many","review":"The worst book I have ever read.\\"Oh God, all the human suffering!\\" is the emotion Jose attempts to invoke. Nothing saddens me more than to see real human suffering, as recently with Kosovo. But here I bought none of it.It's all to simplistic (blindness-sight), predictable and phoney. This, added to poor grammer (sentences which ran on for pages), empty character development and ridiculous annoying names (\\"dog of tears\\" and \\"boy with a squint\\"???), it just makes the book that much worse.In his novel, Jose creates a fictious environment full of excrements. In real life, he offers his book in form of solid waste. Stay clear"},{"rating":"1","title":"Spend your money elsewhere","review":"The premise of this book was SO good (and this is the only reason it gets 2 stars) that I think I was even more disappointed when it turned out to be a really bad read. Amazon lets you read a few pages so take advantage of that!The author uses run on sentences that go on forever, and the only punctuation he seems to use is commas. And what REALLY bothered me was that he didn't give the characters real names, and when they were speaking it was terribly difficult to tell who was talking. I don't think he even used quotation marks for the dialogue. Very frustrating.But worst of all, the author is fixated on human excrement throughout the entire story. I almost stopped reading it a few times because of the unnecessary images he was displaying. It was very disturbing.If you are looking for a \\"feel good\\" novel, this is certainly the farthest from it. I was left feeling rather disgusted and did not find the end to justify that feeling. Skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hated this book!","review":"This book came highly recommended. The problem was not with the story line. My disappointment had to do with the squalidness (if that's a word) of the text. The narrator dwelt on the extreme filth that was a large part of the novel so that it was relentlessly depressing, with no redeeming features that I could find.I also had a major problem with the literary devices the author used: strange punctuation, no indication as to who was talking, nameless characters. It put a burden on the reader which I thought was unnecessary.Looking at the way the reviews lined up for and against this book, I guess you either loved it or you hated it. I hated it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a price!","review":"The cheapest book I have ever bought. It is almost impossible. The condition of the book is very good, just as the description says. The delivery was very fast also. Thank you guys!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A profoundly moving investigation of Human Nature","review":"In a city without a name and with protagonists who are essentially \\"nameless\\" (eg. girl with the dark glasses), Saramango's narrative voice has created a world that is universal or \\"anywhere\\" (much like Macondo in One Hundred Years of Solitude) and inhabited by \\"anyman\\" which could be you or me. Due to an epidemic of white blindness which infects the entire nation, readers are drawn into a world of loss and disorientation through the eyes of one eyewitness. Here we are spectators to \\"man\\" at his/her most horrific self, as s/he faces seemingly unbearable atrocities. In the end, man's spirit triumphs in the face of the most absurd and unjust conditions. This timeless work of fiction is an ingeniously profound study of the human condition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated, not sure why","review":"A friend swore to me by this book. Overall, it is an interesting premise and starts off interesting, but then degrades into over-indulgent descriptions of concentration-camp-like suffering that stretch for FAR too long. There are some good literary devices employed, and the style is worth noting, but overall it is nothing mind-blowing, and certainly repetitive for the seasoned reader who'd already encountered the hashed-out themes of human frailty, etc.Oh yeah, and the ending is stupid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cegos X Cegos","review":"A mais perfeita obra em minha concepo de toda a literatura mundial!

We see how these strangers (who remain nameless throughout the book), now isolated and blind, try to cope with their condition and each other.Apart from a few passages of violence, I found this story fascinating, and Saramago's writing style innovative. No wonder he won the Nobel prize for literature.Well worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book In Perfect Condition With Prompt Delivery","review":"I was very satisfied with my purchase of this book because it was in perfect condition and it was delivered in a prompt manner."},{"rating":"1","title":"I could barely finish this book...","review":"I don't know what it was about this book, but after jumping right in and devouring the first few chapters (the concept was great, the writing was fabulous), I could barely make myself open this book to keep reading.OK I admit it. I skimmed through the last half of the book because I didn't feel right just leaving it unread and moving on to another book. And I wanted to see what happened (but I wanted to skip through the pages of muck and mire and human debauchery that made up most of this book).I guess what it came down to - for me - is this: how much rape and fecal matter can one person stand??? Because I felt like that's all I was reading about. Yeah, I get it, the human spirit prevails, etc. etc...but enough with the poop, semen and blood already!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unusual and chaotic style","review":"Saramago is obviosuly a fantastic storyteller, but what struck me most was the style in which he wrote the book. As we descend farther and farther into blindness and as a result, chaos, the book's writing style becomes chaotic. The punctuation becomes unecessary and the syntax more abbreviated and to the point - somewhat like what beind blind must feel like.The imagery is reduced to feelings and hearing - oflactory senses etc. and the visual descriptions are unecessary thereby forcing the reader to feel the utter despair and chaotic situation that exists. Names and places are reduced to meanigless; people are reffered to by past life descritptions, the \\"doctor\\"; \\"doctor's wife\\"; the \\"boy with the squint\\"; etc...I think you'll find this book exciting without the cheap frills of a shock book. It will not only scare you but also truly empathize with the chaotic plague of the blind."},{"rating":"2","title":"What If?","review":"This disturbing book brought only one question to mind....What if?Dramatic reading that only made me think and wonder.I will read more Jose..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, Saramago...","review":"Any decent editor would be appalled by the literary style of this book, if one can even call it a style. The narrative flips back and forth between past and present tense, the characters remain nameless (the main character is simply called \\"the doctor's wife,\\" others go by \\"the girl with the dark glasses,\\" or \\"the wife of the first blind man\\"). Dialogue lacks quotation marks and is interlaced with the author's narrative, separated by commas, often making it impossible to determine who said what to whom. Other reviewers have commented that this is all Saramago's way of \\"blinding\\" the reader and immersing one in the story, but I have a simpler explanation: the only punctuation marks Saramago learned in school were the comma, period, and apostrophe.But even if you were to penetrate the broken prose, the plot is weak, ridden with filth, gore, lust, rape, and excrement.My recommendation for those considering this book is to look away and save time and money for some actual literature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a necessary read","review":"I first became aware of this book from a reading list suggesting books college bound young adults must read. I thought I would read Blindness before giving it to my daughter and I'm glad I did. I saved her the slow realization that this book is predictable and, despite the author's best attempts to shock, boring. I tried to convince myself that the writing style added a certain weight and importance to the story and character development, but I soon gave in to my instincts that Saramago's faux stream of consciousnesses effort was a cover up for a cliched view of humanity. I don't even feel bad that I could not finish this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"High hopes, low return","review":"The Blindness metaphor was forced and strained. Two stars because I was able to stick with it to the end and it kept me away from the TV. Hard to believe they saw fit to make a movie out of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disturbing and Haunting - one of the most frightening books ever","review":"I just wanted to put in a little review for this book I just read, Blindness. I could not believe how much this book affected me. While I read it, I was having nightmares, and I couldn't stop thinking about it. Not to give too much away, this book is a little slice of hell or a view into some kind of possible apocalypse - what might really happen if the world is inflicted with a pandemic.The good thing is that the book had a nice theme. It has lots, but the one that struck me most was the theme of interconnectedness. We don't think about it, but each person in society has a purpose, and we are all important - relying on each other more than we realize. I think that Blindness really highlighted this idea.I would recommend this book to someone who isn't afraid to read something harsh, someone who likes a good engrossing read that won't pull its punches."},{"rating":"2","title":"I have read few books this moving","review":"After reading one of his books, I understand why Saramago won the Nobel prize. This book grabbed ahold of me and has not let me go, even three months later. The premise of blindness becomes a disturbing allegory of modern civilization where characters and places have no name. Of particular importance is the commentary on homelessness and disease. One character states that now that they are blind, no matter what they die of will have the stain of blindness - blindness and hunger, blindness and AIDS, etc. Although I talked with my wife about the novel, I could not wholeheartedly recommend her to read it because as moving as it is, the events are at times as revolting as literature can get. If you read literature to trigger emotion and thought, I can think of few novels that do that better than Blindness."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"This book explores how people's humanity degrades when put into a helpless situation. If I knew this was all this book was about, I would not have read it. There are plenty of historical references that have already made that clear. I also expected some kind of logic or explanation on the cause of the blindness to at least make the story seem more believeable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad translation","review":"It was clear that the book had undergone a translation, the writing seemed extremly clumsy and must have lost a great deal of its original charm. I think this really spoiled what might have been an interesting story, or maybe I am more biased towards writing style than a good story."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I read this book because it was choosen by my book club. I finished it because I felt I should. The premise seemed interesting but, would I recommend it? No! It did generate some conversation about characters action and reaction, but overall it seemed to be missing something for me.I'm told his other books have the same lack of punctuation...so much for the theory of the writing style \\" makes you feel blind \\".I see he has written a sequel called \\"seeing\\" ( I'm not kidding!) I wouldn't go there even if the book was free!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Philosophical Argument","review":"This book seemed like a college student's writing for a philosophy class.Too implausible! Where were the CDC's in their isolation suits?Why no music? One passage spoke of if only the Doctor could play a violin, even in the worst of times people sing.I just found this whole tedious book to be one long philosophical exercise. The contrived style of no quotation marks and identification of the speaker only added to my general \\"big sigh\\" reaction. No one had names? Oy Vey! I'm outta school and this book took me back to some of the more annoying people and teacher's who lived in their heads. Thumbs down on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overwelmed by Stupidity","review":"With all of the acclaim for this book, and the Noble prize winning author, I expected at least great substance. I do not make any claim to be a literary genius, but if one compares the great research that must go into good historical fiction to this book, then Blindness comes out being sophmoric Science-Fiction at best. The lack of ingenuity, and the crass display of the authors feeble understanding of the basic mehanics of modern life are unworthy of the printed page. The premise of the story and the characters are out of a made for television movie. As a reader, if something great is found beyond all of this, it just does not matter."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Were They Thinking?","review":"My first thought after finishing BLINDNESS was \\"Certainly someone in the world wrote something more worthy of a Nobel Prize!\\" The prize must be as political as its critics claim it is because this book's plot was at the level of a high-school senior's attempt at fantasy. It plodded along through some of the most stilted and ineffective prose I've ever read. Though I finished the novel, my disappointment in the Nobel Prize Committee was such that I threw the book across the room and have yet to pick it up. What a waste! I'll save myself the trouble of wading through any more of Mr. Saramago's work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Saramago continues to disappoint me","review":"For a nobel prize, Saramago continues to disappoint me. I had read \\"Seeing\\" and thought that the author's lack of creativity was particular to that book. Blindness is another flop. No depth in the characters. Very weak and unrealistic plot. For example, why would the only person that do not go blind chose to submit herself to sexual humilliation instead of leading, right from the beginning, the revolt against the thieves that control the food supply? You would think that sight would make her a powerful leader, but yet she takes action until after she and other women are raped by a group of blind men. How pathetic. A huge credibility gap there. I have wasted my time enduring two books of Saramago's mediocre writing. Do not waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"The characters are flat, the dialog thin. The plot is interesting, but its presentation lacks the depth or subtlety that would make it engaging, or even at times credible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth all five stars","review":"This is an important book about the insights of the human soul and surpisingly true if such an epidemic should occur. I find it to be more about the story of discovering the truth behind social interactions when social barriers are struck down and the world ceases to function. Packs of humans form together and many look out for themselves. It deserved the Nobel Prize."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books I've ever read","review":"This was one of the best books I've ever read. I read many books for pleasure as I commute by train every day, popular fiction, non-fiction, historic novels, so I'm not tied to one genre and this was one of the best books I've ever read. The story, the characters, the social message,the concept are very good. Despite some reviewer's issue with the style of writing (little or no punctuation) I found this unique style very interesting and enjoyed it. It's an interesting comment on society to consider what happens when a Blindness virus hits, or some other disaster (like a hurricane for instance), people turn on each other, violence and chaos ensues. Read it, Saragamo is a genius. Then read his \\"Seeing\\" for the all too realistic and current follow up to Blindness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a compelling read","review":"When I was given this by a friend with a brief description, I thought it sounded like an interesting premise, but found that I didn't care enough about the characters to force myself to read it. I kept putting it down, knowing I should read and return it but unable to find the desire to finish it. The ending was no surprise. Not that that's a hallmark of great literature, but I had initially expected something less predictable. If you really want to read a book about human nature reverting to its basest level, I suggest The Lord of the Flies instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"I couldnt do it.","review":"I was excited to get this book, the subject matter was interesting to me. I couldnt get past the punctuation and lack of sentence structure, no he said she said, it was all one huge run on sentence and I couldnt get over that to enjoy it. I felt like I was 10 years old and trying to hold my breath underwater as long as I could while playing Tea Party in the shallow end, and you all stare at eachother and try to enjoy yourself until you have to take that breath and come up to the surface. I was drowning in this authors choice of format, and I wanted to enjoy it so much!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The idea of this story was good.","review":"I can see why it is a good and thought-provoking book, but I find that it is not realistic enough in telling the frustrations of a suddenly blind person. It sounded easier to be inexplicably and abruptly blind than I would imagine it to be. Basically the epidemic was simplified to the extent that I thought the book was ridiculous. This story is really like a dream.What I found was not ridiculous but quite true was how uncivilized humans can be if they were being tested. A thousand years of civilization can easily be brought down in an instant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful!","review":"A particularly dreary read written in a different, albeit novel, manner that imparts little wisdom or insight to any other than the most sheltered."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most perturb book I have ever read","review":"I read the book in Portuguese, our native language, Saramago and my own. I was here in Japan, in a envirnoment where we have to re-define our beliefs everyday. Our little world is a mess of anguishes, religions, desperations and fears, nothing compared with the amphetamian voyage that Saramago conducts throught this allucino-genius book. Who sees and who doesn't? Who feels? And feels what? Where are we? Untill when we will see? Orwellian someone said, apocalyptic I would say. Highly recommended, before and after the Nobel Prize."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blindness from my point of view","review":"I read the Kindle version of Blindness. At first I almost stopped reading because of the typographical errors. I found many small words capitalzed after a comma (not proper names). Also, I found many words with a space in the middle of the word. I would like to apply for a job at the place where this book was typed.The story was interesting as well as the characters. Sometimes the transition from one scene/place to another was not smooth enough to suit me. I had to read some pages twice in order to figure out which character was in that part of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Phenomenal! I feel like many critics miss the point, though.","review":"This book is deeply disturbing. I found myself invited to a celebration along with my own mental, spiritual and emotional blindspots. Saramago's indirect storytelling is brilliant as it gives the readers the necessary space to more clearly see themselves. ---While I physically see, I am blind in so many many other ways. And I am blind of my own accord. Now, because of him, I know it. I am squirming. He is in my face, and he won't let me avert my eyes and escape. Incandescent. ....But wait, now that I've put down his book, my usual oblivion is settling around me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blindness","review":"Well written, but \\"brutally\\" realistic - the struggle of human \\"good\\" over human \\"evil\\" when society's security net no longer exists.

What if this actually happened?","review":"Although the author's explanation of the reason for the blindness is thin, the story itself is a page turner. I did not expect this book to be so suspenseful and engrossing. The characters are nameless, but that does not mean they lack personality and depth. If you are up for a well-written engaging story of something out of your wildest nightmares this is it."},{"rating":"2","title":"It won the Nobel for a reason, read it!","review":"This book won the Nobel for good reason. The style is a bit challenging at first, but I quickly adjusted and fell under the authors spell. It's beautifully written, but also graphic and deeply disturbing. The story presents a wide range of responses to the epidemic, from selflessness to complete and utter cruelty, depicting a full picture of humanity. The epidemic of blindness serves as plight, metaphor, and measuring device for cruelty, survival, and kindness all at once."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Can See","review":"For the first 320 pages or so(out of 326) of Blindness, I felt as though one of my 5 senses had deteriorated, and that any hope of its return was worthless. Whether it was the lack of punctuation, the slow-forming plot, or Saramago's disregard for naming his characters that caused my \\"disability\\" I can never truly be sure of, but my reliance on the single character who could see (7 others did so in the book) eventually paid off, and in the end my sight returned, and I found myself celebrating with those who also regained their vision."},{"rating":"2","title":"Huet-chooo....Bless you!","review":"I received this as a gift and would probably not have purchased it on my own (only because I don't have any hankies). The book had a lot of colored pictures and all of the quilts had themes which were based on what was embroidered on the hankies.

Regan is a great author and I look forward to buying more books from him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"The characters are ugly and almost inhuman. The castle itself is a brooding, decaying symbol of how the house of Groan has declined. Most of the characters have nothing likeable about them. It's hard to sympathize with their plights, except for in brief moments of understanding. There are no wars, no vast worlds to save, no grand epic feel to the book. The action is steady and sometimes subtle. You have to be willing to carefully read the dialogue and observe the interplay between characters. I read this book slowly, to savor it. I had just read several books much fatter and much more action-packed that left me empty and cold. This book, which is loaded with darkness and chills, left me fired up and eager to read the next one. I love the characters for their madness, the plot for its thickness, and especially the prose for its exquisite richness. This is my favorite book, and my favorite author, period. And yes, I've read Tolkien."},{"rating":"1","title":"A cure for insomnia!","review":"This beyond any doubt one of the slowest paced books (as well as boring beyond belief) I have attempted to read.

You wait for the tale to pick up, to get you interested, but you just end up not giving a damn about Gormenghast and its inhabitants. Detail is not enough to make a good story. Keep clear from this one, and spare yourself a bored *groan* upon putting it down. There is one positive aspect : you will expand your 1940's english."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good quality, good price","review":"Great book and price, shipping was sort of fast, took about a week and a half."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is going nowhere....","review":"I read this book because it was frequently mentioned to be (together with the Lord of the Rings) one of the books that are at the root of modern fantasy. In my opinion this book could be placed in other categories as fantasy. It has nothing to do with the sort of novels i consider fantasy. Yes, mister Peake can describe things in an excellent way, and his world does keep some promise. But in this first novel he does very little with it. So i guess i won't read the next (unless i am completly without other interesting books to read). this definitely is not my cup of tea and if you like books written for example by Tolkien, Jordan or Martin, you should get this from the library and try it for free instead of buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be fooled by the ratings.","review":"After an hour and 40 minutes I had to shut the tape off.

Like Alice in Wonderland, this book contains a lot of nonsense and silly situations that I believe are supposed to be funny, but are actually quite boring and stupid.So here's how you'll know if you'll like this book: do you think names like Prunesquallor and Steerpike are \\"unforgettable\\" (as the official Amazon.com review describes them) or just plain idiotic? Pass by this book if the latter."},{"rating":"1","title":"No, It's Just A Chore","review":"Nothing more need be written. See, Peake!

Don't read it if you're expecting another \\"Lord of the Rings\\", or something like one of the innumerable Tolkien imitations that have been written in the last 20 years. It is something quite different. I was literally mesmerized as I read this book and it's follow up, \\"Gormenghast\\". The beautiful prose transports one to a strangely fascinating land populated with bizarre characters who never the less are very human. The reader feels for these sad people, trapped in a world of complicated, arcane rituals. A light hearted escape it is not, but for those with a taste for the unusual, this is a very rewarding read. I would think that anyone who enjoys Terry Gilliam's movies would like these books."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Collection that is rare.","review":"After I found out that power stone was remade for the psp. I had to have that game because this is one of the greatest games from the 90s to have on a portable machine. I give it 5 stars for gameplay because its easy to get addicted to it. Not many classic capcom games are remade for the psp and fortunately this one is. I forgot how the cool items in the game makes it more funny for the players. Overall, I give it four stars because the graphics doesn't match up to the dreamcast port of powerstone. The music, fun factor, controls, and gameplay are a plus. I would recommend this game to any capcom fan today, and hopefully another classic game like this can be remade for the psp."},{"rating":"2","title":"Power Stone Collection is a gem!!!","review":"I was doing research and always wondered if this game was good.

Its really complex at the beginning but you will get used to it.TIPS:This is what I did, I was having sensibility problems so just go to controls> advanced options and adjust the sensibility of the control.Also I had my sensor bar over the tv I moved it to the in front of tv position, then go to wii options and change the setting of the sensor bar to it\`s new position.Now the controls work like a charm for me!Good luck this is a very nice game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Based Mostly on Controls for the Wii","review":"Before any fans jump to any conclusions let me say the series is fun but the Wii controls are so bad that they nearly make the game unplayable. For example, in the second level in co-op one player needs to paint an automated machine gun with the electronics blocker on your pistol. Easy right? No because if you breathe the Wii remote will move off and the machine gun will fire and kill your partner.I like the Wii but after playing this game on it I would recommend renting games not specifically intended to be played on the Wii, otherwise the radical control format may seriously detract from an otherwise decent game."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHERE IS IT??!!","review":"It's been over 3 weeks that i ordered this and i still haven't received the game or a response from the seller.

The Wii is very good for some things, but it appears that at least this PFS is not very good. The Wii remote is very jerky and sensitive. This makes aiming difficult to impossible. The graphics are OK. The storyline, is ok. It another Clancy sneek around and hope you don't get shot because you are going to die in very short order. I hope Call of Duty is better as I LOVE FPS games, but this one is lacking.The camera should not be allowed to go off screen, it should stop at the edge of the screen. Too many control issues to recommend. I will keep trying, but this game isn't so good that I will press on through the control problems just to get through it. I may have it up on eBay soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"bought it to give someone, seller was good","review":"The first copy I got didn't work, and the seller was very willing to switch it for a new one - no questions asked.The game itself is pretty good.

However, I must say that this family seemed to be a bit more captivated by their Adventist teaching than the simple testimony of the grace of God's protection in Jesus Christ.

Students of some intelligence need books that are really engaging and developing, and not just encyclopedic knowledge. Of course by reading this sort of a book we may learn definitions of concepts like noema and noemata, but I believe we would better have no idea of a subject than having a junk of poor and lifeless concepts. I would recommend the reader, especially the more sophisticated and good-willed one, to turn to Husserl's own numerous introductions like Cartesian Meditations or the Crisis even if he does not know much phenomenology, and put some sweat into them.

At a medium-high setting, using an oil with a high smoke point (e.g., grape seed or canola oil, not olive oil), this sauteuese works well for searing, browning, braising, frying, and saut��ing.

Image quality is excellent on the generous 2.5\\" screen and can't be any better, thanks to the active-matrix LCD.However, it is possible that reception could be a problem. I've tried the TV in two different places: Southern California, where reception comes through very clearly; and Northern California, where it was dicey at best. As a result, reception is probably highly variable and dependent on geography; make sure you try this model out at your nearest electronics dealer before you spend the rather pricey amount for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not work","review":"The item turned but that was it.

James became the God-Father after this style of music had changed to the Poppa got a Brand New Bag, Say It Loud, I'm Black and I'm Proud.. Listen to the beggings and soulful roots of the Parliaments, and then Funkadelic, which shared many band members with James' Famous Flames.

A young beginner will probably be very happy with this amp.The bad:The sound. Not the best sound quality. But then again what can you expect for 40 bucks.The ugly:My decision to worry about saving 20 bucks by buying this amp instead of a Fender Frontman 15 watt amp. But that's my fault, not Austin Bazaar's.Conclusion:If you're looking for a small amp for your kid's first guitar, this is probably a decent option. But if your looking for a small practice amp with decent sound, this might not be your best choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing product!!!","review":"I was searching for a small, high quality amp for about a week when I found this amp. I saw it had the best ratings, and by far the best comments so I purchased it. It arrived on time the next day, and with a cable which was a nice surprise because I wasn't sure if I needed to purchase one, and it wasn't listed in the product description. It's a perfect size for a small to medium room, and puts out an impressive amount of sound for such a little box. In my opinion this is the best 10 watt amp for its price range, and even that of much more expensive amps. I am very much impressed with the quality as well as the price, and would recommend this to anyone who is in the market for an amp of this wattage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Won't satisfy the \\"Eric Clapton\\" of your life...but it's a great starter amp","review":"Very nice in a bedroom or living room as your budding musician learns what it means to plug in and get the feel for their instrument.

The songs gel better without I died and Twitch on it and they are both available on \\"Another 5 songs and a Poem\\" - great cd - and her new \\"Essentially Naked\\" collection. What you can't get except for on this Canadian edition of I Bifficus is this particular version of Spaceman (it's different on the Uk (import) edition and on Essentially Naked) and a song called \\"If I\\" which is really good. And the Spaceman remix I think is pretty funky!Hope this helps."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truth.","review":"I Bificus is probably the most enjoyable album released by the original, raw, wonderful talent, Bif Naked, with the emotional Lucky as a high point.

And this mixed-bag of music follows the same description. \\"Moment of Weakness\\" is worth the price of the album alone, but \\"I Died\\" and \\"Lucky Ones\\" are also good (though they don't have that same ska-punk sound which carries \\"Weakness\\"). If you're a No Doubt fan who just can't wait till the February Release of \\"Artifical Sweetner\\", I'd recommend this Cd. Cause, no matter what anybody else says, Bif defiantely sounds just like Gwen. You can almost picture her listening to ND songs like \\"Just a Girl\\", \\"Spiderwebs\\", and \\"Don't Speak\\" over and over again until she could copy Gwen's vocals perfectly. Go on and buy the CD, it's better than most of the trash on the radio nowadays."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big potential ...","review":"I gave I Bificus 4 stars more for the artist's potential than the album's quality. Her voice alone is worth the price of admission. It has a combination of maturity and childishness that can't be faked. Most of the songs include clever lyrics, but none could be described as great. Listen to \\"I Died,\\" \\"Lucky\\" or \\"Any Day Now\\" to enjoy her voice and the way she uses it with the music. On \\"Only the Girl\\" she rises above the music (but not too far) and sings a clever story. Some will say it's not very original, but the lyrics are sharp. Very few words are wasted. There is plenty of edge on the album, something that's missing from most of today's over-produced music.However, many of the lyrics are too juvenile, and they suggest someone with an outlook on life that changes every time she walks around a corner. The question is, will her next effort build on this one? I hope so. I'd hate to think these are the only songs she ever records."},{"rating":"2","title":"smooth and melodious","review":"bif naked comes out with some great melodies. she has such a soulful smooth and beautiful voice and she has good range. the lyrics are both juvenille at times and clever at others. she does sound like no doubt's gwen stefani at times but with my collection of 600 cd's how can you not cross old territory?bif's strengths lie in the fact that she comes across as innocent and worldly at the same time. her voice is soulful, genuine and passionate and her songs rock. this is defineitely something different from the norm that is pretty damn good."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Greatest CD of the CENTURY!","review":"You have not lived until you have listened to this cd in its entirety.BiF Naked is one of the coolest, honest and mesmerizing female artist that I have heard in a very long time.Every single track on this CD is a \\"gooder\\".

(Her publicity photo on the bookjacket certainly is.) But this latest book is very much of the '90s, showing that she can adapt to a different era from the time of Princess Daisy, I'll Take Manhattan and co. Spring Collection is a lot faster-paced than all her other books, and most of the action takes place within just a couple of weeks. All the heroines - there are five in this one - are very appealing, and it also features one of the most attractive of any of her main male characters, Jacques Necker.

Wonderful text, good language, well-paced stories.However, books like Till We Meet Again, Princess Daisy or Dazzle showed the characters growing and developping, while Scruples 2, Lovers and this one are just like - and Krantz says it herself towards the end of the book - like an extra long episode of Love Boat. You enjoy it hugely, but you cannot get emotionally involved with her characters as much as in her other novels.The book was a treat, I'll read the next one as soon as it comes out, but I hope that, at some point, Judith Krantz will write something a bit more emotionally strong again, not just the best soap opera in the world.

It came in an old, sorry looking box that had been retaped several times, there were parts missing, parts substituted for the ones listed in the manual (i.e. the wrong size washers).

At least it installed without problems.Pros: Lots of nice features and capabilities.Cons: No built in native mpeg editing. That means that if you want to edit video that is already encoded in mpeg (mpeg2), such as a DVD you made previously, PE converts it to AVI, you edit it, then it re-renders it to mpeg. That takes a lot of time and results in some quality loss. You can buy a plug-in to add native editing but the plug-in costs as much as PE in the first place.

The fact he lives in a mud hut and eats only a small portion of bread and water everyday almost seems cheerful in comparison. Then, the boy talks about the significance of each color in the rug he is weaving \\"white for the shroud we wrapped my father's body in\\"...\\"Red is the color of the blood of martyrs.\\" Finally, never mind using the story as any sort of a springboard to illustrate giving and helping others less fortunate.

I found none. So what if Doug Lansky watches a bullfight, takes dancing lessons, picks grapes, eats a steak, and goes moose hunting. My grandmother, who is 80, had done all of those 'adventures' too. Let's forget about the fact that the book is a tour guide for senior citizens, and talk about Lansky's attitude. He sounds like a fat, spoiled American who has a wonderful life but still isn't satisfied. Lansky manages to complain about every 'culture' he claims to have experienced. In reality, Lansky never allows himself to experience true cultures. He only takes part in typical tourist activites that actually contribute to the decay of the societies he is visiting. My recommendation is to skip this book. Avoid Lansky's egomania and pessimistic outlook on the world at any cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is the author writing these good reviews?","review":"I read the online reviews here and thought I'd check out this book.

The author seemed to take great pleasure in demonstrating his American superiority to many of the peoples he visited. If some of these people didn't meet his criteria for personal hygiene, then he should attempt to live without indoor plumbing and a fresh supply of water. I was also unimpressed with his tasteless metaphors. However, he does come close to self-examination when he compares himself to a \\"turd\\" while squeezing through a cavern in his spelunking adventure. American readers gain no insight on the peoples of the world through this book. However, the peoples of the world, having met Mr. Lansky, are reminded that the Ugly American still lives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really bad","review":"This book gives hope to anyone who wants to be a writer but doubts whether they have the talent to succeed. In this collection of his travel columns, Doug Lansky travels the world doing the things that only rich, spoiled Americans can do--visiting brothels, impoverised indians in the amazon, and \\"smelly\\" people in India (His quote, not mine.) Despite traveling around the world, Lansky's interactions with the native cultures is only minimal. However, the worst thing about this book is his writing; he has no sense of style or rythym and can barely string two words together. This is the worst type of travel book: that written by a spoiled rich kid who can barely write. Avoid it."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's good for a funny line here and there....","review":"Basically...he drops a few funny lines, but doesn't really write about his travels in any depth.

I just expected more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck","review":"Doug Lansky's first book is a big waste of time.

Unfortunately, I'm inclined to believe that his friends are the only ones who love this book.Doug's writing is extremely poor. His writing is awkward and he can barely string together a sentence. However, I could ignore this fault if his subject matter were better. The trouble is that Doug's outlook on world travel is little better than that of a little child who travels to exotic places and merely wants to eat hamburgers and watch MTV in the hotel room.

It's too bad that they've lost sight of why this was a great program! It takes eons to catalog and view files, and the reliability is ludicrously bad. Whereas browsing through 1000's of files used to be a snap, it is a chore with 6.0."},{"rating":"1","title":"Returned these","review":"I purchased these and it is not a set of 6, it is a set of 4.

I'm glad that is was available for him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expected more from Young at Heart","review":"Young at Heart may take you step by step through the process of writing children's stories, but it's simplicity lacks grit. Ms. Ramos touches on basic concepts, but spends no time going into depth. She writes for a page or two on each concept and then inserts \\"worksheet space\\" for you to practice on. Almost a third of the book is blank practice pages, which is completely unnecessary. The sample story she uses throughout to illustrate her points is umimaginiative and cliche. I would not recommend this book as a tool for children's writers."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book to teach the novice on how to write.","review":"This was a great book to teach the novice writer on how to write stories for children. Ms. Ramos was able to convey experiences not only as a teacher but as a published author.

It breaks the process down into an easier task."},{"rating":"1","title":"How to train a monkey to write.","review":"With her collection of fill-in-the-blanks exercises, Ramos's book suggests that writing for children is a formulaic activity. No creativity is necessary. This book might be useful for folks who care more about the paycheck than their message. For those of you who feel you actually have something unique to share with children, <u>any</u> other book would be more useful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Read","review":"Must Read:This is a definite \\"Must Read\\" for all Muslims, not just converts.He writes with sensitivity beyond what one usually finds in a biographical work. I did find,in reading this, many of the passages in the Quran became clearer.I had set out to read only religious material during the month of Ramadan and this was the first book I chose. After reading it, through my local library, I immediately went into Amazon.com and bought the book. I did this with the next book I read also. That is \\"In The Footsteps Of The Prophet.\\" If you want to see what I thought of that one, then check out my review when they send me the request to do so. :)Br. Emerick is a marvelous writer.

I found I would have liked it better if the author had footnoted the book, providing referencing materials for the stories told in the book. However, I did appreciate the story-like narrative of writing which made it much easier to read than other documentary-like biographies. Also, the author should have inserted more Quranic passages as examples when making references to Quranic sayings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbias and Accurate!","review":"My greatest-most favorite version of the Prophet Muhammad's (pbuh) biography.

I found its treatment of Jews, Christians, and Zoroastrians unfair and, frankly, uninformed. A quick example: the author casually discards the Persians as idolators, whereas the Sassanids, for all their faults, were noted iconoclasts. This book may be well-written, but it is not well-researched."},{"rating":"1","title":"Propaghanda","review":"Of the four biographies of Muhammad I have read to date, this is by far the most un-objective and slanted yet. The author, an American academic and Christian convert to Islam, touts Muhammad as a military genius which is comical at best. The book is written with little historical reference. The author quotes muhammad and his cohorts from specific conversations as if there is any evidence or historical accuracy to these accounts. If there were, I expect the author would have cited them. The book is obviously anti-semitic and anti-Christian. The author dutifully exalts and explains all the violent actions, thievery, and murder committed by the Muslims in a way that would be believable only to a fellow Muslim."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inaccurate","review":"Author is trying to hide violence and killing in Koran and the live of Muhammed.

I wasn't wrong, either! Besides having an absolutely gorgeous cover (which I always judge a book by :D), it is an easy, pleasant read and contains some really valuble information.The Prophet's (PBUH) life and personality is portrayed very well in this book. I really admire how Emerick was able to blend his personal, religious, and political life together, giving us a very multi-faceted and well-rounded view of what the Prophet was like. For Muslims and non-Muslims both, it contains information that is sometimes little known about the prophet and Islam. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Informative Biography!","review":"For someone with very little knowledge of Prophet Muhammad, this books was certainly very informative .

There are 3 street fighters and 3 ghost and goblins.Bad:Control is horrid. I think this is more of the PSP's fault than the game. The D pad is horrible when making moves that require alot of circular motion. Doing fireballs is near impossible. The analog pad is actually worse. The d pad allows quick movements from axis to axis, not the analog pad.There is no difficulty settings on the games. You're stuck with the hard settings. The loading times are also riduculously long. When you change opponents, there's about a 20 - 30 second loading wait.This game is not worth your money. Buy the other capcom collection, it's a lot more fun.

He has to clean out his room, give Pal a bath, deal with the trash and more. Only once he's completed all of this can he go play, but all of the work is rather tiring.Like all other releases in this set, all pages are fully illustrated.

I can safely say that anything named \\"secret\\" is nothing at all. There is not one thing in this book that is beneficial to anyones spiritual growth, simply because it doesn't line up with the gospel of Christ, nor the story of creation in the Bible. This is coming from someone who isn't a total conservative style Christian, who is open to apocryphal writings. Gnosticism is a religion that twists the message of Christ and pollutes it! Quit complicating the faith of Christ by adding false things. This book is awful, don't bother opening it or falling into its snare.Jw"},{"rating":"2","title":"LULU IS LUSCIOUS !","review":"Every bit as unique and flirtatious as her hugely popular purse designs Lulu Guinness, the fragrance is instantly recognizable. With her trademark humor and love of glamour Ms. Guinness offers a scent that is both playful and elegant.It's a sweet, floral scent enlivened by Lily, and aromatic with blossoms such as Clementines, Apple Blossoms and Pink Sweet Peas. Augmented by Lily of the Valley, Easter Lilies, and Amaryllis, the fragrance also boasts Sandalwood and Heliotrope.The packaging is quintessential Lulu Guinness, the rounded flask-like bottle is very retro in tones of black and white. On the front is a \\"Be A Glamour Girl\\" image sketched by the designer. A black shiny cap looks very much like a chic hat.

It really just tasted like maple syrup with the tiniest hint of rose. I couldn't really smell the rose either, and I've got a great snout! Like said before, I've never used a rose syrup, so maybe they're all this faint. But the product tastes pretty good.

So, if your kid outgrows the harness before being ready for a booster, then you're stuck buying another seat to harness longer. It is also difficult to install.

While we noticed it had more padding, we didn't think it would be a problem. Boy were we wrong! As the other reviewer said, there is so much padding, it doesn't provide for a comfortable seating arrangment for the baby. He is pushed so far forward that he can't sit nicely. In addition, the seat had to be jacked up with pool noodles to even be at the right level...and we had to push the drivers seat so far forward to have it at the right angle. We ended up bringing this seat back and opting for the one with less padding...it works much better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"I bought this car seat at Burlington because it looked so comfy. My son HATES riding in car seats, so I thought this would remedy that. Well, eyes can be very deceiving...it was so uncomfortable for him. The cushion is too thick and pushes the baby up too far in the car seat. The clip between the legs is short (made worse by all the cushion), so the buckles were poking into my baby's legs. Also, the belts that go around the legs are too tight. I read the reviews before I bought this, but I bought it anyway thinking I'd try it for myself because it might work for me. Don't make the same mistake I did.

I used the latch system and followed the directions to the letter. My daughter had installed her Britax with no problem. I ended up making an appointment with the State Police and they installed it properly and securely. The trooper was not very happy when I told him the make of the car seat I had purchased.

The problems lie in the dialog and plot, which seem to have been made up on the fly, as it were. When the big twist comes near the end, you'll find yourself saying \\"huh?\\" Don't bother rewinding and reviewing...it still won't make sense. This could have been fun, but it's ruined, in no small part, by stupid male characters...a hayseed boyfriend, his asian buddy who tries to impress chicks by talking like a thug, and finally Lamas, an ubervampire whose attitude and behavior make no sense whatsoever.

The beat got everyone everywhere to party and dance along, but the song is a different story. Missy in her music doesn't have a flow, everything is in fragments like when she says \\"now people sing around, now people gather around go get your freak on\\" it sounds bad. And then every once in a while she'll add in HOLLLLLLLLLAAAAAAA. It's like not a song. I think she uses other top artists to sell her music.

In the past that wasn't the case. That may not be the problem, I am just guessing...this album is just very tame...Missy always claims to have space age beats, she must have left them at home, because they aren't on here..Plus there are two hidden tracks at the end..which end up being gospel type songs..that made it even worse...if I wanted gospel songs, I would buy that type of album!!

But except for \\"Get Ur Freak On\\" and the \\"One Minute Man\\" remix with Jay-Z (and maybe even \\"Slap Slap Slap\\"), this album is a disappointment compared to her other works. It's too experimental: there's like, disco, reggae, and gospel songs present but no theme or cohesiveness. Missy and Timbaland should go back to their formula, whatever that is. Whoever thinks that this is in any shape or form hip hop or R&B should spend some time in a room listening to Talib Kweli and Angie Stone. They'll really get some schooling.

There was a lot of effort in the production, which was worth it. The album is one of the best to come out so far this year. I bought it because I loved Get UR Freak On, and I love it.

After the installation, in a matter of two days, caused two fatal errors. Before purchasing this product, I tried the 2002 version and it worked just fine, so I thought that I would save myself the cost of the upgrade and purchase the 2003 version. What a waste of 50 bucks. It is supposed to protect me from viruses which cause the problems like the ones caused by the antivirus program itself. On top of all that, the customer service is non-existant. You can either pay something rediculous like 30 bucks per call to talk to somebody live or use their step by step useless online help guide. Note: I installed this on the Windows XP Home edition system, with which the product is supposed to be compatible. However, there are people who have had problems installing to this OS and I could be just one of them. However, it does not take away from the fact that this product is inherently defective."},{"rating":"1","title":"Run as fast as you can from Norton","review":"My husband bought Norton 2003 with a license for two computers, and we installed it on our two.

The fellow tried some things (most of which I had already tried) and decided the problem was with the Microsoft installer. (He didn't charge me, presumably because I had already tried everything myself.) I didn't believe that so I reinstalled Windows and tried the MS installer again and this time Norton successfully reinstalled. But I had the same problem with it messing up my machine. So once again I decided to try the for-fee phone support. The fellow tried to convince me it was a virus (no way!) and then said it might be a conflict with another program. He couldn't guarantee he could solve the problem but I would have to pay if I went any further. So I decided to give it up and ask for a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy This Product","review":"I made the mistake of purchasing this product, which appears to have been prematurely released for sale to the public.

After I installed Norton Antivirus 2003, I couldn't access my e-mail account. After trying, without success, to reconfigure Outlook Express with the help of a senior Tech Advisor with my Internet Service Provider, we finally UNINSTALLED Norton Antivirus 2003. This solved the problem immediately. I then purchased and installed McAfee VirusScan 7.0, which worked perfectly. I believe that McAfee is the better product.

This reminder pops up everyday, regularly crashes other progams, and is impossible to get rid of.Per Symatec's VERY delayed customer service response: the only way to get rid of the dialog box is to UNINSTALL your Antivirus software (ie. don't use their product anymore) or buy the subscription service for 1 more year.What kind of strong-arm consumer screw-job tactic is this?!??!

I'm sure that there is some go-around fix, but I already have a job and the last thing I want is to spend my time \\"fixing\\" a new product. I promptly uninstalled it from that computer.I tried it on another machine and it does seem to work using an older email system.

It was obviously put together by scanning the original with OCR, & was then not proofread. The errors are numerous, with characters being replaced with something that looks similar. For example, Jupiter's moon \\"Io\\" is almost always spelled \\"10\\" and the words \\"he\\" & \\"be\\" are interchangeable. Words are italicized at random & sometimes just half a word is italicized.I would wait on a second Kindle edition with revisions before purchasing, or get a dead tree copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Story","review":"The book reveals the biography of E=mc2. As a biography, it starts with the origins of E, =, m, c, and 2. The story describes how these terms came together in a single equation and how the equation has affected human events. Through it all, the reader gains an understanding of the people involved--their successes, betrayals, and beheadings. Who knew that 'spin doctors' were practicing their craft as early as the 1600s? It is a great and very human story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacking in accuracy","review":"Bodanis is an engaging writer. Unfortunately, this book is very short on scientific and historical accuracy. If you want authenticity with your entertainment, this is not the book for you. The number of errors is legion, and many are quite significant. It would appear that neither the author nor the publisher saw fit to have the manuscript vetted by experts in physics and/or physics history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This is a very disappointing book because the author fails to do what he says he is going to do in chapter 1. He says that he is writing the book so people like Cameron Diaz (!) will be able to understand the equation. But even the delightful Cameron would have no real understanding of the science involved after reading this book - not even in a popular science kind of way.It's actually just a story of some of the scientists who helped us to understand the parts of Einstein's famous equation, but even this story is incomplete because he virtually ignores many of the major players. Even Galileo gets only a few words!Also, the author is not helped by his poor use of analogy. For instance, he says that as an object increases in speed its mass \\"swells\\" up. Anyone with no prior understanding of relativity would be totally confused by this comparison.If you want to understand the theory you would do better reading another book. It's not as though popular science books on the topic are rare."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing! Spectacular!","review":"David Bodanis way to go! This is the best book ever! I am in grade 6and I enjoy physics and aeronautics. This book was very well-writtenand even I understood %99.5 of the book. It doesn't give you tons of physical equations to explain Einstein's special theory of relativity but it explains the whole thing in a much better story-like way. It helps if you know some stuff about relativity before reading this book but even if you don't this book will be a great adventure. Highly Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a keeper","review":"I first encountered this book at the library as a book on tape. I was fascinated. It would make a good companion to Richard Rhodes' The Making of the Atomic Bomb."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do we need this?","review":"The equation itself is very very easy to derive from the quite simple mathematics of Special Relativity.E=mc2 - it says that energy and mass are equivalent.\\"c\\" - the speed of light ( a big number ), means that you can get a lot of energy by just converting a little mass (\\"m\\").Hence, nuclear weapons.I am all for books that popularize science, but not to the extent of taking a quite simple equation and flogging it to death."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well, I still don't get it.","review":"As an explanation of the equation, I give this book high marks for almost getting through to me. As a biography, its nearly perfect, mixing people, science, and history together in a fascinating blend of fact, speculation, and relationships. This is a great book for gifts, and someday, I may just get the equation right."},{"rating":"1","title":"misses the point","review":"The point is that ALL energy has a mass equivalence, not just nuclear/subatomic energy. Einstein knew this, although he had trouble proving it (see Einstein's Miraculous Year). By repeatedly and incorrectly stating that only nuclear/subatomic energy has a mass equivalence, Bodanis misses the great universality and majesty of Einstein's equation. He should have shown his book to a physicist before sending it to the publisher. As for me, I'll stick to reading science books written by scientists."},{"rating":"2","title":"E=mc2","review":"The development of scientific knowledge was presented in a way that allowed a person like me, who has practically no understanding of physics, to see how ideas that preceded Einstein come to develop his equation."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fascinating read!","review":"I loved this book. It is a first rate physics primer that reads like a great mystery. David Bodanis ( author of The Secret House and The Secret Family, which I also recommend )has a way of ending chapters with intriguing statements or questions that make it difficult to stop reading. His treatment of the Allied Forces' attempts to sabbotage the heavy water facility at Vermork, Norway during WWII is a lot like a short Ken Follett novel. Since finishing the book, I find myself looking for ways to bring up E=mc2 topics in conversations ( \\"...speaking of smoke detectors, did you know that they derive the power to generate their smoke-sensitive beams from the radioactive decay of americium?\\" or \\"...just imagine, the glare from the explosion over Hiroshima would have been viewable from Jupiter\\" ). This is popular science writing at its best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even more undrstanding","review":"This was a splendid documenation of the actions and thoughts of the individuals involved in the revelations of the most important discoveries in physics ever made. It was told in an exceptionally clear manner by the author. It was very obvious that his research was thorough. He also documented all his discoveries so that the reader could easily do more research.Personally, I had a hard time putting it down even though I have read other books on the subject. It is the best technical writing I can remember."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down","review":"I bought the book at an airport and read it in 3 days. I was amazed at how interested I became once I started reading the first page. I'm not a science buff, by any means, but I am intersted in general knowledge of the way things work. How many people can honestly say they know what E=MC2 means? Well, thanks to this book, now I can.After I finished, I gave it to my father-in-law and he couldn't put it down. The people and the stories behind each part of that equation are fascinating. The section on the race to develop the atomic bomb between the U.S. and the Nazis was especially a page turner.Well done, David Bodanis, and thanks for the insight!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Making sense of history","review":"Over all, a very good read. Mr. David Bodanis does a good job of tracing the \\"roots\\" of the equation E=MC2 and entertaining the reader at the same time. David's story becomes a tapestry of people and places involved with the creation of this deceptively simple formula, all of which are woven together over time. The contributions of the more notable persons such as Newton, Faraday, and Einstein of course are present. But equally interesting are the contributions of Cecilia Payne, Lise Meitner and even Robert Recorde."},{"rating":"1","title":"Opportunity Lost","review":"A solid \\"C\\" at best (not the c for the speed of light either). The main text of the book is a rather superficial history of one of the most important scientific theories. The substance is in the notes found at the end of the book. I only found them and realized their value after I had read the main text. A real shame.Typical of so much of current writing flowing from academia, the author wastes time and space sniping at his perception of racism, sexism, social discrimination. He even appears compelled to throw some worshipful comments about Martin Luther King and Nelson Mandela as though that was part of the required template among profs these days.The ironic, and in all likelihood unintended, conclusion from reading the book is that, but for racism, sexism and social class ostracism, the theory of relativity would never have been worked out."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Tripe!","review":"Hardly a definitive work on the methodology behind the discovery.Its a poorly written history that misses the most fundamentalpoints and jumps through topics with Heisenberg uncertainty.

The story has no original plot or thougt, but are made up of stereotypical and rather stale characters that we all have met before in popular fiction and TV-dramas. His story and characters lack believeability and origiality (of course he made it in marketing - but decided to leave it because it was too shallow; of course she was a cheerlead - all his female encounters were the most disirable, etc., etc.) His description of Michigan and America shows many similarities to an exchangestudent's fond rendition of a youthfull encounter with America - not a deep understanding of the country. I am left with the feeling that the author had a basic idea for the book, took a two weeks trip to the United States, and filled in the blanks from what he observed. This renders the book without a proper framework to build a good story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"My mom bought this set for my four year old son last week.

Practical tips are interweaved with Scriptural theory for a useful book.Mr. Coleman's style throughout, however, is frequently rather tedious and difficult to read. It lacks enthusiasm for the task of discipleship, and its dry, intellectual style does not immediately motivate you to go out and disciple the nations. This is not necessarily a bad thing - it's just not what I expected from a book marketing itself toward ordinary lay people. I find it curious that it's become a bestseller.I also had some fairly significant theological problems with certain portions of the book, but I know it's not supposed to be some major treatise.

When Darci came across a mysterious photo of her father with a strange woman in the forbidden bureau in her grandfather's basement, she knew she had to find out who she really was. Thus begins an odyssey that would take Darci across the globe, then home again. Along her quest Darci would meet a young couple on the plane to greece, the black African student who became her first lover, an enigmatic and wise Ere Zeta. Each encounter with these and others would shape her thinking and awaken Darci to the power of her indomitable spirit while learning lessons in the school of life.

The book is very, very dry, repetitive, and (perhaps most importantly) it occasionally gives somewhat dated information. (This despite the fact that there was a delay in receiving my text because it was brand new!). I found the text to be somewhat condescending-- it attempts to make the information relevant to college/university students by discussing issues that our age group might identify with-- but I personally felt that Dr. Taylor has underestimated what undergraduates are capable of understanding.

Well to be honest, I couldn't even finish the book (I got about half way).

Second the testimolials he gives advocates cry out methods, which if your child is like mine, would not work. The whole reason I bought this book was because I strongly do not believe in the cry out method (my son would make himself sick before he would fall asleep). On the positive, there is some interesting information in this book about ADD being linked to sleep deprivation, and the release of a stimulating hormone when we are over tired and how it prevents us from falling asleep.(...)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Babies Can Sleep","review":"This book is fantastic.

More importantly, though, the author advocates letting a 4-month-old cry it out alone, with no checks or consolations or visits, for the entire night. That's right: according to this guy, it's OK to put your baby down in the crib, shut the door, and do not return until morning. Help! Who does this?!?!??!?

To my horror, I did it for 3 weeks and instead of getting better, things just got worse. By the time I gave up my 9 month old daughter had developed an intense fear of her crib. When I would walk towards the crib to set her down, a look of terror would pass over her face and the hysterical screaming would go on off and on all night long. I know it works for a lot of parents but it just didn't work for us at all. My daughter was too strong-willed for this.I had much better success with Good Night, Sleep Tight by Kim West. A much better method for us. Also, we had been cosleeping prior to trying this and I think all this method did was intensify her separation anxiety.

These quick-fix solutions are all just variations of the old cry-it-out method. Congrats - you've learned to shut your kid up, but at what cost?!?! If you don't want to deal with this, don't have a child. Yes, it's frustrating when your baby won't sleep but that's how kids were designed. Quick fix solutions at the child's expense are cruel and short-sighted. The scare tactics of what will happen to your baby if he misses a nap are ridiculous. Don't let your children cry. It's cruel.

But I think that is what parents are for - to be there for their children day AND night not just when it is convenient or easy. The methods in this book are straightforward even when he tells you not to clean up your baby if he vomits lest you damage the progress of sleep training. The baby stage is very short and I don't want to look back at this time and think that I took the selfish route just for a few hours of sleep.

Which is just to say that we tend to ignore what our hearts tell us in favor of some scientific method that some doctor guarantees will work unless of course we don't do it the right way. Think about that for a minute. Your instinct is to soothe your child(ren), do it. Stop listening to the \\"experts\\". I truly can't stand this guy and I hope I never meet him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tired, Busy Parents Don't Want a Ph.D. Thesis","review":"This book, a gift sent by a family member, is thoroughly impractical for tired parents. At nearly 500 pages, with a full bibliography of scientific research, it serves a useful purpose--for the health professional, not the parent. I am a parent, a teacher, and am studying towards my goal of a Ph.D. I simply do not have the time to read through the exhaustive information for the important tips, which are not usefully presented in any case."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a fan","review":"While there are some good tips in this book I am overall not a fan. It's based on \\"sleep training\\" which I just don't like. While it is frustrating to be exhausted because your baby isn't sleeping, I don't think that sleep training or crying it out is the way to go."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for caring parents of High needs or fussy babies","review":"First off, this book is boring and difficult to enjoy reading. Next, the author is insultive to babies who fall into his category of Highly fussy/Intense temperment. He calls parents of these \\"unlucky\\" and that these children will most likely only respond to the cry it out method. Shame on both counts! It may be difficult to parent these children at times due to a lack of parental resources. However, telling parents they are unlucky to have a child like this is certainly not going to help them rise to the occasion. These children can successfull learn to sleep gently and with love as they mature. Plus, they truly do bring out the best parent in you if you yield to what is needed. Parents of truly fussy or high needs babies this book is not for you. Maybe for the placid baby your friends have, but not you! Beware, and save your money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Genius!!","review":"Unbelievable results!! My husband and I were looking for a method to get our 3 1/2 month old daughter to not only be able to go to sleep on her own, but also to transition her out of our room into her crib in her own room. She had been 100% parent-soothed so I was terrified going into the process! But she responded unbelievably well!!! She made through the whole night in her crib on the very first night! And by the third night her loud protesting (she never even really cried!!) was down to 6 minutes, and the fourth night she simply rolled over and went to sleep. My husband and I now refer to Dr. Weissbluth quite simply as \\"Genius\\"! :-) This method has changed our daughter and our lives! I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Must be useful info in here.......if only I could find it!","review":"I think there are some good and surprising statistics in here about how much sleep children need and what will happen if they don't get it. However, I just cannot wade through this man's writing and come up with a good game plan for getting my daughter to sleep. I've had this book a few months and revisit it from time to time, but his writing is just too circuitous for me to decipher. I have no doubt he can probably help me, but this book needs desperately to be revised by a good editor who can help it make more sense!Boo also to some of his antiquated notions about babies manipulating their parents. Please don't go at child rearing with this notion."},{"rating":"2","title":"I wish I read it sooner..Wonderful","review":"We owe so much to Dr. Weissbluth's book. This was the first book we saw that dealt with naps, not just night sleeping problems. Our daughter was an angel at night, but sleeping during the day was impossible. She just would not go down. We tried everything. This book explained why she had problems going down as a post-colic child and how to solve that problem. Within two days, she was sleeping over an hour at each nap, not just the normal 15-30 minutes. This book was a turning point in her life. Also, he explained how detrimental it was for my daughter to lose sleep. This was the best money we ever spent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Invaluable Resource","review":"This book has made a tremendous difference in my parenting. I've used it with 3 children, and find new suggestions and details each time I open it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helpful","review":"This book was very helpful. My first baby was very cheerful, but my second was miserable at the beginning.

I recommend it to all of my friends when they have new babies. Both of my boys are excellent sleepers and I attribute it all to this book. Dr. Weisbluth presents extensive research on sleep and explains why sleep is so important. Then he very clearly discusses how to instill these habits in your children. Helping your children learn to sleep is not only freeing for you, but is invaluable for your children."},{"rating":"2","title":"not for everyone","review":"Some may find the tips in this book way too harsh. Others may find it a lifesaver. My experience was in the middle. I found some of the facts and information very helpful and eyeopening. Allthough it was too painful for me to let my twins cry so much. So I didn't stick with it 100%, but rather mixed it with my own tenderness and had eventual success. (It took my son 3 months(age 8 months old) and my daughter 7 months(15 months old) to sleep through the night) It advocated what I would call the ultimate cry it out approach to getting your baby to sleep throught the night. ie not going to them AT ALL unless you think they are hurt or hungary. The overall focus is that most children are sleep deprived therefore needing very early nap and bedtimes. I found this to be very true. The book also goes on with chapters for older children, so if your are ok with the tough love approach, this will be a good guide for years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for everyone","review":"This book gives both new mothers and old pros a step-by-step healthy approach to teaching your child to sleep and sleep well.

My child takes 2 good naps and sleeps through the night."},{"rating":"2","title":"life savor","review":"I did not know one main point of the book, and it really helped my daughter be more alert and a whole lot less cranky each day.

DR. Sear's book did not help me solve any problems but to accept the problem. I was so tired all the time and my marriage was falling apart. Out of desparation, I finally followed the quick-fix the book suggested and let my baby cry for as long as it would take instead of following the Ferber method. My baby became more persistant and more awake after crying for hours. During the day, he became so insecure because he was afraid that I would leave him without going to him. When it comes to bed time or nap time, he screamed at the sight of his crib. I let my baby cried for several days, and finally regret it because I started seeing the sad look in his face. It took us a while to go back to the previous night-waking pattern. Not the greatest, but at least there's no letting the child scream."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck.","review":"This book turns my stomach. Someone gave it to me, and I wish they hadn't. It feeds on a first time mom's insecurities and makes you feel like if you don't let your baby cry it out, then you are a bad parent setting your child up for a lifetime of troubled sleep. This book gave me so much anxiety because it goes against every instinct as a mother. Finally I got confident enough to throw it away and trust myself! It is normal and healthy for babies to wake up at night to nurse! This book is cruel and the advice and \\"success\\" stories make me feel nauseas. Better to read \\"The No Cry Sleep Solution\\" for loving ways to help your baby sleep for longer stretches."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful! Poorly organized and unrealistic.","review":"This book was recommend by a few friends, so I thought it would be a good book to read. As I started to read the book, I found it to be poorly organized. It was not broken down by age, so one minute it would be telling you how to get a 6 week old to sleep and then it would jump to a one year old. This book also suggests putting your child to bed at 6pm. For working parents, that is not only unrealistic, it is also veryunfair. Am I not supposed to spend any time with my daughter? It goes on to imply that if you don't put your child to bed that early because you want to spend more time with your baby, you are selfish. These are sacrifices that good parents make. To be honest, I stopped reading at that point, and if it wasn't an e-book, I would have thrown it in the garbage!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not pratical!","review":"The book was awful and way too lengthy to read for sleep deprived parents. I read the reviews and bought it anyways and regret the whole 4 dollars I spent lol. It was too jumpy, didnt make sense and totally contradicting!The ONLY helpful tip I picked up was to look for baby's sleepy cues...such as yawning, fussing, tired eyes..etc, and to be honest I might have read that on an previous review.If your looking for a straight to the point HELPFUL book, then buy Everything You Need To Know For The Modern Day Parent an A-Z guide by Mark Cohen...great book, and VERY straigh to the point. My son is now 12 weeks and sleeping through the nights:)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much research jargon and cry-it-out endorsement","review":"I bought this book truly hoping it would help my son sleep better, and the reviews I read led me to believe that Weissbluth isn't a proponent of just letting your baby \\"cry it out\\". However, after reading the whole book (which was like torture, full of information and medical research an overtired mom doesn't have energy for) it truly seemed like Weissbluth believes the only way a baby can fall asleep is to cry it out or have controlled crying. Besides being difficult to use due to the dense and boring nature of the writing, it didn't help me get my son to sleep better. I highly recommend you go buy the Baby Whisperer or No cry sleep solution immediately!"},{"rating":"1","title":"All babies are different","review":"I tried his idea of putting my baby to bed early and then earlier . . . and what I got was a baby who would take a nice 45 minute nap at 6 or 6:30 pm and then was raring to go until 11 pm!

Win-win."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"This book has one basic message that is found all over the internet and in other books. Yet most of the book is a bunch of stories written by other parents and their experiences with their kids. Personally, I dont care what other parents are doing. Its not a one size fits all approach. I am also sick of these authors acting as if they invented this concept of nap time. Argh. It sort of demeans us as parents as if we are ignorant to our babys needs.

It was hard to follow, and just really useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cry It Out Method Under Another Title","review":"This book is just another description of the cry it out method. In one section the author recommends that you should let your baby cry for up to an hour without responding. That's pretty shocking.

This book gives only one suggestion: earlier bed time. Well, let just say, it does not always work. The earlier we put our child to bed the earlier is his morning wake-up call.

Amazon put the picture of the 3rd with the dates and page numbers of the 2nd (only 345 pages!). I ordered 2 good used copies for my friends - one was just like mine and one was this 10-year-old shorter version! The second book matches the picture posted by a customer.

I'd rather spend some time and help my child sleep with more gentle methods."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some interesting advices","review":"I def learned a lot about sleep and applied a few advices that actually work.

The people who rate this book with a low number of stars either didn't read the entire book, didn't comprehend the information given in the book, or are offended (emotional) that Weissbluth states extinction as the most effective method of sleep training. He is giving scientific information, so he is just stating that the evidence is there to support extinction as the fastest working method. He encourages you to choose the method of sleep training that is right for your family. I personally did not have to practice any sleep training method. Once I got my son (now 9 months) on an appropriate schedule and bedtime, things starting falling into place on their own. You can also check out Weissbluth's blog. I've found it very helpful as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Healthy Sleep Habits, Happy Child","review":"Very helpful and informative.

I liked the fact that this book details the sleep cycles and habits of most children, through the months of the first year and beyond. He does a good job explaining why babies and toddlers sleep the way they do. However, I feel that this is more \\"biased\\" than I originally thought. As a new mom of a 4 month old little girl, I do not personally identify with CIO methods. This book seems to lean more toward CIO methods as the ones that \\"work.\\" While they may in fact \\"work\\" for some people, I do not believe in letting my baby cry-it-out at this point. So while this book gave me helpful sleep related information, I would recommend Elizabeth Pantley's \\"No Cry Sleep Solution\\" if you don't prefer the CIO methods."},{"rating":"2","title":"Should be mandatory reading for new parents!","review":"This is a great book for parents who have the child who does not sleep through the night. This book has a clear cut course of action of what to do to get your child to sleep through the night at certain ages. I wish I had learned this information when my son was first born. However, I purchased it when he was six months old and waking up every hour through the night.After starting these techniques, my son started taking 1 to 2 hour naps and sleeping six to seven hours at a time at night. Plus he was a much happier little boy. Now my son is 18 months old and sleeps through the night.If you can't stand to hear your child cry, well this book may not be for you. However, as this book says in the end all children will have to cry a little to learn to sleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"frustrating writing style detracts from any potential points","review":"Dr. Wiessbluth may have had some good points in his text, but the editors should be fired for not helping draw these points out.

My son was sleeping non-stop during the day and not at all at night. The book does a great job of not only offering suggestions of sleep-training methods, but also explaining the biology behind sleep. It helped me understand what my son was going through. After a few weeks, we saw dramatic improvement in his sleeping patterns. He's not quite yet sleeping through the night, but at least now my husband and I know that we're on the right path!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Ideas, but a bit harsh.","review":"I got some good ideas and information from this book, but a lot of the \\"let them cry for an hour\\" seemed harsh. My 10 month old son didn't make it to 20 minutes before he would get so worked up he would projectile vomit across the room and choke on it. I found the No Cry Sleep Solutions to fit us much better, especially since we have co slept his whole life so far."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay, if you're looking for support to CIO","review":"Pros:-Sleep is very important, and the author makes that clear. He gives you a good idea for how much sleep a baby needs. We have started putting our daughter down for a nap 1-2 hours after waking in the morning which makes a big difference. We would never have thought of that if not for this book.-The author suggests keeping a sleep log, which is also very helpful. We haven't done it exactly as he said (make a bar graph, yeah like I really have time for that!) but just writing it down has helped us to see patterns in her sleep. We have a small spiral notebook where we write things like \\"Wake: 7am. Nap at 8:30\\"Cons:-This is a Cry it Out book. His advice for when CIO doesn't work (because the kid vomits) is 'don't let them cry so much'.If you're looking for validation on your decision to CIO, I recommend it, but if you can't do that (like us) then try something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Impractical","review":"I liked the information about sleep in this book but it was hard to read, very boring. Otherwise he recommends putting your baby to sleep from 6-8 in the evening because that's how the babies circadian clock supposedly works, but that just doesn't work for us and I felt judged for not wanting to put my kids down to bed at sunset. For some people this might work but for most modern parents unless you want to be tied to the house while you have small children I wouldn't recommend his methods."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a MUST HAVE for any parent.","review":"I received this book as a gift from a friend of mine who said it had saved her life and her sanity! I started reading it before I actually had my son and got myself familiar with the information, methods, etc. and I was well prepared by the time my son was born. When people ask me how I am able to get my son to go to bed so easily (put him in his crib and leave, with no crying at all), I tell them it is all because of this book. I have given one to all of my friends who have gotten pregnant. One reason I love the book so much is that it breaks down into age groups and gives several examples and methods to use when your child is 0-3 months, 6-12, months, etc. I refer to the book at least once a week and every time I have tried what he suggests, it works exactly like he says it will. Anyone who is expecting a baby, or is having too many sleepless nights should have this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"One size fits all doesn't work.","review":"The problem with this book is that it offers assurances that if you just follow the rules things will work. Well, I did that and nothing worked. Instead, I got hours on end of screaming and felt like a terrible person."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terribly written","review":"I agree with all the reviewers who said this book is completely unintelligible. There is ZERO organization - the sections seem to ramble on and on and become repetitious - and he is constantly contradicting himself. I liked Ferber's book much better, if only for the clarity. I will probably use Weissbluth's total extinction rather than Ferber's gradual approach, but everything else Ferber has to say is much more helpful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barely readable","review":"Dr. Weissbluth may have great insights on infant sleep, but you won't be able to tell what they are from this book, which is poorly written and poorly organized. For my money, Richard Ferber's book is a lot more understandable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get Ferber's book","review":"Weissbluth's book is poorly orgainized, wordy, and hard to read. It comes across as preachy despite attempts to cite academic sources. Besides that, it didn't work for us (and many others). \\"Why is my baby so different from all these mentioned in this book?\\" I wondered. I expected to hear her cry for 3-7 nights and then sleep well...SHE DID (for about a night...then we were back in the same boat for another week...then another)! Besides that, some of the ideas are ridiculous, to me (eg putting your child to bed for a super early bedtime when necessary). I would NEVER consider putting my child to bed before 6pm again, but for some reason, under Dr. Weissbluth's persuasion, even tried this b/c of his \\"sleep begets sleep\\" philosophy. If you read this book, you start thinking all babies need 12 hours of sleep at night + 2 2 hour naps. BULL!! What finally worked? Ferbers method--mostly because of his more realistic expectations of how much a baby SHOULD be sleeping."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Sleep Bible!","review":"This book became the \\"sleep bible\\" of a Mommy talk class I attended when my daughter was about 8 weeks old and not napping. We really liked it because it gives extremely helpful and basic advice on how to teach your baby to develop healthy sleep patterns...basically how to recognize the signs of sleep in a child before they get to the screaming, red-eyed, exhausted state. It helped us first time parents understand that a certain amount of crying is to be expected with naps and bedtime, and we aren't \\"evil parents\\" if she does cry! With this book, we were able to help our daughter develop a great sleep pattern, by watching her and understanding when she needed to sleep, and the importance of naps and sleep to her health and attention span. I think I highlighted the entire book with a pen! A must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Healthy Sleep Habits, Happy Child","review":"This book saved me. My husband and I needed training and guidance to get our baby boy to sleep. He was about 4 months old and was only sleeping 5 hours per night. We were both working and exhausted.

Everyone is happy, rested and healthy!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a Difference!!","review":"This book changed our lives!! Our four month old daughter would have crying spells for hours in the evening and we couldn't understand why. It took 2 hours to get her down each night leaving us completely exhausted. Then she would wake at least 1-2 times every night. We had no idea she needed to go to bed sooner to fix the situation. Now, she sleeps 6:15-6:00 non-stop EVERY night. She now sees her crib as a peaceful place and falls asleep within a few minutes. We finally have quiet time in the evenings and it's wonderful to know she's getting her rest. I would recommend this book to all new parents!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A crying shame","review":"We tried this approach. Our sweet daughter cried until she threw up. We cried to hear her. And our neighbors thought we were abusing her. She became clingy and fussy all day long afraid to be left alone. Even worse, she STILL wasn't sleeping well or napping either. I continued to look for answers and found better more humane and successful ideas in the NO-CRY Sleep Solution by Pantley. I now report a sleeping child, happy parents and a quiet household."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written & badly structured","review":"My wife and I each bought copies of this book separately with a view to helping to establish healthy sleep patterns for our 3-month old. We both found the book to be very poorly written. Weissbluth jumps from place to place, idea to idea, in a very rambling fashion, without ever really getting to the point. It's as though he has dictated the text to a dictaphone, had someone type it up, and never read it back. The only idea of value I have gleaned from the book is to put the baby to bed at 6pm rather than 8pm. No doubt there are other pearls to be discovered by sifting through the book, but it is so badly written that the sifting becomes very hard work indeed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing, made things worse.","review":"We had a couple of recommendations for this book since my 2 year old son has never slept all night and will only fall asleep by nursing him or driving him around. This book set us back - way back. Before trying this \\"cry it out\\" method, I had my son almost completely weened from nursing. I approached the method open minded and tried it the way he recommends. Now my son is clingy and wants to be nursed constanly, he is scared to death of his crib and won't even go into his bedroom. He has never been so insecure. We feel as though we have broken his little spirit. The scientifics on why sleep is necessary makes perfect sense, however, the method is too cruel for us. The author does contradict himself over and over as stated in other reviews. I'll keep searching for a gentler approach to our problem as I do not believe letting a child cry himslef to pure exhaustion is the way to go."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent book","review":"This book was, by far, the most helpful book I have read in this area. I have read and reread this book many times with my first and second child, and still seem to find new information which is helpful. Both of my children are excellent sleepers, in spite of my second child having severe colic, and I truly owe a great deal of it to this book. I now understand children's sleep cycles and their development of sleep. I also have a better understanding of the importance of healthy sleep habits early on and of napping. I have been told many times I was lucky to have two happy babies, but honestly, they were happy because they were well rested."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of crying involved","review":"Here's a quote from the book \\"If we place an arbitrary limit on the duration of crying at night, we train our child to cry to that predetermined time. When it is open-ended, the child learns to stop protesting and to fall asleep.\\" Well, sure. Have you ever cried yourself to sleep? Exhaustion and agony work. This requires a hard heart and lots of crying. He also says \\"We are leaving him alone to forget the expectation to be picked up.\\" We are talking about a BABY here, a baby who deserves and needs to picked up and should expect to be picked up.

A better more peaceful NO CRY way."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book needs an Editor, Badly!","review":"This book probably has good advise, but its burried in so much unimportant information that I got so frustrated and gave up on it. It was like the book was never properly edited and was compiled by a college student pulling an all-nighter to get it done on time.

However, the writing is so poor that it is very difficult to get the goods. Sentences are often long and ambiguous due to fuzzy modifiers. Several phrases like \\"or several weeks later for infants born prematurely\\" are repeated far too often. Organization of chapters is deceptively sensible, but the contents of each chapter often contain paragraphs that belong in other chapters, leaving the reader confused as to whether the recommendations apply to the featured age group. Chapters contain client vignettes that are often inserted in places having nothing to do with the preceding or subsequent paragraphs, adding to the confusion.

I threw my copy in our fireplace."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still reading, but very helpful so far","review":"I'm still reading this book, but within the first few pages I found great help. My 14 month old did not sleep well at night. He would wake up every 2 hours or so crying and we were so exhausted we'd just bring him in our bed in the middle of the night so we can get some sleep. Last night he slept for 10 hours straight and he only woke up crying once. I call that a miraculous blessing. I'm hoping for a repeat performance tonight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Love Love this book and program","review":"'Train them or they train you' is my motto as we try to keep a positive atmosphere with three babies two years old to 5 months. (twins plus a new baby). We started sleep training the twins at 4 m. I bought the singleton version of his book for the new baby and boy amd I glad. The two versions are invaluable as I trouble shoot. It is an ongoing process as you go through stages and ages... but to keep things consistent and positive I read everything I can and this program is truly a great way to manage the home."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good information if you can get through it...","review":"This book is not well written.

And if you want to instill discipline into your childs sleeping habits this is a book for you (though please note that it does play on one's emotions and fears a little). However our pedeatrician told us that the sleeping methods proposed in this book (and others) are not suitable for babies less than four months old."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I have a fussy two month old and a friend recommended this book so I bought it.

Otherwise don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak and lacking in areas","review":"I found several parts of this book that lacked important information. For example, when discussing the Cry It Out method, he fails to mention any of the ample scientific evidence showing the harmful effects of CIO training on neurologic development (a handful of these studies can be found on page 210 of The Baby Sleep Book by Sears - I would highly suggest reading them before practicing CIO). The author's comments on Attachment Parenting are unfortunately based on his misunderstanding of this wonderful approach to parenting, and gives the reader false information on AP. While I am not a hard core AP parent, I do agree with this approach and recommend AP books by Sears on sleep.The book is also long, 500 pgs. I don't know about you, but I don't have time to read a dense 500 pages!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A little disappointed","review":"I was a little disappointed in the book. It often seemed disorganized, vague or at times talked rather lofty. There were a few good nuggets of info, such as 'never wake a sleeping baby' and knowing how many hours of sleep a baby should be getting and at what intervals. However, I was looking for more step by step - do this to get your child to sleep, but it seemed more like anything goes - no real strategies for dealing with my child. And there were lots and lots of horror stories from parents about their children crying for hours on end, and now I'm quite petrified to deliver mine..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very confusing chapter breakups - too hard to use as a reference","review":"This book is very confusing (and I have been a book editor in the past)! The chapters for say months 1-4 include discussion about 8 month olds and jump around from age to age. Also there is no \\"strategy\\" page for each age group so a parent can turn to the book quickly to learn what to do. I hate reading this and i know of several others who agree, claiming it is about as understandable as reading a instruction manual for a stereo translated from japanese to english. the tenets of the book are spot on of you have the power to get through it, but because it is so all over the place i would not recommend this book. ferber's book is more concise and more understandable"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for worrywarts","review":"I bought this based on a friend's recommendation but find it incredibly frustrating. The book is littered with blackbox warnings about all of the ways your subtle mistakes can brain-damage your child. Sometimes these dictates contradict the text. On two separate pages, large warnings tell us \\"NEVER wake a crying baby.\\" But copy between those pages instructs us to \\"wake your baby in the morning in order to establish an age-appropriate midmorning nap that is needed to set the sleep scheduleThe tone here is annoyingly dogmatic; it's as if there is only one way to address sleep problems: Dr. Weissbluths.The real shame is that I'm sure there's some good information here, and I would love to read an approach other than Dr. Sears' (I love the Sears' baby book; I just want a second opinion). But the last thing an exhausted, anxious parent needs is this kind of poorly edited, one-sided fear mongering."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!!!","review":"It's a very practical book. Basically, RESPECT YOUR CHILD'S SLEEP PATTERNS. If you feel that sleep is important for your baby's growth and you follow the practical advice in the book, your child will form good sleeping patterns and habits and will sleep WELL! It worked amazingly with my first child and even better with my second baby! No one can believe how well they sleep. One is 20 months and one is 7 months. Both sleeping through the night with two naps a day that are 1 1/2 hours each.

The key thing is you HAVE to follow it and it works - no excuses...\\"well, I just couldnt be home for naptime...OR I couldnt let them cry\\". If you follow the book, you have no more than 3 days of stress then peace in your house. I have a 3 year old and 15 month twins and all 3 have slept well with a lot of work and dedication with the information in this book.I wont say it was always easy but it always works! My kids are well rested and we are all happy.I dont abuse their schedule which is key so if I have to do something during sleep times, I get a sitter - I think its a short term expense for happy kids and peace in my house. They will only be little for a short time and let them be happy and rested so in turn I can be happy and rested. Its a win win!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Changed my Life!","review":"This book literally changed my life. I didn't know what was wrong with my baby girl, as she cried all the time.

It just makes sense that as parents we must know what's best for our child. It's up to us to set the schedules and make the decisions. Following old adages like, \\"he'll let you know what he's tired\\" is foolish. You wouldn't let your child decide that he didn't need to eat. It's just as dangerous to have inadequate sleep as it is to have improper nourishment. We all should remember that we're the parents, and they're just children. They need us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally Sleeping!","review":"When I bought this book, my daughter (4 months) was sleeping through the night, but from about 11:00 pm or later till around 10:00 or 11:00 am. She wasn't taking naps much at all. At bedtime I had to make sure she was in a deep sleep before I could put her in her crib or she would start screaming. After reading this book, she now at 5 months, takes 3 naps a day around the same time and goes to bed no later than 7:00 pm and sleeps until right around 7:00 am. I also put her down awake all the time and she rarely cries anymore. When she does cry now, it's brief and not screaming. Usually a pacifier is all she needs to calm down. This book is awesome, I wish I had read it sooner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Saved my life!","review":"By the time we tried this book, I was at the end of my rope. I had held my daughter for 23 hours a day since she was born. I read this book and within 3 nights, she was falling asleep on her own in her own bed without tears. The first couple of nights were hard to handle, but they were well worth it in the long run. She is now such a happy baby. She sleeps from 6:30 pm until around 7:30 am. I recommend this book to everyone I know!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I was a walking zombie until I read this book.","review":"Thank God we discovered this book. My wife and I were walking around like zombies for months after our first child was born (he had colick too!). Of all the books out there for new parents to read (or even \\"old pros\\" who want to get some shut eye), I'd rate this one in the top five. One caveat however: Don't buy this book until after you have joined the ranks of the walking zombies, the sleepless. Only then will you truly appreciate the wonderful respite this book will guide you to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sleep...but at what cost?","review":"As a busy mother who craves sleep I was motivated to read this book. I believe that the methods may work but that doesn't make them right.The key to this book is to let your child cry without giving a response (parent does not come to the baby's aid, no matter how long or how hard the baby cries.)I have a hard time justifying letting my baby cry endlessly because his immature sleep patterns disrupt my busy evening. I question the long-term affects of this trauma on the child, and wonder how necessary it is, as a baby's night waking is normal and temporary.I wanted to be a mother, and dealing with night waking is one aspect of parenthood, and luckily, one that passes. I found more loving and gentle methods described in two other sleep books: Nighttime Parenting and The No-Cry Sleep Solution."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Only Book A New Parent Really Needs","review":"Thanks to Dr. Weissbluth my son is now sleeping through the night (12 hours).

Don't buy this book.","review":"I picked up this book in hopes of finding ideas to help my son nap better during the day. Half way through the book I'm thoroughly frustrated and confused. The book is poorly written, has filler content and is full of contradictions. There's so much junk in this book that I have trouble reading through it and picking out the gems (if there are any). I'm also suspicious of the author's \\"research\\". It's anecdotal at best. If you look carefully, he uses language like \\"I think\\" and \\"it may lead to..\\" which basically means he's just giving his opinion. Don't buy this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing and hard to follow if you don't have enough time","review":"This book offers some good facts about baby sleeping, but as a new parent with limited time, I wish I could have a firm plan that I can try it out. I found this book difficult to follow and confusing for the most part. I wish I had enough time to sit down and read it all and then digest it for another month, and then make out a plan for my baby. In this book, there is no plan or whatsoever, just basic facts and endless warnings. This is not a step by step program to me, this is a pediatrician's notebook on baby sleep. If you do some research or have to take part in a test on baby sleep, this is the right book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have for new mommies","review":"This book is incredible and a lifesaver! We started using it when our daughter was almost four months and I wish I had heard about the book sooner. She is now six months and sleeping 10-12 hours a night. Her naps have also improved dramatically. I have given this book as a gift to many of my friends who are first time moms. It is an easy read and has multiple approaches. If your child is having trouble sleeping and you don't know what to do, this book is a must!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A lifesaver for this Mommy of twins!","review":"This book was recommended to me when my twins were four months old. At that time they did well at night but wouldn't nap. I loved this book because it gives parents choices as to how to put their child to sleep and whether to let their child cry it out (which isn't necessary if you are following the method and observing your child). I charted my children's sleep and within one week they were napping soundly and consistently. His theories of \\"sleep begets sleep\\" and timing of sleep have proven time and again to be true. Now, at 21 months, my twins are still the best sleepers of any children I know and are happy, delightful joys to be with. While the book isn't specifically geared to twins, the methods are adaptable to multiples. This book saved my sanity and made parenting twins a double delight - I have more than twice the fun! I give it to all my expectant friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best sleep book I've read yet","review":"I read this book over and over.

All over the place.","review":"The book should have been half as long as it is. The author is so repetitive, which makes the book very difficult to read. There are too many stories/analogies.

I can't believe it worked.","review":"My first boy was an excellent sleeper, so I kept coming up with excuses for the second one. Teething, temperature, allergies, etc. My second boy woke up every 3 hours - sometimes 2 hours! He had only 4 random nights of sleeping 8 hours straight until he was 8.5 months. I finally hit rock bottom and just wasn't a functioning adult. We have only a 2 bedroom condo, alerted the neighbors on either side of us, put our toddler in our room for the weekend, and put the baby in the toddler's room to cry it out. It took 2 nights. It's been 2 months and he is still sleeping through the night! He does wake up occaisonally, but I don't feed him at all. He is now in his brother's room! I would give 5 stars, except the book is difficult to access quickly and jump around/return to a subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"There are many other books that offer more helpful and kind advice.

We used it for both of our children. The difference in moods and behavior between our children when they take naps versus when they don't is amazing to witness.

I did not enjoy reading this book, nor did I find it helped me in any way as it details on and on (and on) about sleep problems and then only gives a few bullet points of ways to \\"help,\\" which actually aren't helpful at all. I don't understand why 2 people recommended this book to me. It's worthless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not terribly helpful for us","review":"On the positive side, this book does an excellent job of explaining a baby's sleep needs and helped us to realize that our daughter was very sleep deprived. However, other than encouraging us to \\"find the window\\" of where she first becomes sleepy, this book did little to help us solve the problem. This book is not very well organized and a little bit hard to follow (although I read the digital version which may have contributed to that) All I was looking for was a way to scoot our daughter's bedtime from midnight to a more reasonable 8pm. Unfortunately this book did not give me any good advice on getting her down sooner."},{"rating":"1","title":"great, if you have no life...","review":"this book is really useful if you don't have a job, other children, or any life to distract you from your baby's nap and bedtime schedule.

Had it been written a little friendlier - easy 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Might be good if you read before delivery....","review":"I read this book when my daughter was eight months old. I did NOT find it very helpful. He contradicts himself often and cites numerous research studies and goes on and on and on for nearly 500 pages. Now, what parent, who is having a difficult time with their baby sleeping, has the time to read this book?!I am a follower of the Baby Whisperer method (Tracy Hogg) and his philosophy is opposite hers. He prefers the crying it out method. He says it's fine to let the baby cry for an hour.He also writes a lot about \\"colicky\\" babies and this was something I didn't have a problem with and therefore a large section of the book was not important to me.If you read this book before delivery it might be helpful. I did not find it helpful as I'd already discovered many of his insights on timing the naps/bedtime, routine consistency, etc by the time my little one was eight months old.Good Luck"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good science, harsh practice","review":"Yes, sleep is important and this book explains why. However, I must disagree with the 'sleep at all costs' approach of letting a baby cry endlessly until he wears himself out to sleep. Just because he sleeps I don't believe that is solving the base problems. I found a more thoughtful approach to solving the underlying problems that prevent sleep, and more humane solutions, in The No Cry Sleep Solution book by Pantley. I perceive the crying-to-sleep approach as a sort of \\"throw your hands up and let the baby figure it out on his own\\" approach, and I would rather solve the problems that prevent sleeping and encourage gentle, happy sleep for my child."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is fabulous!!","review":"I bought this book when my baby daughter was born, my 2 year old son was having a terrible time sleeping and we had tried everything....the newborn was easier believe me!I read this book cover to cover when it arrived. It is so sensible and practical that I was having those \\"aahhh hhaa\\" moments as I read. I changed several things that I was doing with my son - based on the timing of his sleeps, and I worked really hard at increasing the overall amount of his sleep. He is a dream child now 4 months down the track it is hard to remember how awful things were.This book has also changed the way I have done things with my baby and she is a dream child too!!I have reccommended this book to so many people it's not funny. It is practical, sensible and down to earth. It doesn't tell you to leave your child crying, nor does it tell you to sleep with them in your bed.This is the most useful parenting book I have ever bought."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very informative","review":"I really got a lot out of his book. He tailors sleep shaping concepts to child temperment which proved very beneficial to me. The organization of the book is slightly confusing but forgivable- he is, after all, a doctor and not a writer. Take the information to confirm what you might already be thinking; you are the parent and have wisdom for your child. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"CRY IT OUT BOOK","review":"This book is a cry it out book.

I feel that there are better options for both parent and child."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frightening.","review":"Rocking and nursing, says the author, are detrimental to the child. Checking on the child during the night and offering sympathy and comfort are taboo as well. By doing those things, parents are spoiling their children and setting up bad habits that will haunt them for the rest of their lives. By avoiding them, even at the expense of screaming until hoarse and vomiting - and beyond! - we are creating autonomous, well-behaved members of society.Heaven forfend that parents might actually consider being PARENTS to their CHILDREN. After all, we wouldn't want to miss out on a little sleep just so we can reassure our children that parents will always be there for them no matter what.If you bought this pile of tripe, I urge you to return it and find something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this book!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I tried his method to a tee, by putting our infant to sleep at 4:30-5 p.m. He got so used to it that he can't make it past then. He of course got hungry at 3:30 a.m. and was ready to start the day. Our 3.5 year old didn't wake till 6 a.m., so we of course had no more than 5 hours to sleep. When the kids were sick, we were lucky to get 2 hours of fragmented sleep. We could never hang out at BBQs, as we had to be home at 4 p.m. Even if we did get our son to sleep later, he would still wake at 3:30 a.m. due to learned hunger pangs.

I'm an information junky and usually take a lot away from any book or article I read. Not so with this book! It is one of the most poorly organized books I've ever read, the information is contradictory, the studies he sites are worthless (small sample sizes, no true cause/effect relationships--he says too little sleep causes bad temperments, but can't a bad temperment be the cause for less sleep?!), and he provides no solid method to apply! Basically all the book does is confuse the reader and make her feel worse because not only does she have a child who is sleeping poorly, she also just wasted time and money reading a worthless book. Don't buy it or read it. Just look for signs of sleepiness in your child and do whatever you can to get them to sleep and stay asleep for as long as possible."},{"rating":"2","title":"It REALLY works","review":"I am the mother of 4 1/2 month old twins. They have 2 completely different personalities. I would be totally insane if not for this book.

They have been sleeping through the night since 2 months and their naps are getting better and better with VERY little (if any) crying or fussing.If you follow the book and trust in it (no matter how hard) - it can really help.

However if you want some solid, balanced, research based guidelines for teaching your child to sleep on their own within the first year, this is a great book. I used these guidelines with my children and found the stories, timelines and ideas both comforting and helpful. The book is neither legalistic (\\"if you don't follow this program, your child is doomed for life.\\") nor unrealistic (\\"If you follow this program, then you will never have a crying baby.\\") This isn't a program but guidelines of what to expect when and some methods to get to the goals of regular naps, solid nighttime sleep and an independent sleeper.

Any adult who has not had a good nights sleep understands how it makes you feel the next day, so why would it be any different for a baby, child or teenager?I can understand how this book would be hard to follow if you are a single parent or a working mom. But if you are married and able to stay at home I think this method is awesome! Our friends use it on their 12 month old and he is such a great little boy!The only complaint I have with this book is that it is a little hard to read.

I began with a son who fought and argued, screamed and cried before bed, to a son who happily goes to bed EVERY NIGHT without ANY fussing -EVERY SINGLE NIGHT.

My baby now sleeps 11 hours a night (vs the 8 she use to)and naps 3-4 times per day with lengths varying from an hour to 3 hours (vs. 20-30 minutes before). I use to have to rock my baby into a deep sleep before putting her down, now, I soothe her for five minutes tops, put her down when still awake and she does the rest.My baby now laughs and smiles all the time! Three weeks ago, this was NOT the norm. And I never once had to let my child \\"cry it out\\". If you implement the techniques this book suggests, crying it out in NOT neccessary!If you are sleep deprived, your search for sleep lies within the pages of this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely useless","review":"I found this book utterly useless and a waste of my time. The tone of the book is very preachy. He spends pages telling you how important sleep is, that every parent should ensure their child gets a good night's rest - but if I didn't agree, why would I be spending my time reading this book? Then he contradicts his own position arguing that you shouldn't let other people make you feel guilty about your parenting style, completely unaware that is what he was doing for the last upteen pages. This was just the first contradiction I noticed. He also kept repeating the fact that baby's should only be up 1-2 hours at a time. Which is only true with newborns, but he never clarifies that.I attempted to get my child to bed earlier, as he recommends, but my baby just started waking up earlier in the morning.Save your time (much less your money) and try a different book.
