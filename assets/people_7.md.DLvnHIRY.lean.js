It started out fairly boring and got significantly better later. This would have been a better book if it got more exciting in the beginning. We read this for our social studies class and I doubt I would have finished the book if it wasn't assigned as homework. It only became exciting when we were three quarters of the way done. Even as we got closer to the end it wasn't all that great. Over all I would say this was a really bad book, so don't go reccomending it to all your friends right away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book for Teenagers and Adults","review":"I read this book when I was about 13 and loved it.

They weren't *very* interested at first, as the other reviewers wrote it does start out kind of slow & dull, but as the story progressed we were hooked! After the first few chapters we couldn't put it down and we were disappointed when it ended.I'm giving this book one star less than five because of the slow beginning. But if you are a homeschooler looking for a good fiction book to supplement a unit on Ancient Egypt than this is an excellent choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry to Say, but......","review":"Well, I noticed a lot of people loved this book but i sure didn't. We had to read it for a class project and nobody really liked it at all. It did get a little better towards the end but I dont think that the ending fit the book. Well, the story line of the book is slow and it doesnt grab your attention. If it wasnt mandatory for us to read this book... I would have dropped it after the first couple chapters. Maybe this book just wasnt my type of book but most people i have talked to that read this book agree with me. This book, is however, somewhat informative about Ancient Egypt, but is still very dull and boring.

This is the worst book I have ever TRIED to read in my whole life. It's a good book if you want to go to sleep REALLY fast.

This book, by my standards, is a well written and detailed novel. One of the things I am greatly pleased with is the fact that the author was able to keep such a long and detailed climax. She is also able to amazingly describe the life of Ranofer, the main character, and how he was imprisoned by his evil half brother Gebu. I believe this is a great read for kids and adults of all ages and is fun as a book for a school report or as just a pleasure read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A painless way to learn about ancient Egypt!","review":"I started reading this book aloud to my daughter, and I couldn't put it down after the first few chapters. I had to read the whole book to find out what happened to Ranofer, and to find out how he could resolve his problems with his abusive half-brother and fulfill his dreams.Reading this book really helped spark my interest in learning more about ancient Eygpt. The book is beautifully descriptive, and made me feel like I was there. It really helped me see the beauty in that culture. As I read other books about ancient Egypt, I realized I had already learned and retained quite a bit about it already just by reading this children's book! I think the author really researched her subject well.I would highly recommend this book as an educational book, or just for fun. After the first few chapters, the story does become pretty exciting, and at the end I was left wanting more."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was an exciting, adventuresome book.","review":"The Golden Goblet was an okay book.

Mcgraw makes this book exciting and suspenseful. It is like an adventure and mystery in one! She makes you feel as if you are really there in Egypt at the marketplace or in a Pharaoh's tomb.The Golden Goblet takes place in ancient Thebes. The main character is a boy named Ranofer who wants to be a goldsmith like his father but is forced to work as a stone cutter's apprentice by his half brother Gebu. Once he thinks everything is going wrong in his life, he finds a secret about his half brother and things suddenly start to change.The first chapter is a little bit slow but once you get past that,the rest is very easy to read and fast paced. I would definitely recommend this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"8 The Mormon Proposition","review":"I feel the movie \\"8 the Mormon Proposition\\" was very well produced and accomplished the purpose for which it was produced. I believe it is honest and gets the point across to expose the bigotry and hatred that religion stands for in so many areas of our society. It is because of work like this that the intolerance of groups of people are brought out into the light and educates people on the subject it is written on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Documentary About the Death of Gay Rights in California","review":"This film documents the way the Mormon Church pushed through California Proposition 8, which denied gays the right to marry. It seems as egregious a violation of the separation of church and state as any I have ever heard about. And apparently the IRS thinks so, too, as it launched an investigation after the election into whether the LDS should lose their tax exempt status.Some of the stories of gay Mormons being abused are pretty horrible, but it's a story that needs to be told."},{"rating":"2","title":"Frightening","review":"Powerful documentary about the behind-the-scenes involvement of the Mormon church in the passage of California's Proposition 8, which defined marriage to be a strictly heterosexual union. This is a completely and unabashedly biased film, although it is pretty hard to argue with the secret documents and particularly the film and sound clips coming from church leaders.Do churches and other private organizations have the right to discriminate against others based on who they are and what they do? Of course. Do individuals have the right to view others as sinners and morally corrupt? Absolutely! But do churches have the right to shield themselves behind the first amendment while meddling in politics? Ah, there's the question!Deeply disturbing, frightening, emotionally wrenching, this is a film that should be seen by all who are interested in civil liberties."},{"rating":"2","title":"How the Religion of a Few is Shaping Government of All.","review":"This documentary is a real eye-opener for everyone. You don't have to be a supporter of marriage equality to want to see this one. In our current political era, where the Republican nominee will likely be a Mormon, it makes sense for every American to know how this organization works. The shocking disregard for our laws forbidding religous bodies from interferring in politics will stun you. I hope it will also move viewers to file suit with the IRS against the Church of Jesus Christ of the Later Day Saints - the Mormons. If you think Mitt Romney's religion does matter, watch this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth Watching and Sharing","review":"I saw 8: The Mormon Proposition at Sundance and it is worth seeing. It is getting extended standing ovations at every festival it plays at and anyone feeling to criticize it should see it first. They will find as Variety's review states: \\"8' actually spends more time trying to humanize homosexuals than to demonize those who hate them."},{"rating":"1","title":"What you would expect","review":"My guess is that most who choose to watch this film are those already looking for an indictment of the Mormon Church - and they're find what they're looking for. This is one of those films that plays to the biases of a particular group and does not offer a balanced view. In so doing, the director ensures the film has a committed, motivated target audience. There are, admittedly, many valid points which the film raises. However, it fails to even attempt to fairly address opposing views and instead presents strawman arguments that are easily dispatched. Watch this film if you already hate Mormons (or organized religion in general). You'll be pleased. But look elsewhere if you want a reasoned discussion of the issues."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hatred Documentary","review":"This film depicts a congregated form of hatred towards gays from the Mormon community, however not just Mormons but a lot of Christian sects dislike the gay community. This film is just another form of hatred, but not towards the Christians, towards the Mormons instead. In other words does two wrongs make a right? Lets hate those that you?"},{"rating":"1","title":"This sort of religious defamation belongs in an earlier century","review":"This poorly made movie is a composite of hateful misrepresentations and distortions of the beliefs and practices of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. It is intended to malign a religious minority rather than to explain or inform viewers about why they would come forth to defend democracy.Perhaps its one contribution is in exposing the hate and anti-Christian bigotry that lie at the base of the homosexual marriage movement. Data from throughout the world confirms that the movement has amazingly little to do with anyone 'marrying.' No significant percent of the homosexual population has in any country that allows it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great front bezel","review":"this thing is great made of the same material as teh Lian li cases it looks awesome!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"unwatchable","review":"the reason there is no trailer is because this movie is horrible. the acting is bad, the filming is bad, it is the worst movie ever"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love!!!!!","review":"Also, since becoming a member/customer of Amazon, I have been quite happy with all of my purchases and the sellers.

An utter joke.","review":"Frankly put, this book provides no detail about realistic customer service. As someone who has actually worked retail in my life, I can tell you... This book only encourages a sense of entitlement among those who read it. It's an instruction manual for those who wish to whine, cry, yell, scream, abuse employees and in general throw a tantrum to get what they want.I've always been taught to treat others how you wish to be treated. From experience, being kind, respectful, and understanding is far more likely to get rules bent for you as well as have staff actually enjoy and look forward to your presence.

Reading it was a somewhat painful experience. Although there are some excellent concepts, his use of language is immature and highly repetitive. Everything is \\"like\\" something else. Some of his comparisons are so far-fetched, even after long pondering, the point is lost.I believe this must be a first effort and a self-published book. It is in need of the blue pencil of a good editor, and at least one re-write.As a collector of vampire tales, I am happy to have it in my library, but I would be hard pressed to recommend this to anyone but a hard core reader of tales of the undead."},{"rating":"2","title":"love these cute shoes","review":"very unique and cute shoes, bought 3 pairs, not great for rushing around town per say because the bottom of the shoe is a bit smaller than the top making it easier to fall if you run or walk to fast. but who cares when they are so cute and versitile. i wear them to work and play. my office is office casual."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent","review":"its amazing how a CD that is over a decade old can still school every band in its genre years after its initial release.

So far as I know, he died in 1888. And the book title is misleading. If the book was condensed to include only that information about Chief Ouray, it would be a pamphlet, maybe not even a dozen pages. The book is 210 pages but heavily padded with images. Perhaps there isn't too much information on Ouray, but if that's the case, this is still poorly written and a mishmash of details.

But time passes and I kept up with the prog rock types and the big name bands, but Thin Lizzy? not so much.Some of the lyrics actually did stick in my head - especially the Cowboy Song - with that insanely great twin-lead and the - well - suggestive lyrics in the break - but I hadn't really thought about it for 20ish years until a young friend of mine (she's younger than the album ;) ) mentioned it.And I went - \\"Yeahhhhh!!\\"So I bought it.And - it's not a great remaster, but it it sounds like an album should sound, and the songs are GREAT! alot of variety in tempos and subject matter - the band just plain kicks BUTT and it's just - great!So buy it! it's what - 10 bux? c'mon!

I have not purchased Newton yet, and may not, due to reading of the reviews. But, in comparison to the other series out there, Baby Einstein is the top. I still use the other videos, because they seem to provide more direct education. Yet, I have to work harder to keep my son's attention with the other videos.

The production on these EPs was lousy, and the words often hard to make out. That didn't matter then, and it hardly matters now. This was about passion rather than fashion, which separated them from the Brit punks and New Wavers. Or as Nathan Strejcek so nicely put it on Dischord No. 1, \\"Instead of studying theory, we're gonna get up and go!\\" What keeps me from giving this another star is the aforementioned lousy production, which often subdues the bass in the G.I. and Youth Brigade EPs, which are pretty fierce on their own.Any fan of old harDCore should snap this one up.

Granted, the movie has some funny lines, but it's no comedy.What I AM going to tell you is that this is a good movie if you want a fast-paced action flick. It has clever heists, some amusing dialogue, a couple of great chase sequences, some very pituresque locales (the first part of the film was shot in Europe), and the players all give very solid performances. As another reviewer noted, this is a great popcorn flick.Was THE ITALIAN JOB the most memorable movie of 2003? No, but the buzz surrounding it was pretty positive.

With Mark Wahlberg in the cast, I should have been warned. He contributed mightily to the destruction of the \\"Planet of the Apes\\" movie franchise. In this one, he plays his usual cocky, smirking self. Why these movie makers decided to remake an okay action flick from the 70s is a mystery. You'd think that with so many countless movie majors and movie buffs and aspiring screenwriters desperate to see their work on screen, movie moguls would give them a chance--instead of feasting voraciously on past glories. I'm preparing to watch yet another remake--\\"Texas Chainsaw Massacre\\"--and I really really hope I'm going to like it because it will have to be damned good to surpass the l973 original.

On the downside, nearly every frame contained an advertisement for some product ...headsets, TV's, cars, stereos and computers (the brand name sticker on laptops cannot usually be read upside down!). The dialogue was rubbish, the characters were sterotypes, and the plot laughably predictable.

What \\"Ronin\\" did a few years ago and to a lesser extent \\"Bourne Identity\\" did as recently as last year, \\"Italian Job\\" takes one step further: sweat-your-palms car chase cameos. Only, the setting is LA.Mini Cooper (now a BMW number) makes it possible with all the slickness of a lean and mean vehicle and the climax shots are dazzling. If you are looking for an old fashioned fast-paced action flick, this is your bag.The story is not altogether unpredictable (barring a couple of decent plot twists), in fact the basic theme is based on Michael Caine's 1969 movie of the same name. The action is of a typical 21st century variety, but without any of the computer-aided farces as in \\"Matrix Reloaded\\".

So now they have enlisted the mentor's daughter (Charlize Theron) who is a top notch safecracker and are going to pull another job (this one's in Los Angeles) to get revenge on their former partner.

And of course there is the mini-Cooper, the other star of this movie.

He takes everyone else's share of the loot, kills the safecracker leader of the gang and leaves the rest for dead, but they methodically plot revenge to get their gold back - adding the 'legit' safecracker daughter of the assassinated safecracker to the team. There are plenty of plot twists, one involving the Russian mob. Mark Wahlberg and Charlize Theron have wonderful chemistry and Edward Norton is perfectly cocky.

I've compared this version to both the DVD and the HD DVD version and both are superior to this version. The artifacts and quality in general is atrocious.Unfortunately, this is the problem with BluRay right now.

And the lovely Mark Wahlberg really makes this film, other cast member include: Edward Norton (fight club) Charlize Theron (monster) Seth Green (from buffy) Jason Statham (he was also in snacth and the kit kat adverts lol) & finally Mos Def (monsters ball)over all it is a good film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blu-ray transfer... horrible!!","review":"the movie is great.. there are plenty of movie reviews letting you know how people liked this movie. I've always loved it and wanted to get it on blu-ray. Unfortunately the blu-ray version is pathetic. the dvd version almost looks better. grainy picture, sounds \\"ok\\". Those are the two things you look for being spectacular in a blu-ray and they do not deliver.-I guess this just makes it obvious that some moves were never shot or made to go to high-def. If that is the case.. just don't make a blu-ray version then. I already own the movie, now I own it twice in what I feel is the same quality. So if your the person that's doing a slow conversion over to blu-ray of your favorite movies, you might want to skip this one unless it goes on sale for like $5. I paid $10 so its not a total bust.5 stars for the movie.. 1 star for the blu-ray"},{"rating":"2","title":"La job italiano","review":"This is a good compentant caper flick. Nicely written dialogue and easy performances make this a good film to watch. Many people have said this version is flat when compared to the original, but it holds up well.

After getting my Blu-ray player I knew I had to have this film. The video transfer is barely better than the DVD and lacks a lossless soundtrack. It doesn't even have the DTS soundtrack advertised on the cover. This is an utter disappointment for an otherwise great movie. There were rumors that Paramount was going to re-release the Blu-ray with remastered video and a lossless audio track(the original soundtrack was excellent). But it has yet to surface(and probably never will). This was not worth the purchase and I would have been better served just enjoying my DVD version."},{"rating":"2","title":"good but a little disappointing","review":"This movie started out great, but it seems to me that the movie, climaxed up to a certain point and then just fizzled out.

The scenes he cut, were great, and would have added extra laughs, and the whole part with that one guy driving was taken out.Movie all in all was good, but it just left me wanting more; i ended up watching all the extra features and still found myself unsatified enough that i went out and rented another movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like the movie, however better on DVD","review":"I enjoy this movie have it on both DVD and Blu Ray.

The picture is grainy at 1080P like others described especially at low light levels. When you spend the money upgrading to Blu-Ray, there is a certain expectation that the quality will be substantially better, and in this case it is awful. A pity since this is a great movie. Paramount, shame on you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie is great... Blu-Ray is terrible","review":"We have a top of the line Sony 52\\" XBR TV and Sony Blu-Ray player we purchased for Christmas and I purchased the Blu-ray version of this movie because we enjoy the movie so much. It wasn't worth it! It has trouble rewriting quickly during the action scenes. We actually compared it to the regular DVD that we own and to be honest... it isn't worth the additional expense to purchase the Blu-ray. Overall, we have noticed that with all of the older movies that have been converted to Blu-ray... they tend to be a disappointment in the blu-ray version for the same rewriting problems. However, animations are incredible and all of the new movies that have recently been released in the theaters that are just coming out on Blu-Ray are great... like Ironman... that one was incredible on Blu-ray."},{"rating":"1","title":"Entertaining movie, terrible Blu-ray quality.","review":"I enjoyed this movie, but the quality of this Blu-ray release is just awful. It was so bad in some spots that it became a distraction from the movie itself. I would recommend holding off until it is remastered."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blu-ray review","review":"This is in regard to the Blu-ray version of this movie. The film itself is quite enjoyable and worth watching. I bought the BR edition of this a few days ago, the menus and all look good, no problems there. The problem came in when I started watching the film itself...in the very first shot I could tell that something wasn't right. The picture quality was grainy and awful, it was annoying. I took it out and put in one of my other Blu-ray movies(thinking maybe my player was acting up) but it looked great. I bought it new so I don't know why it would look like that. Some parts (very few) looked the way they should, but mostly the picture was worse than most standard DVDs I've seen. So, I give the Blu-ray version one star, the movie itself I give four stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite movies now.","review":"Forget the old Italian Job, that has little to do with it. This movie is all about the action and mini coupes. Mark Walhberg, Edward Norton, and many others as master theives. Charlize Theron is the eye candy of the movie so there's someone for the guys to stare at, lol. It's just so thrilling to see them in action pulling off very complicated heists. The mini coupes are used a lot in this movie and are quite cool cars that seem to get the job done in the Italian job. It has drama, comedy, suspense and romance. Everything you'd like to have in a flick. So I give this movie a full 5 stars because I love to watch it over and over. I can't think of one bad thing to say about it. It's even at a bit of a bargain price! So grab a copy and you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"The second time was even better","review":"F. Gary Gray did a great job with this flic.

Then when I was strolling through a store I saw an advertisement and the \\"Cool\\" pokemon the game possesd, I went nuts!

First of all, practically everyone from Bulbasaur to Celebi you cannot capture. Also, you don't travel to Johto or Kanto. You can only catch 200 out of 386. There were more even before this game. 50 vanished! I believe that Nintendo has slouched off a lot. The names are pathetic (Mudkip, Torchic, Plus, Minus, Zigzagoon), and have stupid themes. Many game boy advance games have better graphics than this. One more big difference. No Team Rocket?! Magma or Aqua are strange names, and according to data, each team only favors 1 time, fire (magma [Ruby]), and water (Aqua [Sapphire]). However, I'd reccomend Sapphire.

It's absolutely brilliant! the graphics are amazing and the new poke'dex and team display look great! I happily played on it for five hours and can say that none of the fun died down during that time! the new poke'mon are inventive and different (Even if their names are rubbish!) and i think that this game's new two on two battling is a hell of a lot more fun and challenging.The reason why i only gave the game four stars is because i think the only downside is the fact that you can't bring very many of the old poke'mon into the new game and the new name's and poke'mon are not quite as appealing. If you are a fan of poke'mon but don't wish to leave your old 251 behind, then buy this game but don't get rid of your other ones, if you are willing to try something new, then get this, you won't be dissapointed! trust me, this game rocks and i can't wait to own it for myself!"},{"rating":"2","title":"is this the best pokemon game so far for u ??","review":"the best thing about this game is that it is so.......... so............. easy and fun i think that if u like it u should buy emreald it is 49000000x beter than any other pokemon game around !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring.","review":"Ruby really disappoints me.

I know one thing, just like with Gold and Silver, when you play it, then you play Gold, the graphics on Gold absolutely SUCK. I like how you can put two Pokemon out on the field and the controls are a lot better and easier. The graphics are awesome. The only reason I gave it a 4 is because of the childishness of the Title, Pokemon.

There are some standouts, like \\"New Tokyo is Calling,\\" but this same song appeared on their EP by the same name. \\"I Confess to All this Mess\\" is a great tune as well.

However, it appeared locally for only about two weeks, and after seeing the DVD I know why. It was a big disappointment. The plot very thin, and the dancing--with one exception--was a letdown.I think many people would watch this movie just to see the dancing. But there was so little of it, and what was shown was not even that good. The best dance demonstration was at the end of the film, perhaps as a consolation. If you'd like to see an excellent tango movie, check out \\"Tango\\". It was made in Buenos Aires about ten years ago, and might be available at your local library. You won't be disappointed with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Total Waste of TIme","review":"We rented the DVD based on past performances of Robert Duvall but this film is sub-standard of his history.

This is one of the poorest excuses for a movie that I have ever seen. The acting, including Duvall, is amateurish; the directing is non-existent (the use of the term improvisational is generous); and the dancing is poor. My wife and I stuck with it for about 20 minutes waiting for it to get better, thinking that it could not possibly be that bad--but it was. Duvall's impression of an assassin is ludicrous--he blows hot and cold from an unjustified anger at something in life--having grown old? to a patronizing quasi-stepfather...step grandfather??

The story is boring, the acting is lousy, the music is weak, and the dancing is in very short clips and is mediocre at best. There are a few nice scenes of the city - Buenos Aires that is - not Brooklyn. But that's about it. Clearly, Duvall wanted to make a movie about his passion - argentine tango. But he had no story. Apparently he worked on this script for many years. Maybe he should have stopped long time ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"An exercise in weak connections","review":"Robert Duvall could very well be the same character he played in The Apostle as he represents in Assassination Tango. He has the same impatient fervor, passionate obsessions, and bowlegged swashbuckling strut. Rather than get into a new character method, Duvall plays himself again with a new hobby - tango. And how to make a movie about tango interesting? Complement it with an \\"International Man of Murder Mystery\\". Duvall is a fine actor, and I do appreciate him. However, this movie bored me to tears. The tango dancing is exquisite. The indigineous Argentinians are charismatic, beautiful dancers and a joy to watch. By the end of the film it feels like a geriatric tour-de-force -- trying to hold onto youth by obsessing over a hot young tango dancer... and a 10 year-old daughter back home.

The actor has made some marvelous movies over the years, but when given total control, he failed badly. Assassination Tango is one of the worst films of the first half of the 21st century. Duvall, I fear, was simply over his head. The story is incoherent, the long improvised scenes are embarrassingly bad, and the characters are nebulous at best. Quite elderly Duvall apparently wanted to show how sexy and tough he still was; think Marlon Brando and another Tango movie. What a full-scale disaster."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn...","review":"Obviously an endorsement for his girlfriend's passion...the tango. The dance scenes are the only thing worth watching.

This book is no more than a tool to put dirty ideas in the mind of readers, from a unique standpoint, a monkey. This book has no value, it is essentially a story of a monkey who wants to be sexually free, with himself and everyone else, even going to the effort of growing a wife for himself. Welcome to the twisted mind of Orson Scott Card, I can only say that I am happy OSC has mellowed his writing in his old age, and am glad that he has redeeming books such as the Ender's saga.

Following the instructions I tested the machine out four times in twelve minutes. The weight reading was consistent but the four body fat readings I received were 20%, 21%, 24% and 24%. I can assure you I did not down a pizza in those twelve minutes. I am resigned to the fact that these machines are not accurate, I would take a water test for that.

The tribute to his father is so inspirational simply because a lot of African Americans do not get along well with their fathers. This is such a touching song.

Luther seems to have thought to capture a wide-ranged base of music lovers. His duet with Beyonce, The Closer I Get To You, should just be a number one hit. You can't play it just once. Luther has the ability to bring out the best in someone's voice and he certainly achieved this with Beyonce. In the song, Lovely Day, you really get to appreciate the range in Luther's voice. He actually sounds as if he is a one-man singing group who changes registers so gracefully. One man with so much talent is just heaven sent. They Said You Needed Me is awesome - I do need Luther.

When an artist puts out his best work. Luther has clearly put out his \\"masterpiece\\" work and there is no way you can say that he didn't. He uses great song choice and his voice is just fantastic.What makes this album 5 stars? First, the music supporting Luther isn't monotonous. Each song has unique drum programming/rhythm and each song sounds different. I am partial to all the songs, with my favorites being \\"Think About You\\", \\"The Closer I Get To You\\" (Beyonce's vocals are absolutely stunning), and \\"Dance With My Father\\". All the songs are good. Luther and his partners who composed these tunes did a great, great job. What else is there to say. 5/5!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't Improve on The Best","review":"I love Luther. Add Rapper and Hip Hoppers to Luther and they just don't mix. Luther's smooth, loving, soft, caressing ballads are what I'm looking for; not the abrasive style of the street. I like two songs - Send Me a Rose and Dance with my Father - the rest, I will never listen to again.Luther Vandross is THE BEST all by himself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would Like More of Dance With My Father","review":"I bought the album thinking most of the tracks would be like Dance With My Father. Unfortunately, that was the only stand out ballid. It's a beautiful song and most likely the best slower song of 2003. The rest of the album left me luke warm. For instance, the Foxy Brown duet was simply unbelievable. Also, the background vocals on most the tracks were just silly. The writing on this album overall was pretty weak. One other song that I liked was Hit It Again with Queen Latifan. She's on a roll with Chicago, Bringing Down the House and this track. Luther has an incredible voice and that's not a question in my mind. I wish Luther improved health and still willing to go out and buy his next album."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe it ! Anodyne ,over-produced mix !","review":"You can trace a slick line from Luther to current chart-botherersR.Kelly and Usher.Smooth operators all,but Luther is the daddy of them,which is probably why the likes of Foxy Brown,Beyonce Knowles and Queen Latifah have queued up to be his ladeez on this album,adding some hip star credentials,if not exactly gallons of personality to the anodyne,over-produced mix.DANCE WITH MY FATHER is so laidback and uninvolving that a merely reasonable cover of Bill Withers' LOVELY DAY, with superfluous contributions from Busta Rhymes,stands out against the rest of the album's somnambulant soul offerings.With Luther still fighting to recover from a serious stroke,it is possible that this indifferent collection could be his swansong.That would be a shame and a waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Luther's Best","review":"I love Luther Vandross, but this CD ranks low with one or two of his others.

When the music stops, you can't even remember what had just played or who was singing.I'm afraid too many of his fans are giving Mr. Vandross \\"pity points\\" because of his current health problems. I won't. This cd seems to have been tossed out as a nugget to keep fans hanging on until Mr. Vandross' health improves completely and he can get back to some serious singing.No artist should be so complacent that he/she believes any offering is good enough for the listening public, and the listening public shouldn't accept mediocrity because prior albums were a hit.Pick another cd by this performer and take a pass on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE LEGEND CONTINUES . . .","review":"Luther Vandross is one of our national treasures, a consummate artist and a living legend. \\"Dance With My Father\\" is proof positive that even artistic legends can continue to grow professionally and that true talent is a rare and precious gift.

This book contains first hand accounts of the atrocities committed by Germans, Ukranians, Latvians.Estonians, and Lithuanians against their Jewish neighbors.

So far as I am aware, there are some original photos here showing nazi personnel at leisure whilst off duty in the camps. Perhaps it was deliberate, but there is no conclusion to the book. The idea could be to let the letters, diaries and reports speak for themselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Problem with Seller Smartlife Online","review":"I ordered this as a gift, which unfortunately I ended up needing to return.

I found Nature's Colors online and decided to buy it based on very good reviews. Once I received the DVD and played it I was disappointed to see that most of the content was just a repackaged version of HD Environments material set to non copyrighted music. Though the material and music were ok, I just want to warn buyers if you have the HD Environment series dont buy this DVD as most of it you will already have. I am giving my copy away as a Christmas gift to someone who has neither."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lighthearted and magical, just plain kooky!","review":"This is and always will be my escape album.

And it simply doesn't work for the things it should work for. Dude, just for the hell of it I just checked their support site to make sure my question was not answered before submitting this review... there's actually no record of it now. Yay for a total scam!!!At least I didn't pay for it. But buying software that actually works will really eat into the money I saved buying this DVD burner. Lesson learned. To be more specific... I have yet to successfully burn ANY DVD which is then subsequently readable. The drive does function well within the XP environment however... it can read cds just fine for instance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the full length original","review":"I was very disappointed after viewing this current DVD release. I have seen this version of Joan of Arc with Leelee Sobieski before and wanted another copy. This is, in my opinion, the best movie of Joan of Arc even though it's not the most historically accurate. But this DVD is not the full length original movie. A lot was edited out in this copy. The original film had a run time of 180 minutes...this recent copy they have released is but 102 minutes. That's a lot of missing scenes, especially if you are not familiar with the story of Joan of Arc."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very nice introductory overview","review":"An excellent introductory survey of the 66 books of Scripture.

If you want to have the full LP edit, get the UK Castle edition, which includes among others the unforgettable \\"Rock'n Roll Medley\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best Live albums","review":"The Live rendition of July Morning on this album is unbelievable.

It was a treat to hear this music again after 30 years. It is a great CD. One of the best live recordings of any band, in my opinion. Well done, good flow, some chit chat with the audience, and great tracks by Uriah Heep. The live version of Tears in My Eyes is an all time favorite."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing a great track","review":"I love Uriah Heep and this album was awesome, but the CD version is missing the \\"Rock n Roll Medley\\" track that I foolishly didn't notice was not listed when I ordered it.

Over the last two days, the main light bulb part would flicker when turning on or off the lamp (like the bulb would burn out). However, this morning the part that the bulb screws into was smoking and flickering orange and we quickly unpluged it. The baby's room was filled with electrical smoke and my husband and I were sick to our stomachs thinking what might have happened if we had walked in fifteen minutes later while our baby was still asleep in there! Do yourself a favor and don't buy this lamp. Why would you ever put your child in a dangerous situation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"I bought this lamp less than a year ago to replace my 3 yr. old's outlet night light. I liked the fact that it was a night light and could also be used as a lamp for softer lighting than the overhead ceiling fan lights. But, to my disappointment, the night light portion has \\"died\\" and now I am searching for a new lamp/night light. For the money, I had hoped it would last a least a couple of years!"},{"rating":"2","title":"New Mom","review":"The lamp is so cute. It's perfect for our nursery!

I only had the night light portion on and noticed a burning noise and a bad smell. Then it started to flicker and spark, we were able to turn it off and unplug it before anything worse happened. It wasn't my outlet as I had a humidifer also plugged in with no problems. Luckily, I happened to be in the room at the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A turning point album","review":"I was your typical teenage US Hardcore fan when this album first came out. Being a HUGE fan (and collector) of anything Dischord put out, I was eager to get my copy. One listen left me more confused than excited. Is this hardcore? Is this the DC sound? I kept listening. Each successive listen revealed more and more brilliance. 20 years later I still listen to this album on a regular basis. It never fails to move me.On a side note, I am a professor at a university in Colorado and have turned a good number of my so-called emo/punk students on to this album. So far, I've got nothing but positive feedback."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"I remember back to late in my sophomore year of high school every time I hear this album. I remember being \\"in love\\" on this rainy day, slumped towards the window on my schoolbus at the cusp of Summer, listening to Drink Deep for the first time and getting my second wind so to speak. It gave me hope, and even after things turned out terribly, it didn't lose it's potency. This album is one of the very few that has changed the quality of my life. I know it sounds rather silly, but this album feels like a bank of my memories. It feels like so many things, so many people, and so many places. No album I can reccomend more :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"the first true \\" emotive \\" band","review":"You want a real history lesson of what real emotive music was,is, and where it came from, pick up this album. The precursor, along with Embrace, to Fugazi and the whole DC sound of Dischord Records. This is the real deal. Pick up Embrace, and put two and two together, which equals the true sound of what real emotive music is all about."},{"rating":"2","title":"purepower dischord magic!","review":"This is Guy and Brendan before Fugazi.

Groundbreaking material here kids!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rites of Spring was a predecessor to Fugazi.","review":"Rites of Spring is still one of my favorite albums. I have a lot of the old Discord Records stuff on vinyl and this is one which I also bought the CD for so that I could listen to it in my car.

At first these earplugs worked great. However after the 2nd day of wearing them I noticed my ears were tender and slightly sore. The wax ear plugs also get harder to roll in your finger as you use them again, so here I am at night giving all my finger strength to roll these wax ear plugs. Than when I think I have them rolled nice and small enough I start putting them around the ear canal (cuz your not supposed to shove them into your ear just cover the ear hole) and then I am like spackling them on and pushing on my already tender ears to get the wax to stick around the ears. Well ouch! after a while it hurts and your ears get sore, wax gets hard and by the way the wax will pick up dust, etc, cuz its on the sticky side.....Anyway it looks good on paper, but not in your ears. Try the other ear plugs the ones that are foam type, for me those seem the best so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous Reading!","review":"What fun reading this novel was! Within such a fanciful setting, the characters are so wonderfully realistic. All my emotions were engaged in the unfolding of this story - I smiled, I laughed, I got annoyed and felt sad. The descriptions are so vivid that I could swear I know where the mesa is located and I KNOW I've met some of the people. I only wish that I had had someone like Kat for my history teacher.\\"fifth life of the cat woman\\" is a great read for pure enjoyment and also for the thinly-veiled moral. This book was lent to me by a friend, but I've bought my own copy - it's on loan to another friend right now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Exquisite","review":"I picked up the book as an impulse buy, adrift on a remnants table in a local bookshop. I liked the sound of the blurb but I had no idea what to expect. My God, what a find! I have rarely, and certainly not recently before this, been so enthralled by any book. I cannot find the words to recommend it highly enough - it made me laugh with its wickedly accurate portrayal of cats and cry with its equally wickedly accurate portrayal of people. This author has a rare gift. I don't know if she's written anything else but I intend to find out - and to grab every precious word of it if she has. Unbelievable. Exquisite. Spellbinding. Get it today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellently written and intelligent piece of magical realism","review":"This delightful book follows a womans journey from fear and isolation to a very magical redemtion with the help of an oddly believable cast of empathic cats and a timeline of many lifetimes.Sensitively written elegantly paced, Dexters book offers a very personal view into a world as real as any we may dream for ourselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't look that nice on the counter","review":"I got this thinking that it would look nicer to put this over my mixer since it sits out on out counter, but I think it looks much nicer without the cover.

I'm not an avid cook, but I do like baking bread and whatever from time to time. I own the mixer and it sees use around the holidays. If you used your mixer weekly or even daily for that matter, this might not be a great item for you.

It does feel outdated for those of us who have left the bad-for-health-and-environment chemical world and adopted the digital revolution. There's also nothing about how to take pictures; the emphasis is how to light and how to process the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very Technical or Up to Date","review":"This book is really surprisingly still in print. It's from the 70's and it looks like it. Some useful information can be gleaned from it to be overgenerous. I find it rather amusing in fact. The photos inside are absolutely ridiculous. They are clearly examples of \\"just let me take your picture for this ass of a book I'm writing...\\" -- the fat couple in lawn chairs is pretty funny (pg. 21). The discussion of the zone system is laughably short and comprises only 5 pages. Most of the discussion centers around mixing various chemicals in various ratios. I wonder if all of these are still available on the market. The drawings in the text are third grade level, and someone actually gets credit on the cover! This is a very poorly done text and I don't recommend it with so many other books out there on this subject matter."},{"rating":"2","title":"A clear guide to B&W photography technique","review":"This is an ideal text for a photographer who wishes to advance his/her understanding of black & white photography methods. Without excessive detail, the steps that go into the making of a print, and the reasons that justify these steps, are clearly discussed. As the author points out from the start (in the subtitle), this is a technical manual. Those who are looking for a book on the \\"creative\\" and \\"inspirational\\" aspects of photography should look elsewhere. However, a prerequisite to \\"creativity\\" is a solid technical background, and you probably cannot learn \\"creativity\\" from a book if you haven't got it to begin with. If you think the techniques of photography are \\"dull\\", do not try this book. But for a photographer who wishes to understand them, rather than merely follow them as a cookbook recipe, this is a superb intermediate textbook."},{"rating":"2","title":"very helpful.","review":"For those of us who want to go on in photography and learn in depth techniques, I think this book is pretty good. I have Horensteins book Basic Photography. I appreciated all the indepth coverage of the elements of basic photography. Beyond Basic Photography continues with more detailed coverage. I don't like the illustrations this time around, they seem more cartoony--but the content is very detaile.The book is very specific about teaching you how to get good negatives, which will in turn, help you make better prints. That's always a good thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read","review":"As a student of Henry's at the Rhode Island School of Design I read the book BEFORE I attended RISD I was captivated by the simple ways he explained the \\"sometimes\\" complexity of photography.Such as Henry's way - making life easy and fun for everyone.I suggest checking out his other books too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull technical review","review":"This is a mediocre book that presents a lot of loosely related technical facts but almost no link to the creative side of photography. For example, you learn how aperture affects depth of field but never really get a feel for why you would ever want to change depth of field and what creative control it gives you. The books is full of technical detail but is badly missing INSIGHT. Anyone serious about photography will get a lot more out of Ansel Adams trilogy (\\"The Camera\\", \\"The Negative\\", \\"The Print\\") which is very inspirational and insightful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simplicity","review":"For beginners the books is clear simple and describes you step by step how to take black and white pictures."},{"rating":"1","title":"dead collection of dead facts","review":"The books wants to be a technical guide to advanced photography but instead it is a collection of technicalities. It does not provide any indepth insight into HOW all this will improve your photography. Some of the techicalities are obvious, some of them - irrelevant, nothing about it is inspirational or thought provoking (like Ansel Adams's books are, for example). The pieces of info are poorly connected. I got nothing out of this book and returned it back to where I bought it after reading. Worst of all, the photographs used as examples throughtout the book are bad as well.If you want to improve your photography you will do *MUCH* better getting Ansel Adams' \\"The Negative\\" and \\"The Print\\", or \\"The Photographer's Master Printing Course\\" by Tim Rudman (truly excellent book, btw)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just O.K.","review":"Good cinematography and somewhat interesting story; but mediocre dialogue and not very engaging.

All of that changed when I listened to this album! The polished intensity of Coltrane's tenor sax blended with the baritone crooning of Johnny Hartman make this one of the most romantic albums in jazz (and that is saying something).Johnny Hartman, while a star in his own right, has never has inspired me as much. And while, \\"A Love Supreme,\\" released a year and a half later in 1965, is arguably Coltrane's greatest work, \\"John Coltrane & Johnny Hartman,\\" is more intimate and at the same time, accessible for the listener. The struggle to describe the radiance of divinity and reverence is replaced by the more tangible themes of a human's trials and triumphs in love. If you only get one album to share with your sweetheart, this is the one to get!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Johnny Hartman lacks heart.

I still like all of the original versions of all the songs better but still, it's a great CD. All of the songs are remastered and some of the songs sound a little strange, which is the only reason I give this four stars (also another reason this got four stars was because of the horrible song Justify My Love). If you have all of her CD's, or most of them, I would still reccomend this because it gives a new version of each song, and ofcourse this album delivers Madonna's worst song of her entire career, Justify My Love, which by the way stinks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Godd collection of the \\"Materials\\"!!!","review":"\\"The Immaculate Collection\\" is a must-have for any Madonna fan.

The sound quality was awful...it sounded as if someone took a recorder and recorded the music from the radio and burned it to a CD.

Almost everything here is remixed, rerecorded, or just totally unlike the versions made famous through radio airplay and on MTV.

Not a single bad track although La Isla Bonita, Into The Groove, and Borderline stand out above the rest. Sorry I just love those two tunes. Material Girl, Vogue, Justify My Love, and Like A Virgin are other noteworthy tracks.A good balance of dance tunes and touching ballads and certainly enjoyable for those who want to go the comprehensive route to collecting Madonna's music. Bigger fans might want to collect her indvidual recordings but truthfully there is a grat deal of filler tunes on her True Blue and Like A Virgin recordings. My advise is to stick with this compilation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Madonna had some great hits and a lot of them are on this album - but where are the original versions? If you had an ear permanently affixed to the radio in the 80's like I did, you will definitely feel dudded by the paltry offerings from her early 80's period. I am particularly alarmed by what suspiciously sounds like her voice being sped up. This is very noticeable on \\"Like A Virgin\\" and \\"Lucky Star\\". She sounds like a 5-year old for goodness sake! If you want the real versions it looks like you might just have to go out and buy the individual albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"ESSENTIAL RECORDING\\"??","review":"SInce when Madonna has recorded anyhting \\"essential\\"?

WHAT A JOKE!","review":"You'd have to search pretty hard to find anyone as self serving and putrid as Madonna, a woman with an ego so big that its a surprise she ever gets through the studio door. This is her best of. She even calls it 'immaculate' it is not. It is full of the most lame, one dimensional music it has ever be my misfortune to assail my poor hearing too. For months i had to endure this whilst serving in a clothes shop. I doubt if i've yet to recover. There is no redeeming features in this dross. Musically it all sounds the same, the woman can't write and worse she sings out of key. You'd think after the mind numbing 'holiday' it couldn't get any worse, but it does. By track three (if you can stomach what went before) you are wondering if you are losing your sanity, by the end you are thanking God for salvation. And she has made millions from this. Madonna even this psuedonym is a joke. Oh yeah and she advocates wearing fur-say no more! Ego on!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Madonna album","review":"I wish the endings to \\"Like a Virgin\\" and \\"Papa Don't Preach\\" weren't shortened. I wish the set included the song \\"True Blue.\\" But other than that, this is the absolute best Madonna album around. You'll also want to pick up \\"Something to Remember\\" to collect some of Madonna's best ballads. And I hope that down the road, a 2 disc compilation is relased so that you can have Madonna's 90's hits packages with the 80's hits found here. But otherwise, this set is great.

If you're already into Madonna, the album might be worth buying just for \\"Rescue Me\\" and the better versions of \\"Vogue\\" and \\"Express Yourself\\". However, a lot of these songs have been cut down and many of them lost something in the translation. The version of \\"Like A Prayer\\" on this one doesn't come close to the original, and this is true of several of the songs here. It's still an enjoyable listen but I prefer listening to her songs in their entirety."},{"rating":"2","title":"A d*mn fine collection indeed!","review":"Okay, first off, yes I know this collection is not complete and excludes some of Madonna's hits. Big deal! It's a fine compilation and I for one am glad that all of these versions are new! I already have her other albums and would have felt ripped off if she just put the album versions on this disk.The highlights for me are Holiday (yes, I prefer the album version not included here), Vogue (30 seconds longer than the album version), Like A Prayer (an edit of the dance remix version), Express Yourself (edit of the dance remix), Rescue Me (a new song with some fierce vocals), and Into The Groove (edit of the U Can Dance Shep Pettibone version).Personally, I would have replaced the 2 ballads with Dress You Up and Causing A Commotion. I'm glad Who's That Girl isn't on the disk; although it hit #1, it is a lame song."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Immaculate Collection is A Must Have CD","review":"Okay love her or hate her this is an album worth buying. It's got everything in a greatest hit's package you could want. Madonna added Justify My Love And Rescue Me to sum up part one of her career. The album's sound is also excellent as well. The only down thing is from a fan's point of view all the song's are the edited (or short versions) of the songs. So it's like having all of Madonns's 45's in your collection. I recently went onto a major chart listing site and this album is still selling after almost 10 years in release. WOW that should tell you something. If you enjoyed Madonna's stuff in the 80's you will appreciate this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite CDs","review":"This is a great CD if you like some of the older Madonna songs.

These are little and fun pop tunes from the 80s and some of the best of Madonna's.

The cd doesn't even use some of the better 80's dance versions of the hits.

There are some notable exclusions however. Where is \\"angel\\", \\"dress you up\\", \\"burning up\\"? Rather have the album versions of \\"lucky star\\" and \\"holiday\\". Overall, for 80's Madonna fans this is the album to own. In my opinion, this is her last great work. Her 90's material was less fun and she sold out to the new generation which would be fine except that her true talent was captured in the 80's. In addition to the \\"Immaculate Collection\\", 80's Madonna fans should also own her debut album and \\"Like a Virgin\\". These albums really caputure her 80's talent with material that is not on the greatest hits."},{"rating":"2","title":"The World's Greatest Music","review":"This cd is an awesome cd because it combines all of Madonna's greatest hits.

Also for anyone that has never listened to any of Madonna's music, this would be a great choice because it offers many great titles that explore her career. It's great when a cd combines songs that have been popular that everyone loves because instead of having many cds you can just pop in one. If someone wanted a cd to explain the past decade or so, this would be it. Madonna has been a public icon for so long and throughout our changing times Madonna has reinvented herself to provide amazing music. The music that Madonna has created can express any emotion and is sure to put a smile on your face!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mad for Madonna","review":"This is one of her albums that I wanted to add and did. Her music is something I grew up on. No music collection is complete without her. I had the cassette till it couldn't play any more. If you enjoy music, especially Madonna's music, then you know what I mean. I say try it. You'll love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is my Madonna...","review":"You can have the haggard, British soccer mom Madonna, but for me and millions of others, this album is how I'll want to remember her. I'm not even a particularly big fan of her but it's amazing that when I first played this CD, EVERY DARN TRACK WAS RECOGNIZABLE. And they're all just about good, from the goofy Like A Virgin, Material Girl and Papa Don't Preach, to more outstanding contemporary tracks like Live To Tell, Like A Prayer and Vogue, this album is just a lot of fun without too much pretension. The additional tracks even have high standard quality to them that they feel like they're apart of the hits themselves then some thrown on tracks to get the long time fans to buy this compilation. All in all, eighties pop music was a lot of fun, and this CD showcases the music as well as the artist at its peak."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best Compilations in Pop Music","review":"Listening to this album, it becomes clear that Madonna is the best singles artist of the 1980s. Every song shines, and there are 17 of them. Who else in the decade produced so many nearly perfect singles? Granted, some of Madonna's studio albums have weak songs, but you don't have to listen to them here. The Immaculate Collection is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best singalong car tunes","review":"I have always liked all of Madonnas songs since they are all singable. To have all of her best songs on one CD is great. This CD will keep you singing in your car...but don't get caught belting out the tunes when a car drives next to you!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Be Fooled -- It's All Remixes","review":"This is an okay CD, but it has some major flaws. ALL of the songs on here are NOT the original LP edits or radio versions. For example, the remixed \\"Borderline\\" is so distorted that you can barely hear the original keyboard arrangements! Also, \\"Like A Prayer\\" is a completely different version. Instead of releasing the promo versions of the Madonna songs we recognize on the radio, they released this. Also, there are an inexcuseable number of Madonna's other hits that were scrapped. \\"The Immaculate Collection\\" is not satisfactory for die-hard fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Immaculate Collection: Classic pop songs!","review":"Say what you want about Madonna, she's not exactly an artist or personality that is easy to classify. But, few can deny the gift she has for writing great pop songs. The Immaculate Collection captures her essence as well as the fantastic pop music she brought us in such a short time span. They're all here, each one memorable (and sometimes more controversial) than the next. \\"Like a Virgin\\", \\"Material Girl\\", \\"Papa Don't Preach\\", \\"Open Your Heart\\", \\"Express Yourself\\", \\"Crazy for You\\", \\"Cherish\\", \\"Vogue\\", \\"Like a Prayer\\" (whose video ended her contact with Pepsi), even the sexually charged and ultra-contoversial \\"Justify My Love\\"; it's all there. The Immaculate Collection is an indispensable pop-culture artifact, a portfolio of the always interesting Madonna and the timeless pop music she crafted. Discover Madonna before 'Evita' or before she was moving quicker than a ray of light. The Immaculate Collection is the enigmatic siren at her very best."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best greatest hits albums","review":"Immaculate Collection is one of the best Madonna albums ever. It was great to hear those songs from the 80s. I love \\"Borderline\\",\\"Like A Prayer\\",etc. It seems like yesterday when does songs came out.I also think that this is a great album to dance to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure classic Madonna--not quite how I remembered her","review":"I grew up listening to Madonna blaring from my older sister's room. I remember even early Madonna as being great music to dance to, but after relistening, I have to say, not so much. It's still fun, but at times repetitive, and most of the songs don't hold up as well as I would have expected."},{"rating":"2","title":"MADONNA ON TOP OF THE 80'S","review":"Although this is one of my 5 favorite CDs ever including GHV2, this 'Immaculate collection' definately had room for 3 or 4 more. 'causing a commotion' 'Angel' 'True Blue' 'Burning up' 'Everybody' 'Oh father' and much more top 20's had room here, 21 songs would have been more apitizing...the songs that were chozen were great though, I like all Madonna songs, and love most of them. This is a timeless collection of Madonna's best from her early career."},{"rating":"2","title":"A legend","review":"I love Madonna's music. This particular collection is my favorite.I listen to it alot. It brings back great times from that musics era."},{"rating":"1","title":"very average","review":"the songs are catchy.and owe more to the Production than her NON-SInging self.she sounds Horrible.the songs are good though.She is one of the Most Overrated SIngers ever.the Mixes on this disc don't help her voice.if i could i'd give her a 1 1/2.she is just a Brillant Market Maker."},{"rating":"2","title":"Madonna madonna and more madonna.","review":"Alright, so yeah. I was looking at my reviews, and I waas like....WHAT?? No Madonna???So here we go on my slew of Madonna reviews.This collection, brings the best of Madonna, granted, I don't like all the songs and could have done without \\"Lucky Star\\" and \\"Justify My Love\\".Otherwise, I'm very happy with the album. It rocks. It has all of her best songs, and I can't exactly write about all of them here, simply, because I'm more of the short and to the point reviewer. I want someone to read the review and be done with it rather than reading a novel.But yeah, it has all my favs on here. \\"Material Girl\\", \\"Like a Prayer\\" and \\"Vogue\\". Wow, I am so gay...*chuckles*"},{"rating":"1","title":"slow moving with no real detection","review":"I was very disappointed. As a big fan of historical mysteries, I expected more. More detecting at the least. Isaac doesn't do much of anything; just sort of wanders around asking vague questions. Even worse, the story wanders too. No more in the series for me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible disappointment. Denigrating to Judaism","review":"She has created a medieval Jewish hero who doesn't pray,desecrates the Sabbath, reads Greek philosophers in preference toJewish texts, has no Jewish friends or community, a shrewish wife who's faulted for being against her daughter marrying a Christian and so on."},{"rating":"1","title":"rotten mystery: no detecting, a killer with no motive,","review":"I'm really mystified why Caroline Roe chose to write a mystery. She can write nice prose that reads easily, and pleasant characters. But her hero does not detecting, there are no clues, the murderer is revealed completely deus ex machina and is not someone who has appeared in the book until the moment he's revealed -- she breaks the fundamental rules of the genre. Nor do I see why she chose a Jewish character. She obviously has no interest in Jewish anything -- one of the key turns in the plot involves a Jewish girl eating in a monastery. Hasn't Roe ever heard of keeping kosher? And what she does have -- a locked ghetto in medieval Spain -- is inaccurate. The first locked ghetto was Venice in the 1500s. This wasn't fair to the mystery fan, or the historical mystery fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent information, awesome photographs","review":"Excellent and complete information about ornamental grasses. A great book.Thirty pages on the botany, anatomy, and classification of grasses. Twenty pages on native habitat, thirty pages on designing with grasses, and twenty pages of growing and propagating grasses. 170 page encyclopedia listing 400+ species / varieties of grasses. Each species is described in a paragraph or two of text along side a clear photograph of the plant. In the back of the book, you find a 2 page glossary, 5 page bibliography, 2 page grass nursery listing, USDA and European hardiness maps, and a complete index of all grasses by common name. Very complete book.As a bonus, the book is also filled with awesome photography.If you garden with ornamental grasses, this book is a must buy. Excellent information, well worth the money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy 2 copies...","review":"This book is structured, written, photographed and edited with parallel purpose and effect: communication of the author's respect and regard for the book's subject and for its readers. Mr. Darke sets out to inform and does so with enconomy but in full course; when he instructs, he teaches the novice and gives pause to the critic; when he photographs he shows his passion and inspires with the nature and wonder of his subjects. The book is encyclopedic, yet its prose is always to the point with the agreeable dryness of a good, well-bodied wine. Credible, trustworthy, enlightening. This is the best gardening book I have ever read. Negatives? Only one: Mr. Darke's standards are unimpeachable; those of the book's typographer and designer, however, are not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Grass Reference","review":"Good Reference.

They have shady business practices. They canceled my order with them because my \\"credit card failed.\\" Upon contacted both my bank and Amazon it turns out the credit card charge never failed, and was in fact accepted and PC Universe canceled the order because they were out of stock. So they lied to me. Didn't ship product. And billed me anyway. Not the way to do business where I come from."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who wrote this?","review":"This seems a little shady, seeing as my very first Amazon experience was with PC Universe and it was an awful one. I should have reviewed the feedback first, and I take full credit for that, but a glance at it would have warned me about the problem I had, that so many of their customers have. The product was listed in stock. I called several days later to ask about something else, and found out in that phone call that the item was not in fact in stock and wouldn't be until the day after my latest estimated ARRIVAL date. In other words, the item wouldn't even possibly shipped until days after I had been told it would arrive. If I hadn't called they never would have told me. I was essentially informed that they had planned to just let my order sit until the item came in. I had to cancel, and at least they were prompt with that, but it was still a very negative experience. In addition, the same item is still listed as in stock. It hasn't come down at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"a true eye opener","review":"to put it briefly, this movie is powerful. It is moving in its depiction of the carnage in Bosnia, and if you are not outraged by the violence that you see, then you are not human.

A very dreary land."},{"rating":"1","title":"ok if you like this kind of thing","review":"newies come to town to sell the story to the world. but become the story because it's so sad people are being killed in war. God, tribe, power, are the reasons for war. we don't like your god so we kill you. we don't like your family (tribe) so we kill you. but we want the power to rule over a area, state, country, so we kill you and take that power. so the nice people \\"save\\" the poor underdogs by moving them into areas where killing is not on a large scale. in the end send money to help stop war & feed the hungry, stop man made global warming, cure the ill, make life nice in the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Far from perfect, but well worth seeing","review":"The story revolves around a team of news people who are covering the war in Sarajevo and the rescue of some children from an ophanage. It tries to say something important about a war and a place that was practically ignored. I've always been interested in learning more. This movie doesn't answer my questions. I'm still confused about the difference between the Bosnians and the Serbs and why they were fighting. But I did get a feel of the place which I never quite got before. And as films go, the story is a patchwork of pieces and not put together well. Woody Harrelson and Marisa Tomai are in it but their parts are quite small. This is far from a perfect film. However,I'm glad I tracked it down and saw it."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's like CNN..only on celluloid","review":"This film is terrible... Not only is the narrative extremely inconsistent, it has absolutely nothing to offer visually. As far as politics goes it is about as accurate a take on the Bosnian conflict as any biased Western souce. The film could have been a little more weighted in its presentation of a conflict we Westerners have yet to understand..and with the help of movies like these, probably never will."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie","review":"As many have said, this movie is perhaps not the best film of all time. But let's get realistic, this movie took the atrocities of the Balkan wars and presented it in such a way that normal viewers could feel outraged without feeling numb (like CNN made us feel during the siege of Sarajevo.) After watching this film I volunteered my services as a physician in Bosnia. After returning to America and watching it again I cried. I finally understood (1%) of what they went through. I recommend this movie to all, but watch to be informed not necessarily for cinematic excellence."},{"rating":"2","title":"See it, not perfect but worth it!","review":"This doesn't deeply move one like some landmark movies, but I give it 5 stars for its portrayals of the situation in Bosnia-Herzogovina, you get a feeling for it, even if it is not utterly perfect, its attempts at reality and the humanity of it make it a must see."},{"rating":"1","title":"Many pictures-little information","review":"I was somewhat disappointed after receiving this book. Although there are a huge amount of pictures of various Christmas lighting sets, the organization was poor and there was precious little information about the history of electric Christmas lighting. According to the bios of the authors, they reportedly amassed a great deal of knowledge in their field of collecting, but precious little of that knowledge has been shared with the reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nostalgic Disney fun -- Disappointing DVD","review":"It's a shame that Disney refuses to exert that little bit of extra effort (and possibly expense - \\"there's the rub\\") to restore its films and release them in their original theatrical ratios (aka: widescreen). These films appeal mainly to \\"grown-up\\" Disney fans, scholars, and collectors. For a modest comedy like this, the ratios aren't too distracting; for major productions - like Babes in Toyland, The Moon-Spinners, and Blackbeard's Ghost -- the pan-and-scan is horrible. It would be better for Disney to slow down its release schedule and take the extra time to prepare first class DVD's. The Disney name used to stand for quality and technical innovation; appparantly, those standards no longer apply."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cult Status for Merlin Jones","review":"\\"The Misadventures of Merlin Jones\\" is a very likable film from Walt Disney. Tommy Kirk is excellent as the absent-minded student genius Merlin Jones attending Midvale College. Annette Funicello is Jennifer his girlfriend who constantly tries to get his attention. Leon Ames plays the pivital role of Judge Hornsby. This is one of those movies from the 60s containing a lot of campus mayhem and mishaps. The main title song, \\"Merlin Jones\\" was composed by the Sherman brothers and performed by Annette Funicello. It's a fun movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"NOW THIS IS A CLASSIC ALBUM!!","review":"When you find a Reba album where all the songs are first class material and she does an outstanding job on every one of them...you'd better hold on to it tight because this is rarely the case any more.

Women could work in the offices and schools then, before the religious fundamentalists came to powerEven though it was a safer time for foreigners (her husband was an agriculturalist with the UN.) Ms. Stratton seems to have taken some unusually adventuresome risks in her travels about the country. She nonchalantly explains that most Afghans were not dangerous, merely curious.Afghanistan may be different now, but Ms. Stratton's story shows us a more peaceful time and perhaps gives hope for the future. I found her book very readable and informative."},{"rating":"1","title":"$10 shipping????","review":"$10 shipping for a 3' cable? Are you kidding?

Shame on L-com Connectivity Products for pricing this cable at $5 and hoping that nobody notices the shipping charge. If the cable really costs ~$14 then price it as such.

The forward explains that the whole book is actually the poem and that the individual poems within reference each other to add meaning throughout the book. That was something that I had never seen before, and I though it made the book very interesting to read. I came back to things I had read before, because I saw how their meaning could change based on things I read later.

You are able to receive the fax if the machine is already on with the wireless phone by pressing *51, but turning on the machine itself from another room would be a great feature to have on this product.I did not get the top of the line, so I don't know if the larger fax machine has this feature.

If you cannot get the machine to recognize the cartridges, nothing, and I mean nothing, works other than the telephone.You should not buy this machine even if you had one that worked because it requires 4 ink cartridges which do not work after 6 months--I guess they dry up.

I rarely print with color, but the machine frequently reports near empty color cartridges. I must replace all the color cartridges, even it I only want to print black -- it just won't print black without the costly replacement of dried up color cartridges (and I guess they dry up in a matter of just a couple months)!

There a but a handful of characters, which is refreshing in this case."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh","review":"Well this book was recommended to me from someone I know. I found the idea to be intriguing, but the character of Devlin was flawed, and not in a good way. I prefer characters in books who are flawed yet it is very rare to find one. I found that Devlin was easily predictable, as well as the plot. I also found the writing to be very bland and boring, I found myself at times taking a paragraph or two and rewriting them with more passion, and colorful word choices. As others have said this book is a simple read, if you do not want anything complex, if you want a predictable story line with not a whole lot of character development then this one would do well for you. Myself I will not be rushing to the store to buy the next book, though because the story had, or has some small faint shimmer of potential I might buy it in few years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Start","review":"There are a few original ideas in the book, but it is basically a tale of a man who becomes a hero over great odds and his own desire to die. This story is not filled with dragons and elves, and magic is extremely rare. So if you enjoy stories like that, this will not be for you. The writing is solid and shows a lot of promise. The story is not complex, but it is engaging."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book for a quarter","review":"I found the book in a public library book sale for a quarter and enjoyed it.

I don't run games so I cannot comment on how it would perform for those applications but so far for all other apps, it works great. We have a lot of high resolution pics of our kids and they also look great on this monitor.HOWEVER - When buying an LCD monitor you must understand that these monitors only work well at certain screen resolutions. If you run them at other than their \\"native resolutions\\" (in the case of the HP W22 it is 1680x1050) the picture quality suffers greatly.

The colors are washed out, and the sharpness suffers, even though the resolution is supposed to be the same.Odd how HP is regressing in their package deals...six months ago I bought a similar package with the f2105, and assumed that six months later, if anything, I'd get a better monitor.

Being pleased with a smaller HP monitor I bought for my parents last year, I bought this one directly from HP without seeing it in person. I was disappointed at first. I switched from VGA to DVI (there wasn't a dvi cable in the box, I had to steal one from work). It was a little better but still disappointing. My video card couldn't be set to display the optimum resolution that HP recommends for this monitor. I ran Microsoft Windows Update and found a monitor driver that allowed my old Nvidia video card to display the optimum resolution -- it improved greatly and am now pleased that I didn't throw my money away.

They were surprised because they didn't think that the Earth's core produce the magnetic shield that protect us from the solar radiation.The program shows a very interesting experiment that recreates the earth, the core and the efects.

Nevertheless, I was disappointed. My first disappointment came when I noticed that I'd purchased a Not-For-Resale promo CD. Next, the recordings aren't that catchy. Still, this piece may be one of those that I have to let grow on me. It has two mini-orchestral works that are multi-segment pieces, one or both of an oriental theme. The fact that I don't really remember shows that I just don't care for the work, it just doesn't inspire. The only nice work is a testimony to the fallen at Ground Zero, New York where the Twin Towers once stood before 9/11/2001.

(Very interesting).","review":"I have only read the first three or four chapters but so far I have really enjoyed this book. It is about a 19 year old girl named Christy who left her home to go teach at Cutter Gap in the Smokey Mountains. She meets a lot of new people who thinks she should not have left her home. When she first got there a man was trying to find her. It was storming and snowing really bad and a tree fell on top of him. It caused severe bleeding in his brain and the doc of the town had to do brain surgery and drill a whole in his brain to remove the bleeding. He made it through his first night after the surgery and is doing well.

Appeals to many ages.","review":"The made-for-television movie adaptation of this story first attracted my attention to this book. I read Christy three times in a very short time period - as soon as I reached the end, I simply turned back to page one. Over the years, I've read it many more times. It is the innocent and inspirational story of a young woman who finds love, knowledge, and happiness in her walk with God. The author's descriptions of the characters and rustic Appalachian setting are captivating, and Christy's romantic struggles make it difficult for the reader to set the book aside unfinished. I recommend this book to anyone age 12 years or older, but I especially recommend it to those individuals who truly cherish the joy of \\"curling up with a GOOD book.\\" Of note, the videos and the juvenile book series based on this story are quite good as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Touching Story","review":"I picked this up because I thought I'd read it as a teenager (I hadn't).

Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A universal story of faith with something for every reader","review":"\\"Masterpiece\\" is the only word for this book. On the surface, it is the story of a Christian young lady who, against her parents' wishes, goes to a poverty striken mountain community to join a mission and teach. You would think only Christians would relate, but anyone with faith will find something here. I am Jewish and I loved the message that faith brings about change in our lives. The romantic triangle is interesting, but it is not the true focus of the book. Faith is the focus. The audiobook read by Kellie Martin is exquisite - her smart, wonderful voice, the mountain music, the story - just beautiful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Christy on a Mission","review":"Christy is (another!)one of my all-time favorites. It's about Christy Huddleston, who makes the life-changing decision of teaching in stick-in-the-mud Cutter Gap, Tenessee. The job turns out to be more difficult and unpleasant then expected at first, but Christy grows to find the value of the children she teaches.Christy goes through many difficult lessons and situations, but she ultimately becomes a more independent, stable young woman with steady beliefs. Miss Alice shows the way and helps Christy to discover her beliefs and challenges her to follow God's will, not her own. Christy has a big decision to make in regards to the men in her life, as well. She gains the admiration of two different men helping out at Cutter Gap.I loved how Ms. Marshall portrayed all of the characters, big to small, with such simplistic detail. I felt like I could see the characters and understand their actions.

In listening, one must have the subwoofer on and lights low. This one moves the walls.

Exile On Main Street and Abbey Road are two great master recordings, but each of these classics can not match Barry White for a soothing sensual moment when a man just wants to be close to a special lady. Barry's soft rap and soothing vocals along with a steady instrumental backing just sets a relaxed atmosphere. The songs do not vary too much in tone and its all about making love and giving love and yearning for love. Normally I like variety in my music. However, this style is so on the money that the limited variety that exists here certainly fits my bill......especially when love is in the air!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Original Greatest Hits Collection","review":"Although there have been recent hits compilations, the original greatest hits album from 1975 still works just fine!

It isn't always pretty but it's always honest. Listen to \\"Donations\\": a guy with a few friends, who pleads with one of them to let the others know when he is gone, and leaves instructions for his body parts.It is both sad and funny; not easy to pull off. The first two songs are bookends:he's alone, he is 53, and he nudges into adulthood(finally and acknowledging that ,yes, he may be the one at fault). The title song is next to last and is defiant but resigned. Again, two emotions that are usually at odds but that he weaves together. A few of the songs, like \\"Graveyard\\" where he muses on how we all end up there are a bit sophomoric but don't detract from a great album by an evolving artist(although I would still like a few like \\"East Indian Princess\\".)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Out from sadness","review":"He broke up with a babe and saw the love of his life mother pa pass on.

He wasn't a happy guy to begin with (and even before September 11), and his life has been infused with much sorrow and regret. Both his beloved (and much sung about)parents have died in the last few years, burdening him so much extra pain that he almost gave up song-writing. But not to worry, dear Loudon listener, because once again, his pain is our gain --- as he pours out all his emotion into tightly written, restrained odes to rememberance and survival. Amazingly, he writes repeatedly about death without ever becoming maudlin or sentimental, yet he's intensely moving nonetheless. Also, this album wisely stays away from cute novelty songs and overblown arrangements that all too often bog down Loudon albums. Only downside is his lyric that he doesn't care \\"which idiot runs this country.\\" As current events have proven, some idiots are far more idiotic (and dangerous)than others."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Final Disappointment","review":"You all aren't going to be happy with me (press the unhelpful button all you like), but I just couldn't enjoy this album much beyond a couple of listens. Maybe it's me -- I keep buying Wainwright expecting to see him re-capture the magic he had on albums like Album III and Unrequited. You can't get better than \\"Dead Skunk\\" or \\"Red Guitar\\" or \\"New Paint\\" or \\"Mr. Guilty\\". Now it's like he tries too hard. The music is passable, but the lyrics -- though sometimes inspired -- too often seem forced. You see the rhymes coming from a mile away. This from the guy who came up with a gem like \\"You can feel it in your olfactory\\"? And it's the self-absorption apparent in all his songs that give you clues to all the failed relationships he has demoaned throughout his career.

It's not quite as efficient as two beater models but then it makes up for that in portability. My wife simply wouldn't be without one. The only reason I don't give Gizmo five stars is the battery. I purchased this from Amazon and as usual they provide the best service and prices of anyone.

Otherwise I let my kids use it as it's too weak to hurt them.I use the 2 whisks by hand (no mixer) more often than not.

It has been right at nine months of limited use (weekly) on light liquids. It died mixing chocolate milk. It is a waste on money and in the trash now.I had the B&D; cordless hand mixer years ago and loved it, thought this would be good, it isn't. The Gizmo is under powered, torqued or whatever and the plug in charger is a pain. It slowed when mixing up plain cornbread and pancake batter.

It could not even be charged to work for 1 second.

Well, first, it is designed to not work while it is charging, so you have to wait once you lose the charge for it to charge up completely again before finishing what you started. I tried to beat egg whites today and when I went to add sugar to them, the battery started dying, or the mix (of egg whites and sugar) was too thick, I am not sure which. I barely finished and then just decided to mix everything else by hand.

I don't like it that I've had it about a year and the attachment is rusting near the hanging part & down the shaft some. It has 2 speeds, I never use the slow.

It was definately perfect to hang on the wall for convience, but the mixing abilities are not up to speed (literally). It is good for an egg or soup, but not your every day mixing of mixes,corn bread or even pudding. Everything just stays in clumps and I have to drag out the old one any ways. I also seem to splatter my entire wall with what ever I am mixing, and when I use a standard mixer with 2 beaters I have not had that problem. And as for the charge, I originally had to keep it charging at all times for it to last during an entire mix. Now it's a year later and even though I never unplug it, it runs down before I ever get my eggs mixed."},{"rating":"2","title":"mixer","review":"This is the second gizmo I bought.

Doesn't hold a charge and is one of the wimpiest pieces of kitchen equipment I've ever used. It's also a major struggle just to get the mixer out of the holder.

I'm disappointed. It is not the same. This Gizmo is designed to be unplugged when it used and manually plugged in again after use. That is an inconvenience.

Sure I had heard of the likes of Satch and Vai, but I never got around to listening to them. Suffice to say, instrumental guitar music was something I was most definitely NOT familiar with.This all changed when my Art teacher had me listen to The Road Less Traveled. I was hearing sounds that I never knew were possible. I was hearing music done in a totally different way! Mattias seems like a funny guy to me, and you can hear it in his compositions. Songs like There's No Money in Jazz and One String Solo are hilarious, and Print This is a humorous take on a device many of us are familiar with.Overall, from this album I learned two important lessons. One is that it is ALWAYS cool to be able to shred, and two is that being a musician doesn't mean you have to be serious. Definitely a good buy for any guitarist looking for a dose of fresh air."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"After hearing \\"There's no Money in Jazz\\" on Pandora Radio, I was fascinated by Eklundh's fancy for squeaky harmonics and genuinely quirky and fascinating compositions. It's not going to be for everyone, but I can't recommend it enough regardless. It's very experimental (you'll know just how experimental thanks to the fantastic liner notes written by Eklundh providing insight into the creation of each track) yet, except for the very brief electronic intermissions, maintains an undeniable catchiness and groove.The heavy use of natural harmonics lends the guitar a vocal quality I never knew was possible with the instrument. This is one of the very few instrumental guitar albums that I've heard that truly sets itself apart from the rest as something unmistakably unique. Anyone who isn't afraid of instrumental albums (there is one song with vocals, however) needs to give this album a chance. It's inspiring, silly, heartfelt, and completely insane all at once."},{"rating":"2","title":"Goddie goddie","review":"It's simply a great cd, very innovative, if you like the first freak guitar, this is what you have been waiting for.For those who don't have heard the first cd, or any of the freak kitchen cd's: If you want to hear honest music, without pretentions, buy it.Mattias its a very kind person, I recently knew him in mexico city, his music it's a reflect of his personality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Matilda","review":"This is the kind of book that lets you know your not the only person out there not understood.

Walter Mosely is listed as an \\"associate producer\\" but I wonder who ultimately cast this movie? Denzel is perfect as Easy, Tom Sizemore is perfect as Albright but Don Cheadle was miscast as Mouse. In the book, he's described as light-skinned and handsome ( a ladies' man ) but small in stature. I pictured a guy like Giancarlo Esposito in the role. Also, Cheadle could not do the deep southern accent Mouse speaks with in the book.But the most serious miscast was Jennifer Beals as Daphne a/k/a \\"The Devil in the Blue Dress\\", she was way too old for the part! In the book she was a beautiful teenager, 16 or 17 ( I can't remember exactly ) that could pass for white. Someone maybe like Lisa Bonet or even a young white actress should have played her. With this crucial error, the plot failed to make sense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Denzil's first film noir","review":"This film should've been a hit since it was based on a well received novel by Walter Moseby and starred Denzil Washington as \\"Easy\\" Rawlins. Unfortunately it didn't get the notices it should have received due to the fact as Denzil stated that blacks do not like to see themselves as victims. Too bad because this film noir had an intricate plot involving a mysterious woman (Jennifer Beals) who's involved in a murder plot which puts Washington's character in peril and possible imprisonment since one of females he was involved in is found murdered. Another plus was Carl Franklin's astute direction plus you also had Don Cheadle in a career breaking performance as Rawlin's psychopathic buddy \\"Mouse\\".

He loves his house and has not been able to find regular work because of discrimination. However, he gets involved with all sorts of interesting characters, high 40's style and reality of social taboos. The \\"Devil in a Blue Dress\\" is Daphne Monet (Jennifer Beals), who is a languid, simmering beauty wearing one blue outfit after another. She is the key character and full of mystery and surprises. There is an important mayoral race going on that she plays a big part in.Overall the movie is see scene after scene of beautiful vintage cars and the golden age of California.

So the viewer is basically promised some sort of magical happy ending from the get-go.

Some people say it's because the movie is about a weird idea, but nothing is more weird than Fringe. When you watch Fringe especially the fourth season, the story looks very convincing and keeps you following what's going on.

However, while it does have some attractive carryovers from Heroes -- most notably realistic-seeming foreign locales and (subtitled) dialogue, it verges on self-parody right out of the gate. The excellent Kiefer Sutherland has to work really hard with a woefully underwritten part and can't get the character to be believable. Too many scenes of his following his autistic kid and yelling: \\"Jake, Jake, don't go there! Jake. Jakle, come back! Jake, Jake, be careful!\\" led me to stop watching after the third episode."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must See","review":"I'm hoping this series continues in 2013.

Every level of thinker will enjoy these heartwarming stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sci-Fi Meets the Techno-Thriller","review":"Something has punched a hole in the Soviet aircraft carrier KIEV. So begins Mr. Wheeler's effective melding of two normally disparate genres. The KIEV sustains heavy damage and immediately, the Soviets suspect that their carrier was the victim of some new American space weapon. An intense arms race, especially in military space assets ensues but as more incidents are reported worldwide, it is up to the Science and Technology division at the CIA to race to find the cause of these strange occurances before the USA and the USSR get into a real shooting. The answer was a very creative resolution.

The characters are not believable but there is a strong bias expressed against lawyers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"Fannie Flagg is an amazing storyteller. The characters in this book are real, and fun to read about. My book club chose this book, and had a great time discussing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Light, Funny, Entertaining with spiritual undertones","review":"My book group selected this book and even though we discussed the humorous aspects, the heavier discussion of out of body experiences and is there a soul?, is there a heaven? were great book club discussions on a more serious note. The book was light reading yet made me think - how are we living our lives? What legacy do I want to leave behind? Lots of fun reading, highly recommended"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun entertainment","review":"This was a pleasant feel good book about an elderly lady and her attitude toward life and death. It has a happy ending, pleasant writing, good character development and leaves you smiling. It does poke some fun at conventional religious beliefs but it is done with humor and kindness, not animosity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't Wait to Get to Heaven","review":"I really loved this latest novel by Fannie Flagg. I can really relate to the small Missouri town of Elmwood Springs. I visted my grandparents in Camdenton, Missouri and my aunt in Macs Creek, Missouri. Doesn't every town have an Aunt Elner? Every family has a relative like Norma. I hope \\"Heaven\\" is the way Aunt Elner describes it! Cannot wait to get back to Elmwood Springs, Missouri. I am so excited to read Fannie Flagg's next book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Purchase","review":"I had already read this book, but wanted to buy it as a gift for a friend. I was very satisfied with the condition of the book which was considered \\"like new\\". I was not at all embarassed to give this as a gift. The service was very prompt and arrived packaged well. I recommend this book seller."},{"rating":"2","title":"Such down to earth, heartwarming comedy","review":"Fannie Flagg's \\"Can't Wait to Get to Heaven\\" was such a pleasure to read! It was uplifting (to say the least) and very amusing. Elner Shimfissle is so simplistic in her ways, but very wise and endearing. This is a must read for anybody wanting to be uplifted. You will find yourself immersed in the Elmwood Springs community anticipating what will happen next. It is refreshing to see the world through such innocent eyes as Mrs. Shimfissle."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened?","review":"I so enjoy Fannie's writing...but this one fell flat. I returned it to the library half finished because i was so bored with it, i didn't want to even pick it up to finish. Hopefully her next one will be a winner!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I thought at all","review":"This book was SO disappointing to me. I am a Christin woman and don't like to read accounts of Heaven not taken from the Bible. I first started this book and thought it was going to be great. I stopped on page 134 couldn't go any further. The story was dragged out and overall boring. Waste of time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Theology - Trite premiss","review":"I have always been a fan of Fanny Flagg's novels - she has such a quirky sense of humor and creates such lovable characters. I usually want to live in the town of the novel. But not this time. I was really disappointed in this novel. Disgusted too. Even if you're not Christian, I can't see anyone liking the heaven that she interprets here. Not only that, but many of the characters back on earth are either shallow or their problems are solved by a word of sage advice from the main character. Gag. Don't waste your time with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't Wait to Get to Heaven","review":"Not that great - she's done a lot better - \\"Fried Green Tomatoes\\" for instance -"},{"rating":"1","title":"error on page 111","review":"I am reading this book and don't find it as good as Fannie's other books. Too much fantasy. Another reviewer mentioned a serious error on page 111. I can't find it. There is a small grammatical error but I assumed that was intentional. What did I miss?"},{"rating":"1","title":"no brainer","review":"I read it. I finished it. I put it down and didn't speak of it again. Not my style: Too much floof - not enough substance. However, if this is your thing, it's not poorly written. There are other books out there that are much better. Mitch Album did one, and then there was Lovely Bones. If you want a book on the fictional heaven, I would try one of those first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plotless and boring","review":"In reading this book, I kept waiting for the action to start. The characters are very simplistic and not very realistic. The main character asks all kinds of questions and steps in and saves or helps everyone. She's the perfect Aunt or Grandma figure who saves people just by showing an interest or a little love. What a shame life doesn't work that way. Just heal mental illness by giving someone a kitten. Give me a break!! I couldn't finish this book. It was just too nothing...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I think Fannie must have eaten a bad jar of fig jam! After reading her previous novels I was expecting something just as wonderful. It reads like a summary of her previous books with some very strange religious overtones. What's the deal, Fannie? Take your time on the next one and maybe invent some new characters!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did anyone notice a problem with the fig tree?","review":"I've been a huge fan of Fannie Flagg, but I was tempted to put this book down and not finish it. It was the size of the fig tree that put a bad taste in my mouth for this book. Since when do fig trees grow the size of shade trees? As a reader of fiction I can only suspend belief for so much. I wish I had just waited for the paperback version instead of investing in the hardback."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISAPPOINTED","review":"Since \\"Welcome to the World Baby Girl\\", \\"Fried Green Tomatoes\\" and the BEST of all \\"Standing In The Rainbow\\", Ms. Flagg's books have been very mediocre. She is one of my favorite authors but has not had a book \\"that you just could not put down\\" since Standing in the Rainbow and the one's mentioned above. Also, I found this book insulting and disrespecful towards anything spiriual regarding her take on Heaven. I would not recommend this book. Ms. Flagg needs to start on a new sequel, they are what make her the great author she is."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened, Fannie Flagg?","review":"I've enjoyed all of Flagg's books but not this one! I finally gave up about a third of the way through this silly and sophomoric disappointment (and I'm one of those people who feels I have to finish a book once I start it). The religious overtones are boring and ridiculous and all but the character of Elner were unlikeable or pointless. Don't waste your time or money on this one; let's hope Fannie gets it right the next time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't Wait is boring and slow moving","review":"Sorry I can't agree with the 5 star ratings. I found this book to be slow going. Found the names of people to be beyond stupid, which is always annoying in any book.I found nothing inspirational in this book. I do believe in an after life and God and in Near Death Experiences but who she met with and some of the conversations were just ridiculous. It would have been more believable if she'd had a heart attack and was revived. Her advanced age IMHO would make it unlikely she would have been 'sent back'. I know it's fiction but like my fiction to be along more realistic lines.The cat was the most interesting part of the entire book. The people were dull and lead boring lives. I didn't think it was cozy or get any warm snugglies from it at all. Squirrels are not fit to be in anyones house let alone on the counter tops. Give me a break, this book was to dumb to be printed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Life In Written Form","review":"I read this during the holidays and it puts that \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\" feeling in your heart! What a great read this was. Fannie Flagg mixes humor with a touch of heaven. This book is sensational and a great book to curl up with a cup of tea, comforter on a snowy day. Can't say enough good things about it !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Humor throughout","review":"I enjoyed this book. I chuckled from the beginning to the end. One scene had me laughing out loud--the maiden real estate voyage. The only problem I had was that \\"Elner is dead\\" or some variation of it got pretty repetitive. And I merely skimmed over the heaven scenes. Also, the very last pages seemed to come out of nowhere and seemed unnecessary. But I have little patience for that kind of thing. Otherwise, great book. Very lighthearted fun read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flagg makes you love her Characters","review":"I loved Standing in the Rainbow, and I loved Can't Wait To Get To Heaven even more. The characters are lovable and laughable. Aunt Elner's comments are priceless and made the book in my opinion. The town of Elmwood Springs is a special place that Flagg has created and I hope she continues to bring it to life. One of the greatest things about America, and something that not everyone will get to experience, is life in a small town. Well, Fannie Flagg brings that experience home for everyone, and she is a joy to read. For those of you commenting on portrayal of God in this book, I would say, this is a fictional work of art. It's just a funny story. None of us believes God is what was portrayed here. Don't read more into what is there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet, Guiltless Pleasure","review":"What a treat! Especially if you listen to the author read the tale, with that expressive drawl. And the characters--Mrs. Elner Shimfissel is a gem, reminiscent of Arsnic and Old Lace. A story that reminded me that people still laugh and love, almost forgot that."},{"rating":"1","title":"UTTERLY DISAPPOINTED","review":"I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A BIG FAN OF FANNIE FLAGG. WHEN I FIRST STARTED READING THIS BOOK I THOUGHT IT WAS WONDERFUL. THE CHARACTERS WERE SO FUNNY AND YOU SOON FELT LIKE YOU KNEW THEM ALL PERSONALLY. SHE'S A GOOD WRITER FOR SURE. BUT LESS THAN HALF WAY THROUGH THE BOOK, I CAME UPON A CHAPTER THAT BROKE MY HEART AND I THREW THE BOOK IN THE TRASH.THIS BOOK IS DEFINATELY NOT FOR ANY TRUE CHRISTIAN THAT KNOWS OUR TRUE HEAVENLY FATHER OF THE HOLY BIBLE. NO, OUR FATHER IN HEAVEN IS NOT NAMED RAYMOND WHO SMOKES CIGARS, NOR DOES HE HAVE A WIFE NAMED DOROTHY THAT HELPED HIM IN CREATING THE UNIVERSE!HOW HORRIBLE TO REPRESENT OUR TRUE GOD OF THE BIBLE IN SUCH A MOCKED WAY. FANNIE FLAGG BLEW IT BIG TIME WITH THIS BOOK.SHE HAS A RIGHT TO THINK WHAT SHE WANTS ABOUT OUR GOD AND TO MAKE HIM OUT IN ANY FORM SHE WANTS, BUT THIS IS NOT A BOOK FOR A TRUE CHRISTIAN. IT WILL REALLY MAKE YOU MAD. BEING UTTERLY DISAPPOINTED IS AN UNDERSTATEMENT."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't Wait to Get to Heaven","review":"This was a fun book to read. I was interested in Fannie Flagg's ideas on what might await us in heaven. I don't think she's right in everything, but I guess we won't know until we get to heaven, too! I especially liked the ending, where you were given what changed in everyone's lives because she came back from heaven for a short time."},{"rating":"2","title":"fun and funny","review":"this book is laugh out loud funny in spots. some characters have humorously alliterated names and all are quirky and amusing. it will be hard to top Fried Green Tomatoes but this book is Ms. Flagg's best offering of late."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flat","review":"The story was flat and boring most of the way through. The typical irreverent style was more annoying & offensive. I was very disappointed in this book. Not the usual Fannie Flagg."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laughter and tears","review":"Fannie Flagg has a way of making her readers laugh out loud one minute and cry the next. It's all because of the wonderful, slightly quirky characters she creates for the mythical town of Elmwood Springs, Missouri. In this book Elner Shimfissle takes center stage as the nature-loving lady who often does kind deeds for others. One of those kind deeds gets her in trouble when she climbs a ladder and encounters wasps in her fig tree. The plot defies description, but suffice it to say that Elner begins a memorable journey which will have long-lasting effects on her hypochondriacle niece, Norma, her granddaughter Linda, and several of her friends and neighbors. Among the laughter and the gentle spoofs on doctors and hospitals, there are some questions posed on the meaning of life and the hereafter. Read and enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Keeper!","review":"Thank you, Fannie!Fried Green Tomatoes is one of my all time favorite books and now this is every bit as good. What a wonderful story.Thank you, thank you,and please keep writing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as past novels","review":"I love Fannie Flagg's writing - and have enjoyed her past books. Sadly - this time around - this title does not measure up to her usual fine quality. Her past novels were glib, engaging, heartfelt... This installment is flat. Great characters - but they don't go anywhere. I have loved her past works - folksy, charming, real characters that you wish you knew. In the past - I could not put down her books and could not wait for this to come out. This one - I literally put down half way through. I was disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Down to Earth, Yet Inspiring","review":"Real people with different personality types who care about each other. Down to earth, yet inspiring. I enjoyed it. Will order more Fannie Flagg books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charming, to the Nth degree","review":"Wouldn't we all love to live in Fanny Flagg's fictional world? She delineates her characters so well. Of course it would be nice if everything turned out well in real life as it does in her novels.I do agree that the plot line of the murder was gratuitous and added nothing to the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Joy to Read","review":"Can't Wait to Get to Heaven was a great read. The characters were fun, the story uplifting - literally. For a good time, I recommend you read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable, but not great","review":"Wouldn't the world be a better place if more people were like Elner? She cares about other people, takes risks, tries to do the right thing and has a positive attitude. And she's a hoot! While the plot may seem simplistic and goofy on the surface, Flagg deftly and subtly tackles serious social issues (racism, terroism, religion, even stress), as well as showing how big an impact one person could have on so many lives. The \\"mystery\\" did not fit in with the rest of the story and tainted the ending for me. The error that the reviewer was commenting on is that Ida, Elner's sister, is referred to as Ida Shimfissle, not Ida Knott. Shimfissle is Elner's married name."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life in a Small Town, USA","review":"\\"Can't Wait to Get to Heaven\\" is a light, humorous, airy book and yet so real and true to life. All of these good friends living in a small town, knowing each others business and caring for one another in the true meaning of friendship, makes this book easy to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Gift of Laughter","review":"What a great read! Fannie Flagg understands people. Better yet, she loves people, and she gets them exactly right.One of the things she understands is that people are often unintentionally funny. \\"Heaven\\" has a generous helping of laugh-out-loud moments, lots of chuckles and an overall feeling of goodwill. All without being syrupy.Now, truth to tell, this is an over-the-top story. The characters are larger--and sometimes stranger--than life, but you'll recognize people you know. The events are not your everyday stuff, either, but you happily go along because the people are so true to the situations.People talk about Fannie Flagg being a southern writer, and you get the idea us Yankees won't get it. Well, I've never lived in the South, but it felt like home to me.The gift of laughter is a great gift, and my thanks go to Ms. Flagg for presenting me with so much of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so much a star as a dark hole.","review":"This book tries hard to recapture the hilarity of Fried Green Tomatoes, but it flops harder than an 18-wheeler dropped from the top of the Empire State Building. Undoubtedly the most disappointing book I've read in years.Actually not 100% true... I wasn't even able to finish reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shame on Ms. Flagg","review":"What was it Dorothy Parket said in her review of a performance by Katherine Hepburn: 'She ran the gamut of emotions from A to B.'Sad to say, Miss Flagg didn't even get to A with her latesteffort.She made us care for the people she wrote of in 'Fried Green Tomatoes At the Whistle Stop Cafe.' In this novel, she seems to 'painting by numbers,' so to speak. Writing through formula rather than from the heart."},{"rating":"1","title":"A sad disapointment","review":"I have loved this author's other books, but this one is boring and strange. I find that, aside from the one-dimentional but charming protagonist, the author's characters and the author's observations about society and religion are jarring and offputting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book is worse than a root canal.","review":"I began this book looking for light entertainment. Turned out to be a challenge of endurance. The 1st half was full of one of the main characters whining, for hours. After the investment of my time I wanted to hear it out, believing it would have to get better. Nope it didn't. After all the whining it got so boring and the ending was so predictable and boring. Side note...the narrator could not pronounce the word \\"ambulance\\". This word was used in the beginning a dozen of times and the narrator always said \\"amulance\\", one time at the end she finally pronounced the word correctly. If you are scheduled for a root canal, read this book first...the dental apt. will be a breeze comparatively."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cann't get to heaven is a great book","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book even though I read it out of sequence with Fannie Flagg's other great books.

Some humor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Semper Fi !!","review":"Panned by reviewers at the time of it's release, but a box office hit, nonetheless. In some respects, Battle Cry is not much more than a soap-opera type presentation, but a bunch of good acting and sympathetic characters helps sell it.As pointed out by another reviewer, this movie was ALWAYS in color, and as far as it not running very frequently on TNT or elsewhere, that's because of economics and availability, not content.James Whitmore turns in a fine job as the stalwart Sarge, and minor roles by Fess Parker, and L.Q. Jones (the character's name, as subsequently actor McQueen's name), and others help make this a worthwhile viewing experience.Sure, the Danny [Tab Hunter] character is pure mush, but even there, it's probably his best acting and kudos also goes to Aldo Ray, as a hardass lumberjack who finds true love along the way.Certainly not on the level of From Here To Eternity as a \\"war\\" movie, this IS enjoyable viewing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A solid war film about the US Marines in the Pacific","review":"\\"Battle Cry\\" is an excellent film that follows a platoon of US Marines from basic training to the Tarawa landings. It features some somewhat stereotypical characters who are nevertheless pretty true-to-life. This film is based upon the Leon Uris novel of the same name, and is a pretty faithful reproduction of the novel. I actually liked the film better than the book, which is unusual for me.There can never be enough films made about the heroism of the US Marines and this is one of the better ones. Recommended.

For those involved, gritty performances, good scenes of humor,angst, and pain. I stumbled onto Battle Cry on Cable late over severalnights, and just couldn't get through the whole movie (what can I say?I have to work so I can buy these DVD's!!). So, I purchased it for$10/US. The fact that \\"BattleGround\\" was an extra was a bonus in my book!Finally, as my Dad was an World War II and Korea Army Infantry Man, Iknow that he would have gotten \\"a kick\\" out of the close-order drillingdisplayed in the movie. The guys in the scenes in both movies were on their job!!My rating: Five stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Battle Cry","review":"This movie is based on Leon Uris' best seller, and while it does not strictly adhere to the plot/timeline, it is still a relatively faithful treatment of the book. For those of you with short attention spans, this isn't the movie for you. It requires an investment in time and emotion to see the characters develop, in the movie and as friends of each other, culminating in the final battle scene, at Saipan. It is enjoybale, believable, and yes...a movie from the Fifties with all its good and bad points.....only a boorish or immature person would judge the movie because of that though....See for yourself, if you enjoy a great yarn, this movie is for you...and...if you don't think this is how barracks life really is.....you aint been in the Corps...Semper Fi"},{"rating":"2","title":"Battle Cry","review":"The sterling Novel by the great Leon Uris, converted into a movie. Leon Uris had also authored novels like Exodus, Topaz etc. The movie is well produced and in gorgeous technicolor and in widescreen and was released in 1956. A trifle long but quite realistic, what our brave hereos had to go thro, while fighting World War 2 and saving our world from those sadistic monstersn at that point of time, like Germans and Japanese! An excellent movie, but it is somewhat hard to get. I have trying to get my hand on this copy and suceeding at last!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Faulty Disk Review","review":"The cd of the movie Battle Cry is faulty. The first 1/2 hour of the movie does not play. There is a split screen thing going on that shows the title screen on one part and the movie on the other. The movie fits and starts, skipping several minutes at a time. Sometimes there is no sound and sometimes sound with static. After 1/2 hour it plays along fine. I played several other disks as well as the Battleground to make sure that there isn't something wrong with my player. They are all fine.

I took it to a Sigma Kappa party last night (yeah, Sigma Kappas) and shot about 30 pictures with it. Almost all of them came out perfectly. The ones that didn't were shot from too far away (the camera's flash isn't very powerful) or were shot by drunks and kind of off-center. I kept it in the back pocket of my jeans and probably sat on it about 50 times with no damage. If you want to be taking pictures that can be blown up to 12'x18' to cover a wall of your house, this isn't the camera for you. That said, if you want an inexpensive camera to take simple pictures of friends laughing, drinking, passing out on the stairs, dancing like idiots, or making out with random people (or for the more mature, pictures of friends looking depressed) the Pocket Digital 130 is perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent pocket camera for the price","review":"I've been using my 130 for well over a year now. Yes, the picture quality isn't the best. It needs to be held very steady, and taking pictures indoors is hit or miss (usually miss) It is quite handy though, and easy to always have around. I haven't found a better slim pocket camera for under $200.The metal case especially is great, as it means this camera can live with keys and other pocket items that could seriously damage a lesser armored camera.One can't fault the lack of a screeen for a camera this inexpensive, and the built-in battery is easily enough that you'll almost never have to worry about charging the camera (through the USB connector) leave it plugged in overnight once a month, and you're good to go."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blurry off-center pictures","review":"The pictures are blurry and off-center.

Don't believe the reviews. The camera is on its way back to amazon as I type this.

He likes to quote Einstein a lot but his own theories are so far out and speculative as to undermine a lot of what he is trying to say.

The music is compelling, exciting and appealing to an audience much wider than usual for opera. I bought the album at the opera shop next to the Coliseum. James Maddelena created the part of Nixon (and appeared in the London production). The recording is thirteen years old and wears its years well. All performances are superb. The Orchestra of St Luke's, less well known in the UK, perhaps, is a revelation. The recording reaches the highest standard. I encourage listeners to get a hold of this album. It is a great introduction to the music of John Adams, for me the most exciting modern composer since Benjamin Britten."},{"rating":"2","title":"Signature Swings!","review":"Ann Hampton Callaway is a gifted artist, who knows how to use her voice to the max!

I've seen her many times in cabarets, but the concept of this album is sheer folly. She's very talented, but not talented enough to stand comparisons with Sarah Vaughan, Billie Holiday, Ella Fitzgerald, etc. She never really put her stamp on the material, and each cut only makes me think of the earlier, and superior, original. I have all of Miss Callaway's CDs, but this one is the one I'll be playing the least."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unable to see display","review":"I bought this item thinking at $29.99 was too good to be true. Well, I was correct. The display is not bright, in fact, you can't see the numbers unless you get your nose down to the scale, by then, the 20seconds they allow you to save your information is up and it shuts off. I would not recommed this scale to anyone. I will pay a little more and get something better.

After all, this is the LP I grew up listening to it on. This is the LP I made a cassette from and used to listen to in the car or on my Walkman in college. But I've heard a LOT of Rhapsodies since then, and none of them quite measures up. The phrasing, the cadence, the sustain and pauses on the piano notes -- they are all spot on here. This is simply the one best recording I've found. Even other Bernstein performances don't capture the piece quite as well as it is found here. I'm really, really glad this is finally on CD now."},{"rating":"1","title":"False Advertising","review":"For those of you who care the back cover photo of this item indicates that the disc is the European edition of this collection. In fact, that is false advertising. There is, as I know because I was sent it, an American edition of this CD. This muckup is yet another example of Amazon laziness. Presumably they can't be bothered to get the photos right (particularly when they can borrow them from Amazon.uk) just as they can't be bothered to weed out reviews for DVD's when a new transfer of a film has come out. They seem to assume that once you have seen one transfer you have seen them all. Sloppy if not \\"criminal\\" practise.As to the Bernstein Gershwin, it is not bad. As commentators have noted, however, Bernstein makes cuts in the score (boo) and these performances seem more Bernstein than Gershwin (boo).So to sum up three stars for this performance and 0 stars for Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Song list is incorrect","review":"This cd is NOT an import version of the Tomato releases Early Years v1 and v2, which product description would have you believe.

I own it in Japanese and it's awesome!the Game play is cool, you can now battle with 2 Pokemon at a time, the Pokedex is cool, and you can link up to 4 players at a time! Seriously, i am looking forward to the North American Release! People: If your a true Pokemon fan, buy this game! It is the most promising pokemon game ever!Newly found information: There is a total of 135 new pokemon. Which makes the grand total(drum roll please!)......... 386 Pokemon!! Sadly, the most i heard you can find is 200. So, you will probably have to buy both games to get them all.Special: Gamers in Japan got a Special boat ticket at a Pokemon Fair and it took them to an island where they could find Latios(in SAPPHIRE) and Latias(IN RUBY).

However, after a few years, I decided I really wanted to play it again instead of restarting Ruby for the fifth or sixth time so I looked it up. The one I bought was used but it's of good quality and works well. It works just about like any other Pokemon game: you choose your starter, go through the gym leaders, beat the final four, and catch a whole lot of Pokemon, among other side quests. It's a fun game; I loved it as a child and even enjoy playing it for kicks now."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Pokemon Fan MUST","review":"Like most Pokemon fans, I've been playing since the old days of Red and Blue, on my beat-up GameBoy Pocket. Unfortunately for Pokemon, GameBoy Color game out shortly after the release of Red and Blue, and it would take even more time for them to jump on that bandwagon.Since my original playing of Blue, I have yet to get through an entire game of Pokemon. I keep getting distracted and starting all over again. Unfortunately, that's the only drawback to Sapphire. I would have been a bit happier had they been able to hold my attention longer through the game - then I wouldn't have felt the need to continuously start new games. But the best part about Pokemon is that the game is never same twice, since you're constantly building new teams. Give it a try - especially on the new GameBoy Advance SP!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nintendo: smart, or out of their mind?","review":"When I first bought these games on poke'mon some 3 or so years ago I thought they were the best games ever made. I was even more suprised when there counterparts gold, silver, and crystal came out. Then I had figured out that you could trade back and fourth between all of them. Then when I was strolling through a store I saw an advertisement and the \\"Cool\\" pokemon the game possesd, I went nuts! I think it was a little foolish that nintendo did this for two reasons: Pokemon, aare pretty much over. And the new pokemon look somewhat \\"unattractive, or uncarismatic if you will\\". Then I thought of haveing a whole new world to explore in the game and thought it might be fun, and the \\"hip\\" thing to would be to purchase them. All over all this game will probobly be fun and challengeing in Its own way, but these new flashy games,(no Quotes)will never replace the origional pokemon games.(P.S. Why didn't nintendo release pokemon green in america?)"},{"rating":"2","title":"all time best pokemon game!","review":"I got this game 2 days after it came out and it is so good!

This time there will actually be 134 new Pokemon! Like in Crystal, you can become a boy or girl and start a Pokemon journey. There are a couple of bad parts too. One is that you cannot journey to the following regions; Kanto (from R,B,Y) Johto (from G,S,C) and the Orange Islands (not in any game). Another one is you cannot catch most of the R,B,Y,G,S,C Pokemon!

I hav alredy evolved him into Swampert. Kyogre is an awesome legendary. he is really strong( i have caught him). Zigzagoon does have a lot of abilities but u'll find that he isn't very powerful. When u find a SNORUNT in Shoal cave- catch him. he is very rare!!!!!!!!!!! also if u see a RELICANTH and WAILORD- catch them- u'll need them to unlock the 3 legendary REGICE, REGIROCK, and REGISTEEL. the first gym leader is ROXANNE she has a lvl. 14 geodude and a lvl. 15 Nosepassthis game is really cool. buy it!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This game is awsome...oh!and KerBear102.....","review":"This game is awsome!I own all the other versions in english and japenese.And just so you know KerBear102,your review made it sound like you know everything about it.And its not true that the game isnt for kids.I my first game was Pokemon Blue.And I had it ever since I was 8.Now I am 5 yrs better at this game and I say its better to buy it when ur just a kid cauz when they come out with new ones in the furture,you would be ?yrs better at it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Faulty copy.","review":"I ordered this game last weekend because I was feeling a certain nostalgia, got the actual game a week before they estimated it would get here so I was very happy to receive it.

Upon starting a new game, I could not even see Birch at the beginning due to him being invisible. I did not tamper with the cartridge or anything along the lines of that, it simply just stopped working properly.

It's a fad that died out a few years ago, yet Nintendo's making a sequel with some of the most dated graphics I've ever seen. The series hopes to get young kids into the RPG genre, which is fine, but for them to keep at it this long is abseloutely pathetic. They should have scrapped this project and focused on the new Golden Sun game, an RPG series that's actualy GOOD and requires DEEP THOUGHT. I doubt anyone over 10 is playing pokemon anymore.

I'll put down some things that it covers:Gameplay: Walk around, talk, challenge other trainers to battles (what else is new?)The battles are pretty cool at the beginning. You're probably thinking, \\"How cool! Now I know what it's like in the TV show!\\" But after a while, it gets old. The guy with the highest speed goes first, you use one move, the other guy uses another move, blah blah blah until one of them is knocked unconsious and you get exp. When you get a certain amount, you level up and get stronger. Pretty basic for an RPG.Graphics: Great. They hve just everything, perfect graphics. Hands down.Sound: So-so. In some places it's really good, but in other's it just makes you sick just listening to it. Still, it's better than nothing.I give it a 7.3 out of 10.It is pretty good for an RPG, but I wouldn't say it's just normal.

It does a good job of providing some insights into the \\"why\\" some materials are better than others for reasons of oxidation, fatigue etc... But, this is NOT a book you should go to for material data. Most of the graphs are labeled \\"typical\\" You will more than likely end up buying another book or websearching to get such data. Overall, though, it was a good intro for someone who needs to get up to speed on this area (e.g. for me it was turbine materials)and lay the groundwork.

By 1983 it had become insufferably conformist. Even worse, it had also grown to be intensely violent. Even though in many ways the motivation was positive, the release of energy at hardcore shows often resulted in kids getting physically hurt. Ian felt extremely guilty and saddened over it. When bemoaning this to HR of the Bad Brains, HR told him, \\"You started it.\\" This is why Ian did Embrace. It was his attempt to undo the damage he perceived himself being responsible for. While Embrace didn't last long and crumbled an entire year before they released this album, Ian carried on his same sense of purpose in Fugazi in 1987, and he continues to this day."},{"rating":"2","title":"re: first emo record","review":"I don't intend to knock this record which I like very much, but 1985 is a bit late to say \\"first\\" emo record as in the review below. If you dig Fugazi/Embrace/Rites of Spring, check out Mission of Burma's \\"Signals and Calls\\" EP from '79 or '80. There's no doubt they had a huge influence on the mid-80s DC scene, yet seem like a footnote in history next to Fugazi who had a nearly identical style 10 years down the road.

Other suggestions: Dag Nasty, Wig out at Denkos/Can I say ; Turning Point ; Rites of Spring . Dischord Records deserves most of the credit for such an interesting style of music"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dance of Days","review":"Ian MacKaye never fails me with whatever music project he does. Embrace is Ian MacKaye on vocals with the rest of the band Faith minus their lead singer, Alec MacKaye (Ian's brother). Very good lyrics.

The entire game is filled with different, and challenging puzzles on each of it's 64 squares of game play (on the sea chart). The characters are well designed and occasionally throw a bit of humor into the game. I have yet to finish the game, and it seems to me that I'm not already half-way through it and it's already been a month. It's not one of those types of games where you can easily beat it in a few weeks and be done with it. For those of you who previously owned another Zelda game, you know what I mean. If you're debating whether or not to get this game, buy it and you won't regret it. It's probably one of the best (if not the best) of the Zelda series."},{"rating":"2","title":"So very curious","review":"Well, I've always loved Zelda in the past, so I'm hopeful that this game will be just as awesome. Yes, the graphics can get me a little teary eyed. Especially since they changed after the beatiful previews at the E3 show. I did hear that the graphics changed so they could actually do more w/ the game. I don't know exactly what it means, but hopefully it's good!

It looks like this game was designed for 3 year olds and the characters look stupid. Beleve me I tried to give this new game a chance and it not the same anymore. I loved Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask those games rocked and Wind Waker falls short of it.

If you would like to voice your feelings about the game. Nintendo has a web site click on their (contact us) section on their home page look for a picture of Mario.

The graphics are poor and much too of a cartoon effect than any of the previous games. The game lacks the delightful and challenging puzzles we had to solve in previous Zelda versions. This game may be great for kids (my grandson has nearly solved it), but for those of us who enjoy a challenging game, this game is not anywhere close to the caliber of the previous Zelda games we have come to enjoy. For gamers looking for a challenging game, look further than Wind Waker."},{"rating":"2","title":"complex, fun, entertaining...","review":"this is a great game for any age, it has a lot of new ideas and advanced gameplay that allows for beginners to learn and experts to excel at.

While other games lead you on a string from one obstacle to the other, Windwaker is (after a certain point) somewhat open ended, leaving you hours on end the go off course of the storyline and explore the dozens of induvidually crafted islands in the game. With hundreds of sidequests, you could be browsing islands for hours or only a couple of minutes. The only drawback is that completing the game and all of it's sidequests without a guide is virtually impossible because of many obscure details, and took a very competent gaming friend of mine a year. But I still hold it a the best game I have ever played in my life."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best game ever!! well, second best","review":"This is the best, well second best, game ever!!

I thought that it added an interesting flavor to it; to be a serious plot--evil villian (won't spoil who it is) plots to take control of the world and a boy hero must save the day--while the game didn't look too dark and forboding. Some of the side quests were irritating--like the Tingle Quest, which you need a GameBoy Adv. to complete (and I didnt feel like buying one just for that)--but the game was great overall. The story, including the past (referring to N64's Ocarina of Time), and how this new Hero and the evil villian are related--along with finding out who Princess Zelda is and uncovering the long-lost Triforce, is put together greatly and hat's off to Nintendo for that. This is a must for Zelda fans and those who enjoy a good quest game!"},{"rating":"2","title":"long and challenging, but it's all good","review":"this is the first Zelda game I've ever played and from the way I see it, it's the BEST!!!! Yet, you'll probably feel frusterated sometimes because of Windwaker's tricky puzzles and tough bosses. In the end, it's worth it to see the master sword get stabbed into Ganondorf's head.So take my word for it and prepare for a quest across the Great Sea!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"ok... game..","review":"I think this game is better than the old ones. Though, Im not such a great fan of zelda games.. i thought this one was pretty good! But it was easier than the older ones..and way different graphics.. Link looks way different..

U beat the boss, go to a different place.. beat another boss, go to a differnt place until finally the game ends with the hardest boss.."},{"rating":"2","title":"All Hear This!","review":"OK OK OK OK!... I am sooo tired of people judging this game by its graphics!... (Even though it isn't graphics, it's SHADING!) The Nintendo Company is a very unique company. Right now they are using cell shading because nobody else is and they want their games to be different. The people who are turned off by the gameplay probably never got past the first dungeon! Whoever says that this game deserves one star is a complete mindless dolt! Notice that they never even bother to look at what they wrote and make capital letters and correct punctuation? I am in eighth grade and I am a better writer than all of them put together. I have played the demos at the gamestop stores and they were way beyond what I expected! I'm getting mine in two days.

I highly recommend this game for all LoZ enthusiasts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Changes for the better","review":"I remember first seeing the commercials for LOZ:TWW and thinking what the heck was going on with my beloved Zelda. Cutesy graphics. Child Link again!!! More Japanese \\"oooOOOOOOHHHH\\"s than I could handle. No way would I like this game.Man was I wrong. Nintendo put out a gem with WW and if you don't think so, go play it yourself. You want adventure in the high seas? You got it. You want puzzle-solving quests and awesome animation? You got it. You want a Zelda game that stands at or above the standard of every Zelda game you've ever played? Here it is.There really wasn't a second I didn't enjoy with this game. The action is awesome, the plot is probably the best in the series, and you will learn to love Legend of Zelda : The Wind Waker. Highly Recommended!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Wind Waker Rocks!","review":"I really enjoyed this game! It has wonderful graphics that remind me of a Disney cartoon. The plot is detailed, and picks up where the Ocarina of Time left off.

This is the best Zelda game ever!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining Game","review":"This game was the first gamecube game that I couldn't stop. While I haven't been able to play the first series, I am not upset by the different graphics. The plotline grows as the game progresses, and the attention to minute detail makes the game that much more enjoyable. Listening to the sounds the characters make leads me to wonder if the sounds changed at all from the Japanese version to the English. The music for the game was long enough that it did not loop annoyingly unless you were already stuck in a level. The game did not require strategy guides, as many strategy games, and if you worked at the problem long enough, you could try enough things to succeed at whatever frustrated you. This game really touched me as it was cute, fun and a hook into the rest of the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"toon-shaded big WHOOP.","review":"Big deal, the game looks like a cartoon, it's not like it's going to look like real people, it's a game designed for younger kids, what'd you expect. Besides that, OoT and WW came out at different technological times, they can't be compared fairly. Story line of the game rocks, items are great, length of time it takes to beat it is way too low for me. I'd prefer a game with a loooooooong story."},{"rating":"2","title":"From the Nes To The GameCube.

Also, the whole concept of getting around the world by sailing from island to island is really original, although sometimes it gets a little boring.One thing to keep in mind is that it's puzzle based, if you're the kind of person that likes to shoot ... everything that moves, this might not be your cup of tea...Unfortunately, it doesn't have a whole lot of replay value because of the lack of multiplayer, etc... but if you're in the mood for a big fun adventure, this is your game!"},{"rating":"2","title":"... This game is...well...kakkoi!","review":"When I first started this game, I was more than a little confused on what I was supposed to do. But now, I'm speeding along and I couldn't love this game more. The graphics are great, the storyline is incredibly deep and well thought out, and the music is wonderful - it's original but has some familiar tunes from Ocarina of Time. Since the game's story is, in itself, tied with Ocarina of Time, you see familiar characters - a Zora, for example, and lots of references to OoT's story. It's simply wonderful and I would recommend this game to ANYONE! =D"},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME","review":"Wow this game is awesome this is my first zelda game I bought and I do'nt regret it at all you sail around the world with the red lions the boat and he gives you clues on where to go etc. and there is 3 in total island you visit before you play gannon and theres 3 bosses. You get to have the grabbling hook where you swing from trees, the leaf where you could float around or blow your enamies, thewind waker where you could change the direction of the wind and the telescope the are the main othersinclude spoil bag where you colect you enamies goodies bate bag where you real in you enamies and treasure maps dungeon map etc. I would'nt have come close of beating this game without brady games strategy guide. I give major props to them. All in all I give this game 10 stars my favirote game ever. I would recomend it to any one other might be a little hard for little kids im 14 and I did but the guide made it funner for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thw Wind Waker","review":"Like the other 15 Zelda games, Wind Waker challenges you with sophisticated puzzles, twisted traps and brilliant action! People weren't too fond of the game's design and graphics when it first released, but now, this is an absolute treasure to own!It takes place apporxomately 100 years after \\"Ocarina of Time\\". The seal on Ganon has worn down and he escaped. The story enriches with new caracters like Medli, Makar, and Aryll. Some previous characters return in this great installment such as Beedle, Tingle, and, of course, Zelda. The great fairy also makes appearances throughout.The music featured is a brilliant masterpiece that that composers had taken the time to conduct.

A Complete 5 stars! 10/10A Great Game!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Childish?","review":"I have a lot of friends who almost immediately shrugged off the thought of getting WindWaker because of the overall kiddy look. I think anyone who actually played the game would stand by and say the game is amazing when given the chance. I will admit, the first time I played I was kinda iffy since it was the first time Zelda had ever taken on this new style, but it grew on me almost immediately. While the atmosphere is certainly much less mature than that of Ocarina of Time or Majora's Mask, WindWaker has an amazing story with great character development and a surprising ending for such a \\"cute\\" game.Overall, this game probably has over 60 hours of gameplay if you do the story head on. If you complete all the side quests and collect all the extras, I'm going to say over 100 hours! (Especially since the world is so huge)I would definitely recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"A ONE OF A KIND","review":"Whoever says this game was ruined because of its graphics.... does not know what theyre missing!

Stuck places are rare in here - it's nice! Plus I am a sucker for awesome graphics. Did I mention the graphics are awesome? It's less real, but less dark than Ocarina of Time.The figurine side quest was intriguing, and it sent me running about for pictures to make figurines into.

Back In the NES days. I am skipping Adventures of Link because that does not count as a \\"Zelda\\" game (although good in it's own right.) Then came A Link to the Past on the SNES totally reinvented the \\"Zelda\\" Game Making this one the best one out there. And of course there is Link's awakening on GB this got back to the \\"Zelda\\" roots. Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask on N64 again awesome. Then a year or so later comes the Oracle Series better know as Ages and Seasons on GBC. They stuck with the tried and true for many years barely changing the story or style of play. Then I hear of Zelda: The Wind Waker, which is supposed to be cell-shaded and take place on a \\"Water World\\"-ish place. Totally getting away from \\"Zelda.\\" What was I a fan to do? So I tried and I promise you will be amazed by the game play and sheer plot-driven story.

It is kinda scary when kids around 10 to 15 are better in GTA: Vice City than the average 20 yr old. This can be attributed to our society and parental responsibility. This is where the Legend of Zelda: The Winder Waker comes in. People have constantly bashed Nintendo's kiddie game approach (myself included), however children and adults should not shy away from this game. Children will love the game because the main character Link, is a true hero. This game would also please adults because the game and its story are cleverly written. The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker will not teach children how to duel with guns, or any other sexual innuendos. Simply, it is the way video games should be done. Fun and imaginative."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 stars so far...","review":"This game, after only playing through 2 dungeons, is a work of art. All of the controversy over the graphics should be laid to rest. You'll find yourself in the heat of battle, distracted by the time and attention to detail that the \\"artists\\" at nintendo put into this game. The dungeons have been a little on the easy side so far, but as a veteran of the Zelda series, I know they will get increasingly more difficult as the game progresses. Sailing on the ocean for the first time reveals a world that is overwhelming. You will feel like you can explore for months and never scratch the surface.

It was one of the best games I have ever played. But what happened here? Its like a wanna be paper Mario, or something. The new graphics all the magazines claim are \\"revalutionary\\" are really really sad. The puzzles and stuff in Wind Waker borrow too much from OOT. They basically took the old ones and stuck them here in the hopes that noone would notice they are the same. The fighting is all right, but it wasn't as satisfying as previous titles.Overall, its not that bad of a game. Its zelda, so its got to have some value. However, it just wasn't the old run around with Link and kick butt feeling. It was more of a ride a boat with a geek and hit people with a stick feeling. Rent it, don't buy it. That's my final advice."},{"rating":"1","title":"sailing ...","review":"this is a must own for all zelda fanaticks.it is n instant classic.but hold up, no game is flawless. lets face it the sailing ... . they could have made the sailing alot more fun and not so long but no it just could not be that easy. any of you people who like to see a boat going over water for fifteen minutes, this is a MUST own. for all other normal people this is a must rent good buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Zelda Ever","review":"This game is the worst.

It has everything that a Legend of Zelda game should have; great puzzles, fun combat, good characters; but I don't, and not for the reason that most would give. The cel-shading was a novel idea. It's the stupid island hopping that turns me off to this game. The Legend of Zelda is supposed to take place in Hyrule, or, as in the case of Link's Awakening, on AN island, not some \\"Great Sea\\" covering an old Hyrule. If everything else had been the same, the cel-shading, the characters, weapons and puzzles and had set it in one place without having to hop islands, I would have loved it as much as the other games.

The graphics were alright, but not nearly as captivating as OOT, and the storyline was unoriginal. My biggest gripe was the sailing. It was way too time-consuming; I could actually just point the stupid boat and get up and do something else. I finally realized: there are so many better things I could be doing with my time.I don't recommend this game, unless you just don't care because it is Zelda. Why Nintendo changed what was already a huge success so drastically is beyond me."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst zelda game of all time","review":"This is the worst zelda game of all time for all nintendo systems.

It doesn't stand the test of time like the other zelda's. I played through all zelda games all the way through. Here's my favorite zelda games in order.........1. Link To The Past - snes2. Ocarina of Time - N643. Legend of Zelda - nintendo4. Majora's Mask - N645. Legend of Zelda 2 - nintendo6. Windwaker - gamecubeSorry folks nintendo got it wrong with windwaker.

The PS2 has the great \\"final fantasy\\" series, while the Xbox has none. But Zelda is less serious and also, one might say, less pretentious than FF.

The animation may look weird compared to other legend of zelda games but it works amazingly. This game is the squeal to Ocarina of Time and yes its worth being called its squeal. Is it worth 100 dollars hmmmmmmm I cant say it is and I cant say it isnt. If you can wait it most likely going to come out on the WIIU virtual console store so If you want this game it probaly best to get a WIIU and buy it when it comes in the virtual store but if you want this game bad and i mean bad then i guess theirs no other choice.

Some people complain that the cartoon animation made it cheesy but that is what I love about it. The game is fairly simple to play although there are a few puzzle solving situations in it. The music in here is great; songs you will never forget. I have played this game several times and never gotten bored with it.

You won't be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"official Nintendo tester's view","review":"I was asked to test this game by Nintendo a few weeks ago and it is one of the best things that I've ever done. This game is outstanding. I have to admit I was a little wary of the new look at the outset, but Nintendo has succeeded once again. The new look allows for smoother transitions and great overall graphics. The gameplay is amazing and very in-depth. The game takes well over 40 hours to play. You will find yourself addicted to this game once you start. This is one of Nintendo's finest efforts ever and has done the great franchise of Zelda justice. This has set a new standard in console gaming."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cuccos Missing In Action","review":"WHERE are the CUCCOS??? The ghosts and mummies weren't as cool as I've seen them, either.

But no, Nintendo had to switch to this new \\"stealth\\" crap. Now, before you get all exicted that \\"Zelda's going to play like Metal Gear Solid and Splinter Cell!\\", let me tell you a little something: It doesn't. Instead, I'm treated to sitting in a barrel next to a guard that will sometimes stop for no reason to sniff his spear and waiting for hours on end to get to the end of a 3-foot area of land. BO-RING.The bottom line is, WW just isn't as fun as it should be. Next time, Nintendo should get the hint and go back to OoT style. If they don't, there's one less Zelda fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is this a new trend?","review":"I loved many things about LoZ:WW, but I am sorry to say that I am somewhat worried too. It seems that many new games for the Game Cube are much shorter than they should be. They are too easy to beat, and Nintendo knows this. They think that players will enjoy sprinting throught the game and continue to play the \\"mini-games\\" which, despite their addictive nature, are secondary on my mind. I want a meaty game that is hard to beat and an accomplishment rather than a blink of the eye.I wondered about the size of the Game Cube disks before, now I think they have lost much in this new system."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic","review":"This game is great! Dungeons and everything. It has odd new items like the Wind Waker and the Deuk Leaf. A major differance between this and any other Zelda game is that you spend a ton of time on water. Remember the older games where hyrule had a lake or two. Well. Now there is so much water Link has his own sailboat just to be able to travel on the huge ocean. There are now many islands in the game. I dislike the graphics though. I wish they had made Link look like he dose in Super Smash Bros. Melee (a great game). But if you are a Zelda fan you should buy this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"does the game include the bonus disc ?","review":"Does anybody know if I get the bonus discwith oscarina of time and lots of otherstuff if I order the game here?

(i played like an hr. of it every 3 days) and my friend beat it like about 2 weeks before me and he only got it a day before me! After i beat it, i thought a LOT of gamers would think it's a disgrace to the zelda series. (My opinion) If you ask me it was not only short but very easy. you dont even need 2x magic meter! I'm not going to reveal who the last boss is to gamers who have never played this game or who are still playing it but he's easy. Even though it's a great game, it's just too darn fast and easy. I like more of a challenge. I would recommend, but if you want to play a real zelda game, dust of your N64 and play Ocarania of time or a Majoras Mask. (not as challeging.) But still WW is still a great game!"},{"rating":"2","title":"so good","review":"This game is so good it has to be one of the best. It is also though so hard. There is so much gameplay and so much to do. The only bad thing is how smart you need to be in the dungeons and how complex it is.

I know a lot of people dont like the graphics, and at first i didnt either... i remember i thought the old graphics were soo cool and then they changed and i thoguht the game would be bad... btu now that i have played it i am glad they changed the graphics and after a few minutes you dont even realize the change... I also liked the storyline but i wish there was more to it and i do miss being in Hyrule. But the fact that this game was a sequeal to Ocarina of Time was cool instead of having the same storyline, even though this game didnt have the same amount of dungeons or that it didtn take place in Hyrule doesnt mean that it wasnt a classic Zelda game. To me, this is probably my favorite Zleda game yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Zelda Windwaker","review":"This game really lives up to the status of the past Zeldas. However the storyline is different. This time it takes place in a totally different time where Hyrule was overcome by Ganon after Link died. In the game Hyrule is in a uh...different place, (I'm not saying where b/c then it would give the suspense away!)you have to beat this *uknown character* to save your sister after she gets kidnapped. One clarification, you are NOT Link. It is common on the character's island to dress accordingly when you reach a certain age. in the characters case, he is that age when his sister gets kidnapped. Overall great game though."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Ok let me start out by saying this game is so fun and the graphics are great.

I had never played a Zelda game before and had heard that they were really good. But after I played it awhile, I found myself incredibly bored. I got extremely tired of sitting there waiting for the characters to stop talking already! And although Link (the main character) has a sword, he rarely uses it. Then he looses it later in the game and has to run around cluelessly trying to find it again. Talk about barely any action. After that he gets a talking boat and a goofy wand that, apparently, lets him controll the wind. What's with that? I don't call this a \\"puzzle\\" game. I call it a BORING game.

Actually, I thought it was a rather cute idea. The real problem of this game is the fact that Link doesn't stay on solid ground!There's too much sailing that goes on in the game, and it gets old fast. It takes forever and is just all around tedious. Also, I found the frustration level for this game to be quite high. It's to be expected that you'd have to repeat certain spots of the gameplay in order to get it right and move on. However, there were certain parts where Link had to be angled *just* right. Which sometimes took an hour to accomplish; that is if I didn't just throw the controller at the screen first.I just gave up and stopped playing it because my anger level was just getting too high.

There's a main plot but a staggering number of side quests. When I play this game, I really feel like I'm in the presence of genius. Don't miss out on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"fun, challenging, and good for all ages","review":"The first 10-15 mins. of the game bored me but the rest is godly. The cartoon animations don't make this game bad at all. i like the way you can string together combos to beat your opponents and variety of items is good. the story is very good and keeps the player hypnotized; I played 5 hours until my mom told me to quit. I still wanted to play. The only reason I didn't give the game 5 stars was because sometimes I had to look at the walkthrough because i was stuck. for example, in the dungeon with lava, i woulnd't hae poured a pot of water in lava. In real life the water would have had no chance, but in the game the water makes the lava hard so you can easilly pass through it. Get the game if you can find it at a great price. A must have for all gamecube owners."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Legend of Zelda:The Wind Waker","review":"This maybe not the best Zelda game but it is my second favorite game in all the games so far.I liked how they went with cel-shading everything .The control is like every othe zelda game on the Nintendo 64.The duegons are sorta of hard but still you can have fun playing this game.The best part of this game is the sailing.Overall this game is a worthy game for an Nintendo Gamecubers Libary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Zelda Feel...","review":"I haven't played Zelda since the original came out for the NES and this game still has the same level of fun as the original.The graphics in this game are amazing! Watching this game unfold is unlike anything I've ever seen. These graphics are timeless.The only drawback to the game is it feels pretty linear. The original was so great because it was open to exploration and you could beat certain levels before even beating level 1. This game takes you from point a, to b, and so on. There are side missions, but big whoop."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's suprising how fun this game is...","review":"As a 27 year old who grew up on Zelda, but had now become the typical jaded gamer, it's hard to believe I like this game as much as I do.The controls are flawless, the story is great, the swordplay is amazing; the game is simply perfect.I encourage everyone to get this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Title","review":"The Wind Waker captures the saterday morining cartoon visual on a game. With all the bizzare weapons like the deku leaf and wind waker you solve surpisingly intresting puzzels as you hunt for you sister Ayrell.The Zelda makers used mostly recycled emeimes and one of the origainal bad-boys Ganon(or Ganondorf). You venture across the sea in your talking boat, the red lion king, in miles upon miles of sea, finding outposts, islands and more outposts.Overal the game is one of the Player Choices, and I personaly think you will enjoy it(Please rate my other reviews)."},{"rating":"1","title":"zelda","review":"Was very disappointed IT DIDN'T WORK !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

But no, Nintendo had to switch to this new \\"stealth\\"...Now, before you get all exicted that \\"Zelda's going to play like Metal Gear Solid and Splinter Cell!\\", let me tell you a little something: It doesn't. Instead, I'm treated to sitting in a barrel next to a guard that will sometimes stop for no reason to sniff his spear and waiting for hours on end to get to the end of a 3-foot area of land. BO-RING.The bottom line is, WW just isn't as fun as it should be..."},{"rating":"1","title":"IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT THE GRAPHICS!","review":"Many writers seem to think that a reviewer's dislike of this game is based solely on the graphics, but this is only one of the many reasons I was so disappointed in Wind Waker. The entire mood of the game has gone from fantasy good-vs-evil to Saturday morning cartoon. In the previous games you are battling genuinely scary creatures (hair standing up on the back of my neck the first time I encountered the re-deads for example) and having to actually use a little brainpower to make your way through many places, instead of now having the whole process spelled out for you. We now battle cutesy enemies that vanish in a puff of Disney-esque smoke, play hide-and-seek with annoying kids, and collect butterfly necklaces. There's just no comparison. This game would be perfect for the gradeschool set who maybe haven't played the previous ones, but in the long run, I'll stick to the older games and hope there's more (better) Zelda planned for the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"why did they use cell-shading???","review":"i have no argument about the gameplay fo this game.

NOT A STUPID BATON!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Bad","review":"I don't know about you guys but what made me love the Ocarina of Time was the intricate characters and the very well developed story, the music and graphics were a plus.

I loved Zelda: Ocarina of Tim and Majora's Mask. They looked great for the N64. But I was also baffled by the myster pick they showed in magazines. When this cartoon load ...came out, I screamed and hid under my bed. Link (the real one) was supposed to be in it. Not some bobble head little thing. The graphics where good, but I wanted Resident Evil looking Link and Ganondorf. Oh, Ganondork looks like he is 6000 years old, not hip and 30 like the older ones. The King of Red Dragons mouth was dubbed badly it looked dumb. STILL NO VOICE TALENT! I could understand why on the N64 they couldn't talk. But on the GCN, look at the other games! They talk! Why can't Link?! Oh and don't forget that bobble-head can't say a sentence. ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Game is Horrible","review":"I'm sad to say I bought the game. Don't get me wrong I love the Zelda series. Ocarina of Time was wonderful, but this? Dear lord it was horrible. You spend ten minutes going to each island.

They made it all rounded. To me it looks really bad and it hurts me to see what they did to it. I am a long time fan from when Link was in regular nintendo. When I first saw this game I was in shock. But being a long time fan I gave it a shot. When I did, I did not even like the way it played. I am glad some people like it so they make at least some money off of it, in hopes of making more Link's games.But to me the only thing I liked what the game I got with it.

I had never played a zelda game until i got this one. i actually thought that this game was pretty good. The graphics are ok, the gamepaly is great, and the levels are fantastic. there is only one problem with the game. in order to extend the length of the game, nintendo put in alot of filler material. There is so much filler material in the game that it ruins what could have been the best game in existence. The worst part is that the rest of the game is great, and the filler ruins it. if there was anyway to get around the filler, then i would not have given the game this low score, but unfortunatly there isn't. i just hope that nintendo, fixes this when they make the next zelda game.

And while they claim that Link is 12 years old in this game, he looks more like 6. I don't think that The Legend of Zelda was ever supposed to look \\"goofy\\" like this.

I saw the previews of this game as E3 and I felt nothing but disapointment. The childish, flat graphics have all but destroyed the game.The break from its elfin roots into this wierd MarioLand like interface is just hideous. For once, I think I'm going to pass on the Legend of Zelda.

The best of course being Try Me, I Know We Can Make It...an 18-minute ORIGINAL masterpiece that has been shortened to 3-4 minutes on succeeding releases.

Accompanied by the Munich Machine the song seems to fade and then recharges with stronger dance beats. But without any doubt the gem from this recording is \\"Could it be magic\\". Tosee her performimg this song live in concert is a breathtakingexperience.\\"Come with me\\" could be cut as a 12\\" single back then.Is a nice song to be remixed and perhaps reissued today.

Little bit stinky (but not really awful). Texture a little odd. But hey....it works. And it actually treats in addition to being a very mild cleanser.

I believe this was from the zinc. This product also contains zinc and I think thats why it works so well.Other than that, it works quite well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gifford's Fish-Finding Magic","review":"John Gifford's book Oklahoma Sport Fishing is a masterpieceof quality writing combined with first-hand accounts of where to find fish and how to catch them in the rivers and the streamsof Oklahoma.Our family takes the book as an indispensible item on everyfishing trip, and we've never been disappointed with the results.Gifford not only tells you where to fish and how to get therebut also what to fish with and when the best times are. From big lakes to small streams and everything in between, this book goes to the heart of what modern-day, ecologically conscientious sportfishing is all about. Fishing with spinning tackle,flying fishingsitting on the bank with a cane pole, whatever kind of fishingan angler enjoys, they are all discussed in the brillant little handbook that targets the seasons as well as the variety of sportfish that can be located and captured with pleasure within theborders of the state of Oklahoma. Don't leave home without Gifford's fishing secrets."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Weak Documentary","review":"I rented this because I've been to Ostia in Italy and have walked around the ancient apartments, and couldn't resist a documentary about the subject. It seems to me that only someone who is interested in ancient apartment buildings would buy this DVD, but there is really very little about Ostia or its apartments. There's a lot about modern apartments, health clubs, fire departments, but the ancient buildings themselves are on screen for only a few minutes and very little of interest is said about them. For me it was a waste of money. Terry Jones has a better show about ancient Rome, where he actually walks around an ancient apartment building and discusses what life there was really like."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lifechange changes lives","review":"Excellent product.

This is relaxing if you are looking for poses that stretch the body. As you do these deeply relaxing poses you use gravity to your advantage. The exercises can help to relieve back pain or arthritis and the modifications make this practice appropriate for all fitness levels.

If you want to hear Maiden live, get Live After Death. This CD is put to better use as a frisbee, however. I suspect that when vocalist Bruce Dickinson quit the band, the rest of Maiden decided to milk him for all he was worth to delay hiring a new singer. This album, along with the other live album released around the same time, A Real Live One, was the result. It's actually an insult to the fans to release a low quality recording like this, so don't waste your money on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where is the enhanced part!!!!","review":"I recently bought this and I am curious where the enhanced part of this disk is.

A Real Live One was much better than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Valuable Information","review":"To those who are interested in this kind of material, this book is a real find! While the subject matter might not interest a lot of people, those who are devotees of ancient wisdom material will see this as insightful and gifted.

I don't get the \\"faster is better\\" mentality and feel that most HC bands simply lacked musical skill and, more often, originality (remember those bands on Mystic Records?). I suppose it has to do with the manner in which you define hardcore.MIA, for example, are generally classified as a HC band, and the description actually does fit. They could play as fast and hard as anyone, but they also were skilled songwriters and musicians who were smart enough to include powerful, melodic midtempo numbers in their sets to keep things interesting. In other words, these guys had taste.This collection will not dissapoint any fan of REAL punk rock.

So far, I have found the recipes to be uninspired, just simply boring. This may be a useful tool for those truly unfamiliar with vegetable-based cooking - who need a lot of help with cooking basics, but if you are already able to put together a vegan meal of any type, this book isn't for you.Her recurring ingredients include Sucanat, Ener-G egg replacer, and red wine/cooking sherry. None of these are in my pantry, and I am a vegan who loves to cook. Also, there are a LOT of potato recipes, in fact, there are a couple for which the ingredient list is nothing more than potatoes and garlic powder, or \\"any favorite seasoning\\". Your money would be better spent elsewhere, like on \\"A Celebration of Wellness\\" by James Levin, MD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent recipes","review":"This book has great recipes! Most of them are totally unique- everything we've tried has been really good. We also liked the fact that so much information was packed into one book.

Any real 2pac fans know that these constant unreleased albums that keep coming out every year are just crap because it's just recycled songs. It's not the real 2pac. Be real with yourself. Stop disrespecting the poor dead man and stop destroying his music.

Half of these reviewers don't know about Pac or the orgin of these songs. So let me tell you. Half of these song's are from older Pac albums and the rest were bad enough that they never made it past the tape reel. When you make as much music as he did it's not going to all be platinum material.

But it was a soundtrack & it is Pac."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too Eminemish","review":"This album is great, the delivery was excellent, NO DUH, it's 2Pac's verses. The production was okay, the quality is definitely one of the best, but the beats are not really matching with 2Pac's voice or flow. It's EMINEM's production in case you are wondering, it is not bad, it sounds like 8 Mile road or Loose yourself with a Westside Thug Life hardcore rapper flow on it. It just doesn't match...maybe i am just too used to 2Pac's old style with Death Row."},{"rating":"2","title":"how does he do it","review":"For real, how the heck does 2Pac stay better than everyone even beyond the grave. I know it's old news, but his cd's seem to stay on the level of the ones he put out when he was still alive. The new one is one of the best post-mortum joints he released so far. They put some of the hot tracks from old lp's, they weren't released as singles, but they are hot nonetheless. Death Around the Corner and Secretz of War are the best previously released tracks. Then there's the new stuff, which hits hard too. The single with BIG is hard, but I'm still real upset that they put two of the most notorious enemies on the same track together. That is sooooooooooo cake I can't even find no better words. Big up to Eminem for his beats though, he seems to put the same slow tempo and orchestra theme in every beat, but it don't fit nowhere better than with 2Pac. The last track with 50 Cent was alright too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tupac Delivers Flawlessly Again","review":"Tupac was a genius - a poet - a lyrical wonder. His vision has contributed so much to young America and given hope to so many people. This album chronicles his excellence in many fashions. By tapping into some of his more brilliant, yet slept on old tracks, while incorporating some new vibes with Eminem's production, the Outlawz, B.I.G and 50 Cent, this album is a must for any tru Pac fan. I know Pac's message always speaks relevance in my life, and everything from the production, the lightly sprinkled cameo appearances and Pac's classic flow, this album will be in heavy rotation for a great length of time...\\"Until the End of Time\\", as Tupac would say."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST for the Lover of Gospel","review":"Saw the original cast on Broadway and we were standing on our chairs in 5 minutes and never sat down.

I saw it again, when it started to tour, in the 80's - it was good, but the shock of the juxtaposition was gone. So now I'm happy to have the CD, which I really can't rate objectively, because, for me, it is not about the CD but about the memory.There are only a few things that I've seen over the decades that had the same impact as this: Koyyanisquatsi, when it first came to the screen, and now Slumdog Millionaire. There might be a few more, but none that come to mind right now.So... if you don't know this CD and the notion of Oedipus Rex and gospel interests you, buy this CD.

I love most of his work, but this is a very inferior example. I've been told that Keith Laumer had a stroke, and that this was written afterward. I can't verify that, but it sounds right. His sense of humor is all but gone, along with most if his timing, which is what usually drives his stories. This is an easy read, somewhat amusing, but I can't really recommend it. If you want Laumer at his best, try Dinosaur Beach."},{"rating":"1","title":"Important Information is lacking","review":"I shopped by price and picked to lowest one I saw online. It was a new vendor and there was no rating available. When the perfume arrived I was disappointed to find that it was Rive Gauche for men, not for women. This bit of information was not posted in this vendors entry. They said they would take it back but that I was responsible for return shipping as, according to them, it was not their fault I had ordered the wrong thing. This is particularly interesting in view of the fact that the image shown in the Amazon request for a review are of the woman's fragrance option. There was no product image for this particular vendor and therefore the shopper has little more to go by than the fragrance name, price and ounce weight. Apparently they do not carry woman's fragrances for Yves Saint Laurent as they did not offer an exchange.

Very nice range when kept in the speakers limits, when pushed the sound gets compressed and harsh--but I am thinking its the speakers and not the amp. The phono section seems to be good, I need a new cartridge to be able to judge accurately. I recently got all new equipment, which makes it hard to compare, but I'm happy with the amp, its much nicer sounding than the 1990 vintage chinese Marantz it replaced. Also got a Sony HD tuner and its a nice pair with this amplifier... very nice sound... I can crank the dance/trance commercial free station I get and feel right there in da club!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A solid integrated amplifier","review":"There are already lots of review of this product over the internet, so I will only focus on what is not being mentioned often.First, this amp requires a fair amount of break-in. Right out of the box, it sounded edgy and unrefined. After a long break-in, it transformed into a very solid amplifier. I always like Onkyo product due to its solid construction and no-frill-but-well-thought-out appearance. This one is no exception.I do have two operation issues with this amp. First, it should have a balance knob, besides the bass and treble knobs. Second, this amp has only a power button and no standby button. So you can only use your remote to wake up the amp from standby. There are these two buttons on all the Onkyo home theater receivers, and Okyo should put a standby button on this amp also!Performance wise, it is a very solid amp, which has been appraised by so many people."},{"rating":"1","title":"A-9555 Amplifier died after 14 months","review":"I purchased this amplifier with the Onkyo CD player DX7555 Audiophile Single Disc CD Player. They made beautiful music together but the A-9555 amplifier just died about 14 months after my purchase. I then discovered how difficult it is too get any service on an Onkyo product. I cannot recommend any Onkyo hifi product based on my experience. My only option is to take it to a third party repair service who will open it up for $70 with no guarantee that it can be repaired and the location is not convenient. The CD player is doing well. I would recommend that one consider post-purchase support or repair availability in buying these very complicated hifi components. There should be a site that rates the long term reliability of these components. I am not alone with the experience of a Onkyo amplifier/AV receiver just dying on them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing balance control knob!","review":"I agree that this is a good amplifier.

Lo and behold, after only 3 days use, it would not power on after being in standby mode. Called Onkyo customer support, they said it was in safe mode, but there is no way you can reset it to get it out of that. So they told me to send it back to amazon, which i did. very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Quality Control - Unit DOA","review":"Apparently Onkyo has limited quality control. The unit arrived DOA (Remote unresponsive, all source selector lights lit up except for the Tuner & MD lights. No other lights would light up).On a side note, for those planning on using the phono pre-amp, it does not work with Moving Coil cartridges.***UPDATED***I packed up the defective unit and sent it back to Amazon. While packing up the defective unit I noticed that something was loose inside. Perhaps the unit was damaged in shipping and it had nothing to do with Onkyo's quality control. I don't know.What I do know is that my replacement unit works and the sound is absolutely stunning. The Pure Audio button is is a very welcome feature as it allows me to hear the sound from my records the way it was intended. For reference I have this hooked up to a Rega P3-24 turntable with a high output moving coil cartridge. That's right, it does work with my high output moving coil cartridge. Your mileage may vary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over rated; poor build quality","review":"I bought this amp because my Onkyo Integra finally died.The Onkyo A-9555 was delivered DOA.

They suggested that as it was delivered DOA, I should return it to the dealer (B&H;); I did. I got polite, rapid replacement from B&H.;For the price ($385) it is is an OK, but not great amp.Not having a balance control can is a big hassle.

Kane, as an anti-hero, seems to lack much that might draw a reader to root for the bad guy. He lacks the sort of dark humor that might make his evil exploits truly entertaining and, while the characters in the book call him a genius, the reader is likely to understand the elements of his plots for conquest far sooner than the characters themselves. In that sense, there's not much here that kept my attention.Based on the ratings, it's apparent that others disagree greatly with my assessment and, should you decide to delve into the world of Kane, I hope that you get greater enjoyment out of it than I."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer beware!","review":"The new Hot Rod: Garage to Glory has a restrictive only 3 computer upgrade license.

I could watch it over and over again. Even though I've seen it a dozen times or more I never tire of watching it. Easily Madonna's best acting performance to date (she's essentially playing herself). All the cast work so well together and are all perfectly matched to their parts.But forget buying the VHS version get the DVD, not only does it have running commentaries from the Director but it also has the original ending for the film on it. In the previews, the audience thought it ended when Madonna's character was sitting in the cinema with her boyfriend, and so they got up and left leaving 10 minutes of the movie to go. So the film makers cut the ending. You'll get to see Madonna in full 80's regalia riding atop a camel! Need I say more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Madonna's Performance Gives Film Much Of Its Spark","review":"This movie was released in 1985 and was a huge box office hit thanks in main part to Madonna's overwhelming popularity at the time as the #1 musical artist of '85. Her performance in the film was probably her best on film, next to Evita and there really can't be a comparison since Evita was mostly singing and hardly any dialogue. Even though Madonna's role as Susan is a supporting role, she steals the spotlight as a kooky, free spirit who gets wrapped in a bad case of mistaken identity with a bored housewife who ends up with amnesia and wrongly believes she's Susan. Rosanna Arquette was really good also as was Aidan Quinn and Laurie Metcalfe who's hilarious as Roberta's sister in law. And for all those that say Madonna was playing herself, you couldn't be more wrong, Madonna was a bright and rising star with something to prove back then so of course her performance was going to be spectacular...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why Did It Do So Well?","review":"I have no idea why people keep saying this was Madonna'a best movie (before Evita) I'm not saying it's a bad movie but I liked Who's That Girl A lot better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeps Getting Better and Better.","review":"I am HUGE Madonna ever since the early 80's even before her union with Sean Penn.

It was boring. Madonna is a co-star and I might have liked it more if I got to see more of her in it but I just don't care for Rosanna Arquette's character in the film. The amnesiac storyline is done so many times... Save your money and rent this is you're just looking for a movie to watch.

As carefree, spirited Susan, Madonna shines in this seemingly tailor made role. Even though Madonna's Susan was technically a supporting role, she steals the whole show and really not with that much effort. Rosanna Arquette and Aidan Quinn are also worth mentioning for their performances. The film was hilarious and really showed Madonna as a force to be reckoned with in the world of Hollywood. Even though she didn't follow up her critically acclaimed performance with a more suitable role (Shanghai Surprise, UGHH) her talent shines through immensely in this keeper."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fun, Romantic, Escapism Movie","review":"I've always loved this movie.

Yes, you can see the pixels at 200 dpi, but you have to look hard. I already have \\"my money back\\" vs. commercial CD duplication.There is no problem with ink adherance to CD blanks designed for thermal printing. With good blanks the spoilage rate is less than 5%, and that's being picky. It even prints cheaper blanks with only slight rub-off problems.The Signature Z1 is nominally a monocolor printer but I have made CDs in which the logo field is red and the other three fields are black. It requires two passes through the printer.My only complaint: the hub-gripper does not always want to release the CD. I found a painless workaround: drop a blank CD over the printed CD to push the pins back, then lift them both off together.

The rest would be missing a letter here or there or there would be a smear or the text would be all over the place.

This was actually the first dispatch album I got, after hearing bang bang, the general and open up, and it was for sure a great way to kick off my love for the music. This album covers a lot of musical genres- from the ska beats of bullet holes to the rocky/rappy sounds of root down. I can't name a song I don't like off this album, and I would highly, HIGHLY recommend it to anyone who enjoys funky/rocky/reggae-y music with great lyrics and an amazing sound, especially for a three piece band.

As I watch plenty of children videos nowadays, I do feel the Baby Einstein series are comparatively boring and repetitive. The whole series just appear cheap and simplistic.Obviously every child is different and Baby Einstein seems to work great for most parents, but I would strongly suggest buying only ONE dvd at a time to see how yours react instead of buying too many in one go like I did.

In addition, the five groups that Wright chose either had their own written language or quickly learned one after European contact (and the Cherokee even had their own newspaper), so this history is genuinely \\"through Indian eyes.\\" The unifying thread (in addition to the resilience of all 5 groups) is that the colonization of the New World by Europeans was not significantly different that of Africa and Asia- without the disease factor, the Americas might today be wholly governed by their original inhabitants."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Unique Historical Perspective (Why Didn't We Know Before?)","review":"This is the unique perspective on the discovery of the New World and its conquest by the Europeans.

The effect of removing this element is that it is Chiltern who saves Goring, not Goring who saves Chiltern, and the play therefore never gives Goring his moment of heroism and nobility. This film is too jolly and innocent. Laura Cheveley's hubris, Robert Chiltern's anguish, these are really side shows in the film which focuses more on Goring, his wit, and his pre-marital uncertainty.I do think the film is entertaining, for what it is worth.

The politian's worst fear is the loss of his wife's respect, which is also the concern of his friend Lord Goring.The movie is very true to Oscar Wilde's play. The wit in the conversations, the beauty of the costumes and decorative art, and the actors' expressions were all commendable.

These have some of the best supporting material that is expertly incorporated into the book as examples, as well as providing stock images and textures to manipulate and experiment with. A drawback to this book is that at times it can be verbose, however, the authors do a very good job of reducing complex processes into simplified ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could not read companion CD","review":"Like the person from Florida and others, my versions companion CD did not work, so I wrote the publisher and they sent me another one that also didn't work. This is very frustrating when you hear how wonderful the book is from others. you absolutely cannot do anything without the companion CD and that's where this book fails, it's cmpletely useless without it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy it and you won't be disappointed","review":"Having purchased this tome as a result of a newsgroup recommendation, and via Amazon, it comes wholeheartedly recommended for intermediate and advanced Photoshop users.

The CD-ROM simply does not work under any conditions. The autorun causes error messages: \\"Could not execute external program: SETUP.EXE\\", so does almost everything else I try - - Even exploring the CD-ROM and clicking on help or sample files."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe good for some people, I found it boring and unhelpful","review":"This book definitely does not have a \\"cool\\" factor, ei it does not show you how to do cool tricks. It may be helpful in some areas of photoshop, but I had already learned much of its contents on my own. It seemed to cover all the stuff I didn't care about, and nothing that interested me. I wish I hadn't wasted my money. I am never buying a book without looking through it beforehand at a store again!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible","review":"I purchased a copy of Photoshop 4 WOW (limited edition hard cover) because of a recomendation. I was shocked and angry that I had just spent $50.00 on a book that contained worthless incorrect information.

This is not for any serious home shop or for long term use."},{"rating":"1","title":"wear out too soon","review":"These spikes wear out too fast. After only two rounds the yellow portions are worn to stubs.

I am very disappointed with these as 1 of them broke after my first round and three more broke after my second round. The yellow spikes are tearing at the bottom of the shoe, 3 on my back foot and 1 on my front. I do have a fast swing, but I could not believe how easily these broke."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book","review":"I like all the lists. It comes in handy when you need to know something. You know what you have to do in that situation. Will use this alot."},{"rating":"1","title":"I RETURNED this book","review":"This book is terrible. The lists are disappointingly incomplete and inconsequential. For example:A list on tipping includes tips for restroom attendants, but it omits tips for valet parking. In my life, I have used valet parking significantly more often than a restroom attendant.A list of common foreign phrases omits pronunciations. How useful is that? Knowing the spelling of a phrase does one no good during conversation should the pronunciation of a phrase be very different from its spelling.Basically, if one had been raised by kindly wolves in the forest, and recently dropped into modern society, this book might be marginally useful. But anyone with a modicum of planning or forethought would have outgrown this trite little waste of words and paper by age 10."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Idea, Lousy Execution","review":"This is a very disappointing execution of a basically good idea. I bought the book thinking that it would provide clever ideas and strategies for accomplishing tasks that I otherwise would not think of. Unfortunately, there isn't a single list in this book that could be remotely called clever,or original, and some of them are downright bad (see especially \\"From Pigsty to Presentable in Six Steps.\\" Oy!). Unless you've been living in a hermetically sealed bubble your entire life, this book won't do you a bit of good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmmmmmm---I should have bought a mop","review":"I was so disappointed in this book. It would probably help someone in their teens, as most of this information should be known to the average person. We know that raisins can be used in a salad, that washcloths should match a bath towel, and to put the toilet brush behind the toilet or better yet, out of the way. I know to put on rubber gloves before I put my hand in the toilet bowl. This is all common sense that my family taught me when I was a small child."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yes, this is for a late teen.","review":"This is one of the internet pit-falls.

I can now throw away all those articles I have clipped that I might need some day. This book is a great reference tool. It is well written and delightful to read. I love Lagatree's writing style (check out her other books). She writes in a plain, easy to understand, yet very entertaining way. Even if you purchase her book for a particular section you will find your self referring to it again and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Please read \\"Only the stars!\\"","review":"I only wish this book was in hard cover! \\"Only The Stars\\" is a imaginative, whimsical, and elegant story that illustrates the creative world of a granddaughter and her grandmother!

And I, too, love it because it's girly w/o being pink. Red is my favorite color & I'm burnt out on pink (& my daughter's only 11 mos. old). I'm not sure what the previous reviewer was expecting her $200 bedding to be, but I have none of the problems that she did. I didn't think the fabric was cheap, but apparently she's used to a much \\"higher quality\\" of life than I am. I guess she should've spent $1000 on bedding to satisfy her need for fine fabrics. I've washed my sheet WAY more than 4 times & there are still no holes in it.Anyway...I LOVE this bedding set & think it's adorable! Not everyone can afford $1000 bedding & we will settle for the cutest cheaper stuff we can find. Well, this is it! It's not \\"Wal-Mart quality\\", but it doesn't cost a fortune either. It's wonderful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Knowing how God has designed you","review":"This relatively short book helps the reader understand how God has uniquely designed each person, with special gifts and talents unlike anybody else. It then guides the reader through a process of self-evaluation in order to reveal those special qualities that determine how we operate, and what we like to do on a daily basis. Armed with this information about himself, the reader is then prepared to look for job opportunities that will match his specific skill set, and result in employment that will have a good probability of being man satisfying, and God glorifying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Squall scores","review":"Bridges is a captain of a ship and he is on the highseas with his shipmates. other actors include Caroline Goodall, John Savage, Scott Wolf, Ryan Phillippe, Jason Marsden and Jeremy Sisto. an exceptional cast makes this one special and Bridges cares for his mates. a powerful movie"},{"rating":"1","title":"Common sense would of come in handy","review":"This movie was really stupid. A bunch of hormonal teenage guys trown together on a boat does not appeal to me. The movie was a typical movie showing just how useless guys really are. They showed girls as nothing more than dumb airheads and sex toys. This movie did nothing for me at all. It had a bad boy who wasn't really as bad as every one thought. A wimp who wasn't as whimpy as every one thought. A boss who wasn't as bossy as every one thought. Did this movie have anything as it was meant to? How dumb can you get?"},{"rating":"1","title":"1 of the most stupid films ever","review":"First of all, the characters all look alike and the names aint mentioned often so u dunno which guy is which.

It doesn't go all the way to the edge without stretching it and no matter how I fiddle with the aspect ratio on the television, it just doesn't work right. No other widescreen film on dvd have I had this sort of problem with, it's just a bit TOO letterboxed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Movie!","review":"Two things really struck me about this film: the sea action was beautifully filmed, and the development of the characters was well done. This, more than any other movie I've seen, shows what being on a windjammer in the open sea must be like. There's lots of action footage of actual heavy seas as well as excellent special effects. The changes the kids, who truly become young men, go through are very well done. Knowing that this is a true story makes it particularly compelling."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW","review":"THE most underrated movie I have ever seen. My all-time favorite.Great acting, amazing scenary. Ridley Scott is a truly amazing director. Genius."},{"rating":"2","title":"I don't know why this isn't a classic","review":"Maybe \\"classic\\" is a little bit much, but this movie is probably the most underrated movie I have ever seen. I don't remember much about it in the theater and don't know many people that have watched it. It is one of the top \\"coming of age\\" movies made in the past decade or so.If you liked Dead Poet's Society (DPS is better because of Robin Williams) or A Separate Peace by John Knowles, you will like this movie. It is a movie that leads you on a journey, using a group of rich kids that signed up for a year at sea. Jeff Bridges is the tough captain that sets out to instill discipline and teach them that they must respect him, the ship, and, most importantly, each other.I won't give away the ending, but the movie succeeds in delivering its messages of honor and individual responsibility. It does a fantastic job of delivering this message while leading you along a journey with Jeff Bridges and the crew of the ship."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why does no one talk about this movie!?","review":"I don't get it! How can there be so many Ridley Scott movies that go unnoticed? Other mainstream directors like James Cameron and Steven Spielberg have basically recognition for every movie they've made, but with movies like White Squall, there is a forgotten element to what Ridley Scott has done with his career. White Squall is a gem of a movie that has gone unnoticed for too long. Jeff Bridges is excellent as are the rest of the actors. This is a story that will pull you in and is addictive. It's like a book you can't put down. The style of the movie is a little removed from Scott's more modern works, but it's definately him behind the camera. Enjoy this movie, no matter who you are."},{"rating":"2","title":"A real statement of the character of men","review":"I bought this move years ago. And it has been a favorite of mine ever since. I have a passion for character development, especially in an age where character is so rare, like today. A story of innocence lost and manhood achieved. A story of lost life and of the birth of new life (euphemistically). A true story. And one that deserves to be told. And one that is as thrilling as it is entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid","review":"Here is a film that would not receive much attention in the theaters, but it has some depth. Good story, great acting by even the youngest actors. Jeff Bridges is not the only star, with great support from lovable characters. Less action than the cover would suggest, but plenty to get you invested."},{"rating":"2","title":"a wonderful film","review":"The first time I saw this movie was in bits and pieces in the video store in which I worked. I bought it and was not prepared for the greatness of the acting, the magnificent cinemetograhpy, and the story of a group of boys' coming of age. I cry at the end every time I watch it, it's that emotional. I loved Jeff Bridges as the Skipper. His was a strong performance. Scott Wolf too was excellent. For anyone who wants to see a movie that hits into the center of the heart, watch this one. Its poingnancy is tangible. Thank you Mr. Scott for this amazing, comical, tragic, wonderful film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie.","review":"Excellent movie. Explains a lot about human nature.

Someone purchased this cd for us because of the song \\"you know\\". I still like that song--and that's about the only one worth listening to. This band sends no good message, it's extrememly redundant, and I truly can't stand how the singer says \\"yeah\\" about a thousand times per song. About the lyrics: I don't understand them, and they are very pathetic. All the songs sound the same except for YOU KNOW AND OVERSHAKEN. They really only have one singer--and he's ok, but not that great. I don't know how they could call themselves a rock band. The rock isn't rock--it's...I don't really know.

Fifteen minutes later, the first strong breeze of the day caused the plastic sleeve holding the umbrella to kink and fail - permanently compromised.We returned it to the hardware store we bought it from and paid an additional $14 for a more substantial (and more attractive) metal decorative stand, which has held up to all kinds of wind since then.I do suspect that this could be used with a table above it, so that the base isn't responsible to handle all of the wind's load, but that wasn't what we were hoping for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Umbrella, Umbrella, Please Stand Up!","review":"I have not been able to get my umbrella to stand up in this base.

This Bethlehem album goes into the latter group; in fact, only the somewhat dull tune \\"Late spring\\" keeps it from being perhaps the best album of the year for Blakey.

It lives up to the second book, but both fall a little short of the creativity and humor of the first. Still, fans will want to know how the series ends and won't be disappointed with the story presented here. As with the others, the storyline and vocabulary are perfect for the beginning reader or as a read aloud story.This series is a great way to introduce kids to the joys of reading.

It sounds so far fetched, yet if you listen to the arguments of researchers and writers such as Wilson, it's hard to stay sceptical. Now I would read anything that Colin Wilson writes, and this book is fine. But since I read it after \\"Fingerprints...\\" most of the surprise was gone... as this Wilson-book owes quite a bit to (amongst others) Graham Hancocks work.

By collating and presenting ideas of authors and scholars in a coherent and linear fashion this book is entirely readable and understandable to all. (Especially those of us left brainers).However, his own ideas are as fresh and original as ever. Fantastic and insightful! This book sheds light on Humankind's history and possible future by synthesizing information on cultural roots, folklore, religion, hard science and their sociological affects. He gives credit where credit is due (i.e. Santillana, Hapgood, Hancock, Bauval, Flem-ath, West, etc) and has successfully written a book that can be called the Next Generation of it's kind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Little Guide","review":"I bought this book last week and it's about my 10th guide to wildflowers. It's a really spendid guide in three respects at least. First the photographs are wonderful. Ms. Carter is a first-class photographer. Second, the guide fits in your pocket, something no other guides do. Third, it doesn't bog you down in lots of details that are not important in the field. Once you have identified a plant, you can enter the name, or Latin name into a Web search engine such as Google and find out more than any guide could possible cover anyway. It has lots of little embellishments that show the author is also a good publisher (this isn't from an international conglomerate, but from her own publishing company). Flowers are organized by color, and flower size is emphasized so you don't think that 2-inch color blossom in the book is different from the 1/4-inch flower in the field. It's a great little guide and is useful throughout the NorthEast because we share the same wildflowers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite good for a bootleg...","review":"Underproduced austere bootleg live recording with crystal clear sound which, with most bootlegs, is something exceptional and really hard to find.Superb song selection and performance, sounding sometimes even better than their own studio albums...

This book does an amazing job of sorting it all out, and I am greatly indebted to Dr. Havens for doing so. Yes, the text is mostly quotes from Erickson's writings. The brilliance is in how they are categorized, and in Dr. Havens' accompanying interpretations. This book has instantly become one of the most valued in my collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT!!!!","review":"BOUGHT THIS FOR MY 25 Y.O. DAUGHTER FOR CHRISTMAS. SHE LOVES IT.

I didn't like it. Now, ten years later, I bought an ipod. I was going through all of the boxes of CDs that I have bought over the years, putting songs on my new toy. I decided to give Repeater another listen before I sold it to a used CD store, and suprise, I love the album now. It is really weird how your tastes in music change over the years. That was about 2 months ago and it is still all I listen to. I think I am going to pick up 13 Songs tommorow, because if I remember correctly, that was the album that all the hip kids had. At the age of 30, maybe I'm finally a hip kid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fugazi's @ the height of their abilties","review":"They are some self-righteous guys.

The first three or four songs were such a bore I turned it off and never listened to it again.

This definately is not it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I think this one is the best of the whole slew of them","review":"just bought it yesterday after not listening to it for ten years. i can see why someone who is sixteen doesn't like it. I didn't like it as a kid either--too abstract and not punk enough. However, this album is really terrific. It's thoughtful and presents lucid commentary on the darkside of commercialism (something that is becoming ever more apparent). I cannot believe people think the album's music sounds average--this is their best album in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"There's no place like home (so where am I?)","review":"In 1986, while bemaoning the death of Minor threat, hearing that Bad Brains had broken up (rumor had it that HR had died) and learning to like Metallica, my friend from DC came up with an incredible tape of demos from Ian's new band, Fugazi. The tape became a local classic, dubbed and copied untill it was hardly audible. We had the stupendous Fugazi shake the floorboards of our house twice in '87 and '88. One of my favorite live bands of all time, for sure, their studio albums always pale in comparison. I'm glad to read reviews from all the people who love \\"13 Songs,\\" but all I can say to them is \\"damn, you should've heard that demo tape...\\" Well, this album sounds as close to the raw fury of that demo as you're going to find on Amazon.com, so you might as well buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amongst the 'Post-Hardcore' scene's most important albums","review":"Another of those deeply influential bands & Albums, that was embraced by anyone that listened to it, with lyrics that although angry & confrontational, aren't yelled at the listener lines such as \\"When I need something, I reach out and grab it!!,\\" and \\"You are not what you own!!,\\" enforce the points effectively, but most people also forget that this also one of the great guitar records of the 90's.....wait around 2 minutes into \\"Merchandise\\" for an anthemic guitar explosions that easily impresses, with its skilful rhythmic interjection are instantly memorable,and the rousing \\"Sieve-Fisted Find\\" show that Fugazi can mix serious lyrical content with aggressive rhythmic sections and still sound completely Relevant.

David Spade has a sort of bitter sarcastic personality about him that I have enjoyed watching over the years. However, ever since Chris Farrley died, Spade has failed to make it on his own. This movie proves my point. The movie as a whole just falls flat. I laughed zero times throughout its duration, and the storyline is lame and unrealistic (go relive your childhood so you are a real person? reminds me of Billy Madison, but at least there were those things called \\"jokes\\" in that movie). I feel kinda bad for David Spade, as he used to keep me laughing whenever I saw him. But remember \\"Lost and Found?\\" I know, you were probably trying to forget that godawful movie, but this one is way worse, I guarentee it! He just can't act anymore; nothing better sums up my impression of the movie than \\"boring\\". Just awful from start to finish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Funny, completely pointless","review":"When I saw the previews for this movie, I thought it looked alright. It was definately the worst David Spade movie I've ever seen and the jokes weren't at all funny. It was about a former child star who really wants to get his career back on track by starring in an upcoming Rob Reiner film. In order to get his acting motivation back, Spade's character, Dicky, decides to live with a random family and re-live his childhood. This is really a kids movie with corny humor that only someone under the age of 12 could appreciate. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"IF YOU'RE A SPADE FAN DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE","review":"I like David Spade and I thought JOE DIRT was his best movie. This one is terrible. I don't think I laughed once. Spade plays a washed up actor who decides to pay a family to give him the childhood he never head, so he will have the experience to play a roll in a Rob Reiner film. Spade cracks lame jokes throughout and ends up with the family's mother. (The father was a creep and Spade behaved himself throughout, so no need to shelter the kiddies.)The only good thing about this film was the appearance of former child stars like Leif Garrett, Danny Boniducci, and Barry Williams. If they had had larger parts the movie might have been funnier. At the end during the credits a large group of child stars assemble to sing a \\"We Are the World\\" type song. The only reason I gave this POS a star.Don't waste your time. See JOE DIRT instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"No","review":"This movie was the dumbest \\"comedy\\" i have not fully watched.

This move was beyond REALLY GOOD. I couldnt stop laughing once. It was so funny, me and my best friend were just laughing the whole time. Now I am just anticipating the release of this hilarious comedy. If you like comedies, you'll love this movie. There are some scenes that might not be appropriate for younger kids, since the rating is PG-13, so I wouldnt recommend letting younger children watch this movie. Teenagers and adults will probably enjoy this movie the most. Its jokes and great acting makes this movie one of my favorites of all time. I doubt I could get tired of the hilarity of this movie. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a riot!","review":"I thought that this movie is an excellent family movie with only slight traces of adult humor.

A true future classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"It's a sign from hell!\\"","review":"This movie is far from perfect, but it is also downright hilarious. It does start off a little slow and at times plays for the sympathetic, but when it's funny it's really really funny. I've always been a fan of Spade because he was that type of dry sarcastic humor that makes him unforgettable (kinda like Andy Dick) so when he's smarting off the the fat lady that lives across the street or messing with his ex-girlfriend he's at the top of his game. The funniest scene in this film has to be when they think their dog has killed their neighbors bunny. The whole scene is just hilarious and will have you laughing days to come...yeah that and the part when he's talking about the hot mom with her kids and he asks the son Sam \\"just pretend she isn't your mother\\"...I was on the floor...This is a great fun flick to watch and enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better Than I Expected","review":"I am not a David Spade fan, but my sons recommended that I watch this movie, because it was very funny and entertaining.Well, needless to say it was funny as hell and it had very good messages thrown in, in regard to family, which is was what Dickie Roberts was missing out on.

First because in too many places, I found the writing to be awkward and somewhat amateurish.

Taylor Morgan, the protaganist of the book, blunders through her investigation, and solves the mystery herself only because the investigating officers, both State Troopers and NTSB investigators, are depicted as boorish, thick-headed sexists incapable of recognizing a smoking gun when it's pointed at them."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of money","review":"We bought this and we gave it away.

I do not own the release, but own all of the original material and the material is good. However, I disagree that Fugazi fans will enjoy it. If I were to drop most of the material from the release into a bucket, I would compare it to Rites of Spring and Embrace. The first album doesn't compare to anyone *IMO* but the later releases were just different, more similar to feel as Embrace (but not as good).Excellent taste of what was happening in DC in that time.

The problem with it is that this author is L-A-Z-Y. She used the word \\"Stunning\\" or some form of the word over and over (and over and over...you get the idea.) The two main characters were \\"Stunned\\" so many times I began to think they must be using tasers on each other. Overuse of a word or phrase causes it to lose its effectiveness, and becomes distracting to the reader.

Full of history, romance, and the mystical legend of Merlin made for a page turning romance.The story between Vivian the daughter of Fire and Rorke FitzWarren knight to William Duke of Normandy is touching and has managed to become one of my favorite stories! Vivian is the daughter of Merlin and she finds herself in the middle between the Norman's and the defeated Saxon's. Rorke is sent to find the healer with amazing powers and brings Vivian back to the battlefield to take care of William. Rorke finds more then just a healer of the physical self but a healer of the heart and soul. This story takes place right after the battle of Hastings and is full of historical detail but not so much that you feel that it is a history lesson. The story is touching and I found myself laughing and crying which in my opinion is always a sign of a GREAT book! I look forward to the rest of this series to make it to my mail box!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Merlin's Legacy is First Rate!","review":"I bought Daughter of Fire and read it in 1 day. What a great book. Quinn Taylor Evans uses her descriptive powers to the max to make you feel as if you are there. The clothes, the weapons, even the animals are described perfectly. The battle scenes come to life, and you feel as if you know each character intimately. Great writing, great story, great series. I ordered the other 5 the next day and read them just as quickly.

I am deaf in one ear and am a deep sleeper. Until now, I haven't been able to find a clock that would awaken me reliably. I have to take medicine during the night, so I need a clock that will wake me up consistently. I use all three modalities together--alarm, light flasher, and bed shaker. I think the shaker has the most effect on me. It's not unpleasant, but it does get my attention. If I were to change anything about the clock, I would add the ability to set two separate alarms because sometimes I need to get up more than once before night's end. It would also be nice if one could make the numbers go in reverse when selecting an earlier hour for the alarm. However the clock and alarm are not difficult to set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"If i could give this alarm 0 stars I would. It is terrible.

If you accidentally hit the snooze button twice, the thing shuts off. Countless mornings I'd wake up and not hear my alarm sounding wondering how it turned off. I originally bought this because after 2 1/2 years my sonic boom vibrator failed me and I received no support cause I was out of warranty. I was upset with the company.

Recommended for beginners."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ok Book","review":"This is an ok book to learn of psychic works. But it lacks much dangers and ups/downs of psychic developments, as many psychic works books do. She tries to make the book fun to read and learn, and teach as best as she could. Which she lists some low level tools and fun games. It just she was not fully intune with her psychic nature to know more how and why, and follow the mind to teach the way it should be taught. Other then taht, it is a good book for a starter.For those who want to be psychic, caution! I was born as clairsentient, and had many years of expereince with the unknwown and unseen, and being psychic has its ups and downs. It is no fun and games, it is a spiritual life. If you want to practice to be at your true psychic state, be aware there are things you can not control, evil beings that you may have to fight, and that true psychics serve all sentient beings, healers and holy ones for all on earth and off.

His delivery has changed and seems very stylised whereas on Strategic it just seemed like Mitch was being himself on-stage all the time. This is considerably shorter than his first album and the quality of the material isn't great either. I really wanted to laugh but I only laughed at a couple of jokes and smiled through the rest. I was double-over listing to Strategic. The audience interaction was great on that and it didn't seem like Mitch was taking it too seriously. This album comes across as a \\"show\\", rather than Mitch just fooling around with some people present. He was a great talent and I would have loved more from Mitch but he has left a legacy of a truly great comedy album and this so-so follow up. Whenever I need an instant laugh I just stick on Strategic Grill Locations.

It seems like he had about 30 cups of coffee and is trying to rush the laughs instead of just letting them happen. I saw him at the Hard Rock Live in Orlando and he just rushed the jokes there as well. I'm still not giving up on him though, however, he's got to change soon or I'm out. Along with many others! I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND HIS FIRST CD, which you can get on www.mitchhedberg.net. It is one of the funniest stand-ups I've ever heard.

I don't know of a single stand up comedian as original, as sharp, and as smart as Mitch Hedberg. His jokes are quick, brilliant, and hysterical.

Now seeing it again in 2003 I can begin to appreciate it. I say that, because it's difficult to interpret David Lynch films. I think the best approach is to just take it in, don't try to think too much about it, and then think more about it later. Blue Velvet isn't as complex as Mullholland Drive, but it still requires some thought. Awesome performances from Dennis Hopper and Isabella Rosellini.DVD SUMMARY:This is where we have hit the jackpot! Fantastic transfer to DVD. Some great extras too, but also a sad revelation that Lynch originally shot 4 hours of film but was requested to trim it down to a 2 hour film. Apparently the other 2 hours are now lost. Let's hope they find it one day. The DVD provides a montage of some of this 'lost' footage. In a nutshell, the montage is pure gold for fans of this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great film, wretched DVD.","review":"I'll keep this short: although this is one of my favorite movies, the DVD is absolutely wretched.

At the start of this pointless film, it seems interesting and full of suspence, but it soon becomes overly melodramatic and the plot becomes boring. If you like dry, poorly made movies that have no qualities of redemption, this is the movie for you. If you have any amount of self respect, stay far away from this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weird film","review":"Blue Velvet has got to be one of the strangest films I have ever seen. It started off o.k. but when we first see frank booth it just gets weirder and weirder. The film also suffers from bad script. The acting in the film is very poor expect Dennis Hopper.There are so many films like this and I can't understand why people think this one is so special. I was really looking forward to watching this when I bought the DVD but after watching it I felt cheated into buying a poor film.Overall bad film, bad acting and bad script. People who appeciate those three should steer clear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unseemly, Nasty and Rank","review":"If your taste runs towards the morose, then David Lynch's \\"Blue Velvet\\" is for you. Unfortunately, there is little in this widely acclaimed film that makes it watchable or enjoyable. It's a depressing exercise in non-humanity, and is better left on the shelf. The director shocks us into thinking his characters have a real raison d'etre, when in fact there is little to explain why they behave the way they do. A waste of talent, time and critical support."},{"rating":"2","title":"What was he going to do with an open window on the 7th floor?","review":"Although the movie is showing its age, and is not so thrilling as it was when it first came out, it is not bad if you like something meaningless and out of ordinary for your viewing pleasure.What I don't understand is, when Jeffery went to the woman's apartment to get her window open, what was he planning to do with an open window on the 7th floor?"},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked it a lot.","review":"Another cool one from David Lynch.For me, sometimes it's difficult to get into a movie directed by David Lynch.

I can only hope that the US encoders do not use the same ratty old VHS to master from that the UK people obviously used. This is complete shame as this is one of Hoppers' great manic moments, the tension present in the film is ever present and awesome. 5 stars for the film, none for the UK encoding"},{"rating":"1","title":"don't like it","review":"The movie came on time, but it has to be the worst movie in history!

Dennis Hopper is weird as hell. Kyle MacLachlan is weird as hell. Isabella Rosellini is beautiful... and weird as hell. Severed ear... ants...Frank Booth... \\"what's your name neighbor?\\" If you like weird movies and want to count how many times Dennis Hopper says the F word then this movie is for you. Lynch is a very, very strange man. Dennis Hoppers as the gas sniffing, mommy fetishist with a thing for blue velvet (the song and the cloth) is very menacing. One \\"F'd\\" up movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best films of all time","review":"David lynch's Blue velvet is a cinematic masterpiece the photography by Frederick Elmes is simply amazing. The DVD is not bad either good sound and picture and thats all you need for this film. I am very surprized this film didn't get a NC-17 rating it should of but thats the Mpaa. for ya. I recommend this film to everyone who likes disturbing films. Warning: This film contains strong sex scens,rape scens,and strong violence and language."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie in need of more features!","review":"This is a great movie! I recommend it to anyone not afraid of seeing something different. However, I must plead with the filmmakers to release another DVD with more features. Commentary, interviews, deleted scenes, anything! This is one of those movies that lives on in the imagination long after you see it, and I am dying to here a real commentary by David Lynch about what it means to him."},{"rating":"2","title":"She wears...","review":"..Blue Velvet..and so goes the title song. Bkue Velvet is a kind of movie that, when it's watched on a surface is nothing more then a simplistic detective thriller. But it is so much more, if you view this film with an open mind and a keen eye you will be blown away by it's meriad of subliminal metaphors and cryptic symbolism. A movie that will leave you feeling a bit uneasy, yet satisfied, you will feel somethin after you see Blue Velvet. David Lynch has a way about his films that draws you in and never lets go, you are no longer sitting comfotably in your living room chair, but instead you are thrust in to take on Denis Hopper's pure wrath and evil and to weep for Donny..Blue Velvet will move you, wether you want it to, or not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Necessary Lynch","review":"This is quintessential Lynch. The characters are spellbinding. The story is captivating. It lacks the circular motif that appears so strongly in later works. The film is unmistakably Lynch, but is likely to be appreciated by non-Lynch fans as well.Kyle MacLachlan is his usual self. I find him to be consistently and dependably good.Anthony Hopkins delivers what I consider to be his most memorable performance. His character achieves proportions that have been burned an impression in my mind that only deepens as I get older.This is a keeper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time","review":"I was really looking forward to seeing this one. I had heard nothing but great things about it, especially Dennis Hopper's disturbing portrayal. Now my only question is, why did Hopper agree to be associated with this trash? The film makes a bold-but unsuccessful-attempt at delving just under the surface of small-town America. The result is a convoluted, over-acted, downright laughable piece of grade-A garbage. The only reason I gave it one star is that there was no choice for ZERO. A whodunit? How about a whocareswhodunit? Don't waste your time with this. There are more exciting and/or fulfilling things to do in life, like licking stamps or folding socks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Lynch disaster","review":"David Lynch has definetely not let us down with this one. He almost made it as boring as Mulholland drive. The only thing that makes this movie good is Denis Hopper, and his ability to act so evil. Everything else in this movie is boring, dragged along, and out of place. It's a good story, but you have to make it exciting. Plain and simple, this movie is boring, and is badly directed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get Mullholand Dr. instead","review":"I like Lynch. Dune-good. Wild At Heart-good. Twin Peaks-good. Mullholland Dr.-great. Blue Velvet-BAD. Now most Lynch fans would hate me. They would say i dont know what i'm talking about. Well i dont know why but i almost couldnt finish this film. It was just awful. It was werid and some parts were interesting but in the whole there are other lynch films i would rather watch. I think Mullholland Dr. is his best picture. It requries many viewings in order to figure it out so i would suggest gettin that instead. I do think that this movie is definatley worth a watch. I just think it was one of lynch's poorer films."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrifying Rubbish","review":"This film is a terrible waste of celluloid. The cinematography is extremely overrated and utterly pretentious. It splatters colour and various \\"unique\\" images in an effort as to appear creative. Subpar performances all around, except for Dennis Hopper who had some moments. Isabella Rosellini was laughable as a depraved femme fatale, totally laughable. It was a film that relied on its \\"weirdness\\" as the selling point, and as the vehicle on which to convince the viewer that this piece of garbage is somehow a good film. The so-called weirdness grew tired and banal, because it was obnoxiously prententious and self-indulgent. Highest Recommendation to avoid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dennis Hopper swears a lot.","review":"David Lynch is a very unconventional storyteller and filmmaker. There is nothing wrong with that, but one must at least make sense of the story. In 'Blue Velvet', Lynch explores the sexual underworld of a clean-cut suburban town. A young man finds some suspicious things happening in an apartment complex. What he finds out is quite distrubing; Dennis Hopper has a fetish for blue velvet and performes some bizzare sex acts. It was interesting, but the story is ruined by Hopper using the f-word for every other word. The young man falls in love with the victim of Hopper's sex acts. Other than that the story is not very interesting. The characters are more like robots and once again there are scenes that are obviously stolen from Alfred Hitchcock, specifically 'Vertigo'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blue Velvet","review":"Words really can't describe this movie. Was relatively bored throughout and thought the acting lacked incredibly. At the end I felt like it was just one big waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad bad movie","review":"One of the worst movies I ever saw. Dennis Hopper must have been on drugs to have acted in this movie. It was crap from beginning to end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time.","review":"After seeing Mulholland Drive, I figured Blue Velvet and Lost Highway might be interesting as well. Boy was I wrong. Those two movies were horrible wastes of time and money. The acting was extremely poor, and the Angelo Badalamenti music is not only terrible, but plays at all the wrong times. David Lynch doesn't have a clue.Buy something else if you want a good movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perhaps the worst movie I have ever seen!","review":"I looked hard but could not find one redeeming quality. I removed to from the DVD player and took it directly to the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unadvisable","review":"I thought I was going to see something of Roy Orbinson. It was only in the title of the name. I could not watch it when it became vulgar with offensive material. It is too bad to have a good story with great actors lowering its potentially good quality with such degrading vulgarity. There are better ways of getting this aspect of the story across with such depiction. Silly me, I should have checked the rating. I \\"assumed\\" it safe as it would involve our beloved Roy Orbinson. I was sadly and horridly disappointed and cannot in conscience recommend it to anyone at anytime. By the way,I destroyed the tape in good conscience. Watch at your own eternal risk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sexy, Scary, and Provocative","review":"This is the movie that got me hooked on David Lynch's movies. Its a film about the seedier side of suburban life that lives just below the surface of what and who we see every day, however, being a Lynch movie it takes this synopsis to new and freaky heights. The movie begins with Maclachlan finding a severed ear. Eventually leading him to the apartment of Rossellini, where he witnesses a bizarre sexual triste between Rossellini and Hopper. I'm not going to say any more about the plot, but trust me it gets better. Anyway, I thought Hopper was at his coolest as a sexual psychotic, really mean and paranoid. I highly recommend this Lynchian masterpiece, which is one of his finest works, (plus the storyline is easy to follow, unlike some of his movies)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great movie but surprisingly poor transfer","review":"I won't say anything more on the movie. it's a \\"love it or hate it\\" kind of movie. But I have to point out the very poor transfer. It's full of digital artifacts and my dvd player confirms this by showing a transfer rate that is an average of 4-4.5 and drops very often under 2.5. this is really poor and unacceptable from a \\"Special edition\\" version. I guess they had to use such a high compression to fit all the extra material. but I'd rather watch a good quality dvd than some dull extras."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lynch excels with small town horror!","review":"\\"Blue Velvet\\" is one of the most intense flicks from our generation. Director David Lynch takes the pathetically naive and innocent and blends it with the completely demented and bizarre to create, in my opinion, the ultimate in modern-day film noir. Check this out: Frank Booth (Hopper) is a demented, drug-dealing, gender-confused kidnapper (with an oedipus complex) that has good connections. He takes Rosselini's husband and son and kidnaps them in exchange for .... favours...His bizarro posse includes Jack Nance (R.I.P.) as Bob, and Dean Stockwell as the ultra-suave Ben. MacLachlan is the curious & naive \\"young adult\\" that becomes curious on what gives when he finds an ear in the grass (sounds strange?). He manages to hook up with the investigating cop's daughter (Laura Dern) and begins a psychological menage a trois balancing good & evil! Lynch peaked with this film. Everyone who has a taste for the strange should own this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the greatest of 80's...if not all time","review":"This is David Lynch and Dennis Hopper's masterpiece performances. You can watch this movie 10 times...and still catch something you missed previously. For the noobs, reading this review...this movie is FILLED TO RIM with symbolism. From the start, to the finish...there is symbolism throughout the movie. If you watch and missed that....watch it again, only more carefully.This movie is a MUST on any movie buff shelf.

The only character that was remotely disturbing was Dennis Hopper, but that was it. \\"The dark underworld of midwestern suburbia\\". Oh yeah? He sure does get into the \\"dark underworld\\". Jeffrey gets driven in a car and punched in the face. Big deal.The previous Lynch movies I saw really made you think. Trying to understand his movie plots in a logical fashion is futile, you have to think abstract. Well, not with this one. This movie just has a cliched murder/mystery plot with...a happy ending? What is this? This is not the Lynch I enjoy.If you want a murder/mystery movie that really makes you think, see Mulholland Dr. That movie is incredible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dennis is the reason I gave it 2, otherwise 1 star","review":"I love hoppers role in this movie, he is evil and twisted enough, but that's about as far as the good goes on this movie. ..... I think the movie began aggravating me around the point when the sang the blue velvet song for the 20th time in the film (the whole thing) bunch of time killing if you ask me, as sign of a bad movie!! The character of hopper is enough to keep you watching this, and waiting to see what will happen next, but that's about is far as it goes, boring movie, stupid movie - because anyone else in this ladies situation would have done something to get out of the situation.

That is...until we see what a strange world it is. The boy finds a severed ear in a nearby dirt path on the way to the hospital and sets the story in motion. The cinematography has to be some of the best around, especially noticable in the opening scenes with the bright pastel colors of the town, the reds, the blues - so vivid - to give you the small town USA look. A detective mystery story told in Lynch's world where the weird only gets weirder. Dennis Hopper in one of his best roles as the wacked-out methyl junkie who holds a child hostage. If you like odd, this is your film. Not for the squeamish."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still Powerful Film-making","review":"I had first seen Blue Velvet in the theater when it first came out. I was confused, disturbed and, yet, inexplicably mesmerized by it. There was nothing around like it. Nowadays, film-makers try to challenge us with \\"innovative\\" cuts, digital manipulation, gratuitous sex and over-the-top characterizations.What makes Blue Velvet still worth viewing (for those who can stomach it) is its very \\"conventional\\" film technique and character/plot development which still manages to produce a disturbing and inexplicably mesmerizing experience. I'm less confused now but much more appreciative of David Lynch's film-making. It's all pretty tightly done. Once you get through Dennis Hopper's unforgettable portrayal of a Frank Booth -- realistic and demonic -- you'll wonder why he does those bland commercials now."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic Modern Film Noir","review":"Blue Velvet is my favorite David Lynch film, and one of my favorite films of all time. In many ways it's a disturbing film, but not so much because of the violence (compared to today's standards), but because of the characters and the darkness of the human condition that they expose. It's worth watching Dennis Hopper channel Frank Booth, the sociopathic drug dealer who pretty much owns the film. Also great are Dean Stockwell, Isabella Roselinni, Kyle McLaughlin, and Laura Dern, all great actors and actresses who make the film the classic that it is. A must for film students."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is \\"Blue Velvet\\"","review":"What can you say?All I have to say is that you had better not have any distraction's.This is one movie that you can or should watch with a quality audio/visual center.Say what you will, but it works very well with quality involved.G"},{"rating":"2","title":"A neat reworking of a subgenre","review":"I'm surprised that for all that's been said about this film that nobody's realized that it's essentially a 50s gang flick with the point of view shifted and with a strong dose of honesty.Surreal is an unfair description of this film; there are certainly some bizarre moments, but it's not as if this is a sequel to \\"Un Chien Andalou.\\" What it is is a very odd little crime thriller.It's well-acted and excellently written and directed. Not for those who think good movies are all problem plays, but otherwise excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Heated Masterpiece","review":"It will seduce , enthrall and excite but what will it do to your mind ! Above extraordinary and a driving reminder of the influence of celluloid . Cinematic ingenuity gauaranteed.

The documentary is 70 minutes long and has a lot of current interview footage with Kyle, Isabella, Dennis and Laura edited together with older interview footage of David Lynch. The attempt at showing us deleted scenes are interesting, but not great as they are still photos. It is a beautiful transfer. The widescreen presentation is the ONLY way to see it. Having watched it on video for years, the widescreen DVD shows so much it is like watching a new movie. Now maybe a version of Wild at Heart comparable to the Special Edition will be released on DVD!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry... not very good at all","review":"Beautifully filmed, but utterly stupid in its meandering and dumb plot. I'd love to smack Kyle MacLachlan's character over the head about fifty times with a rubber mallet. He may well be the single most stupid and naive dolt in all of cinema and I'm not sure that Lynch meant to make him quite that stupid.Movie tries to be cool and creepy and weird (\\"Hey, small towns have strange people in them, too!\\") Whoopee-stinkin'-doo, I say.I had an acquaintance who used to say \\"I hate weirdness that exists for weirdness' sake only.\\" Now I know what he meant. Pass."},{"rating":"2","title":"Right brain vs left brain-> everyone wins!","review":"Lynch subverts the logical paradigm in high style with a lovely piece of neon noise starring the LOVELY Isaballa Rosellini. It is a beautiful mish mash of colliding worlds where no normal reconcilliation can be found. Crazy people doing CRAZY things behind every door, under every floor, where sanity is a sign of weakness, and love an article of trade. Not so much shocking as stimulating, not so much viscious as visceral... worth watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"LYNCH'S MASTERPIECE","review":"What has to be David Lynch's best film, but Lost Highway is a close contender, is the best study of suburbia ever seen in movies up till AMERICAN BEAUTY. With beautiful shots of the Midwestern countryside and great performances from Rossellini and Hopper, this movie is undeniably weird but undeniably great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing","review":"Blue Velvet would be an interesting movie if it wasn't so confusing. As I watched it, I couldn't figure out what was going on. The whole plot itself was a little weak, but the performances of Isabella Rossellini, Dennis Hopper, and Laura Dern were great. Maybe it's just one of those movies that you either love or you hate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very unsettling and confusing movie!","review":"Dennis Hopper is a Great actor, Kyle McLachlan is better than average. But why they would agree to be in this weird, confusing movie is beyond me. Why does Kyle sleep with Rosselini when he already has a girlfriend? And when he knows he could be killed at her house if Frank shows up? Yes, this was the weirdest movie I have ever seen, weirder than Existenz or a Clockwork Orange. I didn't think the plot was very developed, I though the motivation for the characters' action went mostly unexplained, and I did not understand why so many people love this movie...But if you do love it, good for you - at least Lynch has made some people happy. I am just voicing my opinion, not putting down anyone who loves this film. Like some have said, this film is not for everyone. I give it 2 stars (instead of 1) because it was original, even though I didn't like it, and Dennis Hopper was convincing as the villain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Art thou entertainment?","review":"There are enough opinons about this movie to make it mandatory viewing for anyone who likes things a bit off center. It has interesting characters and visuals, but is short on plot and acting. Kyle McLachan and the rest of the cast are not very interesting to watch; Dennis Hopper is, but goes over the top to the point where his character is almost comical. Some satire going on here too, which not everybody \\"gets.\\" Watch it once to see what all the fuss is about, but it's more something to render judgement on than to enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"rip off","review":"They show a picture of a complete set and then send you one socket.

It is easy reading, not requiring any real thought and very predictable. The reader knows how the book will end a few pages in. I actually became annoyed with the main character at times becasue I thought she was too much of a patsy.

The main character is Rose, who has her very lifed turned upside down when her husband leaves her for the much younger woman, and is then fired and replaced by the same much younger woman. Rose looks at her life and all the things aquired and lost during her marriage and has to rebuild herself. No, Rose does not let the air out of her rivals tires, but she picks up the pieces (with the help of some french undies) and remakes herself into who she wants to be. Leave the unrealistic adventure at the door, and curl up with this inspiring, and extremely satisfying read."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOOKING IN THE MIRROR . . .","review":"Seldom fiction makes me feel better about myself, yet E. Buchan always does. Her writing is contemporary yet no-nonsense. REVENGE OF THE MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN follows our heroine through drastic lifestyle and philosophical changes. Not once did I doubt her middle-aged convictions and strangely found all the challenges comforting. This book was better than a mid-winter holiday for my head and my heart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the revenge?","review":"Title does not fit the book. All she does is roll over and let the world walk all over her. I was dissapointed there was no revenge, even at the one point in the book it would have been easily available to her."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Rose is a Rose...","review":"I enjoyed reading this book because it's very well written and described how a jilted wife goes through the five stages of grief, from denial all the way to acceptance. Buchan's writing style makes you empathize with Rose and her struggles as she survives through the crisis of losing her job and her husband to her assistant, while attempting to console her children and care for her ailing mother, and creating a new life for herself. Some reviewers objected to the way the story jumps back and forth, but I thought this was very entertaining and illuminating. Maybe this book takes some maturity to appreciate its full value."},{"rating":"1","title":"Revenge of the Middle-Aged Woman","review":"Boreing Boreing i just did not enjoy it it was just about ok i cant find anymore words for it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, realistic, well written","review":"I was absolutely drawn into this story from the first page. Elizabeth Buchan did a wonderful job of portraying how Rose thought everything was fine with her husband Nathan, her relationship with co-worker and supposed \\"friend\\" Minty, only to find out that Minty had seduced her husband and manipulated him into falling in love with her. The range of emotions which Rose goes through to eventually come out of the whole expierence stronger is right on the mark. It is also very amusing to see what ultimately happens to Nathan and Minty. I became so involved in this story that I almost missed my plane at the airport. Great read!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Only over 40","review":"Finally a book for those of us over 40. It is a very light and delightful book. I enjoyed it all the way until the end. I purchased 2 of her other books because I enjoyed this so much."},{"rating":"1","title":"A real bore","review":"This book just did not get interesting until the last couple of chapters. It is predictable and just plain boring. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointing read","review":"My book club chose this book because of it's interesting title. What a disappointment. I only kept reading after the first hour because I just knew that eventually SOMETHING would happen. It never did. Don't waste your time on this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Revenge: None in this book!","review":"I picked up this book in the super market, ready for a good book of wit and fun. What I got was a long, depressing book of life. There are lots of things with middle age we can all laugh about, and I thought this would be a book of them. However, it was only sadness. We get enough of real life, please pass on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother!","review":"I found this book to be dreadful. I don't even know why I finished it. I would speed read through sections that were unbearable and pointless only to be disappointed with the main plot that never went anywhere. The title looked intriguing but this book was anything but that. I have to say that I will not be buying or checking out anymore books by this author..no matter how delightful the titles may sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong Title","review":"Instead of \\"Revenge of . . .\\", this book would better be titled \\"Resignation of . . .\\". I kept waiting for the main character (Rose) to take hold and deal realistically (not ballistically) with her circumstances. However, the author was determined to mold her character into a pseudo-mature, compliant, long-suffering blob. I suppose we are to appreciate how marvelously evolved and noble Rose is. Sorry, it doesn't work! Capitulation should not be confused with strength. This book is fiction indeed -- an improbable manipulation of characters and plot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard to put down","review":"I first read a clip of this book in Sept. 2003 Good Housekeeping. I was hooked and had to go to the store to buy the book so I didn't have to wait for part 2. While this book is a bit predictable, the blows that Rose encounters are not always what you expect they will be. As she becomes an ex wife - you feel her pain with her and celebrate her strength with her. I will try another E. Buchan book in hopes that it will be as enjoyable as Revenge of the Middle Age Woman."},{"rating":"1","title":"wallbanger","review":"Wallbanger! Didn't like the way Rose acted towards her husband, Nathan when he dropped his bomb. Heck didn't like the way she acted towards Minty or the fact that Nathan thought his bomb wouldn't affect his grown children and that Poppy should deal with it too. Nathan wasn't very likeable at all! Seemed that he was just searching for excuses from the word go and then when he got what he wanted with Minty, along with the marital home which felt like he railroaded Rose into giving him, he didn't seem to be to happy. He seemed to believe that Rose settled but I think he did later on. Didn't like Hal either. He was selfish and self absorbed. Sure he apologized but I think it was too late."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Sweet and Satisfying Read","review":"I loved this book! In Revenge of the Middle-Aged Woman author Elizabeth Buchan has given us a new heroine to love; confident, comfortable, charming and successful forty-eight year old Rose. Although we meet her on the eve of her undoing (at the hands of her convincingly conniving husband- and job-stealing assistant), Rose is no hand-wringing cliche of the wife-done-wrong. Instead our Rose navigates her new, and painful world with the grace, dignity and class we all wish we could muster when things come undone in our lives. Rose is not destroyed by her suffering, she is transformed in a deeply satisying and understandable way. I especially recommend this book for the quality of the writing which was consistently exquisite from page one through the final chapter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Living Well is the Best Revenge","review":"Rose Lloyd, a 40-something London newspaper book reviewer, is simultaneously dumped by her husband of 25 years and has her job taken by his mistress, who also happens to be Rose's 29 year-old assistant (with the execrable name of Minty). I expected from the title that there would be some sort of revenge ala The First Wives Club, but no. Rose's revenge is more like validation, when her erring husband's new relationship is not all wine and roses. The way Rose is so wrapped up in her garden and many unfamiliar British slang words may be off-putting for American readers. I also thought the beginning was slow, it seemed like a long setup before the action started, but overall a pretty good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Revenge?","review":"I was ready for something fun and inspiring. This book (which I listened to on CD) seemed dull and depressing to me. Where was the revenge?It was also very difficult to follow in the audio format. It kept jumping around in time without any warning. On paper this might not have been a problem, but it was very confusing to listen to. I can think of several ways this could have been rectified, but no signals were given. I wouldn't recommend it, particularly not in audio form."},{"rating":"1","title":"You Call That Revenge?","review":"I am really tired of woman gets dumped, Woman seeks revenge kind of books. They are a dime a dozen! And what's more dissappointing is in this book, I kept waiting for her to take revenge and she never really does. It was a totally depressing book. This was a book club read and I had such a difficult time getting through the entire book. If I did not have to read it, I would have quit reading about 1/4 of the way through."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kudos again for Buchan","review":"This was my second Elizabeth Buchan book, and I really like the style of this author. I love the way she tells the story from Rose's point of view. The reader really gets to know Rose, and see how events took place in her life time.Rose had been left by her husband for a younger woman, but this is not just a tale of how Rose gets revenge on the husband or the younger woman. This is a story of Rose's empowerment. She does go through some awful times before she sees her potential again, but the reader takes the journey with her.This is real testament to the power that women have within themselves. Read and see for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Topeak The Mini 9-Function Bicycle Tool","review":"Awesome little guy... Well constructed! Small and it has everything you need.

However, for small adjustments, it does the job. It worked for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsatisfactory and unreliable study","review":"I found this book unsatisfactory in several respects. To start with, it failed to leave me with more than a supeficial impression of what it meant to be a Soviet pilot in WW2 - I found the book dry and impersonal. Secondly, it left unanswered many of the questions I had before I read it, like why soviet pilots were able to score so many victories with the P39, which was neglected by US pilots. Finally, there is one damning aspect: the book is inconsistent, contradicting itself often. For instance, it will say that a given version of a Yak fighter was introduced in combat, say, in february 1943; a few pages later, a caption will say that pilot XYZ scored a kill on that fighter version in november 1942... There is plenty of similar mistakes. If you are looking for reliable references, look elsewhere. The only positive thing I can say is that there are very few studies of Soviet pilots in WW2, so this book somehow fills a gap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Boxed set contents","review":"This boxed set contains the individual titles which can also be found on amazon below:Death by misadventureBruce Lee: The true storyThe Young bruce leefist of unicorn"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good 1/4\\"Rope","review":"In response to other reviews.

The book loses some momentum 1/3 of the way in. It gets bogged down with how Kong was cloned. This part of the book is a bit slow. However, the second half of this story is fun, exciting, anyone who enjoys King Kong related movies or Jurrasic Park type themes is in for a real treat. Monster bugs, dinosaurs, King Kong, mercinaries, the second half of the book is action packed. A fun read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Feels Good feels good to hear","review":"Take 6 took it back to their a cappella style and I remembered why their style is just as distinctive as ever.

Listening to my favorite track \\"More Than Ever\\", you'll hear what I mean. So 21st Century. A blending of the old and new in a capella, as only Take 6 can do it.

Through the whole movie you're waiting for Lungren's rock em', sock em' action. There's just not enough of it in this flick. Dolph is too quiet and to boring. They just threw the broad in. She really doesn't fit in at all. The only good thing about this movie is Dolph Lundgren's Swedish good looks; and for that reason only ,I give it two stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"another failure with Dolph Lundgren","review":"Dolph Lundgren (Universal Soldier, Blackjack) plays a man who is hired to take out a primary target and helping him is his old partner, Gina Bellman.

The 2 are also in a heated romance and get caught in a deadly cat and mouse game of double cross as the agency they are working for want them dead. Another Dolph Lundgren stinker vehicle though Lundgren can't act if his life depended on it. He couldnt pull of He-Man and The Punisher, he can't pull off anything else. Gina Bellman is hot but her acting is horrible as well as the rest of the cast. There's nothing like being hired to kill people and then have sex. Directed by Russell Mulcahy (Highlander). Bottom line is this actioner is a borefest."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's hard to beleive that Fox would do Pan and Scan!","review":"What a disappointment it is to hear that this, a 2.35:1 film will be released as a pan and scan DVD. And by Fox of all studios. This is a cool Dolph movie that had a great atmosphere to it but you won't feel it in the cropped confines of 1.33:1.

I understand music likes and dislikes are subjective, so I have to qualify my criticism as \\"my Opinion\\"...which is:The lyrics are mostly clever, but the \\"operatic\\" interpretations got old before the first song was finished...and the 'stilited' vocal renditions continue throughout the album.I remember when \\"The Cat Came Back\\" was a country music hit (1950's??), but did not remember how cruel it was...I guarantee it won't get much play today, what with the Animal Rights awareness we now have.The Johny cash song was clever, but not enough to 'carry' the rest of the album.I gave the CD away to a friend who loves acts. I explained I did not care for the renditions, but I left that up to her. I'm sure there are those who will enjoy it immensely....I did not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cats","review":"If you love cats or have a sense of humour you will love these songs. I wasn't too keen on the first one (The cat came Back) as the owner was a bit drastic. The song My Grandmothers cat, who is spoilt rotten, contains a bit of advice for all pet owners. Other songs that reflect the whims and fancies of my own cat abound. e.g. I wanna go out.Some of the cat stories are parodies of some of the popular songs of the 50's and 60's and also a delightful use of some famous classics in the story of the dog and cat.I can really recommend this CD.

Slick and Kantner are able to tell the story of The Doors European tour from the unique position of being there. They're able not only to understand what Morrison was going through and experiencing as rock stars in the 60's, they're able to relate that experience to the viewer.Most of the DVD is of The Doors in concert in England at The Roundhouse. You can't deny the power of The Doors performance. Morrison's lyrics and poems meld with The Doors music to create a theatrical experience that still has the power to draw you in."},{"rating":"2","title":"the doors","review":"Awesome product.

The first \\"Light My Fire\\" picks up midway, \\"Hello, I Love You\\" is the video of Jim singing in the street, cut with some footage of him messing around with fans, and \\"Alabama Song\\" is played over a few still shots/photos and the credits. The Jefferson Airplane commentary is boring and completely useless in terms of teaching anything, or even just being entertaining. I suspect the Jefferson Airplane interview was included because, without it, this DVD would only run about 45 minutes. If you are looking for a good concert DVD of the Doors, this is not it.

Although Aronson's volume is far from being preachy, it is difficult not to make certain connections within our own society that have the character of being drawn directly from Aronson's experiments.Racism, for instance can now be explained entirely in social psychological terms. Both white and non-white behaviror--actions and interactions--follow the models of Aronson's experiments precisely. Alienation within our society and the attendant lost of a sense of community is another example of one of the secondary effects of social psychological processes made so profoundly clear from this book.Aronson leaves us with a lot to digest and think about, and this in my view is what books of this sort should do.

It is efficiently made, un-pretentious, and even includes some good acting. Cecil Kellaway is especially good as a skeptical scientist who loses his skepticism one minute before the Beast eats him. The Beast, by the way, is a fictional dinosaur species, but is very convincing as it rampages thru the concrete canyons of Manhattan. Once again, Ray Harryhausen proves himself the master of creating great special effects on a low budget.

The NYC location scenes are absolutely sensational, and even the on-set scenes are painstakingly realistic. Action set in the Arctic is so skillfully effected that a viewer can practically feel the bitter cold, and even undersea footage of an octopus/shark struggle is smoothly enmeshed with the appearance of the titular creature. Artful casting and a nearly flawless script have resulted in a fast-paced, suspenseful storyline that wastes not a moment of the audience's attention.Why isn't this film more widely acclaimed? The answer is unfathomable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolute classic of the genre","review":"YOu've seen the basic plot 100,000 times: Big creature, often dino-like, wreaks havoc on major city. BUt this is the one that started the ball rolling. Harryhausen's solo effort is still entertaining, despite the mediocre acting associated with all films like this (it actually adds to the whole experience). This is one you'll want to watch again. Don't let anyone give away anything. Just get it and watch it! Great fun!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beats from 20000 Fathoms","review":"I love old sci-fi movies and this wasn't one of the better ones.It was okay, but I was a little disappointed in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"ONE GOOD MOVIE!","review":"Monster movies don't get much better. Paul Christian is a nuclear scientist sure his partner was killed by a monster only he has seen. Of corse nobody believes him, until a paleontologist helps him link several sea disasters and accounts of a sea serpent together, to prove to the military this is a true concern. This comes all-to late when the giant animal (a rhedosaurus) surfaces in wall street, leveling several bloks, cars, and people in his wake. Finally the six story menace is burnt to a cinder when it's trapt within the Coney Island rollercoaster. This was the best 50's \\"dinosaur (or monster) on the loose\\" movie. Paula Raymond is Christian's girlfriend, and Cecil Kellaway is the paleontologist. Special effects by the legendary Ray Harryhausen, and based on popular fiction author Ray Bradburry."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great introduction to Lungfish","review":"This is the first review I've written, so I have to write about a band that really means a lot to me. Lungfish has been around for almost fifteen years now and they're still making great music. 'Talking Songs For Walking' is the oldest Lungfish material that I've heard and it's simply amazing, just like the rest of their stuff. It is a little more rock oriented than later records, but this is a good thing. Lungfish is one of those rare bands that can always seem to change things up and somehow maintain a familiar sound. There are some almost catchy songs on this record, I usually end up listening to it in my car. I've found it's great driving music. Not to say that this is everyday catchy radio friendly music.....not by any means. Very original stuff here and some really great lyrics as you'd expect from their singer Dan Higgs. I highly recommend this record to any lungfish fan, or as a introduction to Lungfish music."},{"rating":"2","title":"I had to find this DVD!","review":"I bought this product years ago in the late 1990's for my son. His school's librarian celebrated Dr. Seuss Day, so I gave my VHS tape to her so the kids could enjoy it. Recently, I was thinking about it and purposed to find it again to buy. I was so pleased to find it on DVD, even though I would have bought a VHS to play it on. I simply love this DVD! I am forty-five years old, but true Seuss fans understand that his work appeals to kids of every age. I grew up on Dr. Seuss!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Goofy, but Informative","review":"This was a cute biographical documentary about the life of Theodore Geisel, better known as Dr. Seuss. It was a bit campy at times, but I knew more about the author than I had before after watching the video. I wasn't able to find much in the way of video resources about Dr. Seuss. This was the best, by far, that I've found up to this point."},{"rating":"1","title":"Parents use caution - not for children","review":"I am very disappointed and shocked by this video. I took it out from our public library with high hopes for my children who enjoy Dr. Seuss books. Mixed into this video of bits about different Dr. Seuss stories are images of swastikas, Nazi's and even Hitler. Apparently the author of Dr. Seuss books did a documentary during W.W. II and footage of it is included in this video. I strongly feel that this is inappriate for children to watch. There are scenes from Kristallnacht - when the Nazi's looted and burned Jewish stores. Why was this included and why isn't there a warning on the box? I do not want my children seeing images that will stay in their mind of these terrible things. I am shocked by how many positive reviews of this video are listed. After informing my local librarian of the contents of this video, she removed it from the children's section."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly Awful!","review":"This has to qualify as one of the worst films of all time. It has the unfunniest jokes, the most bored-looking stars, and the stupidest makeup of any film! It is an insult to Dr.Seuss, Ted Geisel, AND Theo. LeSeig(His various names). It has a good story to tell but botches it totally. A pain to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"A joy to watch.","review":"Watching this movie always puts me in a good mood. This is a great review of Suess's life and his stories. Informative and entertaining. A reporter goes to Suess's studio to learn more about Dr. Suess. While in the studio, she opens a book and is brought into a world were she meets characters from all our favorite Dr. Suess stories. Guided by the Cat in the Hat, she learns about Suess's life, and gets insight into his stories. I greatly enjoyed the sets and costumes, which were made to look like Suess's drawings. Seeing your favorite actor's in those costumes is also a treat (Christopher Lloyd, Patric Stewart, Robin Williams, Howie Mandell, and more).We see many video clips from the animated Dr. Suess stories included in the story line.

However, I hate the fact that these DVDs which contain ONLY 3 episodes are sold for $20 and (if you go to some foreign Jap/China town in the US) they sell for $30!! I mean, three episodes? Rip off! In my opinion, one episode is worth $1. Plus, the extras in these DVDs aren't even all that great either!Back in the early 2000's, company's like Pioneer/Geneon Entertainment sell one Sailor Moon DVD for $14.99 and they contain 6-7 episodes! Boo to ViZ. At least put 6 episodes in a DVD if you're going to sell your products at ridiculously high prices...but I guess its too late for that. I wonder if they're going to release the Final Act series... Also...why doesn't ViZ sub the opening and ending songs?!

I have a 3 year old and she loves the sing along movies. After watching this movie my daugter will not get in the bathtub without shaking and will not allow us to put anything in the bathtub with her. We discovered that her fear came from the movie where there is a part where rabbit and tigger are taking a bath and tigger pulls the plug and rabbit goes down the drain. My gaughters bathtime used to be her most relaxing time of the day. She would take all of her toys in with her, but not anymore. It has become the most stressfull time of the day for her.

Now they've added And Piglet Too to the title, as well as songs from Piglet's Big Movie. Piglet's Big Movie was my least favorite of all the Pooh movies so I didn't expect much from this Sing Along Songs DVD- I wasn't disappointed.

The blade came fairly sharp, (not razor edged) which is nice considering many of the machetes that I have purchased from other companies were dull on arrival. It took little effort to put a better edge on these and so far I'm pleased with how the OKC holds an edge. Look forward to see how they re-sharpen.

I've never been to Japan, but after reading Untangling My Chopsticks, I felt like I had a true feeling of what it is like. I loved the descriptions of the tea ceremony. So well-written, and with such telling detail. The tea ceremony is so different than anything in America, with its emphasis on symbolism. Every action, every item served in the tea ceremony has meaning, and I enjoyed learning about it all. Also, I loved reading the recipes in this book, even though I'm not a cook. This book is to Japan what \\"Under the Tuscan Sun\\" is to Italy. Definitely worth reading.

I bought the album right away and then this one, where I really discovered the band. Here you can find fresh, really impacting songs, for those who are a little tired of easy-listening. Shudder to think is that kind of band you need to hear over and over to really understand what they mean, but, be careful, cause once you start, it's very hard to leave it. Only one more thing, I wish they had more presence here in Spain cause those who have listened to them have loved it.

I absolutely love Minor Threat, the Minutemen, Sonic Youth, Husker Du, and many other bands Fugazi is usually grouped with on alt/indie lists, but I find this album nearly unlistenable, even after many listens. It's so bland and boring. It's like Husker Du on sedatives, writing bad songs.The only songs that keep me from falling asleep are \\"Waiting Room\\" and \\"Margin Walker.\\" The former has nice, loud bursts of guitars and the latter has a cool, uptempo, catchy chorus. All the other songs bore me to tears. They're boring, uninspired, and not in the least bit catchy.I do, however, admore Fugazi's musical ethics. They're very non-conformist, and very punk in attitude. They have their own rules, their own music.

But lo and behold I was wrong. Fugazi had fallen victim to the dreaded disease of having one good song on an album.

I love and respect many of David's other books, but his books on eschatology (and those of Tim Lehaye) are patently wrong. Any person who says that the Tribulation is 7 years long - well, let's just ask: where does it say that in the Bible? It doesn't. Oh, Daniel talks about the 70th week, yes. But no where does it say, or imply, that the 70th week and THE Tribulation are the same. No Christian before the early 1800's (almost 2000 years worth of followers of Jesus) ever taught that. Oh, there are vague references, when take out of context, from Clement of Rome and Origen. Even Kay Arthur (who is a pre-trib believer) doesn't think the Tribulation starts before the Abomination of Desolation (tho she does hint, 20 years ago, that the Rapture is at the beginning of the 70th week). So, David Jeremiah is good - and he's a wonderful Christian, but he's mistaken about eschatology."},{"rating":"2","title":"The book of Revelation simplified!","review":"Most people I've talked to do not fully comprehend the message that Revelation relates (nor do I). Simply put, a child can understand Dr. Jeremiah's explanation and the good part is, he backs up what he says with scripture. Be forewarned -- be ready or be eternally sorry. Excellent reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Escape into the Night","review":"Anyone who studies Revelation in the Bible, knows that it is a difficult book.

Megan Hickey has a genuine and unique sound, both in voice as well as instrumentally, coupled with lyrics which reveal themselves as increasingly more introspective upon review. Teamed with high quality accompaniment, Hickey creates an atmospheric album of matured pace and superb musical exploration."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as you would expect...","review":"We had received a lambskin for our newborn and he loves it so much, we decided to order a spare.

Furthermore, I am extremely disappointed in the seller's customer service! The first time I contacted them to return the item, I was informed that they don't accept returns, only exchanges. When I asked who would be paying for shipping, the response I received was \\"you received this item shipped for free\\"-rude and unhelpful. After I complained to Amazon's customer service and they wrote to the seller, the seller responded that \\"the item is a stocking and can't be defective\\"-again, rude and unhelpful-stockings that don't stay up are clearly defective as there is an issue with the elastic band. I will never buy anything from this seller again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"The product looks nice when I opened the package.

They stayed up the first few times I wore them, but then never stayed up. So, I cut off the foot and now wear it ankle to thigh, which I prefer anyway! Surprisingly, the did not run or unravel when I did this and are much more comfortable without toes! They are sturdy and no runs. They seem to be a good medium compression.

My only complaint is that they take a little getting used to and the band around the thighs has to be positioned correctly to be comfortable.

I would definitely recommend these to anyone who stands a lot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother...","review":"Doesn't provide any pressure support and got a huge run the first time I put it on. Was very surprised because Jobst is usually good quality - maybe I just got a crappy pair.If you're looking for any level of compression support, go with the higher compression levels. This provides less support than non-compression hose. I don't have ultra skinny legs and the hose fit loosely."},{"rating":"2","title":"work for me","review":"Works well at keeping circulation up.

I've being using other brands and these are not even close to be supportive, nor I can feel any good compression. I also double checked the size I ordered, thinking I may have chosen the wrong one, but nope, the size is right, they are just larger.

Not exactly consistent with the squeaky clean image Disney so aggressively cultivates."},{"rating":"2","title":"Circle Of Life- Extended","review":"This Disney DVD Sing Along Songs is an extended version of the VHS tape that cuts out the original Jiminy Cricket intros.

The music and the words on the screen are in that language. As a French and Spanish teacher, I can say that my students really enjoy this DVD (yeah, high school kids!) and since they already know the songs, they can start to sing along immediately.The list of songs is not exactly the same in each language, though, and ironically, the French section has MORE songs than the Spanish. Almost all the songs are there for both languages and they have a completely separate section for them so you can use the ALL PLAY feature and play all the songs through automatically (all in French or all in Spanish) or choose one individual one to use. I've not been able to find any other Disney sing-alongs like this one with the other two languages (there's a Winnie the Pooh, but it only has a Spanish track)."},{"rating":"2","title":"My two year old loves it!","review":"This is a good video with some good Disney songs, and my two year old loves it. It is short, maybe 1/2 hour long, but that works out well since I do not like him watching too much TV anyway. My guy stands in front of the TV and bops to the songs; he likes the Lion King songs best. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the last several songs are unknown, kind of filler songs. The DVD starts off very strong.

This is one book that is so packed with information sure to astound and amaze you, that the trivia tidbits are worth the purchase price alone!

I was completely disappointed. Fielding statistics are almost non-existant. Hitting and pitching stats are pared down to a bare minimum of the common ones. The web site carries more thorough batting and pitching stats for free. I guess now that Total Baseball is the official book of Major League Baseball, they decided to do away with the effort that got them there in the first place. This wouldn't be the first time people got lazy once they figured they were all that. I was so disgusted that I returned the book. I wish they would put the complete batting, pitching, and fielding stats on a CD and sell it, and get rid of this annoying piece of weight training equipment.

The audio quality on the other hand is very poor, for there is a loud and constant scratching sound throughout the entire movie, like that made on an old turntable before or after a song is played. This is the first DVD that forced me to turn the treble on my TV all of the way down in order to drown out as much of the scratching sound as possible so that I could hear the dialogue, and I have a great many westerns on the DVD format that are as old or older than this one with far better audio.

The original release that DID NOT include that over played atrocity Love Hurts (it is included here as the weakest of the bonus tracks). The liner notes will inform you that the band left this song on the cutting room floor in disgust. Only later did some genius release it in America as a single, which did wonders for their career but has provided a lifetime of embarrassment for Nazareth fans.

I've never tried any other memory foam cushions simply because this one is so much more inexpensive than most. My only real complaint is that the hinge that holds the two parts together always ends up breaking apart after 8-9 months, although the cushions are still usable. The included carrying bag feels like it's made of dryer sheet material and rips as easily--I just don't use it. All in all, though, I love this cushion.

Though one can not consider it a literature book, it is nevertheless not like a traditional textbook either, which certainly helps in keeping the reader entertained."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Bogart film","review":"The premise of the film is very interesting. But this is the worst of the Bogart movies I've seen. This movie is badly written. Bogarts wise cracks are badly timed within the dialog- it seem the line should be funny within the context of the dialog, but the lines instead seem isolated from the tone and emotion, adding nothing to the scenes.There are many problems with the editing. There are several places where they seemed to have ran out of film or had no pickup shots.Hollywood should remake this film... they can only improve on it.There are plenty of good Bogart films out there, this is not one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not see this movie!!","review":"If you liked the Maltese Falcon or The Big Sleep then don't see this movie. The direction and writing are terrible. The first 15 minutes of the movie is done as first person with only Bogarts voice - which is extremely distracting. Once you actually see Bogey it doesn't really matter. You aren't invested in the characters and there is no plot. The story goes on for almost 3/4 of the movie before anything worth while caring about happens and when it does it is so poorly written you are more relieved than satisfied because you know that soon the movie will be over. There only a few actual tense moments in the movie, the last 20 minutes, and the final one is so stupid as to be laughable. I felt like I was watching a first year film student film. You know the kind - the director does such obvious camera and plot work that it IS obvious the message they are trying to send and as such you feel dumber for having watched it."},{"rating":"1","title":"You gotta be kidding.","review":"People, what the hell have you been smoking?

It's a great story as well. They don't make them like this anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"BREAKING OUT ISN'T HARD TO DO","review":"Unique film set in San Francisco has too many plot loopholes to be rated a great film.First we have Bennett abeting Bogart's prison breakout, and rightfully losing all, including the shirt off his back. Enter Bacall, all too willing to hide, feed and clothe a prison escapee, nearly 30 years her senior. Then,by chance,D'Andrea appears, a cab driver with connections to a plastic surgeon, who \\"operates\\" only before dawn. Crime doesn't pay? One almost expects President Truman to appear next,hand delivering a complete pardon just before taking the evil Moorehead into custody. Incredibly, the film really does work however,thanks to \\"Bogie\\" and Bacall, who else? The terrific closing scene in a South American restaurant has been emulated in countless films, but few better than in this one, despite all of its shortcomings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Bogart...","review":"This is a little different for Bogart and Bacall, but I found it quite interesting and worth the watch for sure. The premise of the movie dictates that you don't see Bogart's face till quite a ways into the movie, and it's very interesting to see the movie work with that angle. Overall, I think that even weaker movies by Bogart and Bacall are great!

We've Been Bagged Again...","review":"Terrific film with Bogie and Bacall, love it, but not the sound quality. During the credits the sound and music were great. Once the film started we had to keep increasing the volume. It is not our system, it is the DVD's sound reproduction that lacks. This is not the first vintage film rerecorded on DVD that hasn't measured up with regard to sound quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark Passage","review":"Filmed on location in San Francisco, this inventive noir is the third of the legendary Bogart-Bacall pairings, and hinges on the unusual face-transformation plot point: For the first part of the film, Daves presents the action using a point-of-view camera shot, in which we see everything through Vincent's eyes. Once his bandages are removed, the objective perspective is restored, and Bogart appears for the first time. This visual gimmick and the sexual chemistry between the two leads is half the fun of watching \\"Passage\\" and then there's Agnes Moorehead, who vamps it up as a shrewish deviant named Madge. For a first-rate mystery-thriller, \\"Dark Passage\\" leads the way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different pace of film","review":"Read the reviews that rate it 4 or 5 stars, you'll get more detail than I will provide. This was a first-time viewing for me, so I was partially intrigued, but not disappointed. I rated it 4 stars, not that it couldn't be 5, there just lacked a touch of logical progression for me. The Bogie/Bacall combo is there, more subdued than their other notable performances - To Have and Have Not, The Big Sleep, Key Largo. In watching the special features, and learning some behind the scenes info, helped explain some of the \\"cheap\\" feel some segments had, for me anyway. Least enjoyable character was the grifter, he just lacked a bit for me. All of the others were solid, enjoyable to watch in action.

He allows you to walk in the footsteps of the murderer and see through their eyes without ever once looking in the mirror to tell you exactly who it was. From this vantage point the reader experiences the insanity even though they can't quite grasp the process that makes it tick. Hidden In Plain View provides the reader with enough suspense to keep them in the pages and enough thrills to insure completion. Congratulations Blair on another intelligent, insightful and well written offering to the literary arena."},{"rating":"1","title":"Entertaining but not very interesting","review":"Hidden in Plain View was not the book I'd hoped it would be. If you are a fan of mystery books with high drama and intrigue this is not the book for you. There were several scenes that simply did not make sense and added nothing to the plot. The characters - except for Darryl and the killer - were very flat and one dimensional. I agree that it was an easy read - but maybe a bit too easy. I must be honest and add that all of the other members of my book club really enjoyed this book. I also appreciated Mr. Walker's portryal of African Americans as hard working and sensitive and, being from Baltimore, I loved the city references. (Although there is no Ida Wells Hospital here.) I just felt that as a mystery it left a lot to be desired."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit boring.","review":"I think this author has a good future and has written a decent book, but there is just no substance. There is no suspense, no mystery, and not much of a story. Eventhough he spends a great deal of time with his characters you really dont get to know them and in most cases they are in many cases unlikeable. There is one section 3/4 through the book which was very incestual and disgusting and did not lend anything to the story. I think if he takes more time to develop a REAL story, he has great potential as a writer. This book was 3.99 on kindle so it's a bargain and was obviously enjoyed by at least 7 very positive reviewers. However, it completely felt flat to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost Unmitigated Trash","review":"The book begins as if it is really a murder mystery, with the added attraction of dishing on black culture. It soon deteriorates into amateurish, improbable, poorly written trash. Although I'm not sure what pornography is, I think this book verges on that. Just titillating sex and gore for their own sake with no redeeming literary value. Somehow I got the idea that this book was worth reading. I can't imagine how and I need to check my sources of recommendations. A high school student could have produced a more sophisticated/polished product. I regret my encounter with this book, although the nature of the product became clear about 50% into it. I chose to \\"soldier on\\" as a matter of education and research into what the people are now reading, and apparently liking. (?!!?)

It keeps your interest to the end, both the main mystery and the personal details as they develop. I enjoyed watching the relationship develop between Darryl and Yolanda.I will be looking for more since I really want to read more about these characters. There are a lot of really likeable characters and they are very well written. I will be buying the next book just to see if there is a marriage in Darryl's future and to read all about the next mystery he solves.You would not expect a newspaper reporter to be as interesting as these books make him. And the bits of racial conflict and information about expectations are well done and interesting but not confrontational. This writer is a must-try if you want something fast moving and different. These books would be enjoyed by men and women but there is a bit of incest that might make this one not so good for teens."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved this book","review":"It was a real surprise to me.

It makes you wonder about the physical causes that may create serial killers. Darryl Billups, an investigative journalist, is the primary character in the book and is on the trail of a serial killer. Darryl gives you insight into the life of a black journalist. It certainly has disadvantages and advantages; like acting as a maintenance man so as not to be noticed. His girlfriend has a very interesting twin sister;can you say the word metamorphosis. There are moments of humor but intrigue is woven throughout the story. About halfway through the book you discover who is responsible for the murders but it takes to the end of the book to find out how they are accomplished. This is one in a series but is a stand-alone read. After having read this one, I want to read the first one in the series to find out more about Darryl and how he got started as a journalist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another interesting read","review":"I enjoyed reading this book but I thought it was too short. The story line was really good, I didn't see most of it coming, and I really like that in a book. I love mysteries and this one was pretty good.

It has a great story and becautiful sceneries and performances. There was a lot of chemistry between Redford and Olin and they are good together. For those who complained about lack of chemistry watch Horse Whisperer with Redford. Now, that is a film with no chemistry among leads. I particulary enjoyed the last scene when Redford gets out of his car in front of the beach and looks at horizon hoping for Bobby to show up. But he knows she is not coming. It was an unjustice not to give Raul Julia credit. I don't why they did that. But he was very good. I think in time this film will be rediscovered.

The soundtrack is awesome, Redford is nearly flawless - only a few lines are weakly delivered - and though Lena Olin misplays a few brief phrases, she is a haunting presence.It's the usual Hollywood political angle, but the body of the film, the tragic romance, and the setting make that a non-factor."},{"rating":"1","title":"A decent try but no cigar","review":"For some reason no-one has ever managed to make a good film about the Cuban Revolution, with Hollywood often drawing in some of its biggest stars - usually in the hope of another Casablanca - and missing by a mile. Case in point: Havana, a disappointingly dull misfire from Sydney Pollack and Robert Redford that never catches fire for all the money on the screen. The night scenes are beautifully shot and the script makes half-hearted attempts to examine the moral contradictions in the last days of Battista's rule, but it's pretty uninvolving stuff not helped by the total lack of chemistry between Redford and Lena Olin. The few potentially good scenes never quite work and the compensations are largely cosmetic, although Alan Arkin and Richard Farnsworth offer reliable support and Terence Marsh's production design is superb. Not terrible, just not terribly good. Still, at least it's better than Cuba or Che."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST Movie I've EVER SEEN!!!","review":"The acting is terrible!!!

This is a total joke if you are wanting an actual workout.After watching the first ten minutes without her having you do anything, I became totally bored and I don't think she actually did any of the moves herself.

For many WWII enthusiasts, information on the Dirlewanger Brigade has always consisted of general references in broad-based histories. The enthusiast need only to look at the extensive and pertinenet bibliography to see that Maclean has gone to lengths that far exceed anything previously done. The book traces the historical development, composition (names and \\"fame\\") and actions of a group of criminals who were put in uniform for one reason: the extermination of Warsaw.

What really happened during that savage war, as it had been documented in numerous other books, and what really misses from that particular book are the details about the holocaust that was perpetrated with extreme organization and methodicism by the German SS. What Maclean gives are just dry details about some of the operations of the commando without conclusive analysis about the ideology and the fanatical indoctrination with which all German troops, and particularly the SS, were imbued before the invasion.

MacLean manages to confuse reams of irrelevant information regarding promotions and personal information of anonymous SS men as salient to the story. The translations from German to English are poorly done (they read in many cases as literal translations) and the few worthy anecdotes that a reader truly interested in Oskar Dirlewanger and his role in history will find could easily have been condensed into thirty pages.

Here the beds are more in the traditional western style, elevated above the floor with traditional pillows and coverings. Still however, the location in Asia, with Asian architects and customers provides for design touches that are both striking and subtlely different from the standard American design. For instance many of the designs have updated appearing mosquito netting.

Verizon replaced the battery, but there was no improvement. Since quite a number of people have made this complaint, I wonder if there is a bad batch of Samsung U340 phones. After a month, I eventually switched over to a different brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bare bones; won't hold a charge for long","review":"As some of the other reviewers pointed out, it is a bare-bones phone! The one I have now is the second U340 I've owned--I returned the other one because it would only hold a charge if I didn't use it! This second one also will not hold a charge for long if you actually make or receive calls. I've seriously considered switching back to my previous phone, which at this point is about four years old but was MUCH more reliable plus it has features that this one doesn't, namely Get It Now. Overall, I think if you're contemplating purchasing this phone, I would suggest you don't!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying glitch","review":"This phone is fine for a basic phone. I like the size and appearance of the phone. The issue is that I cannot make the settings stay set. I have been back to Verizon, and they said it was a software problem, so I left it with them for a couple of hours, while they loaded the latest software, but it still doesn't work. I emailed Samsung two days ago, but they have not responded.It's annoying to set a ringtone and have it reset to another one as soon as I receive a text message.Bad service from both Verizon and Samsung. I much preferred my LG phone."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"While the phone doesn't have a bad look for the price they fail to inform you that it has no get it now options which means you cannot download ring tones or any applications, not even your phone book if you have it backed up on the computer.

The second time, a surly manager at Verizon in East Cobb, Ga., only growled something about a bad batch of batteries.

I would also recommend the 8 foot table as well. My son uses it as a workstation. He has 3 computers on it.Another great thing about this table is that it can be used for all kinds of things.

That is what this book does best - remind us that God gives us perspective, protection, purpose, and power. The book is divided into four sections based on those four items. Within each section there are several chapters. The chapters are well done and contain short stories to help illustrate the points being made. In addition, whenever there is a related Bible verse it is shared with the reader. One of the things that make this book unique is that it is not particularly focused on getting an emotional response from the reader but is more like a reminder of God's promises and the things that separate Christians from others. This positioning as more of a logical than emotional appeal may make it better suited than most as an appropriate read and source of encouragement for men. \\"A Hope and a Future\\" is a recommended read."},{"rating":"1","title":"May be a book, but not a guide","review":"This product may contain decent content but it exhibits the most retarded way to put it in an electronic guide format. (1) no sensible cross-references; (2) maps are tucked away in obscure pages and are basically unusable because of lousy resolution; (3) the text just pours out location after location without giving you any idea where the hell this place is - you can only make sense of this \\"guide\\" if you shuffle between it and a google map; (4) \\"navigating\\" the guide itself means essentially \\"flipping\\" pages - which is OK with a printed book, but miserable with an electronic one; (5) you can't copy even a couple of words, for instance, to paste a name/location into a search line; (6) search returns all (!) instances of the word without discrimination - good luck trying to figure out which of them just mentions it and which actually gives more detail about the place.Summary: shoddy piece of work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this a ballet or a stage play?","review":"I ask this because it was so horrible that I couldn't finish watching it and tried to not once but twice! I got through the first 40 minutes and there was more acting than there was dancing. the performance was filmed for TV, and done at weird angles. The characters were almost scary in there clown makeup and the little bit of dancing there was was mediocre at best. The part of cinderella was done by a dancer who looked almost past her prime and again there was more \\"acting\\" than dancing. I use the word acting loosely. I got this from Netflix, so I'm glad I didn't waste my money on this horrific version of cinderella.Personally, I like my ballets to be in front of an audience without any \\"special effects\\" added for TV viewing and I like my ballerinas to actually dance, not go around pinching Cinderella the first 1/2 of the production. If you want to be sure for yourself, rent it first before you buy. You will disappointed if you waste your money on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not A Good Buy","review":"First, this is indeed a Kirov production so why the front cover says Bolshoi is weird. It is not filmed in front of an audience and someone thought to \\"enhance\\" the performance with special effects which are awful. They distract from the dance and are very irritating. The performances aren't that good overall and the whole thing is not up to Kirov standards."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scandalous Junk","review":"This is junk. It looks like someone camcorded it off of a television, copied it 1,000 times and then transferred it to a DVD. It would be one thing if it sold for $3.00, but it doesn't. The recorded sound actually isn't bad, but the acting is so absurd you laugh."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is Kirov, not Bolshoi production","review":"This is the Kirov film made for TV.

Heats quickly on just a medium setting, and I love using this pan primarily for making hot chocolate.

Just the right weight for solid cooking and easy to clean."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Product","review":"I purchased this pan to use for boiling pasta and cooking vegetables. I was attracted to the pour and strain feature which I had not seen in any other pan I researched. On the day I received the pan, I used it to boil pasta and to cook frozen spinach. The pour and strain feature was wonderful, and the lid of the pan allows you to choose between two sizes of drain holes. The only thing I don't like about the pan is that it takes a while for water to heat to boiling. Otherwise, it is a very attractive and functional product. I'll probably buy the two quart size as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"too thin of sides","review":"After lots of looking I chose this saucepan. It's deep and the right size for my family. I had just thrown out 2 saucepans purchased from a department store that lasted under a year. I got this one with high hopes, the bottom is thick as you can see, but the sides are incredibly thin. I have a gas stove, and even with the gas as low as it will go (only touching an inner diameter of 3 inches) the food that is touching the sides burns and sticks to the edges. That's with no flame even near the sides. If I was using it as a frying pan it might work, but I want to make sauce in it. I have tried stirring more frequently (which wouldn't be a great solution since I have little kids), I've tried various heat setting, and I've even sprayed cooking oil on the sides of the saucepan. It doesn't help. The sides are TOO THIN! I have a $25 pot from Target that is better than this. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment","review":"I was excited to receive my pan, which actually was months ago. Unfortunately the excitement ended when I tried to use it for pasta. I heated the water and as soon as it boiled, I threw in the pasta. ARGH! The water exploded out of the pan all over my cook top almost scalding me. This happened more than once. I phoned Cuisinart and the customer service rep. told me I had heated it on too high heat. Well I turned the heat down and it still happened, but not quite so forcefully. I hardly use the pan now since I am afraid of being burned and it takes so long to heat the water on a low heat. What is in the metal anyway that makes the water explode out of the pan like that?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the serious cook.","review":"This pan, though from a reputable company, is an under-performing pan. It takes forever to get water to boil, and the small bottom makes it useless on my large gas burner. Why I really am not happy with the pan is that i can not cook rice in it. The lid does not seal because Cuisinart decided to put a pour spout on it. This spout, in my opinion, ruins the pan. If you are serious about cooking, I do not recommend this pan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not 18/10!","review":"As the customer service rep from cuisinart described it, this is \\"100% stainless\\" meaning it is very low quality steel, highly prone to rust, and certainly not worth $50."},{"rating":"1","title":"Developed stains after one use","review":"I bought this pan and at first it came scratched and with a little bump.

I waited to buy this one for such a long time because friends said do not do it. They said what I am going to say below.To see this after the wonderful Secret World Live DVD is just too depressing. Peter has aged 30 years in the short 10 year span this was made since the SW DVD. The whole first half of the show is SLOW and boring and it finally picks up at Solisbury Hill. However, it is short lived. He just looks terrible. I am not sure if he had health issues, but this is far too depressing to watch and he does not play many hits in this show. He plods along, barely able to move. Such a far cry from his Secret World Tour which I saw in person and on DVD and is FANTASTIC. Buy that one. Don't waste money on this one. Not worth it. So sad.

Pete sings a full list of classics and almost every song has its own unique stage arrangement. It's as if the stage is a transformer, constantly moving to help tell the story that is \\"Growing Up\\". Yes, there are some scenes that were spliced together kinda funny (filmed over two nights, and used the best footage), but I don't think that takes away from the show in any way. A great buy for any one who appreciates Peter Gabriel's pure brilliance. He is a true entertainer; constantly working the crowd which makes the time spent watching this show that much richer.

If you need an introduction, buy it.Like the song says, What a show!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Get Secret World instead","review":"Bought this thinking that the music off of the newest cd would be better live...Wrong! The only good things about this video were, obviously Tony Levin, but then all of the props Pete was using throughout the concert. The new drummer is the most boring guy to watch since Peter Criss...Although, his old stuff with KISS was fairly exciting...but this guy butchers classic songs. Then theres the fact that Pete also got rid of his old keyboardist - again. Now its a boring woman with no real show of talent. Pete also brought his daughter along, but she can get kind of annoying at times. Overall, if you liked UP, get this DVD; if you prefer classic Pete stuff, avoid this DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!! what a Concert","review":"I grew up loving Peter Gabriel, Sadly enough I never had a chance to see him live.

I turned around and bought his Secret World tour DVD the minute i finished watching it. I didnt care to much for the camera shots from under the stage but overall its well worth the money.

They also followed him around with a camera. Very creepy. Peter looked like he went to a Star Wars garage sale and layered on his purchases.His entrance was very undramatic and not like him at all. It worked alright just not what I expected. His voice was stressed and he looked very uninterested in being there. The studio overdubbing of the vocals was too much.

It helps when there is a decent script, based on a David Mamet play, to work with. The film explores the genesis of a relationship from the first blossom of love to it's ultimate breakup to a possible reconciliation. The film examines the forces that immolate a relationship from within and from the outside. The outside forces that scuttle Lowe and Moore's relationship are excellently represented by Jim Belushi and Elizabeth Perkins whose rationales are less than altruistic. This film is timeless because it's themes exist outside the culture of the Eighties."},{"rating":"1","title":"MAYBE A BAD COPY","review":"I got my Blu-Ray copy from Columbia House. I don't know if that makes a difference or not. The English Dolby TrueHD track does not read well. It reads between 1.1 and 2.0 Mbps when I should get a reading of about 1.9 Kpbs. Only the Spanish Dolby Digital 5.1 track gives me a good reading. The French and Portuguese tracks are off as well. Even my A/V receiver reads Pro Logic instead of Dolby Digital with this disc. Could it be a fluke or did whoever authored this disc totally screw up? The movie itself is fine, but the technology on this particular DVD sucks."},{"rating":"2","title":"An honest look at relationships!!","review":"If there is any movie that realisticly portrays relationships, it is this one, Rob Lowe & Demi Moore are very believable as lovers who decide to live together in the hopes that they will live a long & happy life, but the perils of living together are explored very deeply here, as with any couple there are problems, past relationships,disapproving friends,adjusting to each other's habits, it is all here & anyone who has lived with anyone will see the realism of this film, if you have not ever lived with your boyfriend or girlfriend this film will seem off balance, this is the perfect film for anyone who might be thinking of moving in with their lover or anyone who has second thoughts, highly recommended!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"dated","review":"we've definitely progressed if what passed for comedy in the 80s (james belushi's character and dialogue) now just sounds sexist and offensive."},{"rating":"1","title":"About Last Night","review":"The product was not in good condition when received. In fact the front case was cracked and the DVD itself had 3 scratches on it.The movie was the worst movie I have ever seen.Poor scriptPoor actingPoor plotPoor settingPoor musicNo real story to the movie.Bubble gum acting from Demi Moore & Rob Lowe. Both cannot act to save their lives.I fell asleep when watching certain parts of the movie. Very unrealistic movie.You cannot relate anything that happened in the movie to real life.There was no romantic parts to the movie.Most boring movie ever watched.Anyone who likes this movie has serious problems with their mental state.The producers should be embrassed by their efforts.

Rob Lowe & Demi Moore just gave their dedication in this movie about love and understanding, relationships and commitments. Great body chemistry of the couple. Whewww! Some hot dish that Rob & Demi. The movie stirs so many emotions which makes it entertaining, not boring. When Rob & Demi are not making love, James Belushi and Elizabeth Perkins, both good friends of the couple, fills in the gap with their sarcastic humor. Nonetheless, the movie is great for young couples to draw close with their partners. The DVD is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chicago and romance","review":"This movie is one of my favorites. It stands against the Blues Brothers as a movie where the city of Chicago is actually a character in the film. Moreover, one of the songs from the movie says that falling in love is easy, but staying in love is hard. Sorry, I can't remember which song, and that is paraphrasing, but that is what this film is all about to me. If you've ever fallen in love and then had some hard times trying to keep it going, this film is for you. I agree with the other reviewers that said that what makes this work is the chemisty and acting ability of Rob Lowe and Demi Moore, while Jim Belushi and Elizabeth Perkins have characters that keep it funny and keep the perspective of how your friends add or subtract to any relationship you might be in. I think this movie is for anyone who has ever been in a relationship that worked or didn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"good stuff","review":"'About Last Night..' is by far one of the best movies I have ever seen. It has a bit of an eighties touch and a little TOO much nudity but, other than that this movie is awesome. Rob Lowe looks sexy and acts his best, and Demi Moore is just beautiful in this movie.It takes place in Chicago and two singles Debbie and Danny, have a one night stand. They move in together and try to make a sexual relationship into a romantic one, will it work out? HMM.. I highly reccomend this movie, especially if you are a Rob Lowe fan(you see a lot of his @ss)."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazingggg!","review":"Have nothing else to do or trying to find a good DVD to watch?

It should be noted that he avoided using the loaded term \\"most important\\" and instead used \\"most influential.\\" Obviously, the first term is quite subjective, i.e., Christians would prefer to rank Jesus as #1, and atheists may prefer a scientist such as Einstein.

I knew on my third or fourth read that I had to have this book. I have probably read this book and or referencedn it in some very delightful conversations with friends as well as family. Our 4 children, 18,15,11,9 have all found occasion to brainstorm on the rankings, and of course no one ever agrees on the rankings or the influence. I loaned this book to an acquaintance who loved to quote benjamin disraeli and buckminster fuller, I haven't seen the book since--which is ok, because a book that can spark that much discussion in such a positive manner or encourage us to seek more info deserves its own place on a 100 most influential....thanks Mr. Hart."},{"rating":"2","title":"it is really useful","review":"first of all, i want to say about that book it was really realistic.When i got this book i was expecting not good enough but the author searched of these people so much than me.

Rename the book as: \\"The 100: A Ranking Of The Most Influential Persons In WESTERN History\\", or2. Gather a commission of world historians to establish an objective list.We know that \\"History is written by the winners\\" and Hart's book is just a reminder of Alex Haley's quote."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very quick tour through some interesting lives","review":"The utility you derive from reading this book depends upon what you expect to get out of it to begin with. I was not particularly interested in the ranking itself, since quantifying and comparing the relative influence on the world of, say, a philosopher vs a scientist vs a religious leader vs a politician, seems to me a rather foolish (if not pedantic) excercise to begin with. However, I did enjoy reading this book for its \\"other\\" content, the brief biographies of people whom, irrespective of their relative impact on the world, led darn interesting lives. It's a classical 90's book (although its first edition appeared in the 70's): compressed information designed to give you just the minimum necessary to avoid looking like a fool if involved in a semi-intelligent conversation. When somebody talks to you about, say, Mohammed or Guttenberg or Newton (or some other, more obscure fellas), you'll at least have a couple of neat data bits to carry on."},{"rating":"1","title":"JFK and not Lincoln and FDR?","review":"It would help if such a historical list were written by a historian. Mr. Hart's degrees are in science, and his bias toward scientists in the list is overwhelming. He lists JFK because of his starting the mission to the moon. Certainly Lincoln, FDR, Teddy Roosevelt, Truman, and Reagan would rank as more influential U.S. presidents. And Madison as Father of the Constitution and the U.S. government has certainly had significant and long-lasting influence given the number of democracies in the world today. The effort to create such a list is certainly interesting, everyone will have different opinions, and the discussion promotes historical learning which is in such short supply today. But it would be better for an accomplished historian to create such a list rather than an author so taken up with scientific efforts to the detriment of other areas of human achievement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book.....but JFK????","review":"My wife and I are really diggin' this book. Thank God the author did not write any more than he did about those old Chinese dudes or the chemists and scientists. 4 pages is enough for me regarding those boring guys. The writer does a great job supporting his reasoning for the ranking and stuff but I was really puzzled when JFK popped up. You gotta be kidding me? JFK? He got it for putting a man on the moon. Hey author dude!!! JFK basically just cut the check. Throw a bone to the guy that invented the multi-stage rocket in the 1920s? He is the one that got the ball rolling. The space race was huge (satillite tv, gps, etc...) but the MAN ON THE MOON????...so what!

But I question the exclusion from this list of James Watson and Francis Crick (and maybe Franklin and Wilkins), who discovered the structure of DNA and the way it codes for genetic information. Surely their discovery has had a large impact on history in just a short time, more so than that individuals like JFK and Mao. Other than that, I'm very tempted to buy a copy anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blasphemy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I am appalled. Mr. Harts (If that is indeed is real name) book is a poorly researched load of tripe.

It is dark brown with some orange-brown strands thrown in for variation.3. IMHO, it doesn't look well with black clothes as the color is much too flat to look natural and therefore clashes.4.

Their attitude and personal lifestyle formed a faithful following, \\"Straight Edge\\" being an anthem for clean lifestyle.

Not to mention the actual genesis of EMO given that the seed planted here sprouted into Fugazi by way of Rites Of Spring. Pick your movement. Classify your soul. I don't care. Fight amongst yourselves. Clearly Ian WAS screaming at a wall. At any rate, this collection (red or blue) was the template for the DC Hardcore scene of the late eighties. For good reason too, the songs are short furious blasts of self-righteous indignation. Well-crafted gems of rage. In a scene over-run by drugs, anonymous sex, & mindless violence Minor Threat asked some tough questions...and did so with ten times the fury of their peers. Aside fom the youthful ignorance of \\"Guilty For Being White\\" this is weighty stuff. Shockingly honest. Angst to be sure but insightful & brave.This CD is a must-have.Their influence runs deep.

On a whim, I decided to upgrade to this. I don't have audiophile ears so I haven't noticed a significant change. We're not talking about the remaster of Raw Power here. The main differences really are the cover (blue instead of red), the CD color (gray instead of red), and the CD insert photo (a live shot from a gig). All the songs seem to have the same punch they had before.

But then a friend of mine introduced me to Minor Threat. By the end of Filler (which is my favorite Minor Threat song to date) I was a convert.

There are much better bands to listen to when it comes to hardcore punk.Saying that though, this is still very good. Ian McKaye, Brian Baker and the rest of them have created an essential hardcore punk album that everyone who enjoys hardcore should hear.

I understand that they are the creators of hardcore, but how did they get that title and not a band where you can actually hear the Hardcore sound (such as Black Flag, Bad Brains).

Minor Threat are one of the bands that owe most of their 'popularity' to their legend and it has clearly proceeded them in this compilation of songs. Corny and sometimes embarassing lyrically and even poorer musically, it only shows they did not have the ability to scrape together any half decent tunes. It was not their forte but I suspect they didn't care. They were so earnest and it's all a bit twee listening to it so many years on ('Straight Edge' in 2005 sounds so blushingly adolescent).

If you like punk-ish stuff but want a band that actaully has talent check out early Thrice (new thrice is good to, but its more emo)."},{"rating":"1","title":"It isn't about the name MacKaye","review":"Basically if you're a fugazi nut stay away.If you like music stay away.If you're anti MTV but perversely buy music on Amazon - buy it.I could do this type of tosh if I had my eyes shut.

I would argue that Minor Threat was the best 80's hardcore punk band, outshining their contemporaries like Black Flag and Youth of Today by a decent margin. The music, aided by Fugazi's unrelenting idealism and straight edge ethos, is uncompromising and distilled. Punk doesn't come anymore pure or potent than this. This is the real deal as opposed to the [stuff] that populated MTV and the airwaves during the \\"alternative\\" 90's."},{"rating":"2","title":"File under \\"hardcore\\", dictionary definition","review":"Leaving nothing out, this album shows Minor Threat's first several minute-long three-chords and a shout songs. The best examples are \\"Straight Edge\\", \\"In My Eyes\\", and \\"Stand Up\\". About halfway through, the songs expand to 2 minutes, but loose little of their punch. I like the humor shown in \\"Cashing In\\", and the cover song \\"Good Guys\\" (by the Standells) is another very good one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sincerity that never gets pompous","review":"The sound of a kid in the basement screaming upstairs that his parents and siblings are full of it and eventually getting them to believe it. There's no excuse for not owning this. The song \\"Minor Threat\\" alone is worth the meager price tag and is one of the finest rock songs ever recorded by anyone, ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"You don't have this yet?","review":"Man, this is awesome. These guys were filled with a lot of adrenaline and energy, but they could write songs really well at the same time. It's too bad I was too young when these guys were around, otherwise I would have loved to see them live. I can't say much other than this is one of the best CDs I have, not to mention one of the best ones I've ever heard."},{"rating":"2","title":"straight edge brilliance","review":"Ian Mackaye and the boys deliver one of the best albums to have come out in the 80s punk scene. Think about it, in a time where most bands were singing \\"hungry like the wolf\\" they were talking about individualism, fighting the desire to conform to the assimilating establishment--an idea lost on many new and upcoming punk bands. Labelled as straight edge and not your typical lager lout, debauchery-loving guys this album is more of a tribute to ideals than to the pervading mediocrity of so many \\"punk\\" bands (read:Blink 182,Green Day, Offspring). Songs like: I Don't Wanna Hear It, In My Eyes, Out of Step instills that wrathful energy that only punk can saturate in your psyche. This is one of the remaining compilations left of a band whose influence sustained and took our music into a totally intellectual sphere. Piercings and tatooes don't make you punk kids, your brain does."},{"rating":"2","title":"Out of Step? Think Again.","review":"Like everyone else who has reviewed this album, I MUST give it a 5-star rating. Why? Because, to my mind, Minor Threat defines punk rock in a way that very few bands ever have...the Sex Pistols and Dead Kennedys being exceptions to that statement. Ian MacKaye's vocals are raw and primal, jamming whole phrases and occasionally entire sentences into two or three syllables. His honesty is apparent...even blatent. The lyrics are socio-political hardcore punk at its best, and they point us to a place where the soul of punk rock resides. Please...I urge any and all members of the human race to buy this album, or at least listen to it. And don't worry about Ian's unique vocal style obscuring the message...a lyric sheet IS included."},{"rating":"2","title":"a 180 degree turn from the usual jean claude movie","review":"This movie starts of very slowly and some what confusing. But the second half of the movie is great. It's like a client eastwood western but with a motorcycle instead of a horses. i don't want to spoil the movie but it about a man eddie(jean-claude) wants to take the journey(death). but wants to get his war friends permission so they can both take the journey. Eddie is giving his friend a gift and it gets stolen, along with his 45m. Then gets back these items along with bringing joy to the town in an unusual way. this movie is a great movie with odd ball characters and i do mean odd ball characters. its a mix between a western, boogie nights, and a jean claude film. all these add up to a great film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Van Damme fans only...","review":"I struggle with this movie. I'm a die-hard fan of Jean-Claude Van Damme, so part of me really likes this movie. But the other part knows that this is a very subpar direct-to-video with a slow script, uninteresting characters, and horrendously bad acting (save for JCVD himself). Having said this, I can honestly reccomend it to fans of Van Damme. They will certainly have a good time watching the muscles from Brussles kick the tar out of some low-life hicks while drinking with his Indian buddy and pickin' up chicks.

The movie does have action. Pretty much this film takes place in a desert, but it is nice. Jean Claude Van Damme's acting is awesome. The women actresses in the movie are really nice looking.

THIS IS A MOVIE THAT DOESN'T EVEN DESERVE TO BE IN STORES. THIS DEFINITELY AIN'T WORTH ONE CENT OF ITS PRICE. IF YOU ARE A VAN DAMME FAN, DO NOT WASTE YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY ON THIS MOVIE.

A funny Indian man (Danny Trejo) helps Van Damme get revenge on the hillbillies that stole his motorcycle. While recovering, the funny Indian man compares Van Damme's genitals to the size of a coyote's. It was a hilarious moment. When Van Damme is fully recovered, he makes his way to town to get his bike back, but he runs into old people, prostitutes and Mr. Miyagi (yes, Daniel-san's master, pure genius). Of course this movie was made by a genius who also showed Van Damme's true acting and his taste for a good pie.

In this book, Laclau continues his elaboration on how do to politics in face of fragmented social struggles. Laclau's essays on universalism and particularism offers an important contribution to understand the various groups that struggle for identification of their rights. There is an introduction of linguistic term of \`empty signifier', that plays an important role to the world of politics. He also includes a critical assessment of Rorty's notion of Liberalism and comments on Derrida's work.

This has gotta be one of the most excruciating CDs to listen to in my collection. While being a big fan of a lot of the stuff Dischord Records has put out,Ignition epitomizes for me the downhill slump much of punk rock underwent in the mid to late 80's. The music lacks pace and punch, the lyrics are embarassingly preachy, and the whole affair has a dour air to it. Granted, there are a few songs on here - \\"Anger Means\\", their cover of the Vibrators' \\"Keep it Clean\\", and a coupla more -that even Alec's voice can't completely decimate, but it's not enough to recommend this to anyone other than diehard Dischord completists. Hard to believe bassist Chris Thomson went on from this (mostly) dismal affair to front such amazing bands as Circus Lupus, Las Mordidas, Monorchid and Skull Kontrol. Check out those bands!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay at best","review":"The species covered in this book are, for the most part, covered well with decent images, but this book doesnt even really begin to cover enough species. It leaves out several common non-edible and edible species that regularly occur in the region with abundance. At most I'd say its a lack-luster book that is easily passed up and easily done without. It is true that with mushrooms its best to have several resources, but there are other books that cover the subject more broadly and efficiently."},{"rating":"1","title":"i was insulted by this book","review":"while this book is a conveinient, easy to use, easy to carry field guide, the author seems to assume the reader is an idiot. it is almost as if he is purposefully withholding information. he reccomends the \\"old man of the woods\\", frankly a bad tasting mushroom, as an edible simply because it is easy to recognize. similarly he discourages eating/does not mention good edibles whenever he feels that the reader may be too stupid to avoid confusing them with other mushrooms. the book does not describe many species either. mushrooms of west virginia and the central appalachians is a much better regional guide, and mushrooms demystified is the best overall in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not, under any circumstances, buy this book.","review":"This book misses one edible mushroom in particular that is of great interest to amateur hunters. Grifola frondosa is one of the world's best edibles and can grow to huge size. I am very surprised that an author with such prestigious honors missed it (although he did find a similar mushroom in the same group, the non-edible \\"Berekley's Polypore\\"). Grifola frondosa is common and widespread, and grows up to a huge size. To write about each of these other mushrooms, and not to have at least walked onto frondosa, is impossible. I suggest the Audubon guide, although the pictures aren't as nice, the black and white plates in the back can help identify the shape of a mushroom more clearly. To make up for the keys in this book, it is easy to scrounge around the net. (Keys help identify mushrooms even if you have no idea what they are.)

I've seen some bad reviews but the game does not deserve some of the poor reviews it has received. The game is loads of fun with good character development and an interesting story line. The primary frustration comes because there are so many places where you have to accomplish certain tasks in order to proceed to a new area or new level in the game. In addition, the lack of a good map or journal in the game means you are lost a good portion of the time. The first person fighting is great and as you develop your character their are many ways to fight the numerous different types of enemies you encounter. If the developers had thrown in a few more interesting NPC's and had them explaining your path forward better, I would have given this game 5 stars.

Very.The plot is predictable, and there isn't a smile, let alone a laugh in the whole of the film, billed as a \\"black comedy.\\" Indeed, the movie hasn't a single redeeming feature. The music is irritating, and even the photography isn't very well done. Oh yes, and Rigg was 25 years too old to play the part she was given. See her in bed with a man easily old enough to be her son. Mercifully, we were spared a nude scene.

(I did update Quicken 2004 to the latest build, but it's still not ready for primetime.) The bugs were annoying but not catastrophic, like hidden accounts not staying hidden or windows not drawing properly. It froze at one point when I tried to access the help file, but I didn't lose any data. And my system is ordinarily very stable. But I'm not confident that my data would be safe. I've never returned software before, but I think I'm going to send this back to Intuit."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor software, easy decision to finally switch","review":"Purchased, was disappointed, and requested a refund.I quickly discovered no compelling features, and poor support for multiple currency accounts (can't see dollar accounts and foreign currency accounts at the same time--something that has been unchanged at least since Quicken 99.)

But if I back date my computer to 12/31/2003 it opens just fine. I spent some time with the chat support and they told me that I will have to use Quicken's disaster recovery service, $200.00 and 10 days-yea right. It's too bad because since I upgraded I spent about 40 hours entering in Budget and Plan data which will now have to be reentered. My only hope is to use my backup and go to 2003 and take a good look at going to Money. Intuit really screwed this one up and their support has been even worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not upgrade!","review":"I consider myself to be a Quicken \\"power user\\" and have been since 1991. Quicken Premier 2004 is awful. I just upgraded from 2002 Deluxe (skipped 2003). My PC has a Pentium 3, 1 gig speed, 256k memory. It's not enough to run this product. The program is such a memory hog that the PC locks up continually. I need to open the Task Manager, close everything that is running in the background, and can have no other apps open in order to work in Quicken. The changes to the interface in the securities accounts are drastic, unnecessary and not user friendly. Entering securities transactions is much more troublesome. You can't hide the Quicktabs bar anymore, thereby losing a lot of screen space. My custom toolbar is gone and you can no longer create custom icons for the toolbar. To recap, too much of a resource hog, no longer user friendly (and I am a CPA) and less available customization.

It installed OK, but I couldn't open any data files from the old system, and to top it off, my computer basically blew. I'm going to have to reinstall everything. Call it a coincidence, but I'd had no computer problems whatsoever before loading the Quicken CD-ROM.

If you're happy with your existing version of Quicken, don't upgrade to 2004. It really is bug ridden, just like many people have commented. Intuit seems to have focused on new on-line features and broke basic functionality. I regret upgrading to Quicken 2004 but it's too late for me to do anything about it. Maybe I'll try MS Money.

Quicken has decided, arbitrarily, to reduce the input screen, put banner-type ads on the bottom, and in general, not allow you to determine the look or functionality of the program. Plus, in importing my data from 2000, I found several errors that I had to manually fix. Who knows what else is lurking in there. My advice, don't upgrade.

The situation of Nat and his family is shown well because you just see Nat's point of view and so you know how he sees that crazy situation of having millions of birds attack his family. You can feel the danger of the bird attacks and the fear and the helpness of the whole population.I think the story isn't very difficult to understand. It's written in an easy English. Alfred Hitchcock took the idea of the birds' attacks from Du Maurier and made a great film out of it. But the story is very different from the book - only the bird's attack ia still the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timeless","review":"I think the book birds von Daphne du Maurier is a good short novel. It's a little bit short, but that is not really bad. Because of the shortness, the book can't become boring.I like that the story is mysterious. The attack from the birds isinexplicable. It's not the usual behaviour of birds. But in spite of them, the story is believable, because the attack is possible. The birds are able to kill a woman or a man. If the animals were worms or something else, then story would be unbelievable and stupid.Another thing I like is the relation from the birds and the nature. The birds stand in this book for all nature disaster. It's just an other representation. I think it's a ingenious representaion.The book is timeless. Daphne du Maurier wrote this book brief after the second world war. It also have a relation to the war. And today the book get read again and again. In some years the book will probably be as popular as now."},{"rating":"1","title":"This review is for the audio version.","review":"I absolutely love the story \\"The Birds\\" and was so excited when I found there was an audio CD version of it. Little did I know this version wasn't an unabridged reading--not even an abridged reading, it was rubbish that was painful to the ears.In this audio version there about 4 or 5 people, some male, some female, and after every sentence one of them read, overlapping the other. So it goes something like this:Guy: [The guy sat there looking at the birds]Now, as soon as he started saying \\"birds\\" a female would kick in with the next sentence.Female: [the birds were acting strange]then another guythen somebody elseTHE WHOLE WAY THROUGH!It was so bad, after listening to less than 2 minutes of it, I packed it up, and sent it back.

Having bought a number of excellent opera and classical DVDs in the past from this label, Arthaus Musik (including Marriage of Figaro and Mahler's 5th Symphony), I thought this would be another DVD produced in high-quality sound. I could not have been more wrong. The audio track is patchy and muffled throughout, and it even skips in a couple of key spots. It is incredibly aggravating to listen to if you like to listen to the music closely.This performance from the early 1990s is actually quite good -- James Conlon conducts with verve, Carol Vaness (here in her prime) sings Donna Elvira brilliantly, and Thomas Allen is still a commanding Don Giovanni (though he looks and sounds noticeably older here than he did in the La Scala performance conducted by Riccardo Muti, also available on DVD). Unfortunately, the truly horrible sound destroys any enjoyment one might derive from this performance. Buyer beware."},{"rating":"2","title":"Karajon version still the best!","review":"This production of Don Giovanni is recommended, but I still prefer the Karajon version as a whole. Everyone has their favorite singers and that will always enter into one's opinion. But the Final Scene in Conlon's version simply does not hold up to my expectations.

These taste ok, although they're definitely on the sweet side, and fortunately they don't crumble if you carry them in your purse.I suppose it was foolish to think these would provide the same nutrients as my 6/day, food-based prenatal vitamins, but I just saw the phrase \\"all the supplemental nutrients needed\\" and made that assumption. These do provide all the folate, B6, and iron you need, but there are lots of other helpful nutrients that are not included, or that only give you part of the RDA.Overall, this is a helpful tool in the prenatal regimen, but it doesn't account for all your nutritional needs.

I've got one thing to say about this CD: if you like older music like Dick Dale and Dusty Springfield, then you will want this soundtrack and like it. If you want modern music that was inspired by the movie, you're not gonna get it. A bonus of this CD is the inclusion of some of the best dialogue from the movie except the first bit of dialogue which wasn't necessary.

It catches the spirit of Tarantino's amazing movie but also stands alone as a piece of musical craftsmanship. The music, while often radically different on paper, blends together seamlessly, perhaps helped by Tarantino's selection of the very best dialogue. No-one will forget Dale's masterpiece opening sequence 'Misorlou'. The only weak song, 'Jungle Boogie', is fully compensated by such songs as 'Son of a Preacher Man' and 'If Love is a Red Dress'.

The soundtracks to Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction follow-up, Jackie Brown, and Guy Ritchie's Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels follow the same M.O., but this is the pick of the litter.Favorite tracks include Dick Dale's surf classic, \\"Miserlou\\" (now inextricably linked with the film), Kool and the Gang's \\"Jungle Boogie\\" (\\"Get down, get down\\") and Dusty Springfield's \\"Ode to Bobby Joe\\"-ish, \\"Son of a Preacher Man\\" (originally written for Aretha Franklin and later recorded by The Diva after she heard Ms. Springfield's slinky \\"Dusty in Memphis\\" take on the tune).The soundtrack may even be better than the movie, which is saying a lot.

Tarantino has done an amazing job in this soundtrack.Even though I'm not much of a fan of music from the 50s, 60s and 70s, this soundtrack just made me love nearly every single song in it. The best songs are: Let's Stay Together, Lonesome Town, Son Of A Preacher Man, You Never Can Tell, Girl You'll Be A Woman Soon and Flowers On The Wall - all of them magnific songs. Not to mention the dialogues and the instrumental music - Misirlou and Surf Riders are movie classics.Overall, this is a CD everyone should own. Soundtrack collectors, music fans... Everyone.

It's completely nuts.

Probably the first punk band to really expirement around with guitar feedback. They also played a real chaotic style with wrenching vocals that made them stand out on their own in the early DC hardcore scene. on some songs they sound shriller and thrashier, and I think that can be attributed to the fact they were drunker on one of the recording sessions (they were infamous for the drunken mayhem of their shows, I guess that is another thing that made them unique in a scene where being sXe was the norm.) Just some good solid and unique hardcore coming from the Void on this cd...As for the Faith, they are OKAY... The first stuff on the album is from their side of a split they did with the Void.

I used to be a dedicated supporter of Russell Mulcahy due to his excellent work in Highlander (I was able to pretend the sequels didn't exist). I understood that he was something of a hack, aping the Scott brothers' best work. As I get older, it bugs me more because I notice upon rewatching Mulcahy films that it takes more than smoke to bring life to the Scotts' images. RESURECTION sees Mulcahy move his aping to then fresh talent, David Fincher. RESURRECTION isn't meant to be a really good film. Meant to be entertaining and to be as close to a remake of SEVEN as legally possible.

I called up quicken and can't get through.

Ninety minutes into a frustrating web-based \\"support chat,\\" the man said he wasn't trained to help me with the problem. I asked for another person to \\"chat\\" with, who suggested I manually enter the missing transactions. When I pointed out that I had 13 years worth of data in 21 accounts amounting to 20,000 transactions, they suggested I pay them $130 to convert the data for me. Pshaw.

Intuit has not been kind to their Apple userbase in recent years. I was glad to find that data transfer from Windows was not a huge problem (I had read the horror stories.) Day-to-day use, though, has been far from pleasurable. The user interface is horrible; for starters it doesn't even remember window positions when I re-open the program. Seemingly basic graphs come up with no data; attempting to download transactions results in errors every time. (Not my bank's fault... works fine on Windows.) And, to top things off, the program crashes 8 times out of 10 when I use it.I never thought I'd say it, but I wish MS would port Money to the Mac or that someone else would step up.

I'm running Jaguar on a G4 and had been using Quicken 98 in Classic mode with no problems, same as I had done in OS 9. I figured the 2004 version had to be even better, plus it seemed to be a no-brainer to run in native OS X mode. Wrong. 2004 crashes constantly, especially when reconciling. It doesn't *seem* to have corrupted my data yet (that I can see, at least) but the crashing alone is totally unacceptable--especially for a personal finance package that's tracking your money.

Even then, the program failed to carry over all the info and I had to spend hours trying to find out what was missing. I finally gave up and did a reconciling adjustment. Since then, everything has worked well, but the interface is pretty bad compared to Windows. But, what are the alternatives?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away from Quicken","review":"For 7-8 years I have struggled with Quicken for Mac.

I got a little nervous when I read the bad reviews listed on this site. But you should not be nervous! All my data transferred instantly and Quicken 2004 works beautifully without any glitches. In my years of owning Quicken products I've never had to call customer support so it doesn't bother me that they charge by the minute. Most of these other Quicken users probably have problems with their operating systems and other glitches. The only time quicken didn't work right was when I had bugs in the system software.

Even with more than enough memory allocated, the program crashes randomly when entering data. It's slower than any previous version and has very poor help on Intuit's website.Unless Quicken can put out some fixes, they've lost one more customer because of this poor quality.This software hardly rates even one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not purchase if using Mac OS X 10.3","review":"Although it looks nice, it still doesn't have the same features as the windows version. A common problem for those of us with Panther, is that Quicken keeps unexpectly quitting when you try launching it. The only solution is to reinstall the software package.

This isn't one of Corman's more entertaining cheapies, although it has its moments. The alligator wrestling scene is a high point in the history of bad movies, and the hilariously macho prison girls (including regular Corman leading lady Beverly Garland) inspire a few giggles.The DVD from Brentwood is, unsurprisingly for a bargain-bin disc, unexceptional.

It was supposed to be a comedy, right? It was BORING!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad.","review":"Where do I start... A desperate writer goes into debt to keep a supposed \\"muse\\" living in the lap of luxury. This is from the Danny DeVito school of film making, hideous characters, doing hideous things all of which comes no where close to a black comedy but a drawn out \\"one joke\\" movie. The only person I know that enjoyed this movie has deep emotional problems herself and probably identified with the Sharon Stone character. This is creepy Hollywood at it's worst."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply Awful","review":"This was not the worst movie of all time, but it was bad enough.

The inspiration parts of it really don't work, but it's fun to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Five stars!","review":"I have seen this movie more than ten times (no kidding!!) and just can't get enough of it. What a lovely story. Brooks, Stone and MacDowell are simply brilliant just beautiful in their rolls. I also enjoyed seeing Jeff Bridges again whom I always remember for his superb roll in Starman. Brooks and Stone are just fantastic in the last 5 minutes of the finale. The finale does leave some unresolved questions in my mind but still it is a great movie. If Albert Brooks sets his mind to it, I'm sure he could come up with a sequel. I'll see this movie over and over and never get tired of it. Who said you need all of that vulgar language, sex and violence to make a great movie!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Art Truly Imitates Life","review":"A shining example of how a movie trailer is better than the actual film itself. It's the story of a washed-up film writer on the brink of being edged out of the industry unless he can manage one decent story/script. Albert Brooks MUST have a LOT of friends in the business. I can think of no other explanation for HOW this film got made in the first place. In the best interest of your sanity, avoid spending money on this one. Wait until it shows up on Fox or something."},{"rating":"1","title":"if Albert Brooks is funny, this must be his worst","review":"This is the only Albert Brooks film I've seen, and it's unfair to judge a writer, director, or actor (all three, in this case) on the basis of a single film. That said, I found it extremely difficult to believe that any of this man's films could be funny or enjoyable. The film is unsubtle, badly paced, and silly. The dialogue always falls short of real comic inspiration. Nothing terrible - just consistent mediocrity. Judging from \\"The Muse,\\" Albert Brooks's movies seems to be dull versions of Woody Allen's. This is beginner's-level comedy and not worth anyone's time or money. (A cameo by Steven Wright does provide some comic relief.)NOTE: After seeing Brooks's hilarious performance and improv outtakes on the new \\"Simpsons\\" first-season DVD collection, I have revised my opinion. Clearly he is very funny. But if he is able to make good movies, \\"The Muse\\" is not good evidence."},{"rating":"1","title":"annoying.","review":"I have enjoyed past films of brooks' but found this movie to be boring, unfunny, and sharon stone to be extremely annoying! this movie is a sham i tell you! i laughed at some of brooks' lines, but everytime stone was onscreen i wanted to leave the room! she wasn't a bad actor, but her character was just so annoying and self serving. this movie just annoyed me ...i don't know why i bothered finishing watching it! bad movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrid. Truly horrid.","review":"I really find words to describe it.. What looked like a very cool concept floundered hopelessly in execution. It seems the screenwriter in reality was suffering from the same thing as the screenwriter in the movie - a major shortage of inspiration. And it seems that every actor got the script about five minutes before the film was shot. Charicters deliver truly unbeleiavable lines, with no emotion, over and over - The only good thing about this movie is that it's over quickly. This movie isn't even the type of bad movie that one can enjoy watching with friends and making fun of..Overall, it's just sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lightweight, Boring and Transparent","review":"I had seen previews of this movie, off and on, over the years, and finally got to see it last week. It was a complete disappointment. The movie plot was shallow and disjointed. The dialogue was often pointless. Even the acting lacked inspiration. And, if ANY storyline required some kind of \\"spark\\", it would be a story about a modern-day MUSE. I barely made it through the entire movie, feeling as tho I was being dragged from one boring and transparent scene to the next. I was disappointed with the ending, as well. It wasn't really about the \\"mystical powers\\" of the muse, as much as it was about the sad and uninspired Mr. Brooks. I would not recommend this movie to anyone prefers something intelligent and interesting, be it a comedy or a drama. In my opinion, this movie was a huge waste of money, both in the making of it, as well as the cost to anyone who rents or purchases it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very pleasant, warm film, not without its originality...","review":"I enjoyed this film, but I must say right away that it is not funny as in \\"huh-huh, what a good line/a great joke...huh-huh\\". It is nice, pleasant, at times witty, but not overly funny. The best part of this film is the ending, which I could not have predicted in millions years...Basically, this film is about one Hollywood writer, who is on the verge of mid-life crisis and writer's block, which is the result of the mid-life crisis.Watch this film, even if you could care less about Hollywood writers and their problems. If for nothing else, watch this film to see Sharon Stone being stunningly gorgeous [as always], while constantly changing her amazing wardrobe!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely atrocious","review":"A movie in search of a good script, ironically enough. Well, maybe not so much a good script as a good editor. There is a lot of dead time in this movie between the not particularly funny set pieces. Albert Brooks gives himself some funny lines, Macdowell is atrocious (she's not even trying, for goodness sake), Bridges is almost unused, Stone we are meant to think as some sort of saint, and there we have it. Lumbering from one average, name-dropping set piece to the next for an hour and a half. Hmm. If that's your idea of fun, then be my guest...This is so unfortunate, as there is the glimmer of a good idea here, and at least Brooks and Bridges are such terrific actors, given the right script. If you haven't already done so, give \\"Out of Sight\\" and \\"The Big Lebowski\\" a watch instead....."},{"rating":"2","title":"A-Musing!","review":"Love the way Brooks demonstrates the relative irrelevance of Hollywood scriptwriters. Though it's hard to well and truly sympathize with a character of such financial means and the film does craftily illustrate the vanity and blind willingness to go along with anything that will help them maintain their life of luxury - the Brooks character making it plain that he wants to write big blockbusters in favor of indie films - in order of course, to live the high life. A major plus, though, is that Brooks is free of a persistent and annoying, donkey laugh typified by a certain ubiquitous businessperson."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating reading!","review":"I can't believe that it's taken me so long to discover Ambler. I first read Coffin for Demitrios on a whim (and a little help from Amazon), and The Schirmer Inheritance is the third Ambler book I've read. In relatively short novels, Ambler combines intrigue, vivid detail, political intrigue and complex character development. The Schirmer Inheritance stands out for its historical context, the ongoing and developing tension between the two main protagonists, and Ambler's ability to keep you completely engaged throughout the novel. Think of this book as a series of mouse-traps laid out in a dark room. As you carefully walk across the room, you \\"feel\\" the traps, know that one or more will spring, yet you are drawn to the other side of the room by the power of the story-telling. Great fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another excellent Ambler story","review":"This seems to be less well-known than many of Ambler's other stories, but in my opinion is one of his best. It involves interesting insight into how people survived in the Balkans during WWII - and the dastardly things they did to those who didn't.

I weighed myself the first time and it said I was 15 lbs. lighter than my other scale. That got me worried. I weighed again a minute later, and I was 10 lbs. down from that. Another minute, another 6 lbs. down. So in the span of 3 minutes I apparently lost about 30 lbs.

This song could easily pass as a Zep tune (along with a few other tracks on the album). \\"Most High\\" features Morrocan/Arabic sounds with the special Page/Plant ingredient. Unfortunately, it's an edited version and the one on the album seems much more powerful. This EP also includes a slightly different version of the hard rocking \\"Upon A Golden Horse\\" (gotta listen carefully for the riffs). But the most attractive song is one by the name of \\"The Window\\". The reason being since this song is NOT included in the album, and is only available as the B-side on this EP. So this automatically makes this CD a MUST for all Zep fans! The song itself is not so impressive, and don't blame them for not releasing it on the album, but it makes for a nice collectible & a good addition to the Zep collection.Zeppelin Rules!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album","review":"I have not heard all of Fugazi's albums but from the ones I've heard (Repeater, 13 Songs) this is my favorite. The songs on here are consistantly great and don't get boring. Target is easily my favorite Fugazi song and is a btrilliant song that should be heard by all. The others are all great too especially Long Distance Runner, Do You Like Me, and Version. This is an album you need to check out if you are a fan of rock and sick of the crap that's on the radio."},{"rating":"2","title":"Your eyes, like crashing jets...","review":"For my money, the best of their albums. Everyone goes on about Repeater, and I'm sure it was revolutionary at the time, but this takes everything Repeater was noteworthy for and turns it up a notch. Its the perfect balance of the old and new Fugazi, with elements of their hardcore past being filtered through their newfound love for noise jams, dub and even occasional rock anthems...a kiss-off to the past before they jumped headlong into the more amorphic jam sessions of End Hits and The Argument. You never really know where each song is gonna go.This is the perfect introduction to Fugazi, and you can go earlier or later from here because this really sits on the dividing line. (And don't worry if you buy it and hate it the first couple of times - whether they want to admit it or not, most people hate Fugazi on first listen, even the ones who eventually become their biggest fans. They are certainly an acquired taste.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kickin' album","review":"If you've never heard a fugazi album, this is a great one to start with.Why some people rate it 1 star, then talk about how it is a 3 and a half star is beyond me.

Check this one out and you will..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent album","review":"This is an excellent album. Fugazi has successfully molded their sound into a interesting mixture, resulting in a very diverse album, from the more upbeat and aggressive \\"Bed for the Scraping\\", \\"Target\\", and \\"Downed City\\" to the more laid back \\"Forensic Scene\\" and \\"Fell, Destroyed.\\" The most interesting track is \\"By You\\", which is an interesting experiment in noise rock. Overall a great album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Red Medicine","review":"Red Medicine is the album I personally always over look and forget when it comes to Fugazi's work. But once I do listen I am reminded why this is such a great album.The only gripe is going to be placed right out front, nothing on the album really stands out among the groups canon of music other than a few tracks. Thats not to say the rest is weak or anything because it is anything but.Red Medicine is very riff heavy, which I love about it. Some of the greatest guitar work by the band can be found here on Red Medicine, like 'Bed For The Scraping' and 'Latest Disgrace.' McKaye's lyrics and vocals are some of the best of his carer on Red Medicine. Just give 'Birthday Pony' a listen.Red Medicine is a unique album in the Fugazi canon and one that really has to be heard to appreciated."},{"rating":"2","title":"beauty, beauty, beauty","review":"watch this flick for one reason: eduardo noriega! he has got to be one of the more beautiful men on the planet and his beauty is showcased in this movie. beautiful face, beautiful eyes, beautiful mouth (absolutely stunning smile), beautiful (natural - no nautilus nonsense) body, beautiful penis: the man has inherited ALL the right genes. celebrate masculine pulchritude: watch this flick!"},{"rating":"2","title":"French version of 50 first dates, but less funny","review":"Just kidding, the synopsis made it sound like another 50 first dates, but it wasn't. It was a bit more sophisticated. I haven't seen \\"closer\\" since it's theatrical release. I want to say it's like 50 first dates mixed with closer, but I am not sure. It's one of the films you watch and like, but never get around watching it again for the second time."},{"rating":"1","title":"I find it unreadable","review":"I do not understand why the author is trying to accomplish. He starts with page after page of description of how we should define bourgeois. He misses out the big picture by failing to present any information about standards of living. Instead he goes into pedantic details about what lots of people have said about the matter. And he does not have a personal opinion so he does not conclude, just moves on to the next section. In the end one wonders how this relates to the big theme of the book. The book continues in a similar style. Some people might consider the language learned, but I consider it stilted. Sentences regularly run into five or six lines (and the font size is not big). This is English, not German! The book belongs to another.When I read non-fiction I want to get a clear message from the author and it is also a bonus if I am entertained. In this case I am neither. I give the book two stars because the author has clearly put in a lot of time into producing the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Put Away My Idols/Kingdom in the Street ~Dion","review":"Better than Dion's first.

Dion and his band delivers huge grooves on this album with his great voice to the fore. A rocking yet tender and heartfelt collection. The religious material is trite though heartfelt, but the songs are just so darn good and sung with such conviction and humanity/humility that. though I don't share his religious convictions. I still enjoy this a great deal. Impeccable. And, kudos to the producer & engineer who deliver such a great sounding record - each instrument in the band is perfectly positioned in the mix, and the band sound is tight and rocking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks good on picture but...","review":"I had to return it immediately when I opened the box.

The image is just amazing with strong, rich colours and deep blacks.The film itself plays like a favourite piece of classical music - it just washes over you, gripping you with a vice-like hypnotic hold.Luckily, I haven't experienced any of the problems other reviewers seem to have had. If you're a fan of Euro horror from the 60's you simply have to get this disc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Far from a classic","review":"After reading all of the four and five star reviews I was really looking forward to this forgotten \\"classic\\". I watched the film last night and started to wonder if I saw the same movie everyone else saw.

There were a few creepy moments but there was alot of talky moments as well.

The title sounded good and I have seen James in a number of movies from the 50's (e.g., The Thing, and THEM) so how could I go wrong. Well - the movie starts out slow, drags in the middle, and the prehistoric creatures (a couple of big lizards) don't even show up until the end of the movie.

Where are the dinosaurs? Where is the 'spectacle'. Basically a pseudo western soap opera of the TV kind - that just happens to have James Arness lurking somewhere in the cast (definitely not 'starring'). I tried to give it No Stars - but the system wouldn't let me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Prevents wrist strain","review":"This is a great keypad for anyone who suffers from wrist strain using a regular keyboard for gaming. After 3 weeks of use I have no numbness at all in my left hand, unlike a normal keyboard. I use it under my left hand and rotate it 45 degress clockwise. That creates a very natural position under my hand. The mouse, of-course, stays under the right hand.This keypad will be all you need for non-online games. But, for MMO's you will still need a regular keyboard for things like 'chat' (the WolfKing only has 19 letters of the alphabet). I have it setup with the mouse right, WolfKing center and normal keyboard off to the left.I only gave it 4 stars because the key action is a little coarse and the really big keys (Z,X,C) are slightly uneven.

I have used the online version with my undergraduate and postgraduate students for several years. I have found that they appeal to a wide range of people who laugh at the behaviour of the earnest monk, Boddhi but also comment on the wisdom of the cat. It is good to explore meaning in a way that does not take itself too seriously and is able to cross the boundaries of age and religion. The drawings are good fun and the dialogue is so human that we all can identify with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointment","review":"i love cats and buddhism philosophy so i order this book. i was very disappointed to see the cartoons are black & white and not in colour as i have seen in the site, an the book is very small something like a notebook."},{"rating":"2","title":"Complusive cult reader","review":"This title is some piece of work. Very visual, very graphic... I like that. I've read quite a few writers and usually the action in the story stops at the words on the page, with this book you SEE the violence (and yes it is violent)occuring. It moves pretty fast, not too long but that's a good thing. Too much of it would be just that, too much - it ends right about where it should. I'd have to say I liked it, partly because of the subject matter (sick), partly because of the writing (this guy obviously could give a flying \\"you-know-what\\" about classic literature)- all in all I think this book takes a step in another direction which again is a good thing... now if you ask me in which direction I could not tell you - one more thing I must ad, this book may not be too good for the faint of heart or the squeemish as it is pretty 'in your face'. I give it two thumbs up for being insane - thanx"},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK.","review":"I had numerous problems with trying to run the sample programs, even though they were run directly from the authors web page!

After around 14 days I completed the book and i could start with my work on ASP's. Only thing I found which is bit anoying is the Javescript used. Yes, always you have to use Java at the client side but it was good to know from the book how to do the same with VBScript as it was a book for teaching VBscripts not Javascripts. Any how, I rate it as a good one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this disappointing book","review":"If you are an ASP beginner, \\"Teach Yourself ASP in 24 Hours\\" may be a better start.This book is poorly written. There is some useful code, but the author does a poor job at explaining what the code does. After reading the book you are bound to ask yourself, \\"What on earth did I just learn?\\" The answer: nothing. You will most likely need another book to start all over again."},{"rating":"1","title":"The author fails to explain the codes clearly.","review":"This book is not completely for the beginners. First couple days are still reasonable to understand; however, on the fifth, sixth, and seventh days, it is getting really difficult to understand what the author is trying to do.

I stopped at middle of chapter 2 and could not go on. The author's writing skill and organization skill seems to be very low. Starting from the beginning of the book, the author uses long and unexplained examples. Large part of the book is made of long programs without careful explanation. It seems that the author was too busy to create some clear and simple examples. After all, I had to buy another book. So If you care about your time and money, don't buy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete Garbage!!!","review":"I bought this book to obviously learn how to code Active Server Pages, what I got was a book with too many coding errors. The Author explains in the beginning of the book how some debugging was sacrificed. I went through the first six days, and not one program worked! I am so upset with this book that I want Sanjaya Hettihewa to personally apologize for this \\"book\\", and give me my money back with interest. If I could give this book negative stars, I would. If you learn by doing, this book is an absolute must miss."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typos, typos, typos...","review":"Though Hettihewa is fairly decent at teaching ASP (I was able to grasp the concepts), the number of typos, particularly in his coding examples, made it consistently difficult to figure out what was going on. I kept stopping to try to figure out why a certain snippet of code was written in such a way, only to eventually discover that it was a mistake. Over and over and over again, to the tune of about one significant error per page. A misspelled word here or there would be one thing, but when you're trying to understand code, the devil is in the details, and the devil had a field day here. On top of that, as mentioned in other reviews, is Hettihewa's unreasonable passion for all things Microsoft. I'm no Microsoft basher, but quite frankly, this guy must be getting paid off. All said, you *can* learn ASP from this book, but I would bet there are much better books for the task."},{"rating":"1","title":"I read this book and then threw it away.","review":"\\"Around We Go\\" was one of the worst purchases I have ever made. I must not have read the reviews...when one has to fight with an Author's gramatical errors and unsure story lines, why bother? After I finished this book, I threw it away (into the recycling bin).I did read the entire book...I think out of amazement that a book of this caliber could be not only published, but sold for $18.95(approximately).The only other use I can think for this book is very expensive firewood."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as great as all the unidentified reviews here say","review":"I should have known not to trust all the reviews written here. They raved so much about the book I thought I'd take a chance. No wonder there is no book description, no professional reviews and no excerpt. Don't go on the reviews only. The book is not badly written, but it's not well-written either. Most of the time the characters are like cardboard. There are some good parts, and the plot is all right for a romance, but it tends to be overwritten and full of flowery purple prose. The sex scenes are not erotica but are over the top. Some people like that alot I guess, but I prefer the solid clear writing of authors like Karin Kallmaker, Frankie Jones, LJ Maas, and Saxon Bennett. Sorry to say, there's a good chance you'll be wasting $$ plus postage if you buy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a good cd!","review":"Wow, you gotta buy this if you don't have it already.

I started it but had a friend who was struggling with homosexual tendencies and not having the time to do a thorough read I loan it to him. Now he wants to keep it! He has been sharing step by step amazing strength he's receiving in reading it and that gives me the assurance that as a christian counselor I will definitely find it one of my most effective books ever. The first few chapters I was able to read gave this profound feeling that the reader was speaking directly to someone I knew - and the tone was one that reached out with hope for the struggling.

Needless to say, I learned a lot about myself and why I had homosexual tendencies and thoughts at a young age.This book explains the reasons why people are gay and tend to be drawn to that sin instead of another.It's a very practical and spiritual book that balances out the two very well!! I never had a sexual experience with a man, but understand how that very act can ground you into believing you are infact this very sin.It's very gentle in nature the way it's written. The author really understand the homosexual and the problems they have faced. He himself has seen people come out of this sin never to look back again.I praise God that this information is available. For you sceptics out there I challenge you to read this book with an open heart, honesty to yourself, and a clear mind. You will learn and understand more about homosexuality more than ever before."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Book is a Crock","review":"There is no such thing as curing homosexuality.

He mixes quite interestingly the real life of the islanders and their innate need for selfsufficiency.

I highly recommend it for any lover of mistery and mistique."},{"rating":"2","title":"High-quality spazzy hardcore.","review":"The music on this CD is energetic, quasi-metallic, and thoroughly disjointed: it's great. Funky atonal riffing and acidic, shouted vocals abound. It's rather reminiscent of early Fall albums, and members of this band turned up later in the Monorchid. It suffers from not being as out-there spazzy as their second album, \\"Supergenius\\", but it's worth a listen nonetheless."},{"rating":"1","title":"YUCK!","review":"Very very bad, especially the 2nd story \\"Parlor Games\\", it wasn't sexy or erotic- the couple didn't even like each other - then they loved each other -huh? The other 2 stories were okay, the 3rd being the best because I like highlanders, but it was rushed because it was a short story. This wasn't worth my time."},{"rating":"2","title":"The First and Third are the best.","review":"I enjoyed reading the Jess Michaels story of the madam and Bow Street Runner. I feel the second story was just okay, but not a necessary addition to the anthology. I enjoyed the final story by Julia Templeton. At first I was skeptical about the time travel storyline, but she made it work well in the story. I would like to read more from both authors. Any suggestions?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Third Story Is The Charm","review":"Though I like Jess Michaels, the third story in this anthology, Border Lord, by Julia Templeton, is the charmer. This romance is hot as you-know-what, and witty to boot. I liked it so much I bought it as a single story on Kindle! The first story in the book is slow, and never quite appeals to me. The second story is better, but both are completely overshadowed by Border Lord. This is just my opinion, but I hope it helps."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Textbook","review":"This text is one of the best one out there. I hope that you have a class using this book.

For a rock album there is a huge variety, from the heavy to the light and the implementation of \\"edge\\", everything is to be had on this one. All of the musicians contribute quite a bit the overall effect, and its hard to pay attention to any one of them for too long because the songs do a good job of diverting your attention to the sweet spots. It has a great opening with the proper intent to keep you interested, and a great closing to woe you- the way that a lot of albums do; very catchy stuff here."},{"rating":"2","title":"These guys are the BOMB!","review":"Saw these guys in Atlanta and they are smoking hot!

NOU can be writen off for any number of things: their penchant for sophmoric noise, comic-politico stance, overstated haircuts and suits, smarmy didacticism. Yet somehow, they overcame all of that and produced a album thats incendiary, informed and confrontational all at once. A true beam of inspiration."},{"rating":"1","title":"ho-hum","review":"I am reviewing this book because no one else has. I ordered it because I am a sucker for Halloween-themed books.

One of my dogs has become very aware that I add things to her food including vitamins and flea medication. So she will simply scoop out the food with her mouth and examine what she is eating before chewing and swallowing it. Even though she look at it she always eats it. I think they like the oil inside.

Expiration date on the bottle is 06/16 so these are very new and should stay fresh for a while!

A very enjoyable comedy with more than its share of laugh out loud moments."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better Than I Thought, Cheesier Than I Hoped","review":"So this movie is Road Trip meets American Pie, often too close to being American Pie. The beginning scene with the \\"cream\\" filled wash cloth and the condom in the hair, very American Pie-esque. Aside from that and the rarity of having intimate relations with an Amish person, this movie made me laugh and was very enjoyable. Even the cheesiness of the end with the hold up scene.

However coming from Europe were we are used to seeing movies that are much more sexual in content it was prudish and lame. The movie was a copy of 80's movies such as Porkys with the same kind of sex jokes and lame comments. Seth Green played a small roles but was the best and funniest in the movie. Not a terrible movie. Yet not that great. Not recommended. 2 out of 5."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Drive of Fun and Bawdy Entertainment","review":"This film crept under the radar and I caught it on TV found it great fun and so I was prompted to buy the DVD. In the mould of Animal House, Ferris Bueller's Day Off and a whole lot of knock off movies, Sex Drive - the title is a play on words as well as the hormonal heights of teenagers - is a coming of age - road movie. The main character is a naturally charged teenage boy promised a night to remember if he drives to Pheonix (nine hours away) to meet a girl he has fallen for over the internet.The story is of course the trials and tribulations of getting there in his brothers hot rod Pontiac GTO and in the process of going through many tests of character.I wont go into immense detail just suffice to say if you like Animal House, Ferris Bueller, Porky's and all those teen farce movies I can reccomend this it is one of the funniest films I have seen in the last ten years. The inclusion of an ironic Amish character was pure genius."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good the first time around, not so much there after","review":"I thought this movie was hilarious when I first saw it. The second time it was funny and I picked up on a couple of things that I missed. After watching it for three plus times it looses most of its humor and becomes an alright movie. I think that this movie was made explicitly for the 17 to 22 year olds. I think that somone who is older but doesn't mind the humor of the younger adults (17 to 22) then this movie would be a must.Even after watching it multiple times and rewatching it I still find times that I laugh uncontrollabely and would recomend this movie for anyone looking for a good comedy to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"My face hurt!","review":"Laughing at this movie!

It's great to have a 2nd unreleased pre-P Boots (Bootsy Collins) track as well as the previously unreleased tracks by the Ohio Players and Freddie Wilson. What I don't understand is why, for instance, Silky Vincent's Funky World Part 1 appears when Gettin It Off featured Parts 1 & 2. Two other tracks repeat without variation; Donald Austin- Crazy Legs and Bobby Franklin's Insanity- Hit It and Quit It. Also somewhat mainstream tracks from Funkadelic and the Counts could have been replaced with more obscure offerings. Lastly there are at least three tracks on here that just scratch funk and would be better left on a soul compilation. BGP can and has put out better comps than this. Still with nowhere else to get some of these tracks it's an essential buy for funk heads as is the out of print 1993 comp (which by the way bears some of the same flaws)."},{"rating":"2","title":"I need the full game version...","review":"My husband is a die hard Red Sox fan and he was on deployment during the world series... he didn't get to see the games!Does anyone know where I can get a full length copy of the full games (dvd or video)?Many thanks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What does this thing have to do with hockey???","review":"Try it, type \\"hockey\\" under DVD (new search) and this thing will appear on the 3rd or 4th page.Has Amazon lost its marbles, balls or pucks again?Why is it that when you type one thing, it takes you to another?A new selling scheme?Otherwise, this has nothing to do with a sport of finesse, grace, guts, power, skills and speed.. not to mention the coolest sport in the world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sappy.

It may be noted you cannot navigate from main menu all the songs easily; you must use the FF and rewind buttons to fully cue up each song.

I mean, the Police have some great music and great musicians but this is not a great DVD. They spend way too much time showing audience members & some silly drunk guy playing \\"Air Guitar\\" , meanwhile there IS a Guitar player on stage that gets less screen than \\"Air Guitar Guy\\". Also, instead of showing Sting playing bass, they key in to his face most of the concert. Ok, I suppose that is interesting since Sting is a sexy dude, but what's more sexier than seeing a musician play? There are cheesy strobbing effects and \\"trippy\\" highlighting on audience members. The only good thing about this Dvd are the 4 extra tracks with mulit camera option. Why wasn't the concert like these tracks? I'm not a crazy Police fan, I enjoy their music, but if I were a crazy Police fan, I would be very disapointed.

Many reviews are correct, the show is great, sound good, and I am a huge Police fan, but take it from a huge concert fan. When the camera is on the band, which isnt often, they have head shots mostly, and rarely show anyone but sting.

I kind of wished they could have reedited it (is it me or are does the extra audio and video footage look and sound better than the concert itself?), but it's nowhere as dizzying as Cream's Farewell concert.

The story centers around three women (all played by men) who are or, at one time have been, in the entertainment business.All three men give hilarious performances of the women at different stages of the carrers. My favorite was CoCo, a character with a tragic (and comical, for us) love story. If you are looking for something a little bit dark, a lot campy and just plain silly fun, then this is the dvd for you. Invite a few friends over and just have some good laughs!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic...","review":"Maybe got through the first thirty minutes before I gave up on it.

Especially if you've got a group of bitter queens to watch it with."},{"rating":"2","title":"An original and campy comedy, hilarious throughout!","review":"This is an off-the-wall comedy about three Hollywood actresses, (all played by drag queens). A very original premise and very very funny! There are some great quotable lines. Whatever your opinion of men in drag, watch this movie in the spirit in which it is intended, a twisted farce and a lot of fun. Good production values belie its low budget. It shows what can be done with limited resources and a lot of creativity. This is one not to miss!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Funniest movie ever!","review":"I love it! everyone I showed it to loves it!so many funny lines, you have to watch it twice 'cause the first time you miss a lot for being laughing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious, outrageous. Funniest movie of 2003","review":"At a mere 79 minutes, this movie is jam-packed with hilarity. A low-budget indie, this movie will find its cult audience on DVD. Its just a shame that MGM is charging an outrageous $29.95 for a bare-bones release. There's no behind the scenes mini-documentaries and worse of all--no commentaries by the film's trio of stars (and talented director/writer). I was hoping for at least one commentary track because the three drag queen performers probably would certainly have supplied commentary that rivialed the film for laughs. The film was produced by Independent Film Channel. You wont find a funnier, faster-paced bad-taste comedy and it doesnt outstay its welcome."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you sew and love it, this book is ... wow!","review":"I couldn't believe it.

This book is in that category and you would be better off to keep your money and spend time with the Help files instead of looking for something in this book. The author and publisher should be ashamed for passing this book off as a complete reference when it is apparent that very little original work went into it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gerber Mini Scissors Tool","review":"Does a good job of fitting in between too-small-to-be-useful and too-large-for-the-pocket. Good quality blades, smooth action, and labeling the blade vs the file sides is a nice touch. Haven't had it too long (month or so), but from my experience so far, highly recommended.A year later, a bout with modern packaging broke the blade limit (probably should have used the scissors). Still like the tool, and am considering buying another, because up to this point it more than met expectations. However, I can no longer really recommend it to others--2 or 3 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tools","review":"You cannot tell from the picture,but the tool on the left side at the bottom is a tweezers.

Let's just say that during TV reruns of Bird on a Wire, the commercials are for nudie bars and air fresheners.In this instalment you get to see Goldie Hawn playing her usual self: a klutzy, ditzy blonde in high heels, with the obligatory truck-stop makeup and that cavernous mouth that yaws open to yelp in surprise. Mel Gibson supplies wisecracking working class beef. The RV, Velveeta, and Readers Digest crowd should love this film, especially since the production values scream made-for-TV.If however this is not your idea of a romantic comedy, you are not alone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Melvin Gibson Romantic Comedy","review":"Melvin Gibson is absolutely as good as he can be in this film, doing the best job of comedic acting he is capable of, and looking as nice as he ever had looked to this point in his life. (Some say that Melvin Gibson is not aging well, but the fact is that he is growing old at the same rate we all are.) If you want to see Melvin Gibson in top form, check out this film. And Goldie Hawn ain't bad either."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is a watchable movie","review":"When this was out critics bashed this movie had very few nice things to say about Bird on a wire. The truth is the critics are wrong Bird on a wire is full of action and funny too. I like it how they paired up Mel Gibson and Goldie Hawn for this movie Mel Gibson acts exactly like he does in Lethal Weapon. I never get what the critics are talking about the movie is funny and never is there a dull moment and the stunts are funny. It is sure worth buying or at least renting."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really regret buying this MP3 Player!","review":"Avoid buying this MP3 player. This is surely without a doubt the dumbest 160$ I have ever spent. I tried to actually enjoy this, I really did but to no avail. The volume and sound quality isn't all that great to begin with. Also, the Phillips Go Gear constantly froze up on me, sometimes for days and the only solution was to let the battery die and then recharge it. But still, I tried to remain positive and just bear with it. But then one day, after a few months, my MP3 player just died for no apparent reason. It hasn't worked ever since. It's been a few months since it stopped working. Sad to say that I basically threw 160 hard-earned dollars away."},{"rating":"1","title":"JUNK!!!!","review":"This is the second mp3 player that I've had from philips.

If you're thinking of buying this product, i would suggest you second that thought and get yourself a Creative Zen Micro instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this product","review":"This has got to be the worst mp3 that I have ever used. I purchased it refurbished thinking it was a great deal at $82, but was I ever wrong. It takes forever to transfer songs. I am guess 1 minute per song. The battery life lasts only about 4 hours. When charging, the unit can not be turned off and that gets very annoying. The software is the worst I've ever seen. It uses Music Match Juke box. The software makes me rename all my mp3 files unless I pay for the upgrade. What the hell is that? I purchased a product, I expect it to work without having to pay for more. Playlist created on Music Match can not be transfered to the unit unless you want to transfer the songs again. It takes forever to create a playlist with the songs on the unit.I WILL NEVER BUY AN MP3 PLAYER FROM PHILIPS AGAIN. I WILL NEVER BUY A PLAYER THAT USES MUSIC MATCH JUKE BOX.

But...","review":"This is a very good coffee maker. Most importantly, the quality of the coffee produced is better than I have gotten in a very long time from many other coffee makers. There are two caveats however, that I feel should be brought to the attention of a prospective buyer:1 You cannot remove the carafe to pour a cup of coffee during the brewing process (this appears to be a function of its unique design).2 There is no automatic shut-off for the warmer plate after the coffee has been brewed.The first I find easy enough to live with. However, considering the high price of this machine, there would seem to be no excuse for not incorporating an auto shut-off feature that is included routinely in machines that are less than half its price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes good coffee, plain & simple","review":"This is way overpriced for what it does, luckily though I bought it for $50 since it was an openbox (new) item. It makes good, hot coffee and looks good on the counter. It looks as though it could make more then 5 (6 oz) cups since the carafe is tall but the coffee brewed does not go any higher then the bottom of the filter basket sitting inside it. Good counter presence though. The carafe does dribble occassionally when pouring which is why I didn't give it a perfect score."},{"rating":"2","title":"No more mess","review":"We've been using this coffee maker now for about 6 months. It makes great coffee and gone are the days of plugged up holes on my old coffee maker that would cause it to run over on the countertop. Due to the design of this coffee maker, even if the holes were to become clogged by coffee grounds which they never have, it would only run over into its own pot, not onto the counter.Only downside is that it does not power itself off after an hour or 2 or 3. For this price I was expecting that as a safety feature if not a convenience. Therefore, 4 stars instead of 5."},{"rating":"1","title":"Saves space","review":"This coffee maker fits in the space between the top of my microwave and a cabinet overhanging it.Making coffee takes some assembly skills as it's a rather bizarre setup. I suspect it's onlyslightly less effort than making coffee in a manual Chemix or Melita set-up. The advantages are that itwill fit in small places and you won't have to clean the inner workings of the coffee maker. Thatbeing said there is nothing much more to recommend it. The coffee is not very good and it does not have anauto-shutoff (Also it's difficult to see the on-light - it's practically on the back). Consequently youhave to keep this little piece of information (\\"got to turn off the coffee pot\\") in the forefront of your head ifyou're not finishing the pot at the moment. Recommended for a one or two coffee drinker household. Makes 2 1/3 mugs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money!","review":"I purchased this coffeemaker November 2011. The handle on the glass pot is flimsy and feels loose. When pouring from the pot there has never been a time that it did not drip on the counter. There is no automatic off if you want to quick get a cup before it is finished. The water drips in the basket holding coffee and pouring too soon gets coffee grounds in your cup. Just after this short time the thing has completely stopped working. The water from the reservoir is not transferring into the decanter at all. The hot plate is rusted as one reviewer noted. Sixty-nine dollars!! Outrageous! I did think this would be a good, lasting coffeemaker for that price. I also stocked up on six boxes of the #2 coffee filters -- I've gone through 1 1/2 boxes only, so now that was a waste of money. Cheaply made and flawed! I would not recommend to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great coffee pot","review":"I have looked for years for a small coffee pot that not only makes good coffee but also makes a pot of hot coffee. After reading the reviews on this pot, I decided to give it a try - it is well worth the higher price and makes excellent hot coffee! The design is very well done and it's an attractive pot as well. I also like the fact that is makes 5 cups because you can get 2 nice size mugs of coffee from it. I highly recommend this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Pot!","review":"This little pot puts my other household makers to shame. Use it in my bedroom and it is so convenient. The removable water tank and carafe filter have helped me immensely. Bought it while on crutches and it saved time and steps. Uses the Cuisinart 4cp filter perfectly. Coffee temp is great, fill line marks are accurate for coffee measurements, filter does help tap taste if used (I normally use spring water). Miss auto shut off, but can live without."},{"rating":"2","title":"quite good but...","review":"It's quite good, but I wish there was the automatic shut-off button. But I knew it wasn't there when I purchased the product. The real problem is that sometimes the coffee grinds get inside the coffee.Overall I would say that the coffee comes out hot and has good taste. It's the best coffeemaker I have had so far."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a 5 cup machine","review":"Be aware that this coffee maker will not make enough coffee for two 12 oz mugs of coffee. Our previous 4 cup model will easily make enough for two 12 oz mugs of coffee, so we expected that this one would too. Not so. Not even close. Be aware also that you cannot use gold mesh filters in this machine. I called the manufacturer about it and they specifically designed it so that gold mesh filters will not fit. The excuse, er... reason, given was to avoid overflow. It may make decent coffee, but these are awfully small 5 cups! I returned it to Amazon with no problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plastic Odor & Taste","review":"This is a horrible coffee maker - unless you really enjoy the smell and taste of hot plastic.The culprit seems to be the filter basket. We ran many pots of water through it and also a couple of pots of coffee. Nothing helped - the smell and flavor is horrible.Seeing the many 5 star reviews, I can only speculate that the formulation of the plastic strainer basket has changed or has poor quality control.We have replaced it with a Bunn Velocity Brew. I have only good things to say about the Bunn. It had no odor straight out of the box and makes great coffee. The Zutto is being returned to Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes good coffee","review":"I like this coffee maker. It makes a good cup of coffee. I think it is a little expensive but not too bad.The only thing I don't like is that you must wait until the coffee is completely brewed before you can pour a cup. Otherwise, the hot water continues to run onto the hotplate."},{"rating":"2","title":"good not best","review":"I've had this maker for 1 week. It does make a great first cup of coffee.

The coffee tastes noticeably better coming from the Zojirushi so I only use the Cuisinart when we have a lot of guests to make coffee for.Besides that, I love the sleek & modern styling, and it is so easy to clean compared to any coffee maker I have previously owned.

Since I don't drink coffee anymore, I asked him how he liked it and his comments are: Makes the best coffee and really likes the design but doesn't like folding the cone filter to fit the basket. Typical man right? It's really not a big deal. Just make sure you buy the cone filters which I did. I almost bought the other ones by mistake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was Jay related to someone?","review":"I just looked up my date of purchase on this pot: July 17. So I've been putting up with this for almost three months. What's the big deal about being able to fill the resevoir with the plastic piece? I don't find that any faster or easier than using the pot itself to fill any resevoir. Five cup capacity? Think again if you use a coffee cup, not a tea cup. I tried to buy a mesh filter. Not only not made, not made to accept one. I'm so tired of all this paper. $69.00 down the tube, if you ask me. I'd like to exchange it for a better model, assuming the company makes a good product but this coffee pot is not it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of junk","review":"Seriously. This thing is a piece of crap. The hot plate rusted within a month or two. It doesn't really make the water hot for a decent cup of coffee and the bottom of the carafe fell out after about 3 months. This was the worse coffee maker I've ever owned. Also, the lid that went over the filter was really annoying to take apart when finished."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed....","review":"I had high hopes for this machine having done my usual research. But it seems like this machine has gone back in time. Nothing is connected, all seperate pieces. While the removable water well is a nice aspect and it makes decent coffee, a #2 permanent filter is ill-fitting because of the design of the filter housing. I use it anyway, just seems like a lot of pieces and futzing around to get the filter onto the plate to brew coffee. Especially for the price of this little thing!Pros:removable water tankmakes good coffeeCons:many piecespermanent filters don't quite fit the basket due to designslow brewingcoffee is not quite hot enough unless you gulp it downI will probably use it and hope the electronics are decent.

All I could find in local stores were expensive large-capacity models and cheap 4-cup models of doubtful quality. Found this Japanese model on Amazon and, based on the reviews, ordered it. Takes about twice as long to brew as did the KitchenAide, but makes superior coffee - perhaps the longer brewing time is the key. Took a few days to adjust the amount of coffee used to achieve the strength I desired, but found I now use slightly less coffee than previously. Again, perhaps the longer brewing time contibutes to that. Easy to use and easy to clean - what more do you want?

I've readother reviews that say the coffee wasn't hot enough, but I drink my coffee black and it's extremely hot. I haven't made coffee for any guests who drink coffee withmilk in it, so on that issue I'm can't give feedback. I've also read reviews that complain that the cover on the glass carafe is loosely fitted and when pouringtheir coffee they have to hold down the cover with their thumb!!! So what!!

I like that it is small. I rarely need more than a few mugs so the 5 \\"cup\\" size is perfect. I've been through several pod makers too, and was rarely impressed with the taste. I did find one good tasting brand via mail order, but the pods were VERY expensive.Before I used it, I ran several pots of water only in an attempt to get rid of the chemical smell. It was slow going so I soaked the parts I could in water with baking soda. After a few more cycles with water, the smell is gone. I had this issue with a recent Krups coffee maker too.So...haven't had too long, but like it so far.

Basic, simple, easy to use design. Unfortunately, the water coming out peaks at around 165 degrees fahrenheit. Several other reviews have pointed this out as well, leading me to believe it is a design flaw rather than a problem with an individual unit. I measured the temperature of the water coming out of the brew spout with a digital thermometer. That is well below the optimal range of 195 - 205 degrees, resulting in poor flavor extraction. Pass on this coffee maker; there are better choices."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor performance after a few months. Very dissappointing","review":"Have changed my review. Liked it initially and gave it 4 stars--not 5 because there was no automatic shutoff--a safety concern. It worked fine for about 5 months.

I would have had to pay shipping both ways and wasn't sure if it was worth it, so I decided to dump the thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great smaller drip coffee maker","review":"I like the seperate water container so I don't spill water all over trying to fill it up. The coffee filter inside the pot is different & works well. When you pick up the pot there is no dripping from a drip chamber with wet grounds. The pot doesn't leak when pouring coffee into my cup. I do need to hold the latch that holds on the lid, even if I take out the coffee ground chamber, as the lid does move otherwise. Maybe they should have made the latch a little bigger to hold securely. It makes great coffee too. I like that it has a water filter. I am using bottled spring water as my tap has alot of sediment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome little coffee maker","review":"I've been searching for a smaller coffee maker and I've been through Black & Decker, Cuisinart, Mr Coffee, Hamilton Beach and this is by far the best of the bunch. It's a little pricey but the design is outstanding and it's rather elegant looking. It makes a great cup of coffee and uses #2 cone filters unlike the basket style filters that most small units use, in my opinion this makes for a much more robust cup of coffee. Filling is a breeze with the removable water tank and cleanup is a breeze as well. It has all the features I wanted which is just an off/on switch. I love it and am happy that I finally found a small coffee maker that brews an excellent cup."},{"rating":"2","title":"great little machine","review":"This coffee maker is well worth the cost , I was skeptical that a coffee maker could make a difference, but it does.

It is designed well, makes excellent coffee, pours easily, and looks good. I've been looking for something like this for years, and pounced when it appeared on the market. We've found it is perfect for brewing two mug sized cups, and generally now use a bit less ground coffee -- we grind the beans within days of use -- to achieve a delicious cup.

The good: simple intuitive design, removable water container, coffee filter built in into the carafe, water filter. The sad: no automated switch off, and a big big one - drips coffee when you pour it in from the carafe. In order to avoid the spills you need to keep a precise angle otherwise your table is full of coffee since it trips all over. Simply sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made in China","review":"I just received the order of this coffee maker. When I opened up the box, the first thing I noticed is the print \\"Made in China\\".

Be aware!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sent it back!","review":"The style was amazing and it made good coffee but...the glass used to make the coffee pot was the downfall. It was so thin and poorly made that I just couldn't believe it! I was shocked that something so well designed and functional, with lots of nice features, could then be ruined by using cheap, thin glass which made it basically worthless! What were they thinking? I sent it back the day after I got it before the weight of coffee in the pot caused the handle to crack the pot. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Impressed! Be Careful!","review":"To be fair, I didn't even try to make coffee in this maker, so I am not saying it makes poor quality coffee. I've only had it out of the box for about 1/2 hour, and it's going back.Some warnings before you purchase:- NO AUTO SHUT OFF. For the price that should be a basic safty function.- The \\"Auto Keep-warm\\" option just means the warming plate stays on till you turn it off... which they don't recommend leaving on for more than 15 mins.- The plastic lid will fall off unless you keep your thumb firmly on it when you pour.- Don't be mislead by the large coffee pot. It only fills up about half way."},{"rating":"1","title":"zojurushi is a joke","review":"i purchased the zojirushi zutto 5 cup coffeemaker based on some earlier reviews and thought i would give it a try... please do not purchase this product! it was such a dissapointment from the time i took it out of the box.. it has a cheap look and is annoying to use. every time i made coffee i would get a big sip of coffee grounds!!! this is going in the trash!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent design, uniquely simple.....","review":"I received my \\"new\\" coffeepot yesterday. and am enjoying my 3rd brew as I type this. As a retired engineer, I was surprised at it's simple, nearly idiot-proof design. It takes up about 1/3 of the space as my previous 12 cup coffeemaker.This coffeemaker does exactly what it was designed to do, make an excellent cup of coffee (5cups/2mugs) and nothing else, no bells, whistles, or timers and alarms.....one simply labeled and illuminated switch, on/off.The filter holder is unique in it's design, it sits within the pot's lid. It is designed in a very simple, but interlocking manner. nearly impossible to assemble wrongly. Also it's ergonomically designed lid/handle tends to lead your thumb to cover the tab that holds the lid while pouring.If you are a single person or a couple, and don't require more than 5 cups at a time, and don't need a clock/timer to reset after power failures, then this is the pot for you!Forgot to mention...the spout does not drip either!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not hot enough","review":"The coffee this unit makes is uniformly weak.

Using more ground coffee didn't help. This led to my checking the temperature. I filled the reservoir and, without coffee or filter, I measured the temperature of the hot water in the container when the flow of hot water stopped. Using both a laboratory thermometer and a Fluke multimeter with a Fluke thermocouple, the temperature of the water in the container was 168 degrees F.At present I'm using water about 40 degrees F hotter with a press-type coffee maker, and enjoyment of morning coffee has returned. The Zojirushi EC-DAC50 is headed for the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look elsewhere","review":"I have a two other Zojirushi products, the hot water dispenser and the rice maker. They are both brilliant products that work well and are well made.While made to a high standard the Zutto coffee maker is a borderline product. The hot plate that is built into the Zutto keeps the coffee too hot, quickly (minutes) causing it to 'cook' and go bad after brewing.I recommend you look for another machine that uses a thermal carafe if you want drinkable coffee after the first cup."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superior Coffee from a Great Design","review":"I have had this coffee maker for over a year and this review is based on extensive use. This is a great coffee maker for two key reasons. First, the coffee tastes very good. I have not measured water temperature going into the ground coffee, but based on the well-balanced and full flavor, I assume that it is close to ideal. The second reason is design. My previous coffee maker had over nine pieces in the cover alone, which may not seem like a big deal when you start using a brand new device, but nine pieces means many nooks and crannies for coffee sludge to find a safe and long-lasting home. The beauty of this device is the simplicity, which may take some time to appreciate. Making coffee is straightforward and intuitive and cleanup is a breeze."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice but overpriced","review":"This coffee maker is twice the price of an equivalent Black and Deckor or Mr. Coffee model. While the look and build quality is certainly better, I'm not sure it's twice better.

It's still too expensive for what it is though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coffeemaker","review":"Great little coffeemaker but remember to turn it off because it does not have a automatic turn-off."},{"rating":"1","title":"it ruined my coffee","review":"I am returning my units because it's defective: coffee does not come out hot enough. It is barely warm. It is an issue, not because I like to burn my lips, but because suboptimal water temperature does not bring the flavors out of the coffee and coffee then tastes like dirty water. I love coffee, I roast my own coffee beans at home to have delicious and fresh coffee and this unit has not delivered it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great small coffee maker","review":"I like this coffee maker because it takes up little room on my counter, it makes good coffee, and the water resevoir is conveniently filled at the faucet and placed into the coffee maker.

Wrong choice.First the water spits out the side as it drips. The lid falls off when you pour even with your thumb on top. If you cover it any more you would be burned. And as another reviewer said the band is so lose it feels like the handle is going to fall off.If you are willing to deal with that you won't be when you taste the coffee.

The Jojurushi is not even close.... and MR Coffee is not great.I am afraid that if one wants high quiality coffee in a 4 cup / two mug size range you have to hand brew with Melita.OK I TESTED THIS THING OUT AND IT RAN UP TO 165 DEGREES f.

Everytime I hear Harry Connick Jr. and Louis Armstrong used \\"When Harry Met Sally,\\" it makes the experience even more enjoyable.\\"Love Actually\\"'s soundtrack fits in neither of these categories. In such a great movie, where the relationships span over several different ages, they really needed to stick to a more timeless selection of music. Since they jump from the Beach Boys to Maroon 5 to Wyclef Jean (great artists in their own right) the music is so diverse, that it defeats any kind of main theme and ruins the experience.

However, Jump is not the Pointer Sister's version that was in the movie (it is some rather hollow faux disco number), the Billy Mack cut is not well-mixed nor is All You Need is Love, where the instrumental additions in the chruch scene seem to have been cut out, giving a monotonous and repetitive chorus that goes on and on.

In the movie she sings her intro without background music. On the audio CD, there is unwanted background music clutter from the start and, to my ear, it only gets worse as the piece progresses.When will the recording industry set standards voluntarily, clearly spelling out on labels and advertising any soundtrack substitutions?

Cannot wait till the DVD comes out...The soundtrack is equally good with an excellent mix of oldies and goodies from the movie. I especially like the re-do of Mariah's \\"All I Want for Christmas\\" and the inclusion of some of the best Maroon 5 songs from their CD \\"Songs About Jane.\\"If you want a good mix CD, pick this one up and I don't think you will be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but incomplete","review":"This is a very good soundtrack for anybody who liked the movie to have, and my only beef with it is that it's incomplete compared to the british version of the soundtrack. I compared the N. American sountrack to the one listed on amazon.co.uk, and it's missing 5 tracks. Our version includes Christmas is All Around and All I Want For Christmas as bonus tracks which is great as the cd would be incomplete without them. However, the british version has a different version of the song Jump for My Love, and includes tracks completely left off our cd by Otis Redding and Gabrielle, not to mention the 3 different love themes by the movie's composer, Craig Armstrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible CD - A must have","review":"The movie was great - and this CD is incredible! Even inside the dust jacket the movie's director said that it was this collection of music that totally made the movie the success it is. Just take a listen and you'll know why. Great music for a romantic dinner - or even as low-key background mood for hanging out or an evening with friends. The only thing that is a little out of place are the two christmas songs (one of which is especially wonderful) at the end..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfectly recaptures the mood of the movie","review":"In the CD liner notes, the music director for the film Love Actually suggests that different music would have made this a completely different movie, and I have to agree. When listening to the soundtrack, I could easily recollect exactly where in the movie each song was used; the music served to recapture all of the complex emotions so wonderfully portrayed in the film.Overall, the soundtrack has a rather jazzy/R&B; feel, from Kelly Clarkson's \\"The Trouble With Love Is\\" to Lynden David Hall's upbeat version of \\"All You Need is Love.\\" Those who have seen this CD in stores may have been dismayed to find that the song list doesn't include Billy Mack's hilarious \\"Christmas is All Around,\\" but don't worry--this is included as a bonus track along with \\"All I Want for Christmas is You,\\" another of the film's more fun tunes.This soundtrack makes perfect background or mood music for virtually any occasion, especially a romantic one. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but.....","review":"This Soundtrack is very good, but... if there were more of the movie music score, that would've been 5 stars.

It is played at the very end of the movie when most viewers are tearing up :)Joni Mitchell also does a great \\"Both Sides Now,\\" one of the movie's best.Kelly Clarkson is another highlight. Her \\"The Trouble With Love Is\\" is the soundtrack song that is getting the most radio play at both Pop and Adult Contemporary stations. It is played during the middle of the movie, then again after \\"God Only Knows\\" when the credits start (funny thing is that this song is on her solo album \\"Thankful\\" too, which is such a strong album, that this song was probably my 2nd least favorite) and works well with this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazon,,,omitted,,,where made, again,,,with 3 different (usa,indonesia, british) versions !?!?!","review":"I was afraid of poor qual. on the indonesian version, but it was good,,,now that i read about a larger/more tracks Brit. version, i want that one,,,WHY IS AMAZON SO TIGHT ABOUT NOT TELLING US HOW MANY VERSIONS THERE ARE TO PERCHASE AND WHERE THEY ARE MADE ? just standard corp stupidstuff i guess,,,"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Comfortable Mattress!","review":"I specifically wanted an innerspring mattress for my futon, because it will get a lot of use by my visiting children and I wanted them to be comfortable.This mattress is extremely comfortable to lie on, and it is equally comfortable when used as a sofa.

At less than $30 on clearance from authorized dealer Midwest Electronics, it represents an excellent bargain for those looking to mount a sub in unusual places, such as underneath a car seat or in a car door.Note that despite having a shallow mounting depth, the THw1000 requires about the same enclosure size as a normal sub, which means that you can use it in very shallow, albeit large, enclosures."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dim Sum","review":"I love the book! The recipes are great! I grew up in the same area of the author. It brings so many great memories of my childhood. It also allows me to pass on tradition to my children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite good for its size","review":"This is a far better book than I had expected--possibly because my previous purchase in this field was Vicki Lilley's exceptionally amateurish and inauthentic effort. Although not comprehensive (see Eileen Yin-Fei Lo's Dim Sum book, especially the 1982 edition, which is far more encyclopedic, as is Mai Leong's), what recipes ARE included are very authentic indeed and extremely precise--which is certainly as it should be, given such a dainty culinary art form. In addition to the books noted above, I must say that my favourite dim sum books are the ones by Wei-Chuan Publishing of Taiwan, but their occasionally fractured English and odd measurements (\\"1/4 cup plus 1 T. plus 1 tsp.,\\" etc.) would not make them everybody's first choice. Blonder's book is both sophisticated enough to be of interest to the dim sum initiate, but detailed and painstaking enough for the beginner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mini Book with a GIANT Message","review":"This book is excellent, written in a very down to earth straight forward manner.

Charles Capps has many more worthy publications than are offered here. His ministry is based in England, Arkansas."},{"rating":"2","title":"God's Word Is Medicine","review":"Capps believes that people can receive a divine healing through the use of God's Word in much the same way that a physical healing is attained by taking medicine. He lists numerous scriptual passages to be used in combatting different types of diseases and conditions. His prescription requires that these bible verses be spoken at least two or three times daily. If the condition worsens, he advises us to double our efforts.Capps' little booklet is clearly written. His message is not really unique since it is similar to the approaches to healing advocated by Kenneth Hagin, Jim Glennon, Ralph C. Brittain, Dodie Osteen and many others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everyone should have spares to give away","review":"I first learned of this book, from a wonderful woman in her 80's.

I have given two of these books away to people struggling with severe and life threatening situations, and will be purchasing more to always have on hand.

Read it and feel your spirit uplifted and your body healed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grows on you","review":"This is a great album that seems more essential the more you listen.It's not hardcore at all. I'm not sure there's a single section of any song that sounds one lick in the vein of Minor Threat, Bad Brains and all the DC godfathers.Who cares.It might be fair to compare the sound to some of the slower and more instrumental grooves of early Fugazi. But, that's not entirely correct either.At the risk of being accused of blasphemy, when it comes to dueling guitar textures and grooves, this Hoover album is light years ahead of where Fugazi was at the same time. It's a much more musical version of that approach, more penetrating and catchy.This is an extremely good guitar groove album, very smart. They really know how to let the sounds breathe. I can't think of any better use of two guitars at the same time in recent memory. Makes Interpol seem really really weak in comparison."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mad Caddies","review":"this is a fantastic album however not quite as good as duck and cover although it does feature some bloody good songs on it, but it if u like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!!","review":"I only bought this because i wanted to hear Derick Plourde on drums. this is the last cd he recorded on.

Hunter is nothing more than so-so as an actress and she looks terrible in the movie, first in a horrible dirty-blonde wig and then in a lousy black dye job. How can you make a supermodel look this bad? The majority of the film involves watching Hunter, Matlin and Roberts converse via telephone and computer, so you'll either be asleep or using the fast-forward button in no time. The ending features several unintentionally funny moments, including a ludicrous shoot-out scene."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not A Who-Done-It","review":"This is not a \\"who done it\\". It certainly should not be considered a regular mystery story. The major plot of this book is not solving the mystery. Rather it is \\"what is the mystery?\\" It takes the hero (and the reader) almost the entire book to answer that question. The last few chapters focus not on solving but resolving the mystery.Early twentieth century, New York state Young man meets young woman. Both highly attracted to one another. Woman says, \\"We must never meet again.\\" WHY = MYSTERY.I enjoyed the book. Thought it was well written.It's free.

And yet his discussion of the new kind of war that will dominate the 21st Century anticipates everything that happened in the former Yugoslavia and Afghanistan. He may not name Osama bin Ladin, but he clearly describes him. This book is eerily prescient. For once the book jacket blurb is absolutely on the mark: \\"For professional soldiers, to neglect this book is to neglect our duty.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Argument Draws The Wrong Conclusion","review":"Mr Van Creveld has written a compelling arguement that violence and war have existed throughout human history. He further asserts that conventional war as we know it is an anachronism that will soon dissapear to be replaced by insurgencies and terrorism. I agree with all of the points. The one conclusion that I must disagree with however, is his assertion the the compulsion to war in human society isn't biological. This assertion contradicts his entire arguement. Human Social Behvaior is a result of our biological evolution and should not be seperated from our understanding of ourselves. To say that war has no biological compulsion is akin to saying that lemmings toss themselves into the sea becuase they enjoy swimming.A wise man he is, but he's got to have a little more courage in following through his ideas to their logical conclusions"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good schoalarship on important topic","review":"In this work, Van Creveld discusses the future of armed conflict in the Post Cold War world. While not the best scholarship ever,(on some points he fails to elaborate thoroughly in supporting his assertions)he presents a grand thesis for the the \\"postulated breakdown\\" of conventional warfare that he anticipates to occur in the near future. His theories on the development of informal, unconvnetional warfare in the post Clausewitzian, 21st century seems to have been vindicated (a least in part) part informal insurgencies in places such as Somalia and Palestine. A must read for any military history buff who is willing to read a tex that challenges he theories of Clausewitz and Jomini."},{"rating":"1","title":"musicman","review":"Wouldn't recommend this album mainly because every song has a longgggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggg drawn out solo.

I personally am not a fan of live cds, somehow I don't feel like they are true to capturing the liveliness and energy and fun of a live show. But Dispatch's three members' amazing, interesting and distinct personalities still manage to shine through on this cd. If you are a Dispatch fan, don't think twice about picking this up. If you are just catching on to the Dispatch tidal wave that is taking this country's college and high school scene by storm, then I suggest looking into BANG BANG or WHO ARE WE LIVING FOR? prior to buying this disk. That being said, nothing surpasses a live Dispatch show. I just came back from the 11/17/01 show at the Orpheum, and Dispatch fans delight, they are making a DVD out of the two nights at the Orpheum.

Having said that this album is really bad, I will stick with Dispatch's other albums. Most of these songs are just [half-hearted], they hardly put any work into Elias or Bang, it is really sorry.

I expected to like this movie. But I was disappointed by Call of the Wild.What Left Me Cold?The film never drew me in. Most of the actors were clearly acting (and not too well at that) rather than becoming part of a compelling story. Character development was so thin that I never cared much what happened.While the scenery and photography were stunning, the editing was poor, and the black screen breaks between scenes distracting. Makeup was obvious, such that I saw makeup rather than seeing the ravages of cold.The relationship between boy and dog was never fully developed. It was there, but emotionless, almost sterile.Overall, I found the movie flat. I enjoyed the scenery but missed the pull of the original story.Five stars for photography, one star for editing, one star for story.

It is worth the time to sit with the family and talk about what went on then.It's a good time to open talk with the kids and talk about our history, life, and death.You won't be able to do that over sex in the city, simpsons, or Icarlie now a days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad menus, not captioned","review":"The menus on the DVD barely work.

Some of these tracks really rock and showcase that flair only Slant 6 seems to capture, a retro-style girl punk that has attitude without coming off as cheezy or pretentious. Unfortunately, tracks like \\"Retro Duck\\" and the album's much too long title track are songs to skip--and this coming from someone who believes skipping tracks is ordinarily a punishable offence in music listening.

The diagnosis of Borderline Personality Disorder, much like ADD or ADHD in children, is over-diagnosed and over-medicated, yet little-understood or discussed. This delusional woman is extremely self-congratulatory over the supposed success of this book. I wonder how many of her supposed maladies would vanish if she merely changed her diet or listened to people who would speak the truth, and not only pay attention to those who always tell her what she wants to hear. People who claim to suffer from BPD are merely adult children who never liked hearing the word 'no', and will still throw tantrums to get their own way.

Great music to listen to while crusing around with the windows down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Change of Pace","review":"Well Jack's back with another great record. There's no denying that \\"In Between Dreams\\" maintains that cool, beachy, laidback feeling that Jack is known for. I mean, yes this record is a bit more VH1 than \\"Brushfire Fairytales\\" and \\"On and On\\", but it's still the same old JJ playing his acoustic with a little help from his friends. Here's just more proof that Jack knows not how to dissapoint his listeners."},{"rating":"1","title":"hmmm....is that it?","review":"this album left me feeling like i'd gotten a condensed version of a cd. maybe this is just jack's style, but the songs were super simple and didn't really entertain me. don't buy this album unless you have a mellow tiki bar in hawaii and need a soundtrack to play. otherwise, don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"There is better mellow folk music out there old and new","review":"I have listen to these guys songs they are listenable nice and kind of dull for one thing the dude's voice is nothing to wave about. So i'm going to name a some music old and new that you should check out in addition to or instead of. Starting with the old Nick Drake, Joni Mitichel, Gordon Lightfoot, Tom Waites, Lou Reed there is more but i would be here all day naming them. The newer ones would be The magentic fields, sondre lerche, belle and sebastain, The Divine Comedy, Grandaddy, Stephan Malkmus lead singer of pavement who is solo now. Not all of this music sounds actlly like Jack but it is more mellow music and singer songwriter stuff you should check out."},{"rating":"2","title":"AS GOOD AS IT GETS THANX JJ","review":"This is an unbelieveable CD. His first two blew me away and now this. Though his melodies kinda carry over from CD to CD he does a good job at changing the tempo and flavor on this one. For any melow music person this is a must have so go get it.Da Don Datta over and out"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this!","review":"I guess I have my three year old son to thank for this. After he became obsessed with Jack Johnson on the Curious George soundtrack, I became smitten too and checked out his other music (I listen to talk radio way too much I guess). Anyway, I realized I had in fact actually heard his music and never realized it was him. It's great to have on in the kitchen when I'm cooking or whatever. Bonus is my kids like him too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jack is the new Bob Marley","review":"I've been a big Jack Johnson fan since his first release and his third effort does not disappoint in any way. His lyrics and smooth acoustic rhythm are so soulful. I can listen to this CD (and any of his others for that matter) all day - in much the same way I can listen to Bob Marley Legend all day - without ever burning out on it. Beyond that, the guy is so humble, down to earth and such a humanitarian that purchasing this CD will further his cause related work. Buy it. Relax. Enjoy with a smile - and a healthy serving of some banana pancakes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally some hooks in pop music.","review":"Yeah, yeah. Some younger folks out there may be bored with this album. It isn't going to make you want to drive really fast or get you pumped up for a workout.Now that we have that out of the way, I'll say that this album stands out among all the GARBAGE being produced by so many other current 'popular' acts. There has been a giant void in good music for the last several years, T & A being valued higher than talent. It's sick.Jack Johnson has created a laid-back yet funky gem that's so loaded with hooks that I was laughing out loud on it's first spin in my CD player. See'Staple it Together.' Jack learned about production. And it is gooooood.For those of you who kind of thought 'On and On' was a let-down (I would fall in this category,) please don't let the previous stinker deter you from buying this one. I promise it will go down as one of your favorites. Perfect for cooking, drinking, and dancing with your wife in the kitchen on Sunday afternoon."},{"rating":"2","title":"a good summer companion","review":"this has always been one of my favourite albums. It just puts you in the zone and gives you the feeling that you are in a hammock under the coconut tree.Just a lovely album"},{"rating":"2","title":"a really amazing cd","review":"This CD is really great. It is very different than Jack's older stuff, but nevertheless still great. My favorite tracks are \\"Good People\\" and \\"Breakdown\\" but they are all great songs. Everyone of them. I've had this cd for about 4 days or so, and I must have listened to the entire thing 10 times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hat Trick","review":"I'm always skeptical when an artist I like comes out with a new CD, thinking I can't possibly like the new one as much as the old one(s). But I immediately liked this CD. A lot. My bias might be revealed by saying I own Jack Johnson's two other solo CDs, as well as 'Thicker Than Water' and 'September Sessions.''Belle' is a departure from his signature sound, given that it is sung partly in French, but it has still managed to become one of my top three songs on the CD. I am pleased to see 'Breakdown' on this CD, toned down for listeners looking for the traditional \\"Jack\\" sound. 'Banana Pancakes' is probably my current favorite on this CD, if only for the lyrics that make me giggle like a five-year-old. Yes, nearly all of the other songs have a similar sound, and from anyone else, that'd irk me. But no other pop-sounding artist makes me feel like I'm on a tropical vacation while driving through the bleak winter season.I'm off to make banana pancakes and pretend like it's the weekend."},{"rating":"2","title":"In Between Dreams by Jack Johnson","review":"Every word of Johnson's mouth is like the hands of the world's most skilled massuse on the back of your shoulders. His music is so soothing and relaxing, the perfect collection for a lazy day around the house, driving in your car and guaranteed to be this summer's essentional soundtrack. From start to finish the album is near flawless, with the only track I have a problem warming up to is \\"Staple it Together\\". \\"Sitting, Waiting, Wishing\\" is a fantastic first single, much better than \\"The Horizon has been Defeated\\" (a great song in its own right), from 2003's On & On. My personal favorite hear is \\"Banana Pancakes\\", and following closely are \\"Crying Shame\\", \\"Do You Remember\\" & \\"Constellations\\". Even the interludes, \\"Belle\\" & \\"Situations\\" are better than what most artists have put out in recent memory. Jack is hands down of the best musicians on the planet today."},{"rating":"2","title":"not too shabby","review":"It's still Jack but doesn't quite have the same feel as 'Brushfire Fairytales' or 'On and On'.Although there are some different sounds coming out of this one, there's no need for worries, Jack's still making beautiful music. I don't think you'll be disappointed.The album jacket is attractive and really nicely put together.I hope you enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Music For People Who Aren't Into Music..","review":"I was at a party recently, and the hostess put this CD on. I caught bits and pieces of it in between conversations and picked it up a few days later. Now, I see why this CD was chosen for party music: it's perfectly suited for background noise. In Between Dreams is so innocuous, uninteresting, lightweight and breezy that it should become a standard in dental office waiting rooms everywhere.If you want to hear some perfectly crafted pop, check out The Pernice Brothers' \\"Discover a Lovelier You.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"In Between Dreams","review":"An excellent blend of harmony, classic guitar and melodic vocals that encapsulate senerity peace and a little comedy in Banana Pancakes, a real treat for JJ fans"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album!","review":"I really like this album! I'm from the North Shore where Jack grew up and you just get that vibe from his songs and I guess maybe it's cause I can picture the places he's singing about. I loved the songs he wrote about his wife and the whole album is just nice to listen to and puts you in a good and mellow mood. I would highly recommend this album and Brushfire Fairytales as well. Great songs with lyrics that talk about love, family and friends, not sex and drugs - what a change!"},{"rating":"2","title":"IT'S ALL IN THE STARS","review":"good side:great rhythm, optimistic, fun sound, strong songs, great guitar workbad side:nothing too bad about it!standout tracks:do you remember; sitting,waiting,wishing; crying shame; breakdown"},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing","review":"this is jack johnson's best cd and all of his cd's are amazing i would recomend theis cd to anyone"},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING! what else is new....","review":"what else can be said except it's a relaxing and amazing cd... a must have!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good cd","review":"this is a great cd .... yea the songs might have a distinct beat but i like'em . Its more so the lyrics that i like ... its simple and universal. The beat is a jazzy smooth guitar mix . Or maybe im just feeling his music because i live in hawaii ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poppy Goodness","review":"This is a great CD; I think we know now what we're getting from Jack Johnson.My wife and I were listening through the CD after we bought it and I noticed how, when a song starts out, it sounds like a John Mayer song, but then Jack comes on with his voice and it's ok.He is a little less political on this album, but you still hear his point of view.A good, fun album that we all like, especially our baby boy."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is good music","review":"In Between Dreams by Jack Johnson is really good. I'm glad his music is getting more exposure on the radio and videos. He is a very talented singer and songwriter. The best song is Sitting, Waiting, Wishing. This is a great song about waiting to be with someone you are interested in romantically and feeling frustrated by it. Better Together is a very pretty love song. It is very melodic and sweet. He really shows off his skill as a guitar player on this song too. Banana Pancakes is another highlight on this album. This is a very cute song is about feeling lazy and enjoying life. Jack picks up the pace with the song Staple it Together. This song really gets you moving. Do you Remember is another one of my favorite songs. It is about all the memories you have with the person you love like having a special place and enjoying music. I love this CD, and I'd recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'll Pass","review":"I gave the record two stars because the guitar playing is decent. Other than that this thing doesn't have much going for it. The songs all sound similar and no effort was put into creating decent lyrics. If Soma were music, there's a good chance it would sound very similar to this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"So-so","review":"If you like Dobie Gray from the 70's then you'll like this CD. The song structures and playing are fine, but this type of music is a bit too boring for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jimmy Buffet Regurgitated","review":"I'm forced to listen to this at work and actually feel physical pain. It's often described as mellow (maybe in a drug-induced comma), but all I can think of is banal, trite, insipid, an American Idol early reject maybe. Anthems for beer-belching yahoos? Most of the surfers I know listen to punk. Anyway, expand your consciousness if possible and pick up Richard Thompson, Edwynn Collins and Nick Drake for starters, money better spent."},{"rating":"1","title":"if i have to hear this any more I'll shoot myself","review":"I could see this album being sold to some family and friends... but mass marketed and best selling?? Only skilled musicians and song writers with creativity should be able to widely distribute their music.I have nothing against Jack Johnson, it's just that he doesn't have any songwriting talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"bland and boring","review":"This is some of the blandest and most boring music I've heard. There's no uniquiness, originality or creativity to this music. This music has no energy and Jack sounds partly asleep when he sings, and it's enough to put the listener to sleep. I don't understand how anyone can enjoy \\"chill\\", laid-back boring music like this when they could listen to GREAT bands like Mr. Bungle, Nuclear Rabbit, Idiot Flesh, Sleepytime Gorilla Museum, Fantomas or Secret Chiefs 3."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and repetitive","review":"This guy gets two stars since he is one step above a street performer. His music is a bad resurrection of old-style Blues from the South. He gets more popularity he deserves, but thats true for most mainstream artists of the 2000's."},{"rating":"1","title":"the selling out of an indie artist","review":"when artists gain popularity and submit to the demand of listeners by following new record company standards no one is very surprised. in the case of jack johnson, who owns his own label, this comes completely out of no where. he became john mayer and jason mraz on this album. he got married and had a kid which essentially means that soon after he lost his balls. it does not make any sense! go ahead and buy this so that the sales go up and he can be on the amazon top seller list. go do it, and pat yourself on the back, because he'll make more crap again. and then you can tell your wide-eyed grand children that you helped contribute to the \\"great killing of all that is good\\" at the beginning of the 21st century."},{"rating":"2","title":"I don't understand people...","review":"I have been reading reviews while making my amazon wish list and it is interesting to see other's opinions. What is frustrating however, is to see a fantastic album given mediocre user reviews because it isn't music to \\"jump around to\\" or isn't hyper, those individuals must not understand the benefits of chillin'. Rant aside, the album is great for any mood...typical of Jack Johnson."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just plain nice.","review":"This album isn't spectacular or mind-blowing, but it's certainly wonderful to listen to. Between Jack's voice and guitar, you can't help but feel peaceful and relaxed and happy - so turn it on during a lazy Sunday and enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"In one word ... Amazing","review":"Just bought this cd today, and is by far the best Jack CD out there. I've been waiting about 5 months for this album to come out, and I was not disappointed in one respect. If your a fan of Jack and you dont have this one yet, go get it NOW. If you are not a fan of Jack, buy it anyways and give it a try. You wont be disappointed.... The wonderful lyrics and amazing tunes will speak to you in some way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good CD","review":"As most of the other reviewers i rate this cd up there with Jacks other cd's. one reviewer stated that you just fall into the music and it is over before you know it. while this is true with a great chill cd.. the cd is only 41 minutes long.Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"The new Jack Johnson CD is fantastic. The same mellow tunes from Jack but as always he doesn't disappoint. If you liked On and On, you've got to pick this one up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Refreshing, mood lifting music","review":"I just love Jack Johnson's music. No matter what kind of mood I'm in or what kind of day I've had, listening to his music just makes me feel good. You can't help but sing and hum along. I can't think of any other band/singer that can do that. While this cd is classic Jack Johnson, it's not as good as \\"On and On\\" and \\"Brushfire Fairytales.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Good album","review":"Sometimes the songs kind of blend together a bit, but they're all good. I also enjoyed the Curious George soundtrack he did (which I bought first) even though it's targeted at kids. Worth a listen if you've never tried him out before. He's kind of like Norah Jones in the stripped down nature of the songs and the fact that he never rocks out but still has catchy tunes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly Great Album","review":"By far one of the most played albums in my collection, it brings summertime images to the mind even in the dead of winter. If you're looking for a CD to just chill to, look no further."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you liked previous Jack Johnson, it doesn't dissapoint.","review":"The latest from surfer/musician Jack Johnson offers good, fun music, void of many serious topics (with the exception of \\"Good People\\" and \\"If I Could\\"). Most of the songs talk about chilling out, and good or troubled relationships. Most of the songs on this CD are solid, Breakdown (good w/ Handsome Boy Modeling School) is great when Johnson takes out the hip-hop beat and lays down smooth guitar instead. As almost always there is a dud (Burshfire...-Sexy Plexi), Banana Pancakes has an annoying pop rhyme scheme and it feel like Johnson wasn't even trying with this goofy track. Still not as good as On and On, but good none the less."},{"rating":"2","title":"Folky and Funky","review":"\\"In Between Dreams\\" is my first Jack Johnson purchase and I have not been dissapointed. The is a well-crafted \\"easy-listening\\" outing. There is a nice mixture of uptempo funky numbers and softer tunes. There great hooks to be had all over the place. I consider myself a new fan of his brand of laid back music."},{"rating":"2","title":"As good as the rest....he is amazing!","review":"Jack Johnson is one artist that never changes his style or any of his music and that is wonderful because it works for him! I love the laid back sound of Jack and have been a major fan of his since Brushfire Fairytales. And ever CD has the same sound and just takes you on a mind trip. It is funky with a twist of Jimmy Buffet for the laid back style. Jack is a great musician that doesn't need radio play he has his loyal fans who like that his stuff is not played to death on the radio; I just hope he continues to make his music. I will listen forever if he keeps making great CDs as his first three."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantabulous","review":"I love every minute of it, there's not many CD's I can put on a listen to every song and have it pick me up every time.

It is my new favorite and I listen to it all the time.My husband even like to listen to it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Soooo mellow","review":"I love this CD. I play it mostly in the car or while I make dinner, it's so mellow and always seems to put me in a lighthearted mood. This is not necessarily an easy task. It's romantic as well. Simple, honest lyrics and uncomplicated melodies, perfect for relaxing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful music","review":"This CD is great!

It's got pictures and the lyrics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I'm surprised by the many positive reviews of this album. It simply doesn't compare to Jack's first two. It simply lacks the lyrical and melodic talent so evident in his previous releases. Don't get me wrong -- I'm a big fan. But when considered alongside his previous work, this is disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"he should be more bored with himself","review":"Typically, an artist seeks to broaden their talent and explore new horizons. With Jack Johnson, he's satisfied to produce the same songs over and over and over and over. If you'd like to hear all the same catchy riffs ad nauseum, buy all of Jack Johnson's albums. Or just buy one, since they're all the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"The triumph of the mediocre","review":"Sorry, I can't see it.I have given Jack a listen and he is just so modest in his singing, his lyrics and his guitar playing.I can only assume it is precisely his mediocrity that makes him popular. To me, sort of offensively inoffensive. He is no Ben Harper... or Xavier Rudd or John Butler etc if you want that sort of thing. Get someone with guts and talent and something to say.He gets a couple of stars because he likes the sea and he is in no way horrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"whatever","review":"I have this cd on now and I zzzzzzzzz.

This album has been in my cd player since I got it, only to be occasionally replaced by Jack's acoustic cds. A must have!"},{"rating":"2","title":"sing to me forever...","review":"Jack Johnson's first cd, Brushfire Fairytales was near perfection. On and On had its high points. In Between dreams hit the nail on the head.A favorite for college students, Jack johnson's wonderful, summer sound has soothed listeners for four years now. This cd just makes it feel warm and sunny outside because it is so happy and romantic. I really think johnson has established his sound on this album.The songs are all wonderfull, upbeat and catchy. His warm vocals will captivate you until all you wanna do is lay down and relax. The ultimate beach cd!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for those who crave edge","review":"Ok, so this album, though \\"relaxing\\", does not progress. None of the songs go anywhere. I feel like I should be sitting at a campfire, bobbing my head, but every song sounds the same and now my neck hurts. Not to knock the song writer who is successful, apparently, and able overcome such an adverse fate as a near fatal surfing accident, but it makes me sick inside to think that pop music is continually more tepid. It's probably just the state of pop in general which creates my strong disposition towards this cd / style of music. In any case, I do not like this Sam I Am"},{"rating":"2","title":"Maybe Another Great Cd From Jack!","review":"This cd is absolutly amazing. This could be Jack Johnsons best cd. I recomend this cd to anyone that likes mellow island music.

Every song is great. Definately recommend to buy no matter what type of music you like... very enjoyable and peaceful (a little change from the constant screaming and pounding drums in my case)."},{"rating":"2","title":"New Jack Johnson Fan","review":"A friend clued me into this Hawaiian son's style and I have to say, I didn't give him much thought at first. I loved the voice but the particular song he had me listen to just didn't stick with me.A recent road trip required hours of good music and I decided to pick up Jack's CD 1) because it was on sale, and 2) I thought it was funny all of his albums had silhouettes or partial glances of Jack, but none had his full face on the cover. This is a guy who is hiding, I thought. Maybe he will reveal himself though his music.He definitely did.The whole album is great, my favorite song is \\"Better Together\\" and I can't help but hum it as I drive to work in the morning. \\"Breakdown\\" also hits home with me. His sweet melodic voice is a change from the James Blunt ritual I had been following for weeks on end on my car's CD player, and his talents definitely transport me somewhere else. Which I think should be the whole point of music.I am definitely going to buy other albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jack Johnson - In Between Dreams","review":"This CD is really, really good! I just found out about Jack Johnson and he is so laid back and upbeat at the same time! It's great music for any time, party, relaxing, cleaning house, exercising, cooking, any time! I consider myself to be a very good judge when it comes to music and J.J. is a 10 in my opinion! Good for all ages!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jack strikes once again","review":"After On and On I wondered how Jack Johnson was going to approach his next album. We got something special here. Although It is my least favorite out of the past two, I still enjoy the tracks. Maybe I just am a sucker for Jack's tired and saddness behind his tales in Brushfire and On and On. In between dreams is a highlight in the musical carrer of Jack and more is to come. Awesome!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jack hits me again!!!","review":"Jack Johnson gets better with each album he churns out. As with the other albums he released this album is again heavy on rotation in my car. Actually, this is my favorite CD as I write this. I listen to this when I'm at home, when I'm driving and when I'm plain chilling out. I've taken this CD to all the road trips I've been to this past summer; a great summer soundtrack! A perfect companion to long road trips!!! Can't wait for the next album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dreamy","review":"Fresh, clean and just, well, dreamy. I have never heard Jack Johnson until this cd. I just stumbled upon it haphazardly and I am now a big fan. I have bought five copies of this cd as gifts for five different friends (who also did not know him) and they are now fans. I like the eclectic alternative sound. It's nice background music for my office and at home when I'm cleaning, baking, reading, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I absolutely love it. It's been living in my cd player since we got it. I enjoy it more and more every time I hear it. The lyrics are great and the overall feeling is highly enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better Together","review":"\\"In Between Dreams\\" is as impressive a 3rd album from Jack Johnson as anyone could hope for. On a follow-up album it is probably impossible to recreate the originality and genuine feel of songs from a debut. But this record has a distinctive flow and progession throughout (Making it stonger than On and On in my opinion). There are lighter portions such as \\"Better Together\\" through \\"Banana Pancakes\\", heavier areas like \\"Crying Shame\\" and \\"If I Could\\" (both of which deal with death), and introspective songs towards the end-- \\"Breakdown\\" through \\"Constellations.\\" There ARE social/political songs; I believe \\"Good People\\" comments on reality/talk show television, and \\"Crying Shame\\" makes a statement about a country at war. From a musical perspective, songs such as \\"Staple it Together\\" display an increased flair in the guitar-work, notably the soloing. Every song is solid, and some are as strong as any Jack has released. This is a very fine album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shawn King \\"In My Own Backyard\\"","review":"This CD has depth and great credibility from a woman's point of view.

I found the Period Ship Handbook-3 and was delighted. I purchased it and several other lesser handbooks that I thought might be handy. The Period Ship book was of no particular value in the process of building the model. The book is very visual and has some great pictures, but they essentially provided me with an image of what my ship would look like tomorrow! The miscellaneous handbooks at much lower cost were far more valuable. As nice as the series looks, I honestly believe that they are more like coffee table books than working manuals."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasted money on this product","review":"I had a broken FAT, and the DiskFixer utility did not recognize the broken drive.

I am pretty sure the blades would have cut through the PTL without any hiccups had it been totally dry.So far I have only used the blades when the orbital setting (in the saw) in the \\"rough cut\\" mode. I'll give the other settings a try and update the review if there are any problems. From what I recall these 7 inch blades are recommendend only for rough cutting.All in all, I am pretty happy with the purchase and the way I see it, these blades give me one more reason to not get a miter saw :-)"},{"rating":"1","title":".coms or .bombs","review":"excelent info,but dated,should b updated,many years have passed and new things are here.i worked w mark layton 15 years ago and he was a leader and well informed,daisytek has changed to pfs web now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad packaging","review":"I bought this chest along with the console and mirror, and magazine rack end table.

It's interesting how Forsyth managed to blend in the character of Sam Mcgeedy in all the four sub stories in one book. Particularly my favourite is the first two stories which involves a phony russian defections and Sam Mcgreedy involvement in a 'cross border exchange gone wrong' in Berlin. Highly intense!The detail of the story on how the procedure are done in the intelligence community prooves his thorough research on the book. This is rewarded by an overwhelming attachment and sense of realism from the reader. It is really difficult to put this book down, once you started it. Highly recommended for those who seek realism and detailed process in espionage action story."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Totally Different Experience By Forsyth","review":"In this book, the GrandMaster of espionage story had set an untouchable target to be achieved by others in his field.Sam Macready, the Deceiver, once the head of the disinformation desk is being expelled from his position because of the end of Cold War. However, the Deceiver is not going out so easy. By putting some of his great achievements as points, his assistant tries to defend his Boss.Forsyth is so detail in his storytelling as always in explaining the Deceivers information.No matter what my review can give idea to others, Frederick Forsyth is still the very best and the ultimate idol of mine in espionage and international crisis novelist.Try to read one chapter, and you would end up finishing the whole book craving for more."},{"rating":"2","title":"the deceiver","review":"Well Frederick Forsyth has done it again, great book was difficult to put down.

There was tape with what looks like wrapping paper stuck to the book as well.

ENLIGHTENMENT GUARANTEED was suggested for a more positive experience after I hated Leigh's Another Year. Brave woman to recommend it. I love this movie. How can European directors and actors come up with such a human and loving depiction of what could be treated -- by someone else -- as a negative sleazy downer? The relationship between the two brothers is a marvel --- it was like seeing two actual guys who had known and been fond of each other for many years. I love this movie. The determined Zen of one is played off against the determined \\"oh well, what the hell\\" of the other --- and that's the joy of it --- nobody wins over anyone else.

I am SO glad I did. This incredibly funny, yet poignant movie goes right to the heart of what zen is about, not so much through dialog and lecturing, but by example played out by the characters. Like her other films, the filmmaker displays her film in ways that can not be mistaken. Great footage of Japanese Monasteries and cities make the confusion of our german protaganists highlighted and totally amusing. I highly recommend this film for those who have ever raised the thought of enlightenment, as well as for those who simply want an enjoyable journey in film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie!","review":"Another great movie by the German director and writer Doris Dorrie. Extremely wise. Inspiring. Moving and funny at the same time.Two brothers go to Japan: one seeks more enlightment, the other goes just for company, not to be alone at home after his wife left him.They find things and learn things they would never expect. Things turn out to be more simple than they thought, and more difficult at the same time.A great story, brilliantly told.I recommend it strongly to everybody!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Expensive for a matchbox","review":"I think 6.99 for a matchbox is expensive with an additional 7.00 or so for shipping.

It caused a General Windows Fault every time I tried to access my portfolio. I tried to uninstall Quicken 2002 and reinstall Quicken 99 (which had worked flawlessly for 4 years) and now it causes Windows to crash.Quicken technical help tried to charge me $2.00/minute to help me.

Why did I ever try to upgrade?"},{"rating":"1","title":"More problems with Quicken 2002","review":"I echo others that have had problems with Quicken 2002. I recently tried to upgrade from 2000 and like others have had problems with the data files being corrupted. Technical support has been no help. It seems that this is a common problem. The program will loose data or corrupt it and then you are lost. The only advice given by technical support is to start over and re-enter each account one at a time. This takes hours and hours. I did this and the program still has glitches. Intuit needs to do a better job of converting the files and making sure all past data can be transported from one version to another. Unlike others, running supervalidate or validate does not correct the problems. Data when recreating the main accounts is not available, such as what was in any retirement planning previously created or data in a home loan that might have been tied to certain accounts.

Having finallydecided to take the plunge and put all our finances on the computer, and figuring that Quicken was a well-known, well-respected name in financial software, we bought the Quicken 2002 Deluxe edition. Quite frankly, the program is awful.It is extremely buggy which is bad enough, but there is VIRTUALLY NO USER SUPPORT!!!! In order to find out how to overcome the bugs in the software, you must pay [per]/min (plus your long distance charges) to talk to someone who likely cannot help you.Unless you already know quicken and so don't need any help at all, I DO NOT RECOMMEND ANYONE BUYING THIS SOFTWARE."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY BUGGY! Don't waste your money","review":"The last 3 versions of Quicken have been very buggy. This one is no different. I would not recommend buying Quicken until they show some interest in quality. Considering the poor quality of the software, it is very disappointing that they offer no technical support.The biggest problem I have is that it won't print. All my other Windows applications print fine. I have also found arithmatic errors, and it crashes often under Windows ME (this problem has been fixed by upgrading to Windows XP.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have stayed at Deluxe 98","review":"I finally bought a bummer from Quicken. After staying at Quicken 98 all this time, I decided to upgrade to Quicken Deluxe 2002. What a waste of money! I purchased this mess back in July 2002, and have already reverted back to the 98 Deluxe version. 2002 is a cluttered, user-unfriendly interface. It automatically creates a list of Scheduled Transactions (an unmanageable one) which you have to fight with to go away The list of annoying and tedious \\"enhancements\\" is too long for this format. STAY AWAY from this version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Umm ... it doesn't crash often.","review":"I was a big fan of Quicken 5 years ago, but this version is abysmal. Features that are advertised on the box, but \\"discontinued\\", a user interface that takes some time to get used to, and a serious bug that I can't get anyone at Quicken to respond to. I created a 401k account, added two mutual funds, gave them both initial balances, then corrected the balances when I found my account information. The problem is that the updated amounts are correct in the register, but are not correct in any other reports. I can't get it to refresh the data in the reports without deleting the account.

I find it less intuitive and friendly than the previous versions and the layout of the My Finances page is not as good as Q2000. Then I found that the net worth reports and graphs are screwed up. How could Intuit release a product with such a glaring flaw? If you want to track anything with a home finance program wouldn't you want to know what you are worth? If I just wanted to balance my checking account I would use Excel.I have resisted going to MS Money because home finance is about the last software market left not dominated by Microsoft.

MYM served me well until both the system became outdated and I 'switched' through my bank to Quicken. What was a tremendous idea and approach 15 years ago now has evolved into layers and layers of complexity. While Quicken can be used for simple checkbook tracking and reconciliation, the menu-laden program seems much more difficult to use. I have now created a much simpler version within Excel which serves my simple purposes most simplistically. Quicken should offer a $9.95 feature-free checkbook version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Financial Tracking","review":"Intuit has made a great product greater, or so they claim. I would agree with them on this except for one thing: they didn't mention that some banks charge for account data submission. This means that some banks charge you if you want to get access to your financial records in Quicken format. Other than that, Intuit did a great job with their software. Its easy-to-use interface and helpful wizards are appealing to first-time users of Quicken. Powerful tools, such as up-to-date checkbook balancing, can make your life easier. I would certainly recommend this to consumers over Microsoft Money."},{"rating":"1","title":"My reaction to QuickBook Pro 2001","review":"I ordered this product when I started my own business.

They had every reason to expect that their interviews would be confidential. The Acknowledgments section makes it clear that not all the candidates gave permission for their names to be used, or that Mr. Fried even thought it necessary to ask them.A footnote tells us that the name of a millionaire trouble-maker has been changed.

If you are interested in true crime and history, this is a must read."},{"rating":"1","title":"A tacky job","review":"This is a dreadful book, full of cliches and sentimental filler, with no research behind it at all. All the information seems to have come from a really good book on the subject published a few years ago and still available from AMAZON.COM. It's called THE BOSTON STRANGLERS: THE TRUE STORY OF ALBERT DE SALVO AND ELEVEN SHOCKING MURDERS. I can't recommend that book highly enough--it's everything that this one is not: really thorough and deep research, and honest reporting, written as grippingly as a mystery novel, and absolutely accurate. Stay away from Sherman's book--it's a real stinker."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's all about the author","review":"I was interested in this book because I had read some other books about the Boston Strangler. So hearing from someone who was related to the case might have been interesting. It was not. The book seems to be more about the author -- and not the topic. Sherman seems to have a large ego and is more interested in making up things that might have happened. He also invokes talking ghosts, which is very weird and doesn't ring true for a supposed newsman interested in the truth. Also, if he works in the news business, why does he need a writer? I don't get it. Very disappointing for true crime fans. There are better books - there is one that came out a couple of years ago about the fact that there was more than one strangler and it is very well-researched, called The Boston Stranglers. Sherman's book seems destined for the remainder table."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rose for Mary book","review":"Thank you for prompt delivery this is a gift for my son in law.

Everytime I walk into a bead store I just want to go nuts - but I didn't really have all the tools and jargon necessary to really make a good start. This book is just what you need to take to the store to guide you through the shopping experience and the creation process once you get home.

Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST beginner book","review":"I purchased this book as a gift to a beginning beader. I am an experienced beader, and I found this book to have many things I wish I had when I first started beading. There is a description of the different shapes of beads and what their names are, rondelle, bicone, etc. There is also a scale diagram of the actual sizes of beads, 4mm, 6mm etc. Very helpful info.

Adam Beach was terrible, comical even!, as the stranded state trooper. Throw in a tough black dude, a womanizing creep, and 2 drunken losers and what you have is the Last Stop...oh yeah, don't forget to add the corpse into the plot for an additional comical element.

Lucky for me the directions for Bid Whist are in the begining of the book. The story is based on a group of friends and some not so friendly that meet weekly to play the game. There is a lot of drama in the lives of these players.Some play games and some get played. I like the main character. I liked the way she handled herself and her husbands affairs while trying to help her daughter who is confused and trying to figure life out for herself. This was a good read. I enjoyed it. It was inspirational, laugh out loud funny and the characters are some people you will know. Some you like and some you don't.Reviewed byDawnny"},{"rating":"2","title":"BRING ON THE QUEEN OF SPADE!","review":"I just finished reading this book and it blew me away!

At the time I was ready to play the game when she made a presentation about the book. I had to have this book! When I finished it I wanted more! This is one of the best books I have ever finished. She knew a lot about the game and the people who play the games. I finished the book in three sittings. I wanted to know what was going to happen next. Every chapter was exciting and every character had a meaningful role to play in this true to life story. What a good presentation of the African American life. My buddy and I talked about how all the characters were balanced and how there were evil and good mixed in together and what made them change their ways. In addition to all that Ellen knows how to play the game. It sounds like from meeting her and reading the book that she knows the games being played in life too! Keep up the good work and I wish you much success with your work."},{"rating":"2","title":"A bid whist players review","review":"This is so a good book, which tells the life and culture of the African American community in the mid west.

My grandsons (almost 4 and just 6), who live on a New England island farm with sheep, cows, chickens, and border collies just love this film and so do I. Containing a series of vignettes of a puppy's life from birth through to working dog, it presents a very engaging story for kids (and their grandparents). Although the narration can be a bit hokey (because it is from the dog's viewpoint), the locations, in the west country of England are gorgeous, the filming is good, and the situations are real. There is a bit of drama, a bit of humor, a little pathos, and lots of gentle lessons as well as a great and very true life story. I can't recommend this movie highly enough...it beats Disney's films for kids all hollow (rather violent and contrived). Please make more."},{"rating":"1","title":"About put me in a coma","review":"It's the DVD cover that sold this movie for me. I love puppies and I'm a sucker for animal movies. One of the best being Homeward Bound. But this movie seems more like hours worth of home video footage spliced together with HORRIBLE voice acting and narration put on top of it. The people that voiced theses characters are among the worst I have ever heard. Some of the accents these people came up with were just terrible. It would be much more enjoyable watching this movie on MUTE! But even then it's not very good. The camera work is very amateurish. The picture is often out of focus and they don't even do a good job at keeping the dogs on screen all the time.This movie is good for ages 2 and under.

Started your journey from Kelvin, you have to fight for goblins, chase for Iron Ring, and eventually, arrive at the Lost Valley of Hutaaka. The module provided a lot of materials to GAZ1 GRAND DUCHY OF KARAMEIKOS, which published one year later and the Gazetteer series brought D&D Campaign into a vast Mystara World in later days. The module is also provide mapsheet and counters for Goblin's War. (like playing war game) Highly recommended! Well, it is quite difficult to acquire an original book now.

It's hard to fathom, but true.Help won't open (maybe related to UFS and locating the help files). One of my transactions mysteriously un-reconciled and the re-reconcile function doesn't work.

After several failed attempts to use the Internet setup assistant in the program, I finally switched over to trying to manually configure my browser (IE 5.1 for OS X) to recognize Quicken as the proper application for the .qfx file once it's downloaded. It's necessary to go to Quicken help to find out how to do this, and even then, you have to watch Explorer closely during download to get the proper MIME type.After spending several hours trying to do this, the download finally triggered a launch of Quicken, and I was asked for a password. I tried all sorts of PIN numbers, account numbers, clearing out the PIN Vault, etc. No go.

Thus the inner liner can only be used with the disc attachments :) Too bad, but I still rate the unit a 5."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spectacular","review":"After reading lots of reviews, both here and at Consumer Reports, I decided that the best food processor to get was this one. When I got it home, I was NOT disappointed. I used to make hummus by hand (which is quite a chore) but this baby turns chick peas into paste literally in seconds. I love it. This is clearly a good machine. My only disappointment is that the attachments for the machine are made kind of cheaply out of very thin plastic. My KitchenAid stand mixer is so solid, and all the parts are so well made, that I expected the food processor to be the same. Don't get me wrong, the base is sturdy and heavy, and will probably last me a million years, but I imagine I will be replacing the attachments when they break in the future.Other than that very minor complaint (dropping it to 4 1/2 stars if I could rate it that) this is a spectacular machine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works the works!","review":"This thing has changed my whole outlook on cooking. It is so fast and powerful that I've had adjust my planning calculations and process things at the last minute to keep them fresher. I've used it to make everything from marinades to whole dinners, desert included. Even better for desert! What impressed me most is its \\"easy snap\\" design. Unlike the Cuisinart which I'd considered before, the main handle has almost no mechanical parts (e.g. springs and screws) which trap moisture and create steam inside not to mention make snapping on and off an exercise. Unlkie Cuisinart, the Kitchenaid does not require the lid to be off before the mixing bowl can be snapped off. One less step of work and whole lot of performance!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not For The Pros","review":"I had very high hopes for this Kitchen Aid food processor. I'd read many reviews that gave it high marks. And it is a fine machine for simple shredding or cutting tasks, but no better than my retired Cuisinart. It is a messy machine to clean, because the bowl lid has multiple grooves and ridges.It's fine for making hummus or dal, but if you want to make a loaf of bread with more than three cups of flour, this processor cannot handle the task. I have my eye on a Viking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eating Plastic","review":"I bought this because of the great reviews that I read here. I now wonder if some of those reviews were written by Kitchen Aid employees. This food processor sometimes does not chop all the food completely, some food tends to ride over the blades. The main blade has rubbed the bottom of the bowl and gouged out some of the plastic. When we use it to grate, the cutting disc rides up until the disc cuts the top portion of the bowl, dropping plasic chips into the food. The design of the grating discs (cutting discs) system is very poor.It only has one speed. This is a disadvantage. This will be our last Kitchen Aid."},{"rating":"1","title":"A lemon!","review":"I bought this KFP670 food processor to replace the seven-year-old Cuisinart. Boy, it was a huge mistake! The engine's blade post cracked after several months of chopping and mixing food and herbs. I never did receive the $30 rebate that Kitchen offered. This will be the last Kitchenaid machine for me. If you're looking for a good machine, DON'T buy a Kitchenaid."},{"rating":"1","title":"good motor , bad design","review":"I bought this after reading reviews and a lot of research. The main problem with this food processor is the all purpose blade has rubbed the bottom of the bowl and scraped of some of the plastic.

It does cut, chop the vegetables well."},{"rating":"1","title":"KitchenAid FKP 670 Junk","review":"I wish I could agree with all the other glowing reports about the KFP670, but mine did not run long enough to find out what it would do.

Next time I will get a Cusinart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Making the switch from Cuisinart to KichenAid","review":"When I wrecked by decade-old Cuisinart, I was all set to buy a newer model Cusinart to replace it. That is until I looked at various consumer reviews and decided to switch to KitchenAid (I have the KitchenAid large mixer, which has been reliable for many years). I'm thrilled with this model KitchenAid food processor and glad I made the switch. I ordered the black model to match all of my other appliances. The old Cuisinart looks like a toy compared to this model KitchenAid (to be fair, a comparable new Cusinart might be just as large and powerful.) The juicer is a plus; I'll be putting away two other electric juicers. The KitchenAid is fast, heavy (an asset) and quiet. Great new toy. I appreciated all the other comments, which helped me make my decision. Best yet...I ordered it from Amazon (free shipping plus a rebate) and it was delivered in LESS than two days! Could not believe it! Wonderful service. Thank you!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"KitchenAid Made in France","review":"Just a quick note to let people know that KitchenAid is made in France. I saw France listed on Amazon's website as being the place of manufacture and called KitchenAid's customer service number to verify. To some people, it doesn't matter. But it does to me. While I understand KitchenAid is highly thought of, I will not purchase items made in France and feel people should know this little-known fact and make their own decision."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy!

Lucy is a 5'3 98 lb pound soaking wet geek---sounds like a girl, not a woman. Instead of starting off with how her chocolate exploits led her down the road of becoming a bad girl, which she never becomes by the way, we just go straight into boring G rated dullsville and bypass any fun. I also couldn't stand her father, a brilliant surgeon with a mind like a sieve. I ended up throwing the book down before I got to the middle, not even going to pass this one on to my friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delicious!","review":"This was my first book by Jennifer Greene and it made me a fan!Lucy creates a new cocoa plant and when she tastes it's first batch of chocolate, Bliss, she knows she has a winner. She shares it with Nick, the owners grandson, and soon finds herself sleeping with him.Later she is not feeling quite right and she blames it on the chocolate. Which is partly true, since she is pregnant from that one night of passion with Nick.This book has a lot going for it. You have the relationship with Nick and Lucy. Also there are some secondary characters with their own issues thrown into the mix to make this and exciting story. It is fun and funny. Sweet and and exciting. I couldn't put it down. I can't wait to read the follow up story Blame it on Cupid!"},{"rating":"2","title":"nicely told...","review":"Lucy and Nick work together in a chocolate factory (Nick is the boss--or the boss' grandson anyways...). While experimenting with a new Chocolate (called 'Bliss') and celebrating, Lucy and Nick end up in bed together (but this happens before the story really starts). The story opens with Lucy getting out of bed and getting sick. Yup, you guessed it-she's pregnant, but she thinks/hopes it a stomach ulcer.The remaining story is a nice, little story of how two people who don't really know much about one another deal with the pregnancy, work, and family issues (including Nick's old fashion grandfather who thinks if a guy gets a girl pregnant, he should marry her...).Definitely check this book out if you're in the mood for a lite, cute, fun, and/or quick read."},{"rating":"1","title":"grammar errors","review":"\\"The guys were gathered around a big burl oak table, and at a glance, damnation, she could see they were all suits.Page 330, 2nd paragraph.Don't editors check these books for typo's and grammar errors????????

Nick explains several times how he would never be interested in Lucy. She says several times how Nick would never be interested in her. I kept reading hoping that the author would make this believable when they finally get together. She never did although I learned a lot about making chocolate.It's just no fun starting a book from the first knowing that the characters are so totally miss-matched!Even the secondary characters are boring. Her father, a brilliant surgeon who can't do anything in the real world. A cute cousin who needs her to tell him he is not gay. Her mom who no longer is interested in her brilliant husband the surgeon.Weird triangle between Nick's older brother & grandfather. The same story plays out with the older brother not marrying the mother of his child. Grandfather loses all respect. Nick doing the same thing with Lucy.

Jane Fairfax has always been a fascinating character, one whom I really preferred to the eponymous heroine of Emma. However, Aiken's prose does fall rather short of the mark, and she occasionally uses phrases that ring false or forsakes Austen's dry irony and understatement for the blatant forthrightness of the modern era. That said, only a reader with a fairly intimate knowledge of Austen's style will likely notice these gaffes, and the book remains an entertaining and engaging story of nineteenth century love and coming of age."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Jane Austen, but very good anyway.","review":"I really enjoyed this book on its own merits. Joan Aiken does a fairly good job of capturing Austen's writing style, although she doesn't mimic it perfectly. And she stays mostly faithful to the characters created by Austen, although there are some lapses. Overall, Jane Fairfax is an enjoyable romance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely well written in Austen-like style!","review":"Being the Austen fan that I am, I began searching for similar styles of writing and came across Joan Aiken's Jane Fairfax. I was delighted from the moment that I began reading this work and enjoyed EVERY WORD. I recommend this to anyone looking for an interesting viewpoint on the residents of Highbury and how Jane Fairfax's life unfolds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent close reading of Emma","review":"Joan Aiken's Jane Fairfax was a real suprise to me since I never really enjoyed Jane Austen characters with other writers. The fact that the book involves a relative existence in time with Emma which is one of Austen's most detailed books is hard enough but the author seems to capture several nuances of the experience of a relatively minor character. The author's close reading of Emma allows readers to enjoy Emma more after reading this novel. She posits that Emma's jealousy of Jane began when they were children and Emma's mother encouraged Jane's musical talent. This is a very perceptive and interesting hypothesis and an excellent example of Aiken's subtle and sensitive observation."},{"rating":"2","title":"A most delightful perspective!","review":"I had just finished reading a sequel to another Jane Austen novel, \\"Presumption\\", and was really not expecting much after being so disappointed it the sequel to P & P. (though by a different author) I was very much surprised by Jane Fairfax! I started the book and could not put it down until I finished the whole thing. I liked how the first half described her childhood and her experiences with the Campbells and then the second half was Jane Austen's Emma through her eyes. She told the story tastefully and I dare say that Austen would be proud of the effort. I at first thought that Emma W. was portrayed in a bad light, but after reading the whole story, you really sympathize with JAne and her feelings toward Emma.

Little did I know, however, the extremes of bad writing which the author is able to delve into. The characters are far worse than those of even a typical supermarket-checkout-stand-paperback novel: one-dimensional, boring, and at times, completely annoying. The plot moves along like a slug through table salt, and it's as painful to read as it is to watch that slug turn into a mound of sludge. The only good parts of the novel are those in which the pieces are fitted together: the coin, the wood in the house...

As it stands, \\"Collectives in A Forsaken Landscape\\" (which was thankfully changed from the original \\"Collectives in A Foresaken [sic] Landscape\\") is a poorly written collection with nearly incomprehensible syntax, grammar and imagery. Sentences that could be summarized in a few words go on for a paragraph or more make it a nearly impossible read. If possible, it's certainly not enjoyable. The sheer verbosity of it is enough to suggest that words were being chosen to allude to writers like Lovecraft and Poe (which the author seems to want to mimic) because the syntax, grammar and story were lacking so badly. It's not the vocabulary that is unreadable, but the way in which it is constructed. Once the story is edited it may be a good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"MY EYES!","review":"The violations of even the most clear grammatical rules of the English language will leave the reader stabbing pencils into his eyes.An attempt that should prove, once and for all, that not all efforts are rewarded or worth repeating, and that not everyone should be a writer or editor. Some peoples' work is better left unshared with the world. This piece tops that list."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good, but not what I wanted","review":"This is a very good book if you're into engineering for larger audiences (halls, etc). I was looking for a car audio related book, but I did keep it since one day it may indeed come in handy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A darn good book.","review":"I've run sound at church and play in a Christian rock band, but I never quite grasped the concepts of sound design and how the equipment works until I read this book. I may not be able to walk into Carnegie hall and EQ the room as well as a seasoned pro, but I understand the basics: how Ohm's law works and why it's important, what channel inserts do, and why sometimes there's a fourth dial on a 3-band EQ. White has a good sense of humor and kept me laughing through most of the book. That's more than I can say about most technical manuals."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rarest Of The Rare","review":"This has to be one of the rarest CD Albums by Madonna, initially only for promotion, was then released commercially ONLY in Germany and the USA. Some copies did circulate to other countries via importing. Beautiful 3D cover that will take your breath away, compliments the actual contents of the CD - one of Madonna's best albums - EVER."},{"rating":"2","title":"The He Said / She Said Team Is Back","review":"Without a doubt - Josie Lloyd and Emlyn Rees know how to do the \\"HE SAID / SHE SAID\\" thing. They hit a home run with \\"Come Together\\" and \\"Come Again\\" - and without a doubt .... \\"The Boy Next Door\\" is a good follow-up to their major success. True - it's not better than their previous work (that would take a lot) but it's a really nice try.This childhood love story of Mickey and Fred is really sweet and refreshing. Mickey and Fred grew up next to each other and experienced all their first together. They thought nothing would ever bring them apart. Well ---- cut to 15 years later and they aren't even \\"friends\\" anymore. Of course - circumstances bring them back together and that's when the fun starts. This is a warm and charming love story that really lets you into the minds of both main characters, and you have the good fortune to have them written by each member of the opposite sex.Nice follow-up effort for these two great and talented writers. Cheers!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Husband and Wife Team","review":"Mickey is divorced, has a young son and runs a flower shop.

They were the best of friends - knew everything about each other. They were getting closer every day and knew their lives would be spent together.But all that changed when with no warning, Fred and his mother disappeared and Mickey was left without a word.Written by a husband and wife and told in alternating chapters, this is a good book on friendship, love and second chances."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kathy Smith is not a belly dancer","review":"If you want to learn belly dance, then take classes from someone who knows what they're doing. Don't buy a video from someone who has taken a few lessons and doesn't know how to dance. I'm sure her knowledge of fitness and exercise is fine. Kathy Smith just isn't a dancer. Even at the low-low price of $9.98, this video is over-priced. In my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kathy is not a dancer, but it is still good!","review":"I bought the video and now I am going to buy the DVD since I no longer have VHS. I thought the video was great, I just had superficial problems with it. For example, Kathy's top isn't tight enough to see her arm movements, but that is okay because we can see the other dancers movements nicely. Now, this is a beginners/intermediate workout so don't expect to be burnt out unless you don't exercise regulrarly. Also, the other dancers don't have rock hard bodies or a model bodies. I thought it was better then the Veena and Nina and Rana videos. I also enjoyed te music and the stage setting."},{"rating":"2","title":"good workout","review":"I believe this is still a good workout even thought KS is not a bellydancer. I got this video when it first came out and use it when I am low on time, it is broken down into two twenty minute workouts. Also the 10 minute stretch at the end is very nice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best bellydance dvd out there","review":"I've tried all the bellydance dvds out there and by far, Kathy Smith takes the cake. She gets expert advice from Bellydance Superstar Ansuyu, a bellydancer since age 4, and Kathy breaks down the moves so they are easy to follow. Kathy Smith is also a guru in the exercise industry so you know you are working all body parts. You learn a slow and sensual dance after then Heat it Up with a 20 minute cardio bellydance workout and makes you sweat but not too hard. The cool down incorporates yoga and pilates and I absolutely love it! I do this tape every day and look forward to it every time. I don't cringe or make up excuses not to exercise. This is a genuinely FUN exercise dvd. You'll fall it love with it. Best exercise dvd purchase I've made to date. December 2004"},{"rating":"1","title":"So Sad","review":"It is so sad to see someone try so hard to make a good video where they can't even dance. I dont know what she was thinking, but someone should have told her that she looked ridiculous trying to teach what she does not know. She is crazy for having her Belly Dance Instructor as a background dancer, what was she thinking?? Gosh, the whole time the background dancers out-danced her. LOL, I saw her Merenge-Salsa video, and its the same shame. I am a professional Latin Dancer, born into the dance, and honestly she does need to stick to what she knows. She is so stiff,its funny to watch her dance. Get this DVD for a workout only, believe me even if you are a beginner I am sure you'll out-dance her too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Appealed to me..........","review":"I gotta say I enjoyed this one. I thought it had a nice flow, and, in the faster portion, it was like doing a dance. Kathy is just so endearing to me. She's willing to get out there and do her thing, even if she looks goofy. She always seems confident, and like she's having a good time. I thought she cued well.Is she a perfect bellydancer? No, but, she's probably like a lot of people who haven't studied bellydance for very long. She's ok at the moves, if a bit stiff. It's nice to have the pros to watch for variety, and, something to aspire to.Though it does have the weaknesses that other reviewers have pointed out, this dvd will give you some bellydance basics, and a nice workout."},{"rating":"2","title":"good instruction and fun","review":"Although Kathy Smith is not a bellydancer, she has real bellydancers dancing with her(one being Ansuya) so you can watch them to get the fludity of the moves. I love this DVD and recommend it to anyone, because Kathy Smith is such a great teacher, but you get to dance the whole time...you're not standing there listening to the instructor talk...you're moving the whole time. I love that fact, because some dvds you are just waiting around with slow instruction. This has a 20 minute slow routine followed by a 3 minute slow dance to follow along with, then a 20 minute fast routine and an about 10 minute cool down of gentle yoga based stretching. There is also a tutorial with Ansuya and a solo performance by Ansuya."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Stuff!","review":"Fun!! This is a relaxing way to end a workout or do on your \\"off days\\". Great sensual dance that anyone can do, and your hubby or boyfriend will love to see what you've learned ;)"},{"rating":"1","title":"All other belydance videos are better than this","review":"I love to workout with videos and this past year tried bellydance videos, which has become my new hobby. There are many bellydance videos available on Amazon.com and this is by far the worst. There are bellydance workout videos by the twins, instructional bellydance videos by Jillina and The Goddess Workout by DOlphina which is a little of both and I would highly recommend all of these! These videos are done by professional bellydancers that have danced their entire lives perfecting the art. Bellydance is a great workout, but it is so much more than that and not something you can learn in 2 days and instruct other people. Kathy Smith is stiff, unsexy and uninspiring and unmotivational. If this is the only video I saw, I would not be inspired to bellydance. Though she does have an \\"expert\\" on the set, Kathy is still the instructor and she doesn't have what it takes to teach this bellydance video. Try any other video, really!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good introduction to belly dance","review":"This is a very good beginner's level workout. Surely Kathy is stiff and not so good at belly dancing, but the other dancers are pretty good, and their outfits are a pleasure to look at. This workout covered quite a few classic moves of belly dance, and the whole workout is very well structured, keeps you move and having fun and feeling feminine and pretty at the same time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the time it takes to watch","review":"Kathy Smith does not know enough about belly dancing to teach it. The most helpful part of the DVD is the tutorial that explains what you should be doing with your body when doing some moves. This part of the DVD is not taught by Kathy, but by an experience dancer. If the whole DVD were that detailed it would be 5 stars. I also feel that there was no enough attention give to keeping proper posture while dancing in order to prevent back injury."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best cd in a while","review":"This is easilly the best cd I've heard in a long time. It's nice to finally have a cd that isn't wore out after two listens. It seems like there is a lot of confusion of the tracks, which song is which, or whatever. My advice to you is put it in and push play. Don't skip through the ambience, stress over a lyric, or think about the song title. Just listen to it straight through, enjoy it, and appreciate it for being one of the best works of art that you'll listen to in a while."},{"rating":"2","title":"good cd but too much...","review":"i love this cd. dont get me wrong its a great cd but they should have more lyrics. the one thing i will critisize is the widow. best song on the album and than 3 minutes in they just play statiky mucis. great cd i still recommend it alot and love it"},{"rating":"1","title":"No thanks","review":"I don't need to hear Old Santana mixed with Zeppelin.This isn't new ground they're breaking, it's 30 year old music jammed together, and not well either.TMV don't write songs, they \\"write\\" parts and put them together and they come across as such.I found this cd to be utterly exhausting.I've listened to it no less than 12 times to see if it had any \\"grow on you\\" factor.I found that couldn't wait for it to end, much like a prison sentence.A for effort, I'm glad that the Volta's are pushing themselves musically.I just don't wanna go where they're headed.Carlos Santana, Jimmy Page, and Robert Plant called, they want their music back."},{"rating":"1","title":"A watered down \\"Mr Bungle\\"","review":"This album isn't really that bad, but it's not very good either. I have two main problems with it that ruin it.1. The singer. Put the Led Zeppelin, Rush, and U2 singer in a blender and it's not a good sound.2. It's sounds like Mr Bungle but not nearly as good. I have only made it through this album once and every other time I stop at track three because it sounds like Mr Bungle but not nearly as good. It's almost like these guys took everything good about Mr Bungle and combined it with generic 70's rock. I also doubt that The Mars Volta has many fans who have actually heard Mr Bungle.The bottom line is why would I listen to this when I could listen to Mr Bungle which is better in every single way? They also have a much better singer."},{"rating":"1","title":"ummm...","review":"this is probably the worst album ever. \\"like anyone could even know that...\\" well perhaps i'm being a tad liberal with the term \\"worst ever\\" but this is pretty pathetic. you guys must be smoking on that bubblegum and that sour disel, because this sounds absolutely retarded. its like a bunch of at-risk children got ahold of \\"Close To The Edge,\\" smoked some paint chips and chunks of dried airplane glue, picked up a SAT vocab study guide, had a circle jerk and upon cumming simultaneously had the epiphany to make the most pretentious, bloated album in recent years. if its rockin' your ears are cryin' for, check out The Futureheads, Death From Above 1979, Converge, etc. and if you are into the \\"weirdness\\" factor, try something less forced...e.g. Captain Beefheart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"I really don't see what's so great about this band. The guitarist is the only decent part of the band. The singer pisses me off especially. His voice is annoying. I wasn't sure what I was hearing when I heard his \\"voice\\", and his lyrics are downright awful. Sometimes it seems like he just grabbed random sentences and tossed them together. The other 2 members are nothing special either. This is proof that salsa and progressive punk don't fit together at all. If you want good progressive rock, listen to King Crimson or Pink Floyd. Avoid this overrated garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"The all-around best Mars Volta album.","review":"...if you love the Mars Volta as I do, you will love this record. It's out of this world mind-blowing. Also, I think I prefer Jon Theodore's drumming to Thomas Pridgen. Technically speaking, speed-wise, and bombastic power - I would have to go to Pridgen...but creatively speaking, Jon, I think, has more imaginative patterns and a wider use of hi-hats and cymbals and an incredible groove when necessary. I have every album made by the Mars Volta excluding \\"Amputechture\\"...I can't wait to get it. I have heard all the songs on that record and I still feel Frances the Mute is the Magnum Opus. The ideas, the melodies, the techniques, the mind & body-bending tempo changes and time signatures, the sheer passion that's being punched through each and every instrument is simply awe-inspiring. I could go on and on...bottom line: It's a great classic album, with fantastically creative musicians playing their hearts out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Out of context","review":"Bashing this record just for the prog rock aversion vision, is just plain prejudice, because by now you probably know what you're getting into when buying this record, virtuosity, experimentation, jamming.. etc.That being said, if you have a short attention span, it's obvious you won't like this record, It would be like bahing a ramones record just because there a no guitar solos, or complex song structures. Just listen to the record in the proper context, We all know Omar is one selfish musician, but he has made a really interesnting effort nevertheless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Correct track info","review":"There's been a lot of confusion over the tracks and how they map to the CD indexes. The correct track listing is as follows:1. Cygnus....Vismund Cygnus (13:02)2. The Widow (5:50)3. L'Via L'Viaquez (12:21)4. Miranda That Ghost Just Isn't Holy Anymore (13:09)5-12. Cassandra Gemini (32:31)In other words, the only track broken into separate CD tracks is \\"Cassandra Gemini.\\" To increase confusion, it's broken into 8 track (5-12), yet the booklet lists 5 sub-sections of the song. These obviously do not map appropriately. The CD artwork also incorrectly lists the song as \\"Geminni\\" instead of \\"Gemini.\\" This was corrected on the vinyl 2LP release.Adding yet more confusion, the CD DataBase (CDDB) and Gracenote (used by RealPlayer, Winamp, Windows Media Player, etc. to identify tracks on your computer) has the CD tracks listed wrong, e.g. using the sub-sections of \\"Miranda\\" as separate CD tracks. This is incorrect. \\"Miranda\\" in only track 4. The lyrics in the CD booklet confirm this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another brilliant Album","review":"The great thing about the Mars Volta, Is that they're doing their own thing, Not being changed by latest trends in music or the next in thing, just going out their and doing their own thing and selling records, which is a very hard thing to do. Maximum Respect.This is just a brilliant album, a great listen.One of the very few albums these days which is worth the price of the album.Only gets 4 stars , Because im really not into listening to white noise for long periods."},{"rating":"1","title":"An amazing song, on an AWFUL album","review":"I dont care what everyone else wants to call it, this cd is crap. Im pissed i didnt use my money for a better cd. I guess it would not be so frustrating if they hadn't of done such a good job with widow. But the rest of the cd is horrible.I dont understand how people can classify this as music when im sitting here, listening to over 4 minutes of erie tones. I think it would be wiser, less costly, and just as \\"intriguing\\" to buy the song on iTunes, and go buy a halloween cd with the erie tones on it. Overall, i just wish i could get my damn money back!My GradeF"},{"rating":"1","title":"I used to like Mars Volta....","review":"a lot...then i bought this cd. Let me prepare you for whats in store if you buy this album. Every song on the album is great once it starts...i say once it starts because it takes most songs 2-3 minutes before we actually get to lyrics. I would say probably half of the cd sounds like they paid some 11 year old to warp sounds and make noise. The widow...is great until after the 3 minute mark when the last 4 minutes of the song is just noise. I highly suggest borrowing from friend instead of buying. Because i promise if you like music and not noise your going to want at leat 30 minutes of your life back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can I give it NO stars?","review":"The Mars Volta's new album \\"Frances the Mute\\" is truly regressive rock. By 1975 punk had already declared rock of this ilk obsolete, apparently the Mars Volta did not get the memo. This band combines the worst aspects of Rush, Led Zeppelin, Hawkwind and Yes with the pitful, self hating lyrics of Korn and the Deftones. I could care less about how instumentally gifted these blokes are or how much pain they seem to be in. This album is truly wretched, derivative and pathetic. No one needs this album and I would not want to meet anyone who does."},{"rating":"1","title":"wow!","review":"wow! it's amazing how one of the most incredible bands of the last decade (At The Drive-In) split into two halves, with each turning to complete garbage after only 2 albums apiece. sparta's first album, \\"wiretap scars,\\" was pretty good (pushing the catchy punk side of ATDI), and mars volta's first album, \\"deloused in the comatorium,\\" was just amazing (pushing the prog-experimental side of ATDI. this was one of my favorite albums of the last 5 years, hands down). well, no surprise with sparta's second album, \\"porcelain,\\" they went even further into pop-crap territory and basically lost my attention forever. similarly, with \\"frances the mute,\\" mars volta have gone even further into prog-crap territory, and i fear, have probably lost my attention forever as well.ATDI you will be missed. sorry but this album is f*cking awful. only a few meager bits (and i mean, a couple sparse minutes here or there) of compelling music doesn't cut it for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"ummmmmmmmm","review":"well, i don't know what exactly to say about this album. it's just bad, and not just mediocore it's really bad. i can barely get through this grotesque monster of an album. i guess if you throw a bunch of wierd noises and half baked ideas together into really long songs you are instantly a genius. i have no problem with wierd music but this just isnt music, it's a crappy jam band dumped into a vat of toxic waste. If you want to listen to some good, wierd music listen to bands like can, captain beefheart, the fiery furnaces, or just about anything else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Prog Rock is back","review":"This is pretty awful. Perhaps if you think Pink Floyd's Animals is a great album you might like this. It is a mish mash of different songs in thrown together to make one song. Not like a blend of different styles. No they play one song like let's say it sound like Queen and then the same song goes to a mellow mexican type song. Then back to the Queen song then back to the mellow mexican style song. Perhaps if you were taking a lot of drugs this might be clever but to me it has the value of a 30 minute drum solo."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Want My $$$ Back","review":"I don't get what everyone is raving about.

Best rock band out there? Mars Volta is a concept, a supergroup that sound great on record, but live, they can hardly pull off the material. Guitarist Omar Rodriguez is carrying most of the weight in this band, and to tell you the truth, I don't think he knows how to play guitar. When he was in At the drive in, he could get as crazy as he wanted, but still Jim Ward, Paul Hinojos and Tony Hijjar would provide coherence to the chaos. In Mars Volta albums, he depends too much on John Fruciante, bad thing he is not part of the band. Mars Volta is probably modern's day Steely Dan. Saying all that, the record is amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Greatest Albums In 30 years!","review":"I used to be into lots of very bad music, bad bad bad. But a friend of mine has sort of shaped my musical taste, and this was the first CD he gave to me (An accident of sorts, due to the fact he bought two more copies than he needed). So, I took the CD, thinking,\\" eh, it'll probably be interesting.\\" So I listened to it, and with the simple mind that I had, I just couldnt wrap my mind around the gem that I held before me, so I put it away in my CD case. A few weeks later, I went on vacation, and I decided to listen to it again. I was amazed by everything going on in this album, I kept listening to it, and listening to it, everything opening up around me, it was beautiful. So, if you want to improve your musical taste and expand your mind, pick this one up, it's absolutely amazing and definitely deserves a spot in history as one of the greatest albums, EVER!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"These boys are on the drugs and creating great music.

The have elements of jam bands, psychedelic rock, classic rock, and Latin rock. And they are genius enough to make it work. It's reminiscent of Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, Phish/Grateful Dead, Santana, the Doors and so much more. The lead singer, Cedric, has a mind-blowing falsetto voice. Ikey plays the organ remarkably like Ray Manzarek but more jazz\\\\blues influenced. Omar, the guitar player, is incomparable. He is like a new breed of guitar virtuosos. Altogether, the Mars Volta are in a category all their own. They are simply amazing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album...Could be better with less fluff","review":"Do not listen to anyone who says this album is terrible or unlistenable. The songs themselves, when you get down to them are great. Creative lyrics generate some interesting imagery, some excellent baselines and guitar riffs with emotional singing. But everyone of these songs are TOO LONG!!! But they need not be, this album could be at least 30 minutes shorter and lose nothing at all. Each song has needless fluff at the beginning, end, and sometimes the middle of the music. Sometimes there just barely audible sounds that add nothing to the music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Damn, this is horrible","review":"Seriously. I bought it for $8 thinking 'what the hell?'. I'm big on post-rock and ambient. Reading these reviews I was hoping for something in that vein. I'm Texan, too.Hearing it, my expectations were proven wrong. Okay. That's fine. Good music is good music.Then I didn't like it and listened to it again. Still bad.I've listened to it three times all the way through, pieces more, and it's still not doing it.I'm inclined to not listen to it anymore. It completely lacks spirit, and, simply, doesn't work on every level.I've never been a fan of 'prog', so-called, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Point of no return","review":"This is how I knew that Cedric and Omar were done with being great. At the Drive-in was special. And Deloused in the Comatorium showed some promise as a follow-up after that band broke up. But this CD literally put me to sleep the first two times I tried to listen to it. The songs are too long and completely forgettable. And you get the sense that the band is just jamming in the studio, improvising like they didn't show up with real material and just faked their way through the album. But hey, if that's your thing, waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really that great.","review":"This album is mediocre... I don't see myself listening to it very much in the future. The old album was much better because it had actual music on it while this one... doesn't.But hey if you want long drawn out periods of build up (like 3 minutes or so in each song) or if you'd like a bunch of artistic noises (another 3 minutes in each song)... \\"Hey wait... that leaves hardly any music at all in the album... That is like half of every song! Wtf!\\" Yeah thats what you will be saying when you realize you just payed money for some fool to hit random keys on his electric keyboard.Well if you ARE a mars volta fan then buy this album (but expect to be dissapointed)-- otherwise don't give it the time of day unless you are majoring in art.My suggestion is to go out and buy a Blood Brothers album instead of this.

Rush should be proud of the musical monsters they helped create.

The more you listen to it, the more rewarding it becomes. I can't stop listening to L'Via L'Viaquez...makes me want to turn the volume to 11 every time I hear it (esp. the drums....WICKED).

I loved De-Loused in the Comatorium, that album was crazy but at least it had \\"songs\\" on it. This is just space junk and spooky sound effects with a few \\"song\\" moments floating around somewhere within.Whats worse is the cd jacket is totally misleading as to how the tracks on the album are broken down. Most of the time I just sit here asking myself what the hell is going on.This album is so overrated. Yes, the orignality is there, but the endless jamming and weird effects that last forever really detract from the album. Make sure you keep your finger glued the \\"forward\\" button on your cd player because you are going to find yourself skipping through minutes of useless noise to get to the good parts."},{"rating":"1","title":"a drum lesson","review":"People desperately want there to be a resurgence of epic rock music and for that reason are calling this terrible album a masterpiece. It feels like a bunch of disjointed riffs and sound effect noodling thrown together with terrible guitar solos by in between. Jamming with this guitarist must be the most frustrating thing in the universe but you'll appreciate that after listening to this because the whole album is basically a jam session that features an incredible drummer but otherwise musicians who are trying to be something they are not. In fact the drums are the most prominent instrument on this album. 5 stars for the drummer, 1 star for the insipid lyrics and non musical garbage of the rest of the album."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Formula","review":"A few good songs here and there. But it's way too hard to get past the pretensiousness.The formula: read Edgar Allen Poe, experiment with drugs (or even better get hooked), and get that fabulous herion shek look. Then listen King Crimson, Yes, and various punk bands. Then take any idea that pops to mind like it is the greatest insight ever and everyone else is too stupid to figure out; then voala- you have something totally pretentious and abnoxious.Some folks will write reviews about how this music has the mark of genius! Then you'll believe your hype so much that you will make albums that get worse and worse but it will be masked by with obsurd explainations of how its over everyones heads.This is a talented band that needs to edit their songs and stop emualating old ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anything but cohesive","review":"Two stars because their ability to attract so much attention.I tried, really I did.

Its mixing of it is bad, it sounds like they just put on the mixer and put the bass and drums and everything else and just put it together, theres no sound that you can connect to and its very hard to follow the music, its all over the place fast , slow, theres no way to get into the music because its just that bad to listen to, IM sorry but this is bad, I cant say it any other way except the only good thing about this cd is I paided 7.99 for it which is about 7.00 to much, dont get it thats all I can say,"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hideous.","review":"If it were possible to give an album negative stars, I can think of none more deserving than this one.

I came across this group and album by sheer luck and I can't pass a day without listening to it. The album just kicks some serious arse.However, as been noted in previous comments, there are tracks that just wonder off in some funky loop that feels like it will never end. Like the last 3 minutes of \\"Cygnus\\". The last 2 1/2 minutes of \\"Widow\\". The first 3 1/2 minutes of \\"Miranda\\". The last minute of \\"L'Via L'Viaquez\\". What is that about? Perhaps I don't get the trippiness of it all. In anycase, I can't be far away from my player controls because I need to run back and skip those sections.But even with those approx 10 minutes of \\"wuh?\\", the tracks just kick it. I'm going back now to buy some of their older stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"an intial listen was fufilling yet somewhat dissatissfying","review":"_Deloused_ and _Tremulant_ are better than this album by a longshot. The majority of _The Fall Of Troy_'s works are also superior to this, so i would reccomend obtaining their music instead of this. Mars Volta is still kewl tho, they just need to cut out the long noise segments and replace it with something more interesting musically (I wouldnt say no to something created while under the influence of illegal substances -- it did a world of good for _Deloused_)~ d:Peace ^.^"},{"rating":"2","title":"The actual MUSIC on this album is amazing.","review":"Here's the thing with The Mars Volta: they are incredibly talented, and the music is amazing. However, they often try too hard to be \\"artistic\\" and that ends up with them being labeled \\"hipster prog\\", etc. Take the song \\"Miranda\\" from this album. Amazing song. But the four minutes of random ambient noise before the music comes in...what does that accomplish? Nothing. I just have to skip ahead four minutes before listening to that song. If they got rid of nonsense like that, this would be one of the best bands in the world. \\"L'via L'viaquez\\" is a masterpiece. Despite that annoyance, the music speaks for itself, and this is a great album. I just want a version with all the random 4 minute sections of white noise and sirens are cut out, so I can enjoy the actual music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"Many people complain about The Mars Volta because of songs they have that are mostly instrumental music, but that's what makes the album so great. The music! not just the lyrics, because we all know those are great. I love this album its just awesome, i listen to it no matter what mood I'm in. The Mars Volta is truely an amazing band. If you dont appriciate them for their music, than you dont know one thing about good music, because its not just about the hit single, people could care less about that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some bands just need a good producer.","review":"Omar's excesses need reigning in, or he just goes off on meaningless tangents. It's like Morrissey in The Smiths, with Johnny Marr to keep him in line (great), and Morrissey left to his own angst-ridden excesses (self-indulgent, meandering and very uneven). Rick Rubin--the great producer who did the solo Johnny Cash records--kept \\"De-loused\\" on track and made every minute count. I'm afraid this record has gone the way of solo Morrissey records: self-indulgent, meandering and very uneven. 'Tis a pity. Some people's egos just demand that they have a producer to keep them on track. This band is a good example."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW","review":"This CD is one of the best ive ever heard!! it blows DITC out of the water. Its wierder more musical and just cooler. 5 songs streched over 77 minutes and the last one over a half hour its heavy listing but well worth it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Album Ever","review":"Frances the Mute by the Mars Volta in my opion is the single best album that I have ever listend to. This music hits everypart that you want it to, it has its slow points that drag you in and make you comfortable then a rapid tempo change and the drums go off and the music instatley changes in a split second. The trumpet and orchestra parts just add so much to the album that if they weren't there it would be complete. I also enjoy the spanish in the beging of L' Via L' Viaquez it really captuvates the listners and wants you begging for moreSimply put best album ever the Mars Volta really had to try hard to cap De-Loused In The Comatorium but they sure did it with Frances the Mute and then some."},{"rating":"2","title":"AN ACQUIRED TASTE...BRILLIANT ALBUM","review":"this is not an album that most people like right away. It does take some getting used to. The songs do drag on at times, but overall frances the mute (in my opinion) is one of the most poignant, inventive, and powerful album i have EVER heard. I feel very proud of the fact that my fellow latinos have recorded some of these songs in spanish.

Anyway, the track listing on this website is way off. The first track is actually all four segments of Cygnus, the second track is The Widow, the third being L'Via, the fourth is actually the four segments of Miranda, and the last 7 tracks are all Cassandra.

Incredible, Fearless, Unstoppable... the Mars Volta RULE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"hey those of you wanting deloused volume 2","review":"this is not it, so don't give it a crappy review just because it doesn't sound exactly like deloused. first of all the band has said many times that they want to PROGRESS with their music, not stay in the same plac. So.. if you want to listen to a band pump out the same cd, with a different title, every year or so, go listen to green day because this is not for you. That said this cd is amazing !!! cygnus and casandra are the major highlights while miranda and L'via are right up there.And every one needs to get their hands on the decoder song which is freakin awesome, i wish it would have come in a package with the cd because everyone needs to hear this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Damn good","review":"I am NOT a fan of At The Drive In's style of music. When I first heard about The Mars Volta I was interested until I found out 2 of the band members used to be in ATDI. So I just forgot about the band figuring it would be more pop-punk crap. However, with this album my curiousity overcame my reservations and I checked it out (its $6.99 pricetag at Best Buy didn't hurt either) and I was VERY pleasantly surprised. This album is the best of 2005 so far, and I think it will be hard to beat. Of course, this style of music is not for everyone and many people will hate this, but I think its fantastic. I can't wait for their CD single thats going to come out (entitled Frances The Mute, it is a 3 part song). They are calling it the \\"decoder\\" for this album.For anyone who has the CD, inside the case, where the CD is held, you see a list of 3 tracks and some lyrics? Those are the lyrics and stuff for the single.I will definitely be checking out De-Loussed now that I've heard this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly dissapointing","review":"I wasn't expecting TMV to top \\"De-Loused...\\" since, in my opinion, that album is pure genius. But even with my realistic expectations, I was definitely dissapointed with \\"Frances...\\". Whether or not anyone wants to admit it...\\"Deloused...\\" has \\"hooks\\" in their songs. Combining that fact with their incredible skills(especially the drummer, damn he's good!) and creativity, it made for a mind-blowing album. \\"Frances...\\" has no hooks. It's completely boring. Not to mention there is way too much filler such as bird sounds that seem to last forever. I can't help but think that this is a result of not having someone like Rick Rubin(producer of De-loused) there to tighten the reigns and give some valuable input into their song writing.Plain and simple...I just can't get into any of these songs no matter how many times I listen to it. \\"De-loused...\\" is a masterpiece and I can only hope that TMV get's back on track to writing quality material again."},{"rating":"2","title":"GET THIS ALBUM.......MIND BLOWING","review":"Im not going to rant and rave about this..Its this simple no other band has the talent to pull off such an amazingly epic album..As well as their debut this is a classic.This album is like listening to a space shuttle heartling through space with a salsa band dancing inside.

The album is pratcially one 77 minute drugged out jam that is diificult to listen to. It does though have handful spralling and engaging moments but that is usually neglected by long periods of silence or pshydellica tweaks thats makes this 77 minute effort seem like 3 hours. decent in its own right but ntohing reaches the catharatic and grooving heights of DE-Loused.underwhelming"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sleeping With The Light On","review":"Busted's latest CD, Sleeping With The Light On is a great mix of pop and punk music.

It is a very well constructed novel that forced me to finish it within an afternoon (and being an English major in college, that sort of free-reading time is hard to come by!)

To further his own goal of becomming published, this boyfriend encourages Angel to apply for a position at a successful literary agency. Angel gets the job, and in so doing, finds a purpose in life. But this agency is filled with wacky co-workers and a malignant boss. Though I found Angel's tolerance for her boss, co-workers and boyfriend beyond annoying, I kept reading for the simple reason that I identified with Angel's passion for books. All the oddball characters surrounding this book lover notwithstanding, as the story unfolded, the little mysteries held my attention.This is no literary masterpiece.

I thought the writing was good in places, but the love story plot line is so badly drawn I thought for a long time it was supposed to be a spoof (similar to the \\"blind submission\\" sections).The characters are either evil (Lucy), weak (Angel), crazy for unexplained reasons (Malcom, Anna), or one dimensional (Damiano).The mystery of the \\"blind submission\\" should be clear to most readers by the mid-point of the book. Several red herrings are thrown in but only the characters in this book are really silly enough to believe them.All in all, I really thought this book was worse than a waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulously Fun!","review":"This was a cute, feel good novel. I thoroughly enjoyed it despite the fact that the summary is a tad misleading. I purchased this novel thinking it was a suspense, thriller type book and was surprised to discover that nobody dies or is maimed or even wounded (just some hurt pride here and there). The story mostly takes place in a literary agency following Angel, a book worm turned editor and her struggles with an absolutely horrible boss. The evil boss and the office going ons got repetitive at times but all the drama with the authors and the boyfriend and the mystery novel that appears to be copying Angel's life kept me on the edge of my seat rushing to find out what would happen next. The sexy Italian guy did not hurt matters either. Truly a happy, fun novel that will entertain the reader page by page with an ending that will make one smile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Interesting and Fun","review":"Blind Submission by Debra GinsbergEven though Angel walked into the job from hell, with completely unrealistic expectations from her boss and very strange coworkers, the book still made me want to work at a literary agency!This is a fun, smart, chick-lit mystery - a step up from the usual.

Maybe if it ever is on Blu-Ray and wide screen it may be worth the money, in this form it is not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sheena Was Made To Showcase Tanya Roberts","review":"Sheena wasn't made to win any Academy awards. Nevertheless, for a \\"B\\" film the photography is actually quite good. Granted, Tanya's acting ability at this time in her life needed a lot of work. I'm sure the producers were aware of this going in and didn't care. They knew the attraction would be to watch Sheena doing her thing in her jungle outfit. Tanya was the perfect choice considering the reason for the film. Sheena was made to showcase Tanya Roberts stunning physical attributes and was successful in this regard. She is the reason the movie is still moderately popular after 20 years. So if you like this type of eye-candy film, enjoy! It wasn't meant to be anything else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great looking DVD","review":"Okay, you don't watch this for a magnificient plot nor review it like you would a epic blockbuster. That said, someone at Columbia Pictures must really love this film because the digital transfer is gorgeous, except for the opening credits (which start a quarter hour into the movie) and closing credits: these scenes have a lot of \\"dirt\\" on the print. Other than those, it is a flawless transfer. You get anamorphic widescreen on one side and full screen on the other. Subtitles in English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese(!), Korean(!), & Thai(!!),(evidently the film is big in the Far East). The music score is beautiful and far beyond what you'd expect for this kind of movie. Yes, there is a cheesy model helicopter crash and the horse is painted like a zebra; however, a great looking DVD for a \\"guilty pleasure\\" movie. Check your brain at the door and enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Go Tanya Roberts!","review":"OK, this movie might not be to everyones taste, but it definitely fits mine. It has an exceptionally beautiful woman, great location, simple good vs evil plots, and good old fashioned man/woman chemistry. All that and I haven't even mentioned the memorable music score which fits the movie perfectly (and which sadly is no longer available for general purchase).This may not be a big budget movie, it may have uncomplicated themes, but thats exactly what draws me to this movie. For me, there is something about this movie that is different, yet charming. I think this type of wonderful charm can result in different viewer experiences and responses.Thank you for making this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rumble in the Jungle","review":"If you like a good Jungle flick, this isn't it. The only saving grace is Tanya Roberts showing her assests (nude) in the movie, so if you missed Roberts centerfold spread this dvd will do."},{"rating":"1","title":"SEXY!","review":"WOW! This movie is so stupit but is Tanya Roberts something else or what. This is a mans pleasure movie mostly, I watch this for Tanya Roberts. Just watching her bounce around on that zebra bareback is fun to watch. Its sexy how she talks to the animals, and I don't even know what the main point is I just watch it for sheena riding in the jungle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheesy Fun","review":"I liked it. Nobody was in danger of winning an Academy Award for this one, but it was fun and entertaining. The scenery was beautiful (both the African landscape and Tanya Roberts). It was shot on location in Kenya. I always like films shot on location more than those that create a \\"location\\" using CGI mumbo jumbo. There's no substitute for being there. The characters were likeable and the story was fast paced and entertaining. The two nude scenes were tasteful, simply showing Sheena bathing in a waterfall and lake. Cheesy elements that added to the fun include the ridiculous dialogue already mentioned by other reviewers, Sheena's Dr. Doolittle animal mind control routine, and the \\"zebra\\" she rode, actually a horse, as zebras have never been domesticated. Sit back and enjoy it for what it was meant to be, light, breezy entertainment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Passed the test!","review":"I had to take the MTTC in order to become \\"highly qualified\\" by the No Child Left Behind Act. I had not taken a course in Spanish since 1988. This guide helped me focus on what to study and the practice test was a great help. Much of the content was on the actual test."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not last 4 months","review":"This item disintegrated when placed in a sunny area covering a flat surface.

In this special DVD they take you into this legendary royal castle and its entire splendor. Yes, it is certainly over the top with all the \\"pomp and circumstance\\", but since I am an American I never get to see how royalty lives. One should not take it so seriously, but more enjoy it for how the other half lives. Yes, it is very over the top, but you have to give the British Monarchy some credit...they certain know how to live.I chose to look at it from a historical, architectural and interior design perspective and found it utterly fascinating. Since I love castles so much there is nothing about the structure itself that could deter me from disliking this DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"dvd was not closed captioned","review":"I sent this dvd back TWICE because it WAS NOT closed captioned. On both the dvds it stated cc for closed captioning and neither one was. I could not hear what was being said, especially because the brits do not talk like the americans do. I could not understand it and was very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Windsor Castle","review":"I love the detailed history provided in the DVD and of course the pictures of the rooms and grounds are always wonderful to see"},{"rating":"1","title":"Frank found what he was looking for","review":"I'm not as impressed with this book as most critics are. Frank traveled around the U.S. and photographed pretty much what he was looking for: visual proof that Americans and their culture are crass, materialist, full of prejudice, and vulgar.This view has been a commonplace conceit of European artists and intellectuals, and it began even before the colonies had united to become the United States. It was a message that was sure to win him applause from Europeans and also from that portion of the American intelligentsia who take European judgements as final.I think Frank's photos are highly overrated and took little insight or understanding to create. They reflect mostly a typical European viewpoint and show almost no understanding of what this country and its people are really about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Que maravilla de libro de fotografía.","review":"Si os gusta la fotografía de reportaje compradlo sin reservas.No tiene desperdicio, ojalá encuentro más libros de fotógrafos como Robert Frank.Muy bueno.Un saludo desde España a todos los hispanos."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring","review":"Robert Frank changed the world of photography with this collection of work. I think every young photographer should own and study this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Implausible, but readable.","review":"Implausible, but readable. Many loose ends get tied up at the end, but not the biggest mysteries. Why would a D.A. quit his job to take on his old case for free, while endangering his pregnant wife? How could he just a few weeks later join an NBA team, and oh yeah, be a star. Lazy plotting and absurd coincidences occur far too often."},{"rating":"2","title":"Joes review","review":"I have read most of Tanenbaum's books of the Karp family.

They are also available at almost all National Park association bookstores."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Watch","review":"Purchased it in a private sale, had it authenticated from an authorized retailer. Lighter then expected but really sharp, for perpetual motion it keeps great time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I had always wanted a Tag watch and finally received this Aquaracer as a gift. First off, it looks and feels good. However, the luminous dial is very small and weak. It is nearly impossible to see the hands even after just turning off the lights in a completely dark room. The second problem is that the automatic movement stops if not worn for 10 hours or so. This is a bit inconvenient, I put mine on first thing in the morning to make sure it keeps running. I would not get the automatic if I was buying this watch again. Hope this is helpful for other Tag fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"a beautiful watch!","review":"i bought this as our engagement gift for my fiance and he loved it! it came in a nice box with all the information and it is so beautiful. the reason i gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because we had a bit difficult time to get the band adjusted. when we took the watch to authorized jewelry stores to get the band adjusted, they said that they can't do it because they can't verify the authenticity. at another other store i tried, they just don't have an authorized person present. i eventually got it fixed at a local store. i am curious to know if this was experienced by others. other than that, it is a very nice and beautiful watch! we absolutely love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tag Heuer Aquaracer auto","review":"Great watch thing look forward to wearing it. Some reservation to warranty since Amazon didn't sign warranty card and doesn't appear to be authorized retailer. Hope there own warranty is sufficient should anything go wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"I should have listened...","review":"When I picked up this unit from Wal-Mart, the clerk at the register told me to keep my receipt because some of these were coming back. That should have been enough for me to put it back on the shelf. But I brought it home anyway...It worked fine for a couple of days, and then next thing I knew the temperature on the thermostat was showing me it was 79 degrees -- a reliable thermometer showed 69. But the heater was REALLY hot. I turned it off, let it cool and tried it again. It worked fine until...The next couple of times I tried using it, I had the timer set for 3 hours. After about 10 minutes, the whole unit shut off.I should have listened to the clerk and never bought the darned thing. Returned it to Wal-Mart where the service clerk said \\"I won't even ask why you're returning it. Almost every one of these we've sold has come back.\\"I've since picked up a DeLonghi unit from Sears. So far, so good with that one. But my advice is to stay away from this Honeywell unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too vague to be useful","review":"I would say that only about 15 percent of this book has material that is really useful as lateral-thinking exercises. The rest of it is too vague to be of much use. Useful questions should be specific enough to narrow down a solution by exercising the various methods of lateral thinking. For example, you should be able to come up with a specific solution by considering ways in which your assumptions affect how you understand the question. This book has too many \\"why did the chicken cross the road?\\" questions that require you to be psychic in order to get anywhere near the solution or require you to pull some obscure fact out of the clear blue sky."},{"rating":"2","title":"More Mass Hysteria...","review":"Mass Hysteria is one of the best groups coming out from France. Their musical style can be compare to Rammstein (Industrial-Metal) but the lyrics are more socio-political.I've never seen them live, but when \\"Donnez-vous la peine\\" plays in a club, the moshpit begins!!Another great song on this live album is the cover of Sepultura's \\"Refuse/Resist\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Generic Knife Block","review":"I bought this knife block in the hope I could store my Lion Sabatiers in one place. The openings are made without any tapering of the slots, that half my knives don't fit. This block must have been a generic block for manufacturers to stamp their logos on. It simply isn't meant to hold forged knives.If you are looking for a knife block for your forged Sabatiers and cannot find one, I recommend the Henckels Oak Block. I was lucky to have stumbled on one, and find it will fit a Lion Sabatier 8\\" -or- 10\\" chef's knife with no problem. The heft and strength of the Henckels oak block is vastly superior.However, this generic block will hold most stamped knives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work for thick knives","review":"I bought one of these intending to use it to store my Henckels Pro S knives. The slots are VERY narrow and my knives wouldn't fit. If you have only very thin knives, it would be fine. This fact ought to have been mentioned in the description. I'm dubious about the claim of its list price. I gave mine away for free when it failed to sell in my friend's garage sale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money...","review":"I completely agree with the other review.
