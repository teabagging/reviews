Fortunately, the author minimizes personal conjecture and relays facts surrounding the incidents. The book's title led me to believe that it was connected to the recent document compiled and presented to major governments and world leaders. However, while that document is mentioned in passing, there is apparently no connection.

All they know how to do is criticize whithout coming up with valid counters to replace what they're criticizing. To me, it seems that if these reviewers seriously cared about the military men and women, and the direction of the country (whcih they consistenly say is disastrous) then they'd do more than just get in their cheap 2 cents by smearing bush in whatever they force to be correlated, no matter how irrelevant.

My intent is to help potential buyers decide if this book is worth their time/money.Ian Wright's detour into political polemics (he is a children's book writer in general) is quite endearing but unfortunately a little sentimentalistic and egregiously one-sided. The title, which is what made me spend on this book, is pretty much the only enticing thing you'll find here. I wonder if Wright was trying to pull off a Michael Moore effort?I have nothing againts cavillars, indeed it is even interesting at times to read highly opinionated counter-intuitive takes on matters that impact the world, not just US. But if you are serious about pithy issues such as the propriety of war and its modes, you may be better off with the well-researched tomes of Bob Kagan, Noam Chomsky, or Farid Zakaria."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunately He Turns Out To Be A Fraud!","review":"Considering the author's recent revelation of lying about his past as a Army Ranger has cast a pale shadow over this book of antiwar posts. Whether you adopt a liberal or conservative point of view. You have to consider that the author was lying about his military record and experiences in 1989 Panama that never happened, in fact he was never in the military.

It certainly gives a political black eye to people who adopt similar political views."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's all made up... fiction","review":"Those of you who are in the \\"don't shoot the messenger\\" camp, wake up!

In First Rider's Call, Karigan is faced with so much evil from the past, and so much confusion happening to her in the future!! As I read through the book I couldn't help but get into character myself, especially with everyone of Britains characters!! I laughed and I cried in frustration along with Karigan and her friends!! As I finished the book, I couldn't help but wonder whether Karigan G'Ladeon's story was really through. I certainly hope not!! And I can't wait to find out if and when Britain will write the third book!! This is just too good of a story to let lie! And so much still needs to be done!!

I have read some of the other reviews, some said how that hate that love triangle that is going on with King Zachary and Karagin. I, my self, love the romance in this book!! I dont like the fact that Zachary ends up with Lady Estora, but the romance is exciting!!!!!!! I love the humor in this book. There is enough humor to keep you laughing but there is not so much that it get silly. The charators in FRC are exelent!! The original charators are more developed and the new ones are developed enough to keep everything rolling. :):)I love how Ms. Britain jumps from one persons view point to another's.

Once I started I could not put it down. Karigan is an unlikely hero, one that does not want to perform her duties. She just wants to be left alone to live her life. This theme continues throughout the book and is a refreshing change of pace.There is enough magic to keep things interesting but not so much that the magic changes the story. There are so many avenues to be pursued in a continuation of hopefully a long series of books."},{"rating":"2","title":"First Rider's Call","review":"I'm a huge fan of the whole Green Rider series, I've read all of them that are currently released. They all have an excellent mature sense of adventure, with comedy thrown in. I love the human aspects of all Kristen Britain's characters, and I find myself at times going, \\"Huh, yeah that's how I would've reacted to being in that situation\\". Not the main character's heroic deeds mind you, but more of the lesser elements to her story.Pick up Green Rider and start reading!

Cliches, both verbal and plot are apparent, but this book really is well done all things cosidered.You won't get \\"lost\\" in this book like I do in a Heinlein, Asimov or Campbell, but it is good reading and I do recommend it.I think this writer will mature and future works will be excellent, but time will tell."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Sequel!","review":"Wow!! I was really anticipating this one after having read Britain's first novel, Green Rider, and I wasn't totally disapointed.

Furthermore, the directions for this are printed on the BACK of this cardboard piece. How dumb is that?

(Fishermen, on the other hand always plays great- 5 Stars for that) Since players can't set up on the three River tile inserts, it eliminates a large part of the 19 hex tiles to work with. With the 30 tile 5-6 player game these three hexes aren't so significant in the initial set-up.These Gold bonus hexes will usually produce about 5-6 victory points with one player taking 3 VP and another 2 in an average game. The real key to how agressively players pursue these Gold VPs is the numbers in the hexes. If those numbers are 5,6,8 & 9 the rush will be fast. If the numbers are 2,3,4,10,11& 12 the rush will be proportionally less.I'd say for the ocassional player, they could take-it or leave-it on this expansion. But for avid weekly players Rivers is a \\"must have\\" $3.00 piece of cardboard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"Obviously this is a cheap add-on to Catan, but even so, I'd say it's not worth it.

It's really frustrating because these were sold to me as NEW and now 6 months later it's hard to know how to replace this one disk.

However, some of what he says is the exact opposite of other sources of information I've found. Unlike the other sources, Vasey never ever (as far as I could tell) explained how he knew what he said was true. He never mentioned doing any testing on the foods (as far as I could tell). He never mentioned any sources of his information. We are just suppose to assume he is a font of all wisdom on this subject for no reason that I could understand. I believe it was Bertrand Russell who said that insight untested is no guarantee of the truth.

The fight scene in the restaurant with Conan Lee and the Godskills \\"expert\\" was hilarious! Conan Lee was at his best in this film, playing the wannabe Kung-fu master.Grew up with most of Henry Sanada's films, it took a while for him to make it to the US, but better late than never! He brings a certain presence and intensity to his performance than the likes of Jackie Chan and Donnie Yen, who have somewhat limited acting skills.My kids just saw \\"Kenji\\" in Rush Hour 3, but they have been a fan of \\"Ninja in the Dragon's Den\\" long before the RH3 release.Definitely among my top 10 favorite martial arts movies of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"superb performance","review":"Superlatives are usless in describing this performance.

If you are a stickler for technical details, then good luck in your search, you will need it. Taking his age into consideration, Vladimir gave an incredible performance. I sure hope I can play like that when I'm in my seventies.

However, I remember being decidedly uneasy about the course that the series seemed to be beginning to take - the \\"android\\" taking the place of the \\"human\\" character and the spouse seeming to fully accept it. The South Africans. A few other things too. I just felt, er - uh - a bit uneasy about this stuff. How did the rest of the series treat these issues? Also, now that I'm a little older and wiser, I see a few flaws in the story, but as pure plot and fun reading goes, the series had a lot going for it, and I'm curious as to how it ended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Locket!","review":"This locket is beautiful!

They do say in the title tag here WITHOUT CHIP, but I didn't pick up on it and just wanted to warn any future buyers that in order to get these to work you'll have to use razor blades and double stick tape to transfer the electronic chip to these ghetto little ink cartridges. Canon doesn't make them and I doubt they're even legal. What kind of third world company sells ink without an electronic chip.

This, however, is not the way to go about understanding the true value of a release.While Grand Coda may not be worth the extra cash to the casual listener, any Chiodos fan would be foolish to pass this up; The few extra tracks very much deserve a listen, and though I might not say this about albums very often, the acoustic tracks are kept interesting enough to compare to their non-acoustic partners.Considering that Amazon.com does not allow for half-star's in their reviews, I will round up from 4.5 and give this a 5."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everyday is a bone palace ballet","review":"I'm not into blogging and writing reviews as much as i'm into reading them... but I also have to defend Chiodos.

I've seen them perform just that album and than their newer stuff, and the newer stuff had an ongoing theme that makes the album flow. Craig's singing improved in this one, and they sound more solid.

At the top of the page it says, \\"after the HUNT had destroyed Symons' vessel and gang in Haiti, he had steamed to Key West Naval Depot.\\" The Hunt was of course his steam tug from the previous book and in this story the Canton was Wake's ship."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Protagonist Perhaps More Sinister Than His Boss","review":"I agree with the other reviews, but only up to a point. That point is the ending, in which the poor, put-upon kick-me-Charley sudddenly turns sinister. This raises some questions: WHY is he so acquiescent? Why has nobody ever heard of him, at the place he said he previously worked? Doesn't anyone see the connection (so to speak) between the chain in the first man's death, and the last line? I don't think I'm giving anything away when I say that this book reminds me of the movie \\"BlowUp,\\" though it's nowhere near as good. I gave the book only 2 stars because I think it's a little too subtle for its own good. Like people who hide Easter eggs so cleverly that no one can find them, the author is so low-key that it's hard to realize what he's getting at."},{"rating":"1","title":"Out of thousands I've read, this is the worst","review":"I don't often take the time to review books here, but I felt it a duty to humanity to warn readers about this one. After a lifetime of reading novels--thousands of them--I've come to expect a story to begin within the first five or ten pages (and more often within the first five or ten paragraphs). In ALL QUIET ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS, no story begins within the first hundred pages, which are about a man being inveigled into doing dull, strenuous odd jobs around a camp ground. The rest of this nonstory is clearly indicated: he will continue to be inveigled into dull, strenuous odd jobs around a camp ground until the end of the book. Judging from other reviews here, many readers find a novel without story, suspense, action, or surprise--a novel in which nothing of interest happens--to be quite a refreshing change. I wish them well. Unless you're in the mood for mind-numbing boredom, however, I'd recommend staying well clear of this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A NAGGING CONSCIENCE...","review":"In echoing the title of Erich Maria Remarque's novel, All Quiet on the Western Front, Magnus Mills has deepened and darkened, quite considerably, the meaning and metaphor of his book. In this Mills has placed an insistent and nagging theme: waste, the wasting of lives, which serves to spur the reader (if not the protragonist). The trajedy of Remarque's novel is that young men pushed into events beyond their control had their lives and potential cut short. The trajedy of Mills' novel is the protragonist getting himself pushed into endless menial and thankless tasks at the cost of his ambition to travel east. He lacks the insight to disengage himself. He has that chance; the young men in Remarque's novel, the young men who died in the Great War, DIDN'T. Though Mills' metaphor of 'capital and labour' is compelling, his genius here lies in his conscience."},{"rating":"2","title":"A window into the world of the odd-job man","review":"It is a good book, but not for those that like a \`beginning, middle and end' to their fiction. Think of it as a few chapters from the narrators' life and you will get the idea. We know very little about the narrator's past, and equally little about his aspirations, except a desire to travel to India. I noticed that other reviewers read the book in one sitting - as did I - and this shows that the story is interesting. Mills describes the Lake District (in the northwest of England) well - the constantly changing weather, the fells up the sides of the lake, and the parochial nature of the locals. The reader can identify with the overpowering nature of Mr. Parker and the meek nature of the protagonist, although not all British are like this! Some elements are frustrating, however, particularly the lack of explanation after Deakin dies - why do the characters just shrug it off and carry on talking, and then it is never mentioned again? Overall, an 80% effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"A tool that teachers need in their classroom.","review":"This book provides the technology tools a teacher needs in her classroom in an everyday basis.

It's not overly challenging, but it will get your heart rate up and you'll even sweat a little. Sure, I've done harder workouts than this, but this is at least fun. D - the instructor is motivating without being too fake or cheesy. She's cool and instructs well. She breaks down the moves slowly and then soon you go up to tempo. I like also to workout when I see more people doing the routine with me (8 backup dancers, motivates me enough!)It's a funky great routine that you can do many many times without getting sick of it.

After each step was added to those before, D would practise it over and over starting at step 1 EVERY TIME! She ended each section by asking her group,\\"Are you already gone??\\" I was screaming,\\"YES!!! The ship has sailed, the barn door is open and the horses are gone, you name it,D, it's gone!\\" I am a very patient person. I have only stopped a workout video/DVD a few times in my life!

The problem is that the blades dull out in literally no time. I have needed to use it to cut cardstock paper and at about the 30th cut - it starts to shred the paper. Overall it does a fairly straight job - but I end up going through blades like I do tissues - it really is ridiculous. And on top of the price of the cutter itself, to get 2 replacement blades it is around[...]. This cutter has not been worth it at all for me and the measurements - to add on to it - when you get between the 5 and the 6 it's almost as if it's not accurate and difficult to measure!

No.I use this for trimming pictures on photo paper.The little groove where the blade goes when cutting gets clogged with paper residue and makes it hard for the blade to slide. This makes for horrible, jagged-looking paper edges.This is the fourth paper cutter I own and definitely the worst one. Good thing it was cheap because I'll be pitching it soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I had kept my old original gray Personal Paper Trimmer","review":"Ugh. I am hating this newer model, and regret getting rid of my old gray one. The orange cutting blade finds every excuse to fall out, since the acrylic housing is too flexible. On the old ones, it was much more rigid and the blade stayed in place. I also find I really have to push down hard on the track in order to keep the paper in place while cutting. I'm so fed up with it that I'm looking for a new/better one or I might get lucky and find one of the old gray ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"great cutter","review":"i have had this cutter for at least 3 years. i am into scrapbooking and mainly cut photos and cardstock, which really dulls the blade. and sometimes i cut regular paper. it does cut 5 sheets of reg. paper at a time. but if you do plan to do this, you have to put more pressure on the blade as you slide. i have replaced the blade 3 times since owning this cutter. so far i am really happy with this device.where i am fustrated is when i am trying to measure something 5inches. 5 inches get lost in between the board and the swing arm ruler. Also,i hoped in the future models of the cutter that fiskar can design a place on the cutter itself to store the extra blade."},{"rating":"2","title":"I really like it...","review":"This little item works very well, as long as you put enough pressure on the blade while youre sliding it. it will trim 2 pieces of cardstock at once, and very well at that.*SIDENOTE*-I just discovered today that the cutting slider button has broken off, and I have no idea where it's at, so I guess now I already gotta replace it.

I use it for projects every few months, and it really hasn't held up to that much use. The blades aren't that sharp, and the shuttle that holds the blade is able to be angled/wiggled a little within its holder, which can easily lead to slightly crooked cuts if you're not really careful. This has been frustrating and wastes paper. The cutter is also unsuitable for scrapbookers or card makers who use 12\\"x12\\" paper regularly, as it's only large enough for 8.5\\"x11\\". I would recommend saving your money and purchasing a larger, better made guillotine or rotary cutter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best","review":"This trimmer cuts well, however there are not enough measurement marks. If you are trimming a 4*6 picture down to a 4*3 picture you have the guide at the bottom, but nothing in the middle to make sure you really have it lined up straight.

In contrast to her previous work this book leaves, from the start, little doubt about the nature of what is going to happen or about its overall outcome. Unlike her previous Alaska-based mysteries, it is easy to put down.The author appears to have her own doubts as well. In the Acknowledgements at the back of the book she notes \\"My thanks also to my agent, Rich Henshaw, who kept insisting I write a thriller. Now that I have, maybe he'll leave me alone.\\" Let us hope that he does!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Different for D. Stabenow","review":"I liked this book very much - kept a good pace and had a good story, but I didn't feel as \\"into\\" the characters as I have with her other books. I still would recommend it. The ending really had me on the edge of my seat!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A really good thriller","review":"I love Dana Stabenow and her Alaska mysteries. This is a harder-edged departure from the Kate Shugak mysteries. It was, for me, slow to get into, but stick with it. It ends up an edge-of-the-seat thriller which exposes a very real threat to American security from terrorists. The research behind this book is first rate--everything from how the Coast Guard patrols the North Pacific to how a weapon of \\"mass-disruption\\" can be detonated on American soil to how international shipping works. It's mind boggling and a darned good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looking for a thriller about Coasties? This is the one for you.","review":"As usual DS has taken on a strong Alaskan woman as her main character (Kate & Wy are two of her more famous). In this story there are a number of other major characters that you will run up against. There is her husband the CIA officer, Fang the Chinese pirate, and the brothers Smith/Jones who are the Koreans who are trying to start a war.In a way this book jumped around a bit trying to keep you up to speed with all the developing story lines but in the end I think she pulled off a good story. But, I had to give her 4 stars for this main reason.This premise to this story was very interesting to me. The brothers were actually trying to make the US attack North Korea where we have all heard that things have deteriorated for the normal people to below 3rd world county standards in some cases.I thoroughly enjoyed this read while on vacation.

By the way, \\"The Soap Book\\" is a nice little book for the price, more for the general info and photography than for the recipes, which are all variations of one theme, each of which makes too much of one type of soap, and uses way too much essential oil."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"I'm so glad I didn't let the previous reviews keep me from purchasing this book. It is not intended to be a book on \\"soapmaking\\", but rather on natural homemade products for the home and body. With the utmost respect to previous reviewers, just reading the title \\"Clean, Naturally - Recipes for Body, Home, and Spirit\\" tells what the book is about. There is no indication that this would even be a \\"soapmaking\\" manual or why anything extrodinarly new would be in this book. Natural cleaning has few variations - that's why it's \\"natural\\".This is a lovely book and Sandy Maine did an excellent job in putting it together.

We own a small business and have expanded into producing Bath & Body care products, so picked up this book to add to our library.This is one of the best collections of practical recipes we have found but, as others have noted, many are contained in Main's other books (Soap Book). This is not a big issue for us, but if you already own that book, you might want to pass on this one. Also, several of the the recipes use Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (SLS), which is a serious skin irritant for many people, but for those that are concerned about SLS (like us), Sodium Coco Sulfate is considered a safer alternative.The recipes are generally easy to follow and many have color pictures to show what the finished product should look like, which is always helpful.Recommended!CFH"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Was disappointed in the book I ordered on line.

It looks like the fillmakers spent a lot of time in some town in Siberia, which is apparently a lot like white trash America. So instead of feeling taken away, I felt like I was taken back to the Ohio. Also, the scientists spend lot of time looking for tigers or avoiding seeing the tigers so they don't get eaten. And not much time actually running with the tigers.There is one really cool part about hunting tigers from a helicopter (with dart guns to put radio trackers on them.)

Quality of recording, in this case, doesn't matter. Tony Williams's fantastic (faithful to the definition: \\"fantasy-like\\") music is a singular human accomplishment. All the songs blend into the other, so the album reveals itself (after a couple of good listens)to be the uncanny audio-reel testimony of a disembodied emotion, submitted to the court of our human consciousness; or a jury of feelings, who admonish the televison crews: \\"I love you more when you're doubtful\\"; or a 3:33AM seismographic hi-fi studio session with apparitions kissing their invisible aortas during the darker moments of lunar eclipse.

The plot concerns goings-on in the fictional African empire of Azania (which is supposed to be off the coast of present day Somalia). Civil war has just erupted, and an English educated Azanian named Seth ends up the victor. He gets caught up with the British legation, including frivolous Basil Seal (an acquaintance of the recurring Waugh character - Lady Metroland). Basil is made the Minister of Moderization and has Seth's constant ear. Naturally, things spiral downward from there. BLACK MISCHIEF starts off a bit slow, and the first 75 pages are a bit tedious and confusing. However, things really take off afterwards. Waugh is always funny, but this book has more laugh-out-loud moments than most of his novels. Highly recommended for fans of Waugh and good satirical novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"An African Satire","review":"Black Mischief (1932) is another classic Evelyn Waugh satire of colonialism of the British Empire in a fictional Eastern African country. It is my understanding that the novel was out of print for some time due to racist language and stereotypes. The story mostly concerns Seth, an oxford-educated emperor of the fictional Azania, and his adventure seeking fellow classmate Basil Seal. It seems the Europeans get most of the brunt of Waugh's satire, but he doesn't leave anyone untouched. As usual there are some great comic sequences and bon mots throughout the novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty funny","review":"Either literary humor hasn't changed much in 80 years or Evelyn Waugh was way ahead of his time. This was a really funny book and chock full of memorably amusing characters. There's more setting than plot and nearly all of it takes place within the Author's invented country of Azania, floating off the coast of today's Somalia. The book alternates between detailing the culture and history of the island and the dialogues between its ridiculous inhabitants.This book was one of three English-language choices in a German-run hostel somewhere in Asia. With a name like \\"Black Mischief\\" and a publication date of 1932 I wasn't surprised at it's politically incorrectness. Nearly every ethnicity and segment of society lives up to some sort of stereotype or another; the net effect is more misanthropic than racist (but a little more racist than some of the other reviewers seem to think).In any case it was a quick and enjoyable read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Sardines","review":"I'm not sure what crestfallen means.

(The stretching methods he advocates range from confusing to dangerous.) That is, if you can get past the annoying, egotistical writing style of the author. With any luck, most people who pick up this book will be so put off by the writing that they won't even try to figure out the exercises. And try to figure them out is what you'll have to do because the stretching methods that the author cites as being the most effective aren't clearly explained or demonstrated. For all his talk about how conventional stretching methods don't work, it's interesting to note that most of the exercises illustrated in the second half of the book can be found in just about any good conventional stretching book on the market. In fact, for half the price or less of this book, you'd be better off bying a basic stetching book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great wallet stretcher, but that's about it....","review":"This book was a disappointment. I have no idea how this book could garner a 5-star rating, especially when you factor in the cost. YES, there are some interesting concepts, some of which conflict with \\"western\\" practices. You will be beated into submission about how slow stretching is for pansies. The overall concept of this book is really nothing more than a hybrid approach, with emphasis on working the body parts only to the flexibility point that YOU really need for YOUR sport/activity. The best concept I got from the book, FLEXIBILITY WITHOUT STRENGTH IS USELESS. BOOK FORMAT: Overall layout and chapters, WEAK. The pages of text are cropped and only fill the center of the pages. Pictures are grainy and gee-zow most of them are of the most simple stretching excercises ever seen, you know, the kind you can pick up at any doctors office or gymnasium. Sorry for the bummer write-up, but I gotta tell it like it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected.","review":"Basically, the book takes old information and puts in SOME new info and charges $34.95 for it! The book gives no programs or routines to follow, it just displays the exercises and doesn't give good or complete descriptions on most of the exercises shown in the book. This book is not for the experienced or for the beginner for that matter. There are better books out there that discuss flexibility in greater detail like Kurz's book's and Marco Lala's tapes. Now there are some good points of this book: It doesn't use heavy scientific jargon, like Kurz's book does. Instead, it uses modern, easy to understand language which I appreciate and also makes it very refreshing. This book also gives SOME new info that are not in the older books on stretching (such as STI's). Overall, this book has information that has been covered in other book's and at a much cheaper price. But it does give some new stretching idea's, if your looking for new ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don\`t buy","review":"As all Povel books this is as well expensive compared to the info.

Although I think the scholarship and scope of both are excellent, Flexner is much more readable and enjoyable in my opinion. Maybe historians would prefer Freeman, but I think most lay readers (like me) would prefer Flexner.Joseph Ellis' \\"Excellency\\" is also a great read, but not comprehensive enough to challenge Freeman and Flexner as the best single-volume biography of Washington.

The James Tiptree stories I read and loved were pretty much in that Silverberg vein, with a hard-nosed toughness at or near the surface, or somewhat more science based but just as strong.I hadn't realized that the author's style had matured in this direction. \\"Brightness Falls From The Air\\" is soft fantasy. It may be 'better written' than her work from the Good Old Days, but I don't like it.I recently picked up an anthology of \\"the best science fiction of 2003\\", and didn't find a 'real' SF story in the bunch, or even a story that was well written.

Nick (Jesse Eisenberg) seeks out his uncle Roger (Campbell Scott) in order to bring an alpha male role model into his life. Eisenberg's portrayal hints at future success, with subtleties and nuances of a veteran actor even this early in his career. Scott beautifully develops an inherently flawed character who perceives himself as exactly what Nick needs, but discovers that he isn't even serving his own best interest with his actions and behaviors.As long as you can handle some heavy dialogue and some dark humor, Roger Dodger shouldn't disappoint."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie","review":"The first feature from director Dylan Kidd is a knockout. Campbell Scott was a brilliant stroke of casting and made the movie. Perfect choice.In addition to the wonderful movie are the extras which make the DVD worth double the price.

In addition the actors have an audio-go as well and a number of shorts explore the movie from all different vantage points. Great collection of extras.My only complaint, and it might be my DVD equipment, but this DVD caused my laser to whirr non-stop. I have not heard laser grinding on my machine like that since I put in an independent, small label, european DVD a couple of months ago which ultimately didn't play (and no it wasn't porno!).

Love the piano work throughout, and all the solos are T-A-S-T-Y.Above all, they delivered the tunes; the title track alone is worth the price of the disc, but there isn't a single weak cut. Perhaps my only critique is that Romeo seems to have gotten a bit too carried away with the squeals and the bar, but as with any six-string virtuoso, he's sometimes allowed to be guitarded.An automatic purchase for anyone who likes intelligent songcraft delivered with skill, fury and emotion.

Allen has the best voice in progressive metal, and he whoops the tar out of all the candy-a$$ pseudo opera-boy wailers in most other prog metal bands. The band shows killer chops and a great ability to groove in odd time. (The track Paradise Lost starts out in 25/8!!!)

It was indispensable in helping me complete my book. It reminded me that, \\"Writers maintain work schedules just as athletes maintain training schedules\\" (p.1). It provided self-editing suggestions, gave me tips for locating and working with a professional copy editor, led me step-by-step through preparing my manuscript, and showed me how to query, find a publisher, and negotiate a contract.

I chose the Timex MP3/cd line-in alarm clock. It is somewhat confusing to use. There were a couple of times when it didn't perform as I thought I'd set it to, and I don't know if I did something wrong or it was malfunctioning. The performance and features of it are, however, decidedly secondary to the fact that it's now dead. I woke up, over an hour late, this morning to see a random pattern of lines displayed across the face. Regardless of the buttons I pushed there was no response or change. I unplugged it before I left and plugged it back in when I got home hoping for some sort of revival, but I was disappointed. I'm really pissed off, and all I can do is write this review. I really wish I kept the old Zenith; somehow I think it would be working today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good.. if you can repair this!","review":"Even though I found it a little bit difficult to program at first, I really loved it once I got the hang of it.

The sounds features still work, but at this point I must operate the device blind since the display is now completely died.

Even if your child isn't big into Dora, this is a great book. Too many \\"visit to the dentist\\" type books instill scary ideas with mention of \\"hurt\\", \\"shots\\", \\"scared\\". The dental staff helps a child through these notions if the need should arise. If they don't do so you need to find your child a new dentist. For many children, this is all they need to know going into a dental appointment. If they do need a \\"shot\\" for a cavity to be repaired, the dental team will use kid friendly/appropriate terminology to walk them through the process. Honestly, please do your children the favor of this fun read and not even uttering words like \\"needle\\", \\"shot\\", \\"hurt\\", or god forbid \\"pulls teeth\\" (I've heard parents unknowingly scare the beans out of their kids...).

I didn't find Orcutt's plot believable, her characters sympathetic, or her descriptions fantastic.

Unfortunately i found this the most irritating biography i have ever read. There is way too much padding and repetition from chapter to chapter. This book is at least 100 pages too long. chapters go off at tangents that have nothing at all to do with Nick. The interesting parts are contemporary recollections of old school and college friends where we get to know that Nick was a normal teenager and university guy. Interviews with joe boyd, robert kirby, and brian wells give us more insight into his method (or lack of it) in the studio. However, what should be made aware is that nothing from John Martyn or most importantly Gabrielle Drake means he relies a lot on old interviews to gain a perspective. This is like an overly long 6th form essay (well researched but poorly written)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough info to warrant a bio","review":"Since Nick Drake didn't talk much, there just isn't enough info to sustain an enaging text.

The author jumps from Titanic to World War 2 and back to Nick not wanting to talk to anyone. It\`s no wonder that Nick\`s relatives didn\`t want to be a part of this thing, the man isn\`t exactly the worlds best writer, and what annoys me the most is the way the author suggests that maybe Nick was gay, just because he had trouble communicating with people!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Code Name Stinkbomb","review":"Kathleen Kinmont is awful in every way, but there's a whole lot of bad acting to go around here, including of course O.J.

I love the way the bodyguard creeping through the utility passageway suddenly turns into a stunt man being blown off a ledge, while magically reversing direction in mid-air! They must have loved that special effect, because they used it for two different deaths! What a joke. I only bought the DVD because my late friend Bil Barratt played the bodyguard who got blown up.

One is a 1998 REPUBLIC release, the other a 1989 CONGRESS VIDEO edition. Comments here (and the star rating) are specific only to that second tape.This is of the very poorest quality! Recorded in ELP speed, it has a terribly degraded picture that looks multi-generational and a linear audio track, meaning NON-HiFi. Even the sound is bad. There's a faint background squeal and the spoken word is partially garbled.Definitely avoid the 1989 CONGRESS VIDEO release of this otherwise SUPERB movie.(PS to DEAD OF NIGHT fans: Sorry for the two stars, but with 28 current reviews on this film I don't think the overall rating will be dragged down at all because of it. The tape in question is so AWFUL, there was little else to be done, IMO.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The all-time best \\"anthology\\" horror film.","review":"As far as I know, this British gem from 1945 was the first \\"anthology\\" horror film, and is still probably the best. (This is progress?) The framing device involves an architect who is invited to spend a weekend at a country estate. When he arrives, he begins to feel he has experienced all this before, in a dream. The various guests then tell their own stories (all dramatized in flashbacks) of bizarre and possibly supernatural events in their own lives, mainly to convince a skeptical, materialistic psychologist. Ironically, the psychologist eventually tells the most bizarre story of the five! Unlike most other anthology films, this one ties the stories together in a weird climax which finally suggests that the whole thing is starting all over again, in an endlessly repeating circle."},{"rating":"1","title":"outdated bore","review":"Don't get me wrong, I'm a big fan of creepy black and white horror movies, but this 'horror' anthology looses its appeal at the very beginning.

The video and audio transfers are made from a very deteriorated source. I've seen a much better transfer from a PBS TV broadcast.

Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Princess of Burundi is no jewel","review":"The Princess of Burundi was a rather dull and plodding police procedural.None of the characters were particularly compelling or well drawn.

As for the plot, plodding: no real mystery at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fairly pedestrian scandinavian crime novel","review":"My wife and I read this after becoming hooked on the Scandinavian crime scene, mainly through Larsson and Mankell. The Princess of Burundi shares the bleak landscape and social themes of the Wallander series and the Salander books, but little else. The plot is uninteresting and so are the characters, who mostly walk around complaining about their boring lives. The detectives do very little investigating, or much else for that matter. This might be what you get when a mediocre writer attempts a Bergmanesque thriller and fails miserably."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"While the subject matter of this book is potentially facinating, this book has problems. First of all, it is shockingly poorly edited. Second, the author can't quite decide to take a detached view of the material or to be lighthearted. One way or the other might not be that bad, but both is annoying. For a better, more in-depth treatment of this subject, I recommend Nicholas Campion's \\"The Great Year\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"The end of worldly history","review":"This book is filled with a remarkable variety of material on the topic of the End of the World. While the author does thoroughly cover the various biblical interpretations of the End Times, she goes far beyond the various Christian perspectives. Here you also find Mayan, Hindu, Buddhist, and Muslim, teachings equally considered. Moreover, prophets and prophecy from all ages are included, from the dawn of recorded history to contemporary times.It is truly fascinating how profoundly metaphysically advanced Traditional cultures such as the Greek, Indian and Mayan could come to quite simular concepts and timing on the great cosmic cycles...As this book points out, Madam Blavatsky was also of the opinion that an end would come around the year 2000-but could be changed by more and more people becoming attuned to spiritual wisdom and guidance.The author's use and comparison of quotes from relevent source material is especially good."},{"rating":"1","title":"The sensational idea that the world will End - It may not.","review":"The book's point gets lost from chapter to chapter when it provides detailed accounts of fundamentalist Christians in US history who ruled by fear that The End was coming. There aren't many prophecies in the book and basic prescribed methods of preparation for the end. Some Hindu and Muslim mythology is incorrect due to the lack of core understanding. It mainly focuses on the freaks in the US with little information about the rest of the world. The overlapping predictions of some of the New Age psychics are a bit redundant. Read this if you are in the mood to skim - it is the only way one can see the last pages. It seems like a basic stepping stone that could lead to better reading if the subject matter is of interest to the reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"does NOT fit!","review":"this filter DOES NOT FIT HYUNDAI TIBURON GT! so don't bother. you need the one that goes into a fuel pump!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Could have been better","review":"The strengths of this book are in the concise explanation of the techniques of acupressure and the clear illustration of the location of the acupoints.

As a licensed massage therapist who already knows quite a bit about acupressure, I am always willing to learn more about any kind of bodywork. I had hoped to be able to pass on some ideas to my clients for self help but this book was definitely not it. The book gives some accupoints for specific problems, some of these are \\"golden points\\" able to stand alone in use, but others are not. The book gives no order to use these in and furthermore does not specify if all or any of the points are to be used together in sequence, or not. Also,it does't tell where the points are EXACTLY. There are really too many flaws to go into here. Acupressure is very complex, this book tries to simplify it to the point that it looks like some goofy folklore advocating some bad mojo."},{"rating":"2","title":"The price was right and it's a cutie!","review":"This toy was purchased on a super sale and it was worth what little money i paid.

Lots of techniques and explanation as to how to meditate and use breathing exercises to relieve stress. The feeling from the authors is that stress is a key contributor to PMS symptoms, which I'm not sure is the case. I'm unclear as to whether stress aggrevates the symptoms or whether your experiencing these symptoms makes it less likely that you can deal with stress as you normally would. I haven't been practicing the techniques so I don't know if they are helpful although I do exercise 3-4 times a week and although it does help while I'm exercising, it does not help later when I'm not and I experience stess.So, if you feel that you can fit the exercise component into your life this is a good book, otherwise, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"A piece of garbage.......","review":"Purchased this for my 7 year olds room.

First, when the product came in, the flimsy box was torn up and had a six inch hole in one of the corners. The \\"wood\\" pieces were barely painted and had streaks in it that showed the \\"wood\\" underneath in random places. It looked like someone had given it a thin coat of paint and then went back in random places and put a second coat. Had the whole thing had a second coat of paint it would have looked decent. At that point we boxed the product back up and had to pay 70 dollars to ship it back to the company. I was afraid I wouldn't get my money back since the seller says items must be unopened and in original condition (which wasn't how it was shipped to me in the first place), but I did.

I had not necessarily bought this edition for it's cost, but after I received it and looked back through the other options I had, I only saved two dollars. This is a book I intended on having on my bookshelf for generations to come. I have learned my lesson and will keep an eye out for these 'making books affordable' publishers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't pull out more than 15 feet!","review":"I bought this reel for my garage, it worked well for about a month and then I pulled the cord out to about 25 feet and the spring broke. I emailed the company looking for a fix, and never got a response. I really would have liked to give a better review, but the company's non response results in this product going to the garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating","review":"I bought this reel as a gift, but after inspecting the retract funtion, there was no way I was going to give this as a present. The retract function rarely worked, and once we got it to lock the cable out it wouldn't retract, we tried the directions and mounted it in the horizontal and vertical positions, nothing worked. For the time it took to get the cable to lock out I could have un-coiled an extension cable and coiled it back up. End result: for $100 it just isn't worth it. If you need 12 gauge cable the get a Reelcraft, if you don't buy the cheap $40 reel."},{"rating":"1","title":"wont retract","review":"Bought this \\"automatic\\" reel for my truck so I wouldn't have to manually roll up my cord, not the case. This will only roll up about 2/3's of the cord and the rest you have to push in yourself. Do not recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"cool costume","review":"My son loved this costume. We had a problem getting the correct size from the vendor. But they took care of that for us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Returned item","review":"My son changed mind about this costume, wound up returning it. The mask was VERY tight and uncomfortable......but you get what you pay for, right?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bright and colorful ! Only for those who are into Thomas!","review":"If you have a child who is into Thomas and Friends - then I would answer \\"yes\\" in regards to purchasing this item. You need to beware that the quality of the material is not up to standard. They are thin and itchy when you take them out of the package. Had to wash them and use rinse softener plus the dryer sheets to get them softer. Yet, it will take more than one washing.Yet after the washing, the colors remain intake very well. After washing, my son doesn't mind the sheets. He just wants to sleep with Thomas and/or James who is his favorite engine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather unappealing protagonist","review":"I think I would have enjoyed this book more if Susan Henshaw were a little more appealing. Is it me, or is she the most self-centered creature on the face of the earth? Or maybe she's supposed to be one of those people you love to hate, and I'm missing something. I keep looking for her to redeem herself with either some razor-sharp wit or deep insight, but I'm still waiting. Disappointing book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Total Disappointment","review":"Normally I am a fan of the Susan Henshaw series, but this installment was just terrible. By the end I couldn't care less about the identity of the murder victim much less who killed her. The entire premise was so unbelievable. Most of the characters had two different names which kept me confused and the frantic pace that Susan ran around town for 24 hours left me so exhausted I couldn't wait for the book to just end. I would love to know what police chief would only smile upon learning of a dead body being hidden for a day or so in order to not ruin the wedding day for the bride! The fact that her friend Kathleen, a former police officer, agreed to go along with the plan only made it worse. By all means, skip this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Susan is Mother-of-the-Bride","review":"Susan's Henshaw's daughter is getting married and, as usual, everything that could go wrong does. However, a missing wedding gown is nothing compared to the dead body which Susan has found. If you can swallow the premise that Susan wouldn't report the murder to the police because she doesn't want to spoil her daughter's wedding day, then you should enjoy this cozy. Acually this book is one of the better ones of the series and contains amusing characters and situations, along with plenty of red herrings and a satisfying conclusion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck!!!","review":"I have enjoyed all of the Susan Henshaw mysteries and was very disappointed in this one. No self-respecting mother in the world would allow her daughter to abuse her this way. I was so annoyed with Chrissy's behavior, I didn't even finish the book! If this is the only one you have read, please, please try one of the other ones, they are much, much better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Mother's worst nightmare","review":"This story continues the saga of Susan Henshaw--the surburban mother t has other outside interest. The stories have followed the growth of her children and the change in her suburban ways. This story takes the suburban Mom and shows some heavy duty problems with the merger of a marriage and a murder. Especially a problem since this Mom wants everything perfect for the daughter--a very normal reaction.It has some disjointed moments but it is a fun read. It is a good book but she has written better ones"},{"rating":"1","title":"Series is going downhill","review":"Susan Henshaw was once a spunky, intelligent heroine. This book continues her unfortunate metamorphosis into a flighty, self-absorbed, uninteresting person who displays uncommonly bad judgement at key points in the novel--simply to keep the plot going. This confirms my earlier resolve to stop reading Wolzien. A real shame, given how enjoyable her earlier works were."},{"rating":"2","title":"An awesome cookbook, true to its title.","review":"This has become one of our most used cookbooks because the recipes ARE Healthy, Hearty & VERY Simple. We have not tried a recipe yet that we haven't enjoyed.

A real plus is the ease of preparation and clean-up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cuban Comedy in Song","review":"Pototo Y Filomeno started their Cuban radio show in Havana in the 1940's. As they gained popularity, they went on to make movies and eventually two albums, one of them being this one. Recorded in Cuba in 1956, this album on the Puchito label won the gold record of 1956 and its songs were featured in the 1957 film \\"Ole Cuba\\". Leopoldo Fernandez and Anibal del Mar were masters of their craft. Forced to leave the island in the early 60's, they transferred to Miami where they continued to work together in theater and recordings. Anibal del Mar eventually retired from comedy, but Leopoldo Fernandez continued his television show in Miami and Puerto Rico. He died in 1985 in Miami. This CD release i must say lacks sound quality. Having the original LP's, the difference in sound is very apparent. The LP sounds much better than the CD. Still, it's a good buy for the price, and the LP's are hard to find. A good buy overall if you enjoy Cuban comedy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Holistic Formula","review":"This book is solid. The language is not overly academic while conveying textbook type information in a semi novel type format - easy to read and thoroughly enjoyable. The book is excellent for people new to project management because it is comprehensive without being overly technical, that is, it covers a broad range of topics and ties them together to present a holistic approach to project management. For this reason it would serve well for corporate training programs. Counter to that, the book is also a \\"should read\\" for top managers - to remind them of their role in creating a sound project management environment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective DVD","review":"This was a multiple DVD set and upon the first time it was played, the 2nd DVD started freeze framing when it was 3/4 way through the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lassie Come Home DVD","review":"Bought this DVD for my grandchildren,thinking of Lassie as \\"timeless\\"-unfortunately much of the background story of War[WW2] is not relevant to 5-6 year olds.Also discovered that the DVD code was incompatible with my player,so had to get my son -fortunately savvy re these things- to enter my area code into my unit,after which there was no problem.Personally I enjoyed the nostalgic elements and the scenery but think the modern generation would find it boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent movies enjoyed by all.","review":"I purchased this movie for the nursing/rehabilitation home my 89 year old mother went to live in after having a stroke. They have movie afternoon every Sunday and I thought the Lassie DVD would be very enjoyable for all the residents. My mother was thrilled that I got it. She loves Lassie Comes Home even though she always cries at the end. I have memories of watching it with her when I was a child. The movie was enjoyed by all the residents and even though I didn't get to see the other two movies on the DVD, mom told me they all liked them very much. These are family classic stories, the kind I remember as a kid. It's very well worth buying for youngsters and oldsters alike."},{"rating":"2","title":"classic movie classy dog","review":"this movie is a movie icon and a dog icon as well. there are many dogs (cats?) that have traveled like lassie and it is a great family movie. with collies being such great kid dogs it is questionable why more people don't have them."},{"rating":"2","title":"The item was a gift","review":"Can only rate the item was delivered as scheduled.

But the book indicates that the CD included with the book includes animations of the subject matter. Throughout the book, it encourages you to go to the cd and view the animations. What it does not tell you is that the animations are only available to instructors. It took me six contacts with the book publisher, and lengthy conversations with five uninformed representatives, to find out that I could not get the cd animations. VERY DISAPPOINTING INDEED! I have purchased many science texts that come with animations on cd and it is available to anyone who purchases the book. Why bother to include a cd with the book. The cd that comes with this text is absolutely empty. It only contains a link to the book's website.Just know that if you purchase this book, the cd is useless to students."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good introduction","review":"This text gives pleanty of pictures and the cases studies help reinforce what the reader is learning in lecture and lab.

It sounded so great....keep food warm with controlled heat. Sadly, it has not heat. The unit doesn't even warm to the touch on high. We exchanged the unit for a 2nd one and it too had the same problem. Both were defective. We ended up using Rival Crock Pots with much better results. I would not recommend this product, especially for the price"},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific item","review":"This holiday we wound up hosting more parties than I would have thought possible, so my husband and I purchased this item and the similar Deni 3-section server. Both trays were great at keeping food warm, and more than one guest swore they were going to rush off and buy them as well. They clean up easily and were the hits of the party. My one complaint is that on the temperature dial, the \\"off\\" setting does not work. The only way to turn the unit off is to unplug it from the wall. (It seems to work fine on the 3-tray unit so it's apparently a fluke.) Still, I'm not the type to leave heating appliances plugged in when not in use to begin with, so I'm not overly concerned. You probably shouldn't leave these running unattended in the first place. Fabulous purchases and highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a very useful book","review":"The number of examples in this book that don't work in one browser or another is astonishing. While this is in the nature of html, it makes the book rather useless for development of an internet site. For development of an INTRAnet set, where MS Explorer can be enforced, it's not bad. Better proof-reading of the CD that contains the examples would have been helpful. Some of the scripts needed editing to enable them to conform to the filenames on the disk."},{"rating":"1","title":"You can find better!","review":"As I bought this book knowing zero about D-HTML, it was a decent introduction, but became increasingly frustrating as I began to understand how D-HTML works. The major problem (aside from some code snippets not working) is that examples for effects are presented for either MSIE only or for Netscape only. Very seldom is code shown that will work for both. As a web developer, developong for only 1 browser is not an option! This book is great if ALL you'll develop for is MSIE -- but if you want compatability with Netscape, buy another book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Check Oneida online for better price","review":"I was about to purchase a 20 peice set of this Oneida flatware here and decided to check the Oneida list price to see what kind of a deal I was getting.

It's taken me two years to get through it. Oh, each story passes quickly enough, but never seemed to whet my appetite to read the next story. Too bad"},{"rating":"2","title":"O. Henry endings entertain","review":"Archer delivers twelve short stories, each with a different conundrum. Nine of the stories are based on real-life incidents; three are pure fiction. Each story has a decidedly O.Henry ending. (The last one has four options!) For the most part, this is a good read. It won't change your life. But, it should entertain you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A very entertaining collection of short stories","review":"I enjoyed this book, especially \\"One Man's Meat...\\", which is the last story and has 4 possible endings. I would advise strongly that you read them all (I found the first one to be the best). The only flaw about this book is that the endings to the stories weren't particulary surprising, but it is still well worth a look for anyone who enjoys Jeffrey Archer's fantastic novels"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wannabe","review":"Ignore the brown-nosing reviews on the back cover, many of which lifted from the British right-wing press. This is amateur storytelling, at best, with watery plots and weak -- sometimes embarrassing -- choices of phrase. When it comes to scorpion tales, Mr Archer, I'm afraid you're no Roald Dahl."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of the Jeffrey Archer masterpieces ....","review":"I liked Archer's novels better than this collection of short stories. These stories are written with vivid descriptions, but they fail to pack a punch.One commmonality among the short stories is the Archer penchant of an unexpected finish. Though at times, this too gets to be as predictable as discovering the identity of 'bad guys' in a Superman comic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous Stories from the Master","review":"The term \\"Master Storyteller\\" is perhaps overused but in this case, Jeffrey Archer earns the moniker. Each of these stories I read between other people's novels, in order to space them out. It is a testament to the quality of these stories that I found myself wanting to get past the particular novel I was reading so I could get to the next Archer short story. Some of these stories have twists and some have irony, but they all have that exceptional phrasing that I have come to expect from Mr. Archer. I am suprised at some of the reviews below, giving this book lower marks, but I think if you are looking for a well-told tale, this is the book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"A series of short stories","review":"This book is a series of twelve short stories with intriguing plots. Good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Re-defining the term \\"Red Herring\\"","review":"Jeffrey Archer is one of my favourite authors, so youcan imagine my disappointment with this book. A \\"red herring\\"is supposed to surprise you; the ending of each story issupposed to knock you off your feet and scream \\"Boomshakalaka!\\".Unfortunately, Archer succeeded to (mildly) surprise mewith one story only - out of the twelve, and that, in mybook, reads \\"total failure\\". Archer should stickto his one-story-per-book approach, and abandon theseforays into the short-story genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"didn't work","review":"I don't know if maybe I just got a defective product or if they're all bad but mine did not work.

Great photos, exact descriptions, great reference for identification. I especially appreciated the section on reproductions and re-introductions. Very useful for telling the valuable old stuff from the not-so-valuable new stuff. And a fair treatment of the somewhat valuable new stuff. Prices are a little too moderate, in my experience.

I don't appreciate the mixed messages of encouraging creativity and then mocking those who do try to be creative.

The artistry, both in studio skill, as well as musicianship, is truly stunning in \\"Out Of The Blue\\".

By far, the Electric Light Orchestra's highest achievement!"},{"rating":"2","title":"ELO's biggest-selling album turns 30!","review":"OUT OF THE BLUE turned out to be the Electric Light Orchestra's biggest-selling album of their legacy. This 30-year-old album spawned two Top 20 hits,TURN TO STONE and SWEET TALKIN' WOMAN,also fan favorites like IT'S OVER,MR. BLUE SKY and WILD WEST HERO. All tracks contained herein were written by frontman Jeff Lynne. I love the sound of the drums,although it was not Jim Keltner playing. Lynne and Keltner would later collaborate together for recordings by Lynne's close friends the late George Harrison and Tom Petty(Lynne,Harrison,Petty,Bob Dylan and the late Roy Orbison later founded the all-star Traveling Wilburys).

Don't get me wrong, this is a great album, but in all of it's slick studio polish it the band loses some of it's charm. While not as disco influenced as the next album, Discovery, it shows an alarming and unfortunate tendency to sacrifice the band's \\"electric classical\\" approach for a more commercially slick sound loaded with synths. A pretty good album on it's own merits, but the old guard had a feeling something ill was being borne on the wind."},{"rating":"2","title":"ELO's best, with some great songs that nobody heard of","review":"This was probably ELO's greatest album.

It still holds up as a very melodic example of Jeff Lynne's ingenius melding of classical music instruments and 60s-70s rock.

To me, the music of ELO is timeless. This album marks the true talent of the group.

Although her acting is somewhat limited to lots of sobbing, and exclamations of \\"oh Bill\\", even so you feel the chemistry between girl and dog. The story is maybe a bit of a stretch of the imagination with girl finding dog that has been shot, nursing dog back to health, losing dog to the war, getting dog back (with post-traumatic stress syndrome which he snaps out of quite quickly), and then the prospect of losing the dog again. The best performances are by Frank Morgan and of course Bill or Lassie or who ever he/she was."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good series","review":"I really enjoyed the Culdee Creek series.....

Instead of trying to decipher them yourself, which may take hours, speak to someone that knows the subject and you will be surprised how easy all this really is.I think the author decided that since this book is designed for Comp Science majors it must be written in an EXTREMELY concise way which made parts of it also extremely hard to understand.

I've always been a fan of this film, because I think it has alot to offer, but if your talking in terms of DVD status, it dosen't rate so high. Im glad to see this was put out on DVD for others to check out, but its sad it got such bad treatment. The video quality is probably worse then the VHS version. It looks like to me they took the best copy on tape, and converted it to DVD. Its definitly not \\"remastered\\". It would have been nice to see it in its widescreen format with cleaned up audio and sound, but not so with this one. In fact, because this movie didnt exactly burn up the charts, you probably will never see a special edition or any other version then the one currently out because there just isnt enough interest in this film. The DVD also lacks any features, commentary, ect. Also no artwork insert either, but mine did come with $50 in coupons!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A HIDDEN GEM!","review":"It was nice to finally find this hidden gem. Almost 20 years ago I caught this movie on late-night TV and didn't catch the name of it. For years I tried to find out what the name of the movie was and from where I could get a copy of my own. After reading a review on a horror website, their description of the plot details (which I don't want to give away at all) led me to believe that this was the movie I was looking for. I quickly googled it and found Amazon selling it and for cheap! Although, in some parts of the movie, its too dark to see what is going on, this movie is a must for the slasher genre fans. It has a top-notch cast, who many of you will recognize, and a great plot. This movie stands above alot the the 80s slasher flicks."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Mob Rules !!","review":"I just heard of this band in 2006. I bought Among The Gods and loved it. This one is a close second but a little mellower. They play German power metal with quality keyboards and catchy melodies. That's not to say they are a lightweight band. Rather they mix it up with some heavy power songs and some more melodic ballads. Their compositions are well thought out and arranged. The singer has a good voice with plenty of range. Give them a try if you like Masterplan,Silent Force,Jorn Lande,or melodic metal in general."},{"rating":"1","title":"A pathetic forgery","review":"This book is obviously 20th century stuff!

Joseph wrapped the body in pure linen that he had previously PAINTED so as to form an image of Jmmanuel\\"Now why would anyone want to paint someone's image on the shroud?

Much was made of the Ants' swashbuckling/Apache image, but if image was all they had, then this album would have died a sudden death. To this day, \\"Kings of the Wild Frontier\\" remains a terrific album because it not only has great songs, but because it seamlessly switches directions between frivolous and dark, providing a total thrill ride in its 13 songs.

The comic relief offered by her neighbors and relatives provide delightful diversion from dark events.

The sheriff and his nephew, Lassiter, are admirable, and I liked that."},{"rating":"1","title":"An error-riddled, badly-written book","review":"This clunker is not worth your time. The dialogue is clumsy,the plot transparent, and it's based on totally false premises.Want an example? Here's an innocuous one--Goldring ascribespaintings of Tolkien's characters to a \\"Depression-era\\" artist,when the books were written during WWII! Goldring also hasthe chutzpah to equate Wiccans with Satanists, and to totallyinvent a cult which resembles the real religion in name only.Even \\"flavor\\" materials about Native Americans which arecrucial to her \\"character development\\" are wrong and offensive.\\"Indian buck\\", indeed! Stay away from this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather a Mess","review":"The back cover copy lured me to buy this book on my lunch-hour. The characters start off well as does the mystery. But then it all goes to pot. The writing style -- while occasionally fresh -- frequently becomes incoherent. Willi Gallagher -- the sleuth/teacher -- is often too stupid to live but like the Energizer Bunny keeps on despite at least 4 unconsciousness-causing belts over the head. The murderer must be one of the most incompetent in all fiction. You know the book is in trouble when you are rooting for the murderer to finish off the slueth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Goldring Doesn't Know Texas","review":"The author implies that she is from Texas and is, at least partly, of American Indian descent. However, her book is just plain silly. I don't mean it's funny. It isn't! Her dialogue makes fun of Texans, Mexicans, Indians. The author further implies that she is a teacher, or at least knows about teachers. I am a native Texan and a 20+ year teaching veteran and a published writer, and I am insulted at the descriptions and mannerisms she uses in reference to Texas teachers and to her other characters. Also, the surnames and Christian names she gives to her characters are mostly ridiculous. Her writing is immature. I am surprised that Berkley chose to publish her work!"},{"rating":"1","title":"All Signs Point to Murder","review":"The title is catchy and lured me to select the book. I thought it might be a good read. This book is poorly plotted. It has the same flaw of many American mystery novels today that use the personality traits and character development of the heroine/hero,Willi Gahhagher in this instance, to cover over a thinly plotted novel. Unfortunately, the main character instead of coming across as likable, perky, determined and smart, comes across as irritating, silly, self-absorbed, and ultimately stupid. She has developed a more likeable and worthy character in Quannah Lassiter, a detective who is the nephew of the Sheriff in the County.This may be the beginning of a series. It can only get better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get thee to an editor","review":"Infuriatingly sloppy writing. At one point the main character is thinking about a piece of evidence she doesn't actually find until about twenty pages later.

The plot happily skips along to an obvious conclusion that is worth neither the time nor the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for all mystery lovers!","review":"I so enjoyed All Signs Point to Murder! This first book in the series, as well as the subsequent ones, are well-written, fast-paced and fun to read.

HOWEVER, it also blocks my nose up and makes it hard to breathe. It exerts an ever-so-slight pressure on my nose that makes it harder to take a breath. ALSO due to the nose piece, it constantly slides UP and lets in light. Not recommended unless you have a tiny nose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for everyone.","review":"I work on a military base in Africa and sleep in a tent. I'm a side sleeper which means many products with clasps leave indentations in my head and are obvioulsy uncomfortable and very hot. As for this product, if they expanded on the idea of making different size masks with a bubbles that extend lower then it wouldn't scrape the sensitive area under my eyes waking me up."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best","review":"Due to working shifts I frequently use sleep masks and have always used the normal flat fabric type. Earlier this year, when on holiday in the U.S, I came across this novel type of mask and decided to buy one. It is well made and very comfortable in use, and it really does allow your eyes to move freely. I only have two gripes: A small amount of light is let in around the nose area, however I have never used a mask that hasn't done this. It would be nice is the manufacturers could fix this, perhaps by adding a soft aluminium strip so the the mask could be made to seal around the difficult nose area. If it wasn't for this I would have given it 5/5. The second gripe is that, to my knowledge, it's not available in the UK."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Fit, let's light in","review":"I guess you get what you pay for! I've been wearing sleeping masks for many years. This one is the least fitting and comfortable of any I've bought. It let's light in around the nose as there is no padding to seal it tightly. Given you are lying down, any light from night lights or equipment can be seen coming in under the mask. The plastic case it came in was broken badly and someone had wrapped it in saran wrap making me wonder if it had been returned previously. The cost to ship it was almost as much as the cost of the product. I wouldn't recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch out!

I ordered again from Amazon, and this time they fulfilled my order through Magellan, a 3rd party seller. What I got was not, in fact, the \\"Lights Out\\" sleep mask but a similar-looking item, and it didn't even have the same name on the package. Also, the interior of the packaged smelled terrible when I opened it, as if it had been in a damp moldy place in a warehouse or something. I initiated the return procedure, and Magellan now wants me to pay the postage to sip their items back to them, despite the fact that what they shipped me was A. Not the item I ordered, and B. Smells horrible. Would not buy through Magellan again.

You can close your eyes and it'll look/feel completely pitch black and given that I don't spend a lot of time with my eyes open under the mask, the mask doesn't lose any functionality because of this bit of light. You might want to get the black color instead of the blue if you're really concerned, as it may absorb more light.The velcro strap is adjustable for bigger heads like my own. I honestly didn't think the cupped design for REM sleep would be a big deal, but it really does make a difference, if just for comfort.I highly recommend this mask."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"First of all this product is identical to the \\"Sweet Dreams Contoured Sleep Mask\\" by Dream Essentials, except the Sweet Dreams mask costs less. I ordered both, and they are identical.Second, the Velcro closure on the back of the head-strap forms an uncomfortable 'bump' on the back of my head that makes it almost impossible to sleep with this mask on.Third, the mask does leak some light in around the nose, but I am more upset about the 1st two points. I didn't want two of the same mask, particularly when the 2nd one cost me more than the first.Do not buy this mask under any circumstances. If you want it, do an Amazon search for \\"Sweet Dreams Contoured Sleep Mask\\" instead, it is the same thing for less money."},{"rating":"2","title":"terrific sleep mask","review":"The Lights Out sleep mask is the best sleep mask I've ever had, and I've tried several different brands over the past few years. It does an adequate job of blocking the light. But what makes this mask exceptional is its comfort level. Unlike all the other masks I've tried, it rests very lightly on the face, not pressing down at all. After putting it on, I forget it's even there. I like it so much I bought 2 extra ones: one for home, one for travel, and one just in case I lose either of the others!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't like the nose","review":"I bought this mask and the Sweet Dreams mask at the same time. They look identical, but they are not. I don't like the nose on this one at all. Not just that it lets in (a little) light, but it's squishes my nostrils to where I can't breathe. (Like the opposite of a Breathe-Right nose strip) (The Sweet Dreams mask doesn't do this.) Even if I make the mask looser, the nose just isn't right.I work nights, so am a regular day sleeper and ALWAYS use a mask. Even if I sleep at night, I have grown accustomed to having a mask on. I'm not returning this one, but am putting it at the bottom of the night stand drawer. Better than nothing, but have several others I like much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still seeps light if your nose is small....","review":"This is a really great, comfortable sleep mask with the neat feature of interior cavities allowing one's eyes to open and close. However, if your nose is on the smaller side, the contour of the nose piece still permits light to enter the bottom of the mask, even if the velcro strap is tight. Nonetheless, much better than other masks."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK, but","review":"light in weight, and blocks MOST of the light, but didn't conform well to the area around my nose, letting a sliver of light in.

It describes every topic clearly and completely, and does not skip over anything. However, it is a little short, and it does not explain some non-C++ parts completely (it gives a VERY skimpy paragraph or so on reading data from files).

My highest recommendation if you need to get up and running with text-based C and you are starting from zero.DISCUSION: This book separates itself from almost all others by sticking with teaching the reader how to write programs in C. Topics such as Windows programming, details about using specific products (Visual C++, C++ Builder, etc.), and historical anecdotes about the history of computing are left for others to cover. These subjects are indeed interesting, but the novice is easily overwhelmed by them (for me, the transition from Apple IIe line number based BASIC to structured, compiled programs was rough enough!). Winston's approach allows the programmer to begin solving problems quickly. Once the user is used to the language and has a few programs under his belt, he can think about tackling K & R, Schildt, Perry, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful book for cat lovers","review":"This is a really nice book, very informative and with beautiful photos of cats of all types.

I kept thinking while listening that it's all \\"plastic singing\\" with no real emotion, and some of the songs are so bad that your toes curl. You can predict the words he's about to sing, in some of these awful songs, before he sings them.In his autobiography, Eddie Fisher says that at one point, he was more popular than Sinatra. I guess that's true, but today, when you listen to Sinatra, you hear some real emotion in a song. These songs by Eddie Fisher have no emotion in them. They still play Sinatra today, but I don't think you'll hear any of these songs by Eddie Fisher, on the radio anymore.

It screams propaganda."},{"rating":"1","title":"Standard Espionage Fare (With A Few Great Visuals)","review":"Though I roundly consider Alfred Hitchcock to be one of the greatest film directors of all-time, there is one aspect of his filmmaking that rubs me the wrong way sometimes: a lack of a really engaging plot. Some of his films have it, while some do not. This one, unfortunately, does not.For a basic plot summary, \\"Foreign Correspondent\\" sees American reporter John Jones (Joel McCrea) sent into Europe to get the \\"scoop\\" on the upcoming war (WWII). While there, Jones and fellow lady friend Carol Fisher (Laraine Day) get caught up in an espionage plot involving the start of the war.I'll admit that the visuals are very well done for 1940, and a few sequences even provoke genuine suspense, but I just could not get into the plot whatsoever, as it seemed to drag on and on with little action or character development to move things forward.Thus, if you are a hard-core Hitch fan, watch this one.

The storyline is very confusing. It is way too long (over two hours). The script is definitely not up to Hitch's usually witty level. I honestly can't say I followed the plot very well because the movie kept putting me to sleep.It is partially redeemed by some fine performances, notably Joel McCrea in the title role, George Sanders playing an uncharacteristically heroic part, and Herbert Marshall as the leader of a supposed pacifist group.

It's great toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fisher Price I can Play Guitar","review":"We are having a lot of problems with this item. I think that the wire to it is faulty.

When Christmas morning came, the thing barely worked. There seemed to be a short in the connection at the guitar. It did work once, but then failed completely. Prospective buyers should be aware that Mattel discontinued this product after one year. ([...]) That should tell you something. If you decide to purchase anyway, check the vendors return policy. We had great customer service through Kazizuri, so we were able to return it. Still, it's not worth the disappointment and hassle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I bought this from another online retailer in December '08.

Anyone having two boys can certainly relate to all of the things children, especially very young ones,can get into. You pray that they will hurrym up and grow up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pessimistic Drivel","review":"It is a shame that this book made it to print when there are so many other worthy manuscripts out there, waiting to be published. This book was so negative about the aspects of having children, I contemplated trashing it before donating it to our local library so that no one else would make the mistake of actually putting out money for it. Yes, parenting causes a lot of personal sacrifice and lifestyle changes, but not in such a way that one dislikes their children, as Mrs. Grody seems to. This book was written in a manner that suggests that children are an enormous burden; it is supposed to be humorous, but manages to leave you disgusted, rather than laughing. The flower-child of a mother depicted seems to have more regard for Green Peace than for her own children. It would be best to find a book by Erma Bombeck if you are in need of a good-natured, tasteful laugh about the trials of child rearing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredibley Entertaining!","review":"First, I love stories by Jackie Collins... and listening to this story was great! I was entertained and excited to see what would happen in the different characters lives. The narrator was AWESOME! Each character had a distinct and extremely authentic voice/accent, etc. It was so easy to tell who was talking, I could actually visualize the characters based on the voices used. I have listened to several books on CD and this narrator by far has been the BEST. I definately enjoyed this story and recommend it to anyone who enjoys a fast paced, exciting, \\"R\\" rated story!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Multi-book Family Saga is Born!","review":"The Lucky Santangelo of the new millenium has arrived! This latest read, and hopefully just the first, does not disappoint. Fast paced, with excellent characterization. It leaves you, or at least me, wanting more of the Diamond brothers, and newly discovered sisters...much more. I hope JC decides to continue on with another book utilizing these characters. You just KNOW that little Lulu is going to be a force to be reckoned with once she's a little older....should be an interesting ride!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Diamond in the Rough","review":"This is the typical novel you come to expect from Jackie. Lifestyles of the rich and truly spoiled. This novel focuses on the lives of the 3 Diamond brothers (Max, Chris and Jett) who try to make something out of their lives despite the fact that their father, Red tries to sabotage them at every turn. I think that I have read all of Jackie's novels and never come across someone so despicable as Red Diamond.I also enjoyed the Birdy Marvel/Rocky storyline. You do not have to be a genius to figure out that it seems very familiar to the Britney Spears/Kevin Federline FIASCO. Reading about Birdy made me see how Britney could have gotten herself in all the mess that she is involved in. Jackie was that convincing.Can't wait to see who she writes about next, maybe Brad and Angelina???"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jackie's Back!!","review":"Dirty, sexy Scandal at it's best! Jackie hasn't missed a beat...In this latest novel, she gets down with hip hop moguls and tight-fisted billionaires, drug addicts and the Russian Mafia.

Meet a young, ambitious, and incredibly beautiful Liberty, a talented waitress trying to court her destiny; Amy, a high society princess and emotionally traumatized woman; and Gianna, Italian model extraordinaire. Now meet the three brothers Diamond, and their billionaire father, the controlling and conniving Red Diamond. Known throughout the business world as cutthroat and ruthless, he is known to his sons as even worse. Now he has summoned them to New York for a mysterious meeting. The suspense was nuts!!! The plot was deliciously worked and the bling was enough to make a person blind through the pages. Go on wit'cha baaad self, Jackie!! Two very big thumbs up!! :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak and sad attempt from Collins","review":"Let me just say I love Jackie Collins. I will always buy her novels no matter what but there is a distinct difference from the old school novels she used to write to today's Jackie Collins books. First, where is the sex? Second, it ways always fun to try and figure out who the characters were based on...Warren Beatty, J. Lo, now it just seems the characters are not really based on any celebrity figures anymore. This novel was weak with a storyline involving a family that I couldn't care less about. The villian in the story was not that compelling and I didn't care about the lovestruck couple Jett and Amy. I don't know if the other reviewers have read all of her stuff but I have and was entirely disappointed. This book took me a week to read and usually I finish her books in a day because they are so exciting. This one was tough to finish, Jackie, tough to finish."},{"rating":"2","title":"Number 1 Jackie Collins' Fan","review":"As always, Jackie Collins has done it again. I thought this book was outstanding, not as good as the Lucky/Gino books, but still written very well. I love the way Jackie introduces her characters and always giving you something to look forward to reading. I really enjoyed Liberty's character. I especially would like for Jackie to keep the characters of Liberty, Jet, and Chris going in future books. This is a book very worth the time you will spend on it. I read it is in less than a week."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is That All There Is?","review":"Maybe the book is entertaining. Hard to tell if you are listening to the unabridged audio version. I did make it to the end of the first CD. Then gave it up. The reader is boring and uninteresting. Worse, she thinks, like so many of the current narrators, that she has to do \\"characters\\". This one cant. All her accents are phony. Do we need the accents? No. Don't we know how a Brooklynite or Southerner talks? If you can't do it right, just talk American. Frank Muller is dead; the last of the greats."},{"rating":"1","title":"storyteller","review":"If you like Tales about the rich and famous and the lives of luxury that they lead, you'll like this book. If you're tired of reading about spoiled people who take no consequences for their own actions, then you won't like this book. As always, Jackie Collins is a great storyteller and this book is full of sex, lies and dirty dealings."},{"rating":"2","title":"lovers and players","review":"i absolutely love this book, this again is another good book from jackie collins!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tremendously boring","review":"Jackie Collins has bored me for quite awhile now.

I was so excited to get this book, but am very disappointed in it. I just could not get into this book. I didn't even read all of it. I didn't find the characters interesting at all and was just bored with all of it. I will still read whatever she puts out, I just hope it is better than this next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't Finish It","review":"I've been a Jackie Collins fan for nearly 20 years, but I just could not finish this novel. It was boring, the plot was an old rehash of everything Collins has ever written, and the characters poorly developed.

KINKY SEX! AGAIN? AGAIN? AGAIN?","review":"Men who cheat. Women who cheat. Love, betrayal, murder. Fabulous locales and kinky sex. Haven't we heard this song before? Perhaps too many times. It's no wonder why Joan Collins' younger sis, Jackie, did not have her long-standing (and lucrative) contract with Warner Books renewed. She may have penned nearly two dozen books, but they all read the same ... cut and paste has never been more profitable. The woman Vanity Fair dubbed \\"Hollywood's own Marcel Proust\\" may have insisted (in the title of book #1) that while The World is Full of Married Men, it's also full of writers who know how to cash in on trash ... and the people who rummage through it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not worth it","review":"The kind of book you buy in an airport and read once.

If you don't mind redundance then this might be just the book for you"},{"rating":"2","title":"My proverbial Jackie cherry has been broken","review":"This book was my first foray into the dramatic world of Jackie Collins and it was the guiltiest pleasure. The book was near impossible for me to put down. It was an easy yet totally engrossing read. It played like a campy soap opera rollercoaster ride, and yes, it was fun! A reviewer was correct in saying that the character development was slightly weak and you didn't end up caring for anyone in particular but it didn't hinder my reading experience. I didn't know what to expect from a Jackie Collins novel and I would have to say I can see why she's so popular."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been better","review":"This book has so many characters but its still hard to like any of them.All the characters seemed underdeveloped. Its also predictable. You can tell what is going to happen early on, and by the middle of the book you just dont care. Ive read JC books before but this one just seems like she ran out of steam."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good enough not being an historical.","review":"I ventured into the world of the modern day fiction with this and it was a very good story. Missing for me was the hot sexy romance I find mixed with my historicals. I guess I prefer that. This was a complex story about power money lots of betrayal and secrets of a whealthy family. Truly it was amazing to me that the 3 sons of Red Diamond managed to only have the few hangups they each did have. Red truly was a bastard of the highest level. So for a book about the complex relationships between 1/2 brothers that were not exactly raised to be close but manage to be there for each other when times get rough - it was a well written good solid interesting story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read","review":"While somewhat predictable, the characters were well-defined, which made you care about them and what happened to them...and kept me reading nearly all day in order to find out everything that was going on. Even the multiple storylines, which can often be confusing, held my interest.The only thing I found annoying was the character of Lulu. It was bad enough that she was an annoying, whining brat...but the constant chanting over and over of whatever words someone said were nearly enough to make me pull my hair out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovers & Players","review":"Its very entertaining andJackie Collins is a real story teller.I hve bought all her books.Its always funny n we can relate to the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not like her other books","review":"I read the reviews before I read the book and didn't believe that it would be as bad as people were making it out to be, but they were right. One of the things that drove me crazy was the way that Max's daughter talked. She was supposed to be 5 years old and talked like a 2-3 year old - referring to herself in the 3rd person and repeating phrases or words 3 times in a row. Aside from that, I feel like this book could have been cut in half due to the repetitiveness of some of the character information or things that they said. Liberty's story was very not very interesting at all and was incredibly predictable and the ending was horrible and BORING!I love Jackie Collins books and this one was very disappointing in many ways."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Speakers for Under $250","review":"I have owned many different types of speakers.

If you like it, you can also look for the sequel: The Boggart and the Monster."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disapointing","review":"I am quite surprised that amazon's romance editor recommended this book. The writing level is very juvenile, for example, emotion is conveyed by using exclamtion marks and lots of emotional adjectives. The characters are stock and just about one-dimensional, either totally virginal and saintly (the heroine) or cruelly inhuman and murderous (the villan). The hero is another tortured one with a dark secret, which has been much better done in other books. Finally, the plot is just about formula, for example the major conflict running through the bulk of the book is very shallow--\\"I can't let myself love him or her, but my temperature boils whenever I am near him or her, oh what shall I do!\\" I might have liked this book alot when I was 13, but adults want more than titilating sex scenes held together by melodrama."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book was outstanding, well written and emotional","review":"While it seems Heather has been raised in the lap of luxury, all is not what it seems--she has that very same feeling when Damian hires on at her estate.

Damien comes to realize Heather couldn't harm a soul--both get much more than they bargained for when they start falling in love.

Literally, every other page ends with something like \\"...and she wept.\\" She was so rude to Damien, not firm or strong, just rude and loud and argumentative. Everything was a such a big deal.The sentence that bothered me the most was, \\"She pressed the back of her hand to her forehead.\\"What is this, a play?

I loved Just One Kiss and One Moonlit Night. She never disappoints me.

For example, a subsidiary of Haliburton, that drives trucks in Iraq, charges for trips it forces its employees to take with empty trucks between cities in Iraq, simply because they charge by the mile traveled. This creates tremendous life threatening risk for the employees, but gets great profits for the company, and does not serve American interests. They frequently do this with empty trucks, and are not transporting empty trucks to the destination because they are needed there, but simply to accumulate the mileage.

As we know from pass experience with Wars, they are UNFUNDED by Congress and as such our country will spend what ever is necessary to win a War ~ as it should be. However I have a problem with Congress trying to blame our current deficit on over factors. As an old man, my memory is not dead YET and I can recall many actions taken to try to win the Wars in Iraq and Afghan. After all my son-in-law spent 3 tours of duty in Iraq and currently on the end of his tour in Afghan.

The script is no stranger than most, the casting is excellent and the action is phenomenal (especially the warehouse/construction site brawl). The fatal flaw with this film is the soundtrack, not the tpe of music, but the volume. It is so loud it overpowers the sound effects and the pieces that have been chosen's rhythyms don't mesh with the action on screen. It makes the fight sequences feel out of sync. If the soundtrack is scrubbed and replaced with rap songs with a more appropriate beat and mixed so that the sound effects could be heard, I'd give this movie two more stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is what it is, people - action and comedy","review":"All right, so this movie isn't the best work Jet Li has done. It's not really the point. This is fun, mindless action and I really enjoyed it. True, the dubs on the English version are hokey.

There were a few enetertaining fights, but not as much as, say, Twin Warriors (which was a far better movie, IMHO).

The Phony fighting scenes could not be more obviouse if they used hand puppets. Wen you see Jet Lee speed up to blur like speed, all the surrounding scenery also speeds up the same.

The action is often breathtaking; Jet Li is a charismatic hero, and Karen Mok a charming heroine; the photography is superb; the sets and costumes are always interesting. Unfortunately, the film has been edited (at least, in the American version) as if it were a music video, with no concern for coherence. As a consequence, the overall story is murky (I never could figure out exactly what the bad guys were up to), and the composition of individual scenes is often confusing (in many of the fights, you have to guess who is hitting whom). I could also have done without the wall-to-wall rap soundtrack, but your taste may vary as to that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sexist and Trashy","review":"I like Hong Kong flicks and I love Jet Li in them.

Unless you're into boring sci-fi junk with no real substance...this is a big waste of time. The two women represented: One is supersex killer with fishnets (just what a modern fighting girl should wear - yuck)...and the other is ultra clingy and pathetic Karen Mok. What was Jet Li thinking?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Jet's worse, but man was that bad","review":"Now obviously the new rap music and great american voices they put on make it as bad as possible. But then again, the movie certainly is no gem in it's original language version, that is for sure.The whole movie had above average action sequences, but the story was unbearable. Not the story itself, but the execution of it is the worst possible. It goes from sickening moments to almost little kid parts between Jet and teh girl. Just freaking horrible.So the dvd is full screened, music is stupid, voice dubbing is almost as bad as the \\"jet li collection\\" movies, but you will get a few good points one or two good laughs, and a decent finale."},{"rating":"1","title":"stop the rap music, please","review":"Just because someone might be a fan of martial arts movies, doesn't mean they want to listen to an hour and a half of backround rap music. I would rather have seen the original Hong Kong version of this movie because the American distributor made a joke out of this. Every scene is punctuated by rap or hip hop. So if you don't like that kind of music, this movie is hard to watch, which is a shame cause it's a pretty cool movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Sharp at times Exciting Action-Thriller.","review":"Selected, Biologically Engineered Battle Squad takes over the Hong Kong Drug Trade.

Jet Li has so much talent and could do so much better. If you are not a Jet Li fan you may find this movie greatly entertaining, If you are a Jet Li fan you will be nearly sick. There is one good fight scene and it is very short. If you follow Jet Li movies you probably characterize him as some sort of super being. It is quite amusing to see Jet Li preform acrobatic confrontations against people weaker than him and several near equals in a film. In this movie every opponent is a super being. Basically its Jet Li starting a stunt only to be countered by a fifty year old man on wires. The mere sight of a old man kick off a wall, fly twenty feet on wires to kick an immobile Jet Li in the head made me wince. If you want some good martial arts movies buy The Enforcer, and Fist of Legend."},{"rating":"1","title":"nonsensical, silly, and dull!","review":"I love Jet Li, which made me dislike this movie all the more. Some funny moments, some halfway cool moments, but boring overall. I am sure the original HK version is better, it couldn't be any worse!

The topics this book covers, according to the summary, I have known, studied since the time I was in third grade back in 1962. Back then it was groundbreaking science, more theory than reality. The ideas this technology was built on, goes back centuries in theory. This is my point in writing this review.Old does not mean the ideas are without merit, without purpose, but if anything you are reading my sci fi, as what is now history and very relevant..

First, the zippers are very cheap and get stuck easily, 2. The canvas material is not what it used to be either, my old set seemed to be bullet proof but this new set is not the same. 3. The sizes are so different, I ordered the bibs/cover-all a size larger than I wear, but when they were delivered and I tried them on, it was as if they were two sizes smaller. The material is thin, and the insulation is very cheap and again not what it used to be. I am very disappointed in this Carhartt product, to the extent I will probably not trust Carhartt with any more purchases.

Mr. Irving's writing style drones on endlessly and lulls the reader into utter boredom. There was so little focus on Cindy Campbell Ray - yet, she was the subject of the story. I was incredibly bored and couldn't wait for this book to end. Even the captions under the pictures were stupid. The quotes from the book that he picked to caption the photographs were inane.

This book sounds like an endless talk show. To read this, you would think that we were living in Nazi germany, not the USA. This is NOT my experience of being gay-that we are constantly being victimized by others. It is my experience that those who don't understand that private sexual activity does not have to determine public dress, bumper stickers, behavior, etc, do ruffle other peoples feathers. But the same goes for straight people who refuse to tone down their blatant sexual preoccupation (putting pin up posters in their office, women who dress outrageously suggestive, etc). I hated this book. I also thought some of it was creepy-sexually obsessed.

I liked the title but did not get much out of the book. The author is very touchy-feely-sensitive and this got on my nerves after a while. Grow up! There isn't a lot of practical advice here, which is what I was looking for. I guess it is hard to actually give practical advice to gay people as a group since we are so different from each other."},{"rating":"1","title":"CDROM does not have correct code","review":"I just bought this book today. The included CDROM has so many problems with missing files, misnamed files and misplaced files that I cannot in good conscience refrain from warning people about the problems with the CDROM. This does not mean that the CDROM is unusable, but anyone who expects to use the code on the CDROM should expect to do a LOT of work to fix files to the point where rebuilding the programs described in the book is possible.Coriolis says this book is warranteed for 90 days against bugs.

I gave it 4 stars because of the high sodium content. I forgot to pay attention to this prior to ordering, and now my arthritis is acting up and my hands and feet are swollen/burning. Today, I ordered the low sodium (which is still higher than it should be .. the norm is less than 140 mg per serving) to see how I react to it. I adore soup.

The more entries there are, the less thorough each entry can be. This work seems to go too far in the number of entries it includes. It's useful if you need to know a sentence or two of information about an obscure boat or officer or something like that. However, such inclusiveness only leaves room for a few hundred words or less on major people and battles. Since the majority of people are more interested in the larger people and issues, this limits the usefulness of this work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay - not great for non-readers","review":"Bought this for my six-year old; and although she can read some and we played it together the first few times, the rules in this game were a little complicated for her.

The kit also contains several each #2 Philips and PoziDriv bits, which are redundant. Admittedly, the #2 Philips is a popular size, and having a back-up is nice, but the Pozi bits aren't used much in the US. I'd like to see combo-bits (slot + Philips), triangular bits, security Philips bits, the newest style TORX Plus bits (not the security type which aren't released to the general public), and perhaps bits for removing one-way screws.

Kahn has one of the most powerful and charismatic vocals in metal and the other musicians prove their mettle as well.It's hard to find another live performance to match the standard of this one, other than Queen's Live at Wembley and Iron Maiden's LIve After Death.

Education, advocacy, and education - coupled with complete peanut avoidance - and overall compassion, is missing here.It's more of a trial by fire, and we're lucky Sam was still with us after the anaphylactic reaction - many kids are not as fortunate.

An AM radio with sensitive tuning will let you pick up weak signals between those two locals on 1430 and 1440. With the Eton S350, the signal on 1410 started coming in at 1390 and stretched all the way to crosstown rival 1460! In fact, music from 1410 came in as background under 1460, which shouldn't be possible. That shows how awful this radio is!I bought one at Radio Shack and returned it within a week.

From a historical perspective it was very enlightening and interesting.

The Story is well crafted, well researched and historically accurate. Suliman had a mother... this could be her story. Many of the characters are historically accurate. With it on my Kindle...I've probably bought my last copy.

I would not even categorize this book as a romance novel. I have read a couple of Bertrice Small's other books and loved them. but this was different. The book was very long, and actually takes place over a period of decades. I agree with another reviewer that the book is mainly political. I usually love historical novels, but the plot is extremely tedious. The book starts out interesting, but it increasingly gets worst. The polygamy stuff really took the romance out of the relationship with the two main characters for me. The hero loves and sleeps with his other wives while \\"inlove\\" with the heroine.

Instead its a very simple routine that isn't well grounded in science or theory and just seems to have come from the author's experience in his own basement gym. The author also borrows liberally from the training advice common to two-bit karate books from the 70's in his weightlifting methodology, which tends to cast doubt on his authority as a weightlifting expert.

None of the books concepts are base in fact or research yet they are touted as far superior to any others"},{"rating":"1","title":"Power to the People! : Russian Strength Training Secrets","review":"Save your money and look for a real book on Powerlifting and or strength training. This book basically talked about deadlifts, floor presses(dangerous) and military presses. It's basically a book on powerlifting for someone who is not interested in bodybuilding, powerlifting, or getting bigger. You might get stronger than the average couch potato with the routines he provided in his book. You will not get the muscle mass density or strength of a powerlifter or bodybuilder. If you want to get strong you have to lift big and when you do, you will get bigger and stronger muscles. You will even lose bodyfat in the process. Look for books on Powerlifting to get stronger. Their basic powerlifting routines will increase your strength and muscle mass a lot faster than those lightweight routines Commie man placed in his book.

Pavel has been the only Strength Training author to \\"clearly\\" articulate and describe the hows and whys of proper strength training. I always knew I had a lot of potential for strength, however, I couldn't find the key to on lock it. Pavel's Power to The People is the key. I highly recommend buying Pavel's book so that you can clear up all the mysteries of strength training and unlock your potential. If I had a dollar for every person I've heard say: \\"if I only had used Pavel's principles when I was younger\\" - I would be very rich."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surely This is a Russian Plot?","review":"After reading this book and seeing the incredible price tag for so little useful information, surely this must be a Russian plot to bilk hard-working Americans out of their money and send them on a mission of useless training programs?As so many other reviewers have stated, it appears that Pavel's books are written in serial fashion to either 1) get you to buy more expensive books or 2)get you to buy expensive DVD's.\\"Take down that wall Gorby\\"...so those wacky Russians can experience the American dream by selling over-hyped books supposedly containing valuable Russian training \\"secrets\\".Comrades - save your money and your time! Search Amazon for some of the common sense, practical weight-training books, preferably by Stuart McRobert, Bill Starr and some of the old-timers who built massive physiques and strength without Russian \\"secrets\\", steroids, or other nonsense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected. Pass","review":"This book is mostly a waste of time. Pass.I used to like Pavel's occasional focused articles on variants of training, from plyometrics to kettle bells. I also liked some of the things I read on Dragon Door to shake up my training.This book is cheesy schtick with this \\"velcome, Comrade\\" tone, and chock full of training advice ranging from average to terrible.If you are looking to up your training regimen, you'd be much better off with HITT or I hate to say - even Bill Phillips Body for Life type pyramid regimens. I've even gotten better results from German volume training.Some of the basic ideas are useful, and I have had success with some of Pavel's older articles, so I'll be generous and give this two stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent start","review":"I liked this book and have been following the cycles in my strength training for quite some time. The principle of irradiation is interesting and I've since eliminated the idea of isolation and replaced it with emphasis. I like how this book teaches a practitioner to become strong without adding any mass. I would only give the book 4 stars because it is a start and not a one stop source for developing strength. For the price of the book, it should be. I have made significant gains on this program but have reached plateaus and I also find that when I abandon this training, my progress is quickly lost. I think the author purposely holds back information in his books so that he can later publish new books containing the missing information and make more money. This is no way to do business. All this aside, this is a great start to strength training but the book does have its limitations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Effective!","review":"What are your strength training goals? Do you want to increase strength without gaining size? Do you want to increase strength and size? Do you want to learn how to get the most out of your body in terms of strength production? If your answer to any of these questions was yes, then you will not be disappointed in this book.As an ex-gymnast, my goal was always attempting to make my body as strong as possible without an increase in size. If I would have had the luxury of owning this book when I was competing, my workouts would have been different! The thing that sets Pavel's books apart from others that I have read is his attention to detail and his user-friendly writing style. The techniques that he teaches can be utilized whether you are lifting barbells, dumbbells, kettlebells or your own bodyweight.If you are into strength training, I highly recommend this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Testimonial-Results speak for themselves","review":"Forget all of the fancy rhetoric. If you are serious about improving your strength and your health buy this book and pay attention to what's provided. I started in January 2000 doing deadlifts with 200 lbs.

I have been training with weights for over 15 years and I am stonger and more ripped at 39 than ever- thanks to PAVEL. (Just ask my muscle head friends.) His formula is simple: hi tension = dense (ie STRONGER) muscle. Simple. I am the ultimate sceptic- you want me to beleive something? Prove it. Pavel did and the only reason I am writing this is because I have read some ridiculous, and totally incorrect, negative reviews here.Trust me now- thank me later."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Basics","review":"If you are involved in sports or you are getting into strength training, this lays down the basics that someone should have told you a long time ago. It is a amazing how many ignorant people hang out around the weight rooms across america. I, for one, have spent my fair share of time in weight rooms and this is the first time that work-outs have made sense. I have followed the authors instructions and I have gained 25 lbs in my bench and 40 lbs. in my deadlift in 6 weeks. All this improvement and I would spend only 20 minutes a day in the weight room and not one day was I ever soar. If your are serious about strength, you are not doing everything you can if you don't purchase this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Factual, but not worth the money","review":"There are other, more comprehensive books on powerlifting out there, for less money. This book focuses on the deadlift and the \\"floor press\\", which a bench press on the floor. Yes, you lay on the floor, have someone hand you the bar, lower it until your elbows touch the ground, then press it back up. Nothing but a dangerous partial range bench press. The shoulder press involves pressing a barbell with one hand, by holding it in the middle. This makes it very unweildy, and unsafe especially for your wrist.

After reading the likes of McRobert, Dreschler, Bryzki, and Zatsiorsky (who Tsatsouline quotes in this book), this comrade is a \\"joker\\". Tsatsouline recommends two exercises in his book, one of them is a common exercise and the other is (not saying it won't work) a little ridiculous! I would recommend this book only to the beginner due to the fact that you have tremendous potential and will respond to \\"any\\" type of training (just get off the couch).

I also review about three different books/programs a year. Each program's success was a direct result of the individual effort put into it. Pavel's book was an effort to finish reading. The principles are simple, you can find them in almost any collegiate and high-school football weight program. The book is dedicated to quirky and far from common examples of sometimes circus feats of strength. Pavel could have compressed this book into a flyer and also eliminated the final half-dozen or so pages of ads for his other books and products. I have no doubt that these techniques work for Pavel or others. Just don't buy this book and expect the secrets of strength to open up. For the cost of the book, many will be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money","review":"I enjoy collecting books on fitness and weight training. However limited the content may be, I'll keep the book if it has one good idea. I sent this one back. You will too,unless you feel deadlifts and one arm presses constitutes an entire workout.

The book should have taken 2 pages not 80."},{"rating":"1","title":"CLIFF NOTES VERSION OF SUPERTRAINING by MEL SIFF","review":"This is the cliff's notes version of \\"Supertraining\\" by Mel Siff. What this comrade did was flip through the 600 page \\"Supertraining\\"and paraphrase a page here and there. You can sum the whole book up in a few sentences. Do one arm shoulder presses and deadlifts. A few sets of 5 each day. Increase the weight 5lbs each week...once it gets too hard...start a new cycle 5 lbs heavier than where you begin the last one.

If your a veteran athlete that thinks he knows it all like me then get this book and enjoy the fresh air. It's only been 4 work outs and I like applying his very simple principles.

Apply what you read and you can not lose, period!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor value, very little explanation of theories","review":"I tried this program and soon became stagnant with no gains, even when using the cycles as suggested. I found out why it didn't work when I read \\"Serious Stength Training\\" by Bompa, DiPasquale, et.al.Pavil writes a funny book that proposes programs that may give you short term strength gains, but will eventually stagnate your strength. In addition, this program may not be good for your health as there is not enough conditioning work proposed prior to going through his 3-5 day a week training cycles of only two exercises.Pavil is probably fit and pretty strong, but I gotta wonder, how much weight can this guy lift? He doesn't say in the book at all--maybe for a reason. :-)My recommendation--SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"very little factual information","review":"Pavel is obviously a great athlete, however his books are filled with very little information about anatomy and physiology, and could be condensed into perhaps 10 pages. The Dragon Door marketing machine pushes these type of publications and kettlebells as a fitness revolution. I own 4 of Pavel's titles and they are essentially empty pages. If you are indeed using kettlebells, avoid by all means holding your breath during the exercise, the Valsalva maneuver as suggested in these books!Save your money, instead look at Steve Maxwell's 300 workout (see my review of this product, it is excellent), for example, or for those of us not into ballistic movements, Yoga for Real Guys. For the ultimate in exercise theory, get Ken Hutchins book on Super Slow exercise, or Dr. McGuff's upcoming book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch","review":"Guys, I respect Pavel, and he has a tremendous reputation in the power-training world. I was really excited to begin the routine in P2P, but it only took me three weeks to WRECK my lower back from the deadlifts and my right shoulder from the side presses. I'm a strong, healthy, 26-year old guy with about a year of freeweight experience. I paid very close attention to Pavel's directions, and still got injured. There are safer routines out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Best info on proper deadlift form I have seen","review":"Otherwise, this book is good, but not great. It definitely has some good and thought provoking information, but it is littered with wacky anecdotes and advertisements for the author's other books. There is much one can learn from this book, but it is pretty expensive for the amount of meat in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Strength Made Simple","review":"This book was a revelation! I was using the machines at my gym and, while I got a little stronger, I still had all the aches and pains I'd always had, included a problematic lower back.Pavel's program saved me, literally! For the first time in years I'm able to sit and stand relaxedly without lower back pain, and the \\"real world\\" strength I've acquired has astounded me - I can open those jars I could never open, the awkward rear seat in the minivan I used to need a helper to put in now gets put in by me and me alone, and I could go on and on.Add to all this the fact that I lost weight while acquiring this strength and I couldn't be happier. This is _the_ book on making your body stronger and it doesn't matter if this is all you do or if you also do other exercises or sports. (I run.)

The lead character has everything going for her; a great job, family, friends, looks, money, etc. Yet she is pathetically unhappy because she does not have Mr. Right in her life. The book centers on her 30th birthday, and the fact that she is not married. I found myself hating the whining,complaining, sad Charlie thinking that she will never be happy in her life. Also, there was an excessive amount of drinking to the point where it seemed like many of the characters were in a state of constant drunkenness.I am sure it was meant to be humorous, but it just brought home the point that many of the characters where deeply depressed and trying to drown their sorrows with booze.The moral of the story seemed to be that women always have and always will define themselves by the man they marry.

The author comes across as a jerk and a disgrace to the profession. I don't know which is worse, his writing ability or his outlook on life. His rants about the poor are ugly and embarrasing. We all work under difficult conditions in emergency medicine, it comes with the territory. But if Pezzi wants to view his patients as animals, he ought to go into veterinary medicine. The donkeys would at least feel at home with him.

I never really liked violence and this was everthing I was against. Well...I was wrong. My brother was playing this on his PS2 and he let me play with it to give it a try. I'm glad he did. :) I have discovered another favorite game to play. Where I do understand that this game is NOT for the younger crowd, I still reccomend getting it for the older crowd.I don't have a PS2 and I don't know if I'll ever get one.

But don't make the mistake I did. I've already owned the game on the PS2, so I made a dumb decision by buying it on the PC, where I thought the game would have better graphics and controls. I WAS DEAD WRONG! Don't buy this game on the PC unless you have a good computer! I have a Windows XP, so I won't recommend you playing games on this computer! The graphics are even worse then in the PS2 version, and the controls are terrible. What a waste of [money]!

I was expecting a lot better. This was my 1st GTA game, and the last.Sure, it's fun to drive a car/motorcycle/ambulance as crazily as you can and run over people. Sure it's interesting to run from the police... for awhile. Sure it's different to fly a chopper. But really, it gets kind of monotonous. Quickly. After running around the town millions of time and failing some of the same missions, buying weapons and killing people on the street for money... you just find yourself saying, \\"What's the point?\\"Oh, one thing though... KCHAT is hysterical! :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Vice City","review":"Vice city is an early GTA game that is set in the 80's. First of all, the controlls on this game are really bad. you can't aim the gun, it aims for you and it sometimes aims at the wrong person. All the buildings look the same and you get lost very easily. The missions are borring and frusterating espeacially when your character will not hit or shoot the person you want him to kill. Their is also no diversity of vehicles. Buy the Vice city stories, I found the controlls to be easier and I was able to complete the game, however the two best GTA games are san andreas and GTA IV (the new one)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointement.","review":"In my opinion, this game is overrated. Some of my friends told me this game is excellent, but when I finally bought it for PC I was quite disappointed. The graphics are excellent, very detailed. The con about the graphics are the people. They all look the similar to each other. They really need to work on it. People are too rough around the edges. It looks so fake when you make Tommy Vercetti run. And when you see cops and regular people run, it's just too unrealistic. Same things with cars. They repeat after a while plus when they try to speed off, it's just too fast and too unrealistic.When you get a hooker you can hear and see the car moving, but when you change the view angle you can see the people just sitting. It would be better if they showed some sort of movement.Plus I don't like the idea of shooting the hooker after sex or going on killing spree and beating people into a bloody pulp.Yet, I found this game to be pretty addictive."},{"rating":"2","title":"gta did it again","review":"GTa vice city is the best game ever. It's so realistic and has way better graphics than gta 3.You can do missions, or just roam around and cause chaos, or do stunts in cars, bikes, helicopters, boats, golf carts, and even mopeds.

There is only one problem: it won't run on a current system.First it didn't like my Video Cards; gForce 8800sIt can NOT adjust to my controller at all. If you use a controller that has an analogue system (like the PS1/ps2 controllers) it will not be able to accept proper commands. There is no way to invert or reverse the X/Y axis. So up is left and right is down. It's imposable to get used to doing everything in the wrong order. Half my buttons don't work even though the settings options can read them.The game refuses to recognize my sound card (X-Fi Pro) for what it is, giving me only bare mono sound. It chokes constantly crashing for no reason and freezing the system even though I have 8Gb of ram.Works alright on my old system, but that defeats the premise of a gaming machine."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true masterpiece","review":"The Grand theft Auto series is without a doubt the greatest video game series of all time.

That being said, if you enjoyed GTA3 there isn't too much new here. There are some cool new things but all in all its all familiar. Personally I totally dislike the Miami-ish setting. It's flat and boring, much like Florida. Liberty City was far superior. If you have a fast computer and a killer 3d card you will love the graphics. On my XP 2.0 Ghz P4, 1Ghz RDRAM, and brand new ATI 9800 Pro 128MB video card the graphics are pretty stellar. The game itself has no real customizing options for graphics, but my card does, so I'm running 6x anti ali. and 16x antro. filtering at 1280x1224. Looks great.

Blowing up planets and cities is in a sense abstract, and unreal; showing favorite characters being badly beaten, shot and ... other things... is really unpleasant. Overall, the script is pretty dark: The bad guys get off scot-free, an incredible calamity (caused by those same bad guys) destroys a solar system, and one of the Dirty Pair are killed. Kind of a crappy way to end the book, IMO. I thought about giving this two stars for the art, but I actually prefer the art style in the original manga and anime series.

My husband says that this can't be the same toy that he loved as a small child. The spring action in this little guy is so stiff that not even my 10 year old could loosen it up for her little sister to ride on! My youngest daughter is now almost 3 years old and is very strong (weighing in at about 36 pounds), yet she still can't get Marvel to move like he is supposed to. She gets so discouraged with this toy that it rarely ever sees the outside of our storage shed. What a waste of money! I absolutely DO NOT recommend this toy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT FOR MY KID!","review":"When I opened the box the first thing I noticed was that there were no assemby instructions. As I was unloading the parts I noticed that the toy is extremely dangerously manufactured. It included metal foot pegs that have obviously been die-cut and the edges are jagged and RAZOR sharp. The bolts supplied to attach the head of the horse to the body are about a quarter of an inch longer than the receiving, pre-drilled hole so about 1/4 inch of the bolt juts out to the side of the horse's neck in a perfect spot for a small kid's face to hit. The \\"ride-on\\" toy can't even be ridden because the wheels are warped and therefore can't roll without shearing off slivers of plastic on the sharp metal wheel housing. I absolutely cannot believe that Amazon and ToysRUs sells this thing!

My boys have outgrown it but even the 13-year-old still crams himself into it, riding with his knees practically up his nose. (I am not kidding about that.)This go-cart is one hot commodity on our street, let me tell you. We often had 5-6 kids waiting to take their turn to ride it, with arguments periodically breaking out if someone took too long!

The story is one big adventure told in a way which is humorous, and compelling. There is constant danger, but never prolonged suspense to bring any real concern over the outcome. At times Peter is as much a villain to the children as he is a hero.

I started to ponder this and realized that the title was Aristotle. Billy Collins was speaking of life itself. Anybody can relate to a poem if you just give it the time of day.Overall, the book was nicely put together. I enjoy the fact that Billy Collilns isn't like every other poet.

There is nothing in Picnic, Lightning that will change your life. Collins has become a master self-promoter and crowd pleaser, and, like a versifying George W. Bush, is quite skilled at taking no risks with what he says or how he says it. Collins has become adept at writing the \\"Billy Collins\\" poem, and people are eating up his work like Twinkies. Will we ever learn anything about Collins other than that he likes listening to jazz, reading, and throwing parties? I hope so, but given the lure of popularity and the six-figure book deals that go with it, I doubt it."},{"rating":"1","title":"So-So","review":"I find it enlightening that so many reviewers said that they don't usually read poetry.

This book contains articles that the author wrote for a magazine in the 60's and 70's. While the articles are informative and talk alot about AQHA bloodlines, someone with little experience in these fields will become very lost.

The protagonist is Ezra Gordon, an underpaid and underappreciated college prof. whose life is turned upside down by his writing of a pornographic novel. The story is believable and entertaining.

The reader cares about Ezra and the premise of the story is funny and interesting - but the writer's propensity to write, to write repititious dialogue tired me out to the point I gave up in the middle, in the middle of the book. I have no interest in reading anything else by this author in case this IS his writing style.

Alas, although he started with a great idea for a story, and although he did actually tell a story - rare, nowadays, in novel-writing - he lowered himself to sophomoric, pedestrian, and, sadly, boring prose.

I checked it out and anticipated a great piece of writing. Fifty pages into the book, I was, to say the least, extremely disappointed. Being the optimist that I am, I decided to give the book a chance, hoping it would get better. I was horribly mistaken. The further into the plot, the worse it got. Then, nearing the end, something miraculous occurred, I started to enjoy the book. I read faster and faster, enjoying every word. I turn to the last page two hundred sixty-something and then the book stops. No, I mean ends, without tying up the loose ends. It was the most disappointing ending I have ever read.

In fact, they pissed me off so much with their absurd narrow ideas that I felt like chucking the book across my room, but I couldn't because I was so caught up in the story. Seriously, you're labeled as a \\"witch\\" and discriminated on just because you played the role of a gypsy?

You'll enjoy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Barbara's Review","review":"The book was ok. It wasn't the best though. It was kind of boring.Sarah and her mother have moved to Pine Crest. Her mother's boyfriend has a daughter who Sarah doesn't really like. Sarah is a fortuneteller in the Halloween Festival and actually sees something in the glass paperweight. Then what she sees really happens! She gets totally creped out. Eric thinks it would be cool to open a fortunetelling booth to make a little money. Soon people start to think that she's a witch. First she finds a picture of a gallows. Then she finds a dead crow! In her locker! Is she really a witch? What will happen to her?The type of person who would like this book is someone who is interested in witch hunting. That is mainly all they talk about nearer to the end of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book......Okay for Lois","review":"Lois Duncan is my fave author ever, and I've read almost all of her books. This one was good, but definately not her best. She writes the town very well. The way she describes the lives and secret lives of the families is interesting. Again, full of suspence, and a very intriguing story line. I own the book, and might read it again someday. I don't really believe in reincarnation, but I am very open minded, and just pretended. She uses a lot of facts, I like that. If you don't know a lot about the Salem Witch Trials, I would read up on it some before you start reading this book. Overall, it was a good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paranormal Mania","review":"This book could have been so much better than it turned out being. I was not impressed at all with the reincarnation stuffed down the reader's throat by Ms. Duncan. I wasn't pleased with the portrayals of the Christians as evil-minded bigots, hating anyone who's different or doesn't fit in with their views of the universe.I did like the relationship between Sarah and the ugly duckling boy. Ms. Duncan is a better writer than this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting, but not very exciting","review":"I first read Gallow's Hill a little over a year ago and i just picked it up to read again today and it barly held my interest. I mean, when i first read it, it was alright but i really think that Lois Duncan can do much better . This was not one of her greatest books. I really didnt like the ending to much, it didn't close right. All i was thinking was,\\"that was it,what was the point.\\" If you want to read a book by Lois Duncan, read Daughters Of Eve, or Down A Dark Hall, those were excellent books. You can read Gallows Hill if you want to, but don't be surprised if you are massivly dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read","review":"Though not Duncan's best work, Gallows Hill is still a smooth, fast-paced piece of work. The reader can identify immediately with Sarah and is caught up in her story until the very last page. This one cannot compare up to Killing Mr. Griffin and other more sophisticated novels like The Twisted Window, but Gallows Hill is still entertaining and a good read. The karma concept is fascinating."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this book!","review":"I loved this book because it was suspensful. She didn't wright this book from a nairow point of view and I liked that. I like books with supernatural plots,and this one fits that description! This book has originality and charactor! Very good!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A TRULY MYSYERIOUS BOOK.","review":"Lois Duncan has written another fabulous book. Sarah moves into strange, but innocent small town. At first nothing seems scary with no true vilan. But as you read on the vilans start to appear in the most unexpected people. With many refrences to the Salem witch trials this book is a great mystery with a special twist."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very intense book, but just as good as her others","review":"I liked this book a lot. It was very interesting, but I have to admit that it was very hard to read without getting so mad. Lois Duncan writes so well that you feel as if you're in Sarah's position. Everyone is unfair to her, and people always lie about her, and they make her take full blame for bad things they convinced and helped her do. It's enough to make the reader furious at all the other characters. And I really hated Kyra. This, however, doesn't make the book bad. It just means that the book is extremely well-written. It was suspenseful, too. Sarah saw visions of real events that were past or future. You wondered what would happen next. It was also very suspenseful when Sarah would take a walk and get followed. Over-all, I thought that it was a great book. The plot was interesting, and I liked Sarah's character. The only thing I didn't like about it was the idea of reincarnation. I thought it was weird."},{"rating":"2","title":"Learning about colon cancer after diagnosis","review":"After I was diagnosed as having colon cancer, I started reading books to get a better understanding about the disease. This book was the best one I read.The author explains colon cancer in a technical manner, but in a way that the average person can understand the subject. It is written clearly and provided me an excellent reference to question my doctors during the decision making and to be prepared after the operation.The author also spends time discussing diet as a possible preventive for cancer cancer. Since one who has had colon cancer is a candidate for its reoccurence, the chapters about diet are a good reference for the future.If a person is concerned about colon cancer, this book should be in his library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good gift","review":"I bought this CD as a stocking stuffer for my step-dad who is a fan of acoustic guitar music. He didn't seem thrilled with it on Christmas day and I don't think it gets played very often if ever. It was worth what I paid for it, less than $5 I think."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good, kick back and listen","review":"I picked up this one because of the cover, the guitar burning in lava, it fits the CD, this one smokes...It reminds me a little of Ottmar Leibert's early work, not so technosized (is that a word?), pure guitar. This is a put in and listen, read a good book, have it in the background. It's more mellow than, say, Oscar Lopez's Heat. This CD has a fequent listeners spot in my collection. I'm looking forward to Zanabili's next CD"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Very Helpful","review":"I spent 3 months in Europe and can honestly say that I never used this book, not for lack of trying. In Germany, we needed to get gas and found how to ask what kind of gas the car required, however, no listing for the answers you might get to this question, i.e. \\"diesel\\"! Some of the \\"commonly\\" used phrases, according to the authors, include \\"I want to shake my dancing legs\\" and \\"I want to enjoy nature's calm\\". Unless you frequently use these type of phrases, don't bother with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's freely available in Big Sur","review":"I'm a single dad, my youngest has just 'left', and I was in a great funk and did the usual search through Amazon. I don't know why I landed on this book, but bought it. Read/skimmed it in 1 day and, unfortunately found it completely unhelpful. Advice like, \\"Think good thoughts\\", \\"Don't get depressed\\" etc. did not really get to the core of my feeling bad--I felt like the authors were quite pushy in their advice. The good part of the book was the reassurance that I wasn't alone, but their advice for feeling better was simplistic at best. Anyway, there's a free library at Deetjen's Big Sur Inn, where I 'donated' it. So if you're on HWY 1, about 50 miles south of Monterey, stop in and look at it, and I think you'll agree with my assessement."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Sub-Par Retromedia Transfers","review":"Creature From The Haunted Sea looks and sounds terrible. I've yet to watch the other 2 features, but if you're buying the set for Creature (like I did) then stay away, it really looks pitiful."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Place to Start","review":"If you are interested in american history, this book is a great reference to have. It breaks history down by year and further breaks down each year by catagory. It discusses government, arts, sports, sciences etc. year by year. On the down side, each listing is very limited, so if you find something interesting, you first have to find another book on the subject. Still, as I said in the title, it is a good place to start."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good buy","review":"The book looked older than I'd imagine (probably because it didn't have the dust jacket) but was in overall good condition. This is a pretty useful tome for anyone interested in history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frayed writing, needs polish","review":"I found this book to be the perfect example of a book whose time has not yet come. Perhaps the had no other recourse than to go to a \\"VANITY\\" publisher. It needs editing, for the plot is convoluted and entangled in non-linear ways. The characters are soft and hollow. There is no \\"fire\\" here. It reads as if the writer merely typed it. A headless torso, says this observer. No sale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting, but just too distracted","review":"As a die-hard Sox fan, I am interested by any writing about the Red Sox under Theo Epstein, especially when it involves a new and different look at the managerial goings-on of a sabermetric franchise. And there are plenty of interesting tidbits and stories about sagas such as the Jose Contreras deal and the Kevin Millar signings that many Red Sox fans remember vividly. But I felt like there was too much background for certain players, too much focus on specific games. It's worth a read for die-hard Sox fans, but I can't really recommend it for most."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"This book was an excellent idea, and the author seems to have had great access to the two main characters, Epstein and Ricciardi.But he blows it. The storytelling is really choppy. There are too many characters introduced - you have to keep turning back to remember who you're reading about. And he tries way too hard to turn routine events into memorable vignettes. He is not a good enough writer to pull it off, and the end result is this jumbled mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip it","review":"This book is the literary equivalent of the Bataan Death March. It's inconceivable to me that the author actually makes a living by writing. There was no flow to the book, which followed no dicernable chronology or any other theme. The author jumps from story to story within chapters, making no effort to link anything together. Too many characters are introduced, making it impossible to follow who was who and what was going on. Like wading through a bog of molasses.I really wanted to like this book, because I am a Red Sox fan. Skip it an read Moneyball instead, which is a masterpiece and a fun read even for the non-baseball fan. This piece of literary garbage (Chasing....) went on the bookshelf after I was 2/3 of the way through, even with a 13 hour flight from Australia at its disposal. Eeeeeek.bt"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Resouce for Plague Research","review":"I recently read this book for a college history class, and it provided many interesting facts about the plague and the debate between science and religion. Still, it's not really my kind of book. If history is your profession or hobby, definitely check out this title. I found out a lot about the plague and its methods of treatment, so if you're looking to broaden your plague knowledge (and aren't we all?) try this one on for size!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great blade for the money","review":"I'm an active hobbyist furniture maker, and I've tried the Diablo, Freud, and even the $$$ Forrest crosscut blades, and none can match the performance of this little workhorse. The Forrest and Diablo blades consistently burn almost every cut (on both sides of the cut), while this one leaves a nice fairly polished surface that cleans up with only a light sanding or block plane. The Forrest definitely leaves a smoother surface than this one (as it should for more than 2x the price), but who wants to sand out burn marks after every single cut? For the money, I don't know how you could do better, especially considering the thin kerf of this blade. I have even given up switching out this blade for rip cuts, I use it for everything now. It is clearly not as fast as some for rip cuts, but it has done very well for me for an all around blade."},{"rating":"2","title":"waited too long","review":"This thing cuts smooth and fast like a terawatt laser through butter vapor. I didn't realize how bad the old blade was. I was actually sawing it back and forth manually to make it cut.

They finish the season with a record of 13-3, and yet the Titans finish at 8-8 and don't even make the playoffs. How are they making a run for the championship in 2009? Every other team on the cover made it to the second round of the playoffs. Where is San Diego? Where is the DVD of the Epic in Miami, one of the best NFL games ever played?

I've been an avid gardener for over 20 years and the Bionic Women's Gardening Glove is just the best made. They mold comfortably to my hands, provide needed extra support and strength for the hardest gardening jobs while protecting my hands from cuts and abrasions. Whether I'm sieving compost, spreading mulch, pulling weeds, digging, planting, or setting up irrigation systems, I make sure I'm wearing these fantastic gloves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too short","review":"The size chart says the size S gloves are for 6 1/2 to 7 inches circumference. My hand is 6 3/4. They fit fine in circumference but the fingers are much too short and very uncomfortable. I'm also surprised a gardening glove is white since mine tend to get very dirty. These are made by Louisville Slugger so I think they just slapped another label on their batting gloves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Gloves","review":"Only reason i did not give 5 stars is because of how SMALL the sies run.

I wear an extra-large (8-8 1/2) but these are a bit short in the fingers. Strange, too, because I bought their driving gloves and they were a bit big. However, I do like the gloves and am hopeful that because they are leather they will stretch with use."},{"rating":"2","title":"All you need NOW","review":"I really like this book. Even though it covers things lightly, it covers ALOT of topics!! The book flows well and the chapters make sense(the way they were placed). Again, it doesn't duel deeply in to the meaning of things, but it is great as a fast reference. The people I know that have the book, usually use it for writing legals, but it contains alot of other valuable info.

Just when you think its over another competely obvious cliche unfolds. I guess the thing that bumms me out the most about this story is the negative image attatched to the natives. How much time Nunn has spent researching the reservations \\"Up North\\" is disputable. I realize that this is a work of fiction, but Nunn seems to add flair by pumping up the negative meth lab stereotype which he so readily attatches to the local tribes. NOT COOL. Oh yea, and the title of the third book is a dead give-away to the big finale. Tear it out so you don't see the ending 100 pages early.And if your someone who wants to read about surf adventures that are (in my opinion) better and non-fiction, pick up Allen Weisbeckers book \\"In search of Captain Zero.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so hot!","review":"Please be aware I haven't read this book, but my husband did...and this is what he told me: Not a very good book! Not only is the author a mediocre writer at best, but the story is lacking in authenticity. My husband has lived and seriously surfed in Northern California since 1984 (Humboldt County). He thought the book was not genuine, but rather \\"puffed up.\\" A much better book of this type to read, according to him, is \\"Caught Inside\\"...check that one out is my suggestion!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A powerful journey.","review":"Kem Nunn delivers his readers into the perilous turbulence created by the combination of obsession and desire. His story revolves around the sport of surfing, and is quite eloquently detailed. But his message can certainly be understood (and deeply) by anyone with a passion for an ultimate state of being.

And as far as I know, I am no relation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mythic Search for Perfect Surf & The Fate of the Searchers!","review":"Kem Nunn writes a passionate, archetypal book about an aging boomer surfer, a pioneer who preceded the commercialization of the sport.

His mission - pick up two up-and-coming surfers at the airport and transport them to Heart Attacks, a secret, whispered-about spot on the Northern California coast to photograph them with surf legend Drew Harmon. His photos are supposed to show the changing of the guard, the old teaching the young. What actually happens involves the malevolence of man and nature, death, drugs, Native Americans, a young wife, witchcraft, sharks, giant waves, and a few things that defy description. Kem Nunn is an acquired taste, and he even manages a quick salute to an earlier book, \\"Unassigned Territory\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark and moody suspense","review":"An absorbing book full of darkness and brooding suspense fueled by the fanatical extremes of the characters pushing them individually beyond the boundaries of conventional reason. It had me hooked."},{"rating":"2","title":"dark & beautiful","review":"A very sensual book. I could feel the cold, damp air and smell the ocean and the rain forest. The characters were familiar, if not entirely likeable. One has to admire the resolve and determination of the main characters.

Except that vinyl albums had inner sleeves to protect the album when you slid it in and out of the cardboard. The slightest grit or dirt in the sleeve will scratch the disc as you side it in and out. I put the disc in a separate box. But the cardboard sleeve won't fit into a jewel box so the two wind up separated in my collection. I've seen cardboard foldouts that still provide a push-on holder for the CD. This is the cheapest junk CD packaging I have ever seen.

I frankly see no problem with releasing several concert versions of songs at various points in Young's career, heck the Grateful Dead have been doing it for years to much acclaim.What really makes me a bit peeved are two things. First this is only half the show and there's no reason for it to not contain the accoustic set. It makes no sense as there are bootlegs out there of the full set from the 1970 tour and this comes off as rather skimpy. Second, why is it taking so long to release the much touted archives to fans?

Quite frankly however, I just don't understand why this CD is a rip off just because Davis was on the same bill that night at the Fillmore East. In my opinion, and I will leave it to the Neil Young fanatics to explain the genesis of these vault tapes, this is a gem. And, I am sure that the acoustic set that preceeded this one was just as great. Hopefully, that set will be issued at some point. The most intriguing song is Wonderin'. With 20/20 hindsight, the obvious country influence on this tune appears to be a harbinger of what was to come with Harvest, two years later.

You have to be an over the top fanatic to see anything of value in the DVD. Save some money and just buy the CD. At the very least, potential buyers should be made aware that there is no film footage. I'm surprised Neil let this \\"Piece of Crap\\" DVD loose on his fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good and Bad","review":"These are some well recorded performances that are a sizzling testament to the raw power of Neil when he plays with Crazy Horse. It's amazing that they sat in the can for this long. The package and the playing time smack of bargain bin though - 43 minutes? - C'mon! This is no bargain priced CD. The packaging and information is absolute bare-bones.Am I disappointed? You bet, but I'm a fool for Neil's early work, so I'll grudgingly buy the next one too.

More like crazy \\"Old Man\\"...","review":"When I came across this new release in a record store, I was very surprised, to put it mildly. During the last Neil Young interview that I read, he said that the first Archives release would consist of 8 cd's full of great, old live shows including one showcasing \\"Harvest\\" in its entirety. So what's up with this rip-off?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I had high expectations for this movie because it was half-way carried by James Spader who excels in roles that are more conversational and involves human interaction. The artsy feel and uncomfortable theme of the movie just hit me the wrong note with me. I feel Spader's character was inconsistently written. Was he a lucky survivor or a victim? I suppose he was both, but what he perceived himself as was unclear and he went back and forth on this; and also with how his character felt about Anne Brochet's character. I agree with the other review that Brochet's accent was a little difficult to understand to the point where I did use the captions. There were several good moments between the two characters , but unfortunately they were overshadowed by the lackluster, drawn out plot and weak ending. I'm a huge, HUGE Spader fan but this movie is definitely a can-miss!"},{"rating":"1","title":"tr'es franc,ais","review":"A reclusive woman keeps a man who drifts ashore under the idea that they are on an unknown island. This is potentially deep. It touches upon ideas that woman needs man, or vice versa, heterosexually speaking. It hints that even misanthropes need companionship sometimes. Still, the movie also felt like \\"Misery\\" repeated. I hated watching James Spader's character be duped. This movie was long and had few sounds and dialogue. It seemed artsy and noir, in the French kind of way. This is an arthouse film, certainly not meant for the masses. I actually missed out on some of the dialogue because the lead actress' accent was so thick. This DVD really needed captions. This could be a deep meditation on the human condition, but it's still a bit of a yawner."},{"rating":"2","title":"The 2R Manager","review":"I found this book to very informative.

Why? Because Friedes effectively boils down the skills of effective leadership into two concepts: Relating and Requiring. This simple yet profound model works for all kinds of leaders whether you are a business manager, sports coach, teacher, or parent.Perhaps the best part of the book is that Friedes allows you to customize your leadership development to best fit with your current leadership style. Through a simple survey, Friedes allows you to discover your natural style: Relator or Requirer. He then offers a variety of practical suggestions for learning and developing areas that likely need improvement based on your particular style.If you are looking for a solid and practical approach for developing your leadership skills, or those of the people around you, this is definitely the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely marvelous!","review":"My cousin and I just returned from a 9-day trip to Southern France.

The Grandfather Frog story was so well written it captivated his interest, and this is amazing because there are only a few black and white pictures interspersed among the chapters. I am so glad my kids can enjoy these stories, too. They have subtile morals embedded in the stories about not being greedy, and being helpful, etc, that are nice, too.

To my ears these songs are those with the strongest harmonies. Some of the cuts on Carry On are alternate edits, or by Stills alone. My take on it is this: that this Manassas recording is one of the major albums of its era. It's no smoke to own and listen to the whole thing, to get the ebb and flow and rapture of all twenty-one with original harmonic structure and power playing.

The next 2 weeks consist of one complete practice test, broken up into one section one day, with an explanation following the next day, and so on. The next week is another practice test, broken up the same way. I was a little disappointed in the book, as I thought it would be more than just a few practice questions broken up into daily sections.

Such is the right description for this disc.Of all the albums Benson recorded for CTI, this is my absolute favorite, and the one I would recommend to anyone interested in exploring his work for Creed Taylor.At this point in his career, Benson's style was fully developed and on this album, an amalgam of bop, blues, funk, and Latin influences, you get to hear him at his best. Supremely confident and playing with incredible power and fluidity, Benson just tears through the material. The album starts off in high gear with an uptempo funkified version of Dave Brubeck's \\"Take Five\\". The sheer technical prowess Benson exhibits on this cut is exhilarating, yet never is his playing devoid of soul or complex harmonic ideas. \\"My Latin Brother\\", \\"Full Compass\\", and \\"No Sooner Said Than Done\\" are equally brillant. In fact there is simply not a weak track on the entire album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anything but Bad!!!","review":"There are two sides of George Benson. There is the signing pop star that many non jazz fans know, who gives sold out concerts all over the world. Then there is my favorite side of Benson.

The side in which shows Benson's excellent guitar playing. His flashy and talented chops.The album opens with Dave Brubeck's classic, Take Five. This time, done in a funk setting, Benson does this jazz classic like its his own. Nice playing all around! Benson's original, My Latin Brother is a nice groove.The others are nice 70's pop tunes, and funk masterpieces. Drummer Steve Gadd gets some spotlight and some funky drum solos. Ron Carter is an excellent addition to this group also.If you love this side of Benson, the funky instrumental side, then this album is perfect for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Value, Great Function","review":"Unless you have a giant head [or ego] this may be all the helmet you need.Fits great, is light enough not to turn you into a shoe-gazer by the 4th inning, keeps the sweat out of your eyes and you won't cringe every time you need to toss it aside to make a play.You can save the $[...] extra that you'd pay for the flaming skull paintjob, the \\"team-color\\" that won't match your next team's uniforms or the bragging rights for spending too much on your gear- use the money for some batting-cage time or hire a real {NSCA or ACSM certified} personal trainer or catcher's coach to help you PLAY BETTER.Remember- it's HOW YOU PLAY not what you own.

This is a very fine video - Roy\`s biography. the only problem is that it is advertised as the 1943 movie King of the Cowboys, which it isn\`t.

Roy[s biography is worth five stars, but if you are looking for the movie King of the Cowboys, look somewhere elsse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Not nearly as gripping as \\"Upon the Head of the Goat\\".

I had to read this book for school and it was boring. I don't know why but it is a terrible book. Save your money for something better and worth reading. It is just too slow and to long.

Like I said before, don't waste your money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"powerful stuff","review":"Other reviews by young adults suggest there is no action and that it is boring, but they are missing the true meaning.

THE ONION FIELD is one of 1979's best films and it's brutality, both socially and judicially, is stunning. Harold Becker was the right director for this labor of love, an \\"A lister\\" at the time would have screwed it up and the film's intensity would have been lost under the hype. The acting is the core of THE ONION FIELD: James Woods was robbed of an Oscar nod. John Savage plays his heart out as the tortured Carl Hettinger and Ronny Cox is solid as Pierce R. Brooks (Brooks later wrote OFFICER DOWN CODE 3, which is a staple in any police library). Christopher Lloyd has a small important role as The Jailhouse Lawyer. This was justice for Wambaugh after his studio war over THE CHOIRBOYS (1977).

This one had an etched number on the edge and a balance weight welded on--This is correct. It is a good moderately priced brake drum, that does the job. The balance weight is important, because you can never get a wheel balanced to compensate for an imbalanced brae drum and your car will vibrate at speeds over 55 mph. I ordered the second one online from a well known vendor and got a brake drum in a Raybestos box with no balance weld and no numbers etched on the side. I knew right away that this brake drum was a knockoff probably from China. I called Raybestos to confirn this. Then I called the vendor and they offered so little resistance it made me beleive the vendor knew it was a knockoff, because they sent me a new one directly from Raybestos and did not even want to spend the money to have the knockoff returned.

I was looking for a Commentary on each book of the Bible. This book is NOT a book by book commentary on Scripture. So, if that is what you're looking for, this is not the commentary for you.It is a more thematic approach on various subjects in both the Old and New Testaments; but it does not cover material from the writings of the Apostles, such a Paul, etc. It looks good as a Practical Thematic commentary.Just be sure what you're looking for before purchasing this one.-Fr Aidan Hix+"},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Book","review":"I previously ordered 7 copies of \\"The Journey\\" by Billy Graham.

IT was most interesting and a new setting outside of Cambridge was a change of pace. I believe to have a character develop that there needs to be some occasional changes in the basic format of the series. This was a fine book but definitely not typical of the series. I am more of a cat person but have learned a great deal of information from her books concerning showing and the obedience aspect of dog showing.

It took a good 5 - 10 minutes with a set of pliers to get the spring and hook to fit together properly so that it could even extend out to grip a wire. Much of that time was spent bending the 'hook' from the straight position that it arrived in. Its not that I minded spending a bit of time fixing the product, but considering that there are so many other options within $1 or $2 of the price of these, I would recommend buying one of those that doesn't require manual adjustments before use.Also, when the description says 'mini'grabber they mean MINI.

The banana plug end is molded on stacking type, the grabber is a good medium size and not as fragile as some I've seen and not as sturdy as others... I'd say the grabber is average.With any of these minigrabbers, expect to break them at some point. I keep some spare grabbers around in case of breakage. You can also resolder the wire if it breaks there.The wire gauge isn't heavy (maybe 22 gauge stranded) which with these grabbers is actually a good thing.

If you want a book about delta, check out \\"Weapons of Delta Force\\" by Fred Pushies. It's got about all the info that there is about the unit. It also has photos of the equipment and gear that delta uses(being used in the photos by SF, Rangers, and SEALs).\\"America's Special Forces\\" is by far the best book available on the subject of US Special Operations units. A true classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth getting...","review":"Wow! The photos in this book are awesome! The author takes the reader into the heart of America's Special Forces. Page after page illustrates the power and expertise of our country's premier fighting forces. Well written and informative, I bought several to give as gifts as well as for my coffee table."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful book.........","review":"One of my friends who used to own a book store supplied me with a copy of this beautiful \\"coffee table book\\" when it first came out in 1998. The photography is well done and gives a unique perspective of the enormous Buddha statues that one happens to find at various locations around Thailand. Before moving to Thailand I stored some items at my mothers house and this is one of the very few books that I kept. Simply a beautiful book to have if you can find a copy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing t ext and photography.","review":"The photography was at best \\"mediocre\\" and presented nothing that could not be seen in other books on Thailand. The text lacked both depth and understanding of the subject and was stilted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting details but cardboard plot","review":"The author definitely knows Amish details. But in my opinion these were \\"two-dimensional\\" novels that could have been so much richer. Furthermore, the likelihood of those events coming together--the unlikely adoption, the true love not really drowning in the ocean but reappearing five years later, the main heroine becoming the mistress of a manor--made these more Christian-styled \\"soap opera\\" books than good, richly styled novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Shunning was GREAT, the other 2 books, bad","review":"I LOVED The Shunning. It was a great book with lots of suspense and surprises. I couldn't wait to get to the next book.....now I wish I never did. It was SO BORING and SO DRAWN OUT and had absolutely terrible characters, like Dylan, who took up the entire book. It seems like Ms. Lewis ran out of ideas and instead of writing a 2 book series, she made it a 3 book series....She should have kept it to 2. I was so bored I just kept paging through and trust me, you could get the gist of it without reading every page. Disappointing!! Read Abram's Daughters Series instead!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Heritage of Lancaster County -Pack","review":"An excellent series. I have read several of Beverly Lewis\\" books on the Amish and found them fascinating. She is a wonderful writer. I even gave a Book Report to a Women's Group in our church and it was very well received. All the series will be eventually placed in our church Library for others to enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"i would not recommend","review":"These books had a great story line but the story drags on and on including to many trivial details. The only reason you even continue to read this trilogy is to see if Kaite ever gets back together with Dainel Fisher her childhood love. The book contains lot of useless info that makes it very annoying to read. You will end up spending atleast 2 days of your life (thats how long it took me to read the three books. Which is a long time for me b/c i usually go through 8-10 in that amount of time)reading these books to find that the only good part is the epiloge of the last book."},{"rating":"2","title":"shears that can keep you off a ladder","review":"The length was well balanced and was not too heavy.

This is orchestration at it's best coupled with stellar sound quality and acoustic ambience which surrounds you. A nice music system with the volume turned up just a little louder than normal, I swear I could pick out individual instruments and a feeling of being transported into front row center. Even with the iPod and PX-100 headphones, this is musical ear candy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No new information here","review":"The Play the World Strategy Guide is nothing more than a printed version of the Civlopedia, which is included with the game. The \\"strategies\\", if we call them that, can be summed by saying: \\"win the game\\". The manual reminds players to keep the end objective of winning in mind, but provides zero guidance on how to get there. Anyone with a week of playing experience could probably right a more insightful look into the game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy the Game Instead","review":"missed are special strategies and techniques, shortcuts, more than just the rote recitation of what you get with the game itself.I love CIV III despite the almost absurdly long times at the end. Especially fun are the huge games in which you are sometimes centuries meeting your nearest neighbor. The most annoying facet is control of enemy territory. It is nearly impossible to keep a city once it is captured as it almost always reverts back to its former owners. Fix this bug!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fragile!","review":"The product works great until the first time you drop it. I've had 2 of these and they've both broken the same way; the housing gyro in the back end of the unit breaks off and rattles around, rendering the mouse cursor unusable. Both incidents were an 18-inch drop onto a wooden floor from the armrest of a sofa.If you don't have thick padded carpet in your TV room, stay away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Remote","review":"Ordered this for a media center I recently built. Works great, even across the room. My only complaint is with the device buttons at the top (PC, TV, etc.). They are somewhat small and tend to not work the first time I press them. Other than this minor issue I'm quite pleased with the remote. I highly recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT a universal remote","review":"This remote is good enough as a media center remote. However, if you are planning on using it to control your TV, receiver and other functions you are in for a lot of frustration. Learning function simply doesn't work properly, and as someone already mentioned overrides don't work in PC mode."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I purchased this cassette tape deck primarily to use in transferring music from cassette tapes to CDs.

Didn't really want to spend the time and $$ to transfer them to CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good deal","review":"Ordered this deck as a gift. Never heard of Pyle before. Now I know why. This deck looks cheap with its tacky blue graphics. Right out of the box, the power switch didn't work. It has a one-year limited warranty, BUT you have to send it to the manufacturer at your expense, and send $20 for return shipping. Why would anyone spend $30+ on shipping for an item that arrived defective? It's going back to Amazon, and I'll buy a brand I recognize and trust."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting premise, poor excecution","review":"I just couldn't really find it in me to really like this book. It has a good setup, with the ancient teachings of the sith beginning to trickle back into the galaxy, provoking an all-out war in the next volume, but way the characters are handled isn't very well done. Characters do things that just don't make sense. Ulic decides he must turn to the dark side to learn the secrets of the sith, but why? Considering that Ulic and his friends just defeated a Dark Lord much more powerful than the current threat, Ulic's decision isn't something the reader understands and symathizes with, it's simply a heavy handed plot device. A similar lackadasical approach to the characters and their decisions is taken throughout the story, with apprentices disobeying their masters for no good reason and overlooking basic options. The artwork is OK, but overall, I think Dark Lords of the Sith doesn't function well as a Star Wars story."},{"rating":"1","title":"just terrible","review":"The artwork is wanting, the storyline appeared to be very thrown together and I did not get any real sense of why the Sith legends were so impressive.

Really truly incredible, definitely inspired, and I disagree that it is slow...just to take in the incredible visual journey married with a semi-historic prolific story that is absolutely moving in every sense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic DVD Mountains of the Moon, great condition, fast delivery","review":"DVD was in new condition, arrived promptly, well packed, what can I say? what's to complain. I would highly recommend this vendor based on my experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Full screen vs. Wide screen","review":"Several other reviewers had commented that this was a widescreen edition mis-labeled as a full screen DVD. They are 1/2 right. It is a letterbox edition that thinks it is full screen. I had difficulty getting a wide image on a 16x9 screen (black bars on top bottom and sides), but on a regular TV got a letterbox image. Black saturation is not great on the image. I think it was probably transfered to DVD from a letterbox videotape. It would be nice if Artisan re-did this movie as a widescreen anamorphic DVD from the original 35mm print. The movie has spectacular scenes of Africa and it is a shame that the image quality is not the highest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sanitized History...","review":"Though I give it credit for fine acting and cinematography, this film is yet another example of a long list of films that disturbingly sanitize history. Anyone who has done any critical research on this subject will quickly discover that Burton and Speke hated each other well before the expedition ever began. What is more, Speke never married nor had children and there is evidence to suggest that he was probably homosexual. In addition, the interpersonal relationships between the characters in the film are grossly skewed to support the filmmaker's desire to produce a film that is not rooted in historical accuracy. Finally, Speke's death is portrayed as a suicide and any evidence that exists as to Burton having possibly murdered him is practically non-existent in the film. Again, a sad film in my opinion for butchering history into some type of myopic re-presentation. Booooo!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasn't worth the hype","review":"A great movie if you like to see grime and only grime. For me, it is a disjointed movie. The story wasn't melded enough. The characters did not connect with each other enough to create the drama. The sex scenes are so bad that they look like afterthoughts. Poor editing. I see why ordinary mortals like me would not go ga-ga over this."},{"rating":"2","title":"A captivating story of the search for the source of the Nile","review":"Although the theme of the story is the search for the source of the Nile, this film is more about friendship. The characters are extremely believeable and well acted. Although it may not be a technically perfect film, it is very entertaining. If you like either drama or adventure, this film is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"the battle of the 1,000 slain","review":"Great quick read. Puts real people and real invents in a short novel format. The stuff that you didn't learn in school. Sheds a light on what Native American's really went through. An eye opener! Very moving."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Beleaguered City","review":"The book arrived on time and was as advertized. I find that books ordered from Amazon are in the condition that is reported, even used books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good book, awful reading","review":"Foote's a fine writer, a wonderful and accessible historian -- but he's no performer and he does his work a great disservice by narrating it on this audio version. His slower than molasses, monotone reading makes for an incredibly frustrating listening experience. You want to scream at him to just get on with it. I ended up giving up on the whole thing after only the second tape. A shame. I enjoyed reading Foote's history on the Civil War several years ago and was looking forward to reliving the experience in tape form. I suggest you get this in book form."},{"rating":"1","title":"not for people that have MCS","review":"If you really suffer from chemical exposure, don't read this book. It will serve as one more denial of a real illness. Instead, I suggest you read an informative book that will guide you towards less exposure and alternative health care that can help, like Dr. Sherry Rodgers, etc. I was totally offended. Of course, any religious help is always helpful, but to deny the reality of MCS is just another slap in the face."},{"rating":"1","title":"SIMPLIFY! CONDENSE!","review":"DR.

To my profound disappointment, Sampson and his wife spin a tale of the most bizarre, unbelievable stories that unfortunately for him, as well as for readers with MCS, deny the medical fundamentals of this frustrating and debilitating disease.

Bud, or Buddy, is a bad tempered, horse racing, angry, young con artist who is asking for trouble. At least that is how I see him. The story is more like a series of events that kind of don't go together and you wonder what the whole point of the story WAS? It makes me wonder why a female author, B. M. Bower, is writing from the point of view of a male character? Why not the female point of view?Zane Grey this is not and, frankly, a bad Zane Grey is better than a good any other western author, including this one.DON'T waste money and TIME on this book.

I also learned a lot from it for it helped me comprehend in many ways some of my own true life experiences. I enjoyed having three different stories in one book. It was like buying one book but getting three for the price of one. The characters were entwined in two of the stories. I just loved Mama Creole I could see the people and taste the food and Triple Threat was very thrilling in fact I was surprised at the end of the story, it was not something one could contemplate. I loved the mingling and discriptive words and the detailed manner of the author. Thanks for a great read I hope it becomes a frontlist for you, you deserve it.Sincerely,SaffronP.S.

As soon as I returned the item I searched Ebay and located a 70's era Sanyo direct drive turntable with an Empire cartridge and stylus that a private owner sold me for about the same amount of money....it is of high quality and I am very happy with the used unit. If you enjoy playing old albums either spend at least 200 bucks for a new TT or look for someone selling a good turntable from the 70's or 80's.

I have tried two of them and neither would play a record without sticking every 10-15 seconds - either with the included cartridge or a Shure cartridge I had sitting around. One of them came with a warped platter, and the second one would not hold a constant speed - it kept drifting faster and slower. On paper it looks like a nice unit - built-in strobe, a standard interchangeable cartridge mount, etc. As a number of reviewers mention, the unit feels cheap. I could live with that if it actually worked, unfortunately it failed to actually play a record."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Nice for the Price","review":"This item is great for the price. I purchased it for my father this past Christmas and it is still going strong. I have two complaints: the stand and cover are both plastic which makes it a little less attractive and when we received it the hooks that keep the cover on were broken. I never bothered to return it, but if I had they seemed to have a pretty good policy."},{"rating":"1","title":"piece of junk didn't work","review":"When the turntable arrived I was pretty psyched, but as soon as I took it out of the box it was evident that this thing was not a quality product. It was mostly comprised of cheap made in china plastic. Once I set it up I couldn't get the tone arm adjusted properly, the counterweights were not sensitive at all. Once I was finally satisfied with the tone arm I set a record on the platter, but the needle just sat on the edge of the disk and didn't follow the track towards the center of the record. If you want a turntable and this is your price range, go on ebay and find a German made player from the 70s or 80s.

The person at the Outdoor Store was polite and as helpful as she could be, but insisted that it should fit my mower, and was the same as the older model. She gave me a number for the technicians at the factory. I ended out modifying an old part of my retired Cub Cadet grass catcher. Oh Yeah, when I received the box and opened it, one of the bags was broken - the flimsy top plastic rim. Should have been made of metal. It took 2 weeks to be sent a new one, though the Store was good about it. Overall, the whole thing [except the parts made of metal] was very flimsy and poorly designed. Definitely not worth the $300+ ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed with service","review":"Product looks like it might work, but was shipped without all the parts and three months later at the end of Summer, I am still waiting on MTD to send me the correct parts.I may update this review if I ever get the chance to use it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Manger screw up!!","review":"I ordered a bagger for a 38 inch mower and got a bagger for a 46 inch mower the invoice read 38inch.

Think of this as a book that's left next to your desk that you can pick up and read when you have 5 minutes to spare. That's the way this book will benefit.

While I can't tell if it interferes with the performance of the disc, it is certainly quite annoying to have all that stuff on the disc when you just supposedly cleaned it. Additionally, the cleaning pads get dirty after only a few cleanings, and the brush that is supposed to be used to clean them doesn't work at all.If you are looking for a cheap disc cleaning solution, I'm sure you can find a solution that is just as cheap but it much more effective than this particular brand of cleaner. I chose this over others simply because Belkin made it, but you shouldn't necessarily trust a product because it's made by a big brand (as in this case)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best bang for the buck!","review":"Simple, effective, and easy to use.

Crosby and DeMartini's guitar riffs and harmonies positively crush while Pearcy's vocals and lyrics are superb. Don't forget rhythm section extraordinares Blotzer (drums) and Croucier (bass). \\"Invasion of Your Privacy\\" is a lesson in how to compose hooky, yet credible glam rock. The musicians may look like chicks, but they can still churn out some sultry, sweat-inducing, street-smart rock.

If you like 1 track of the album, you will probably like the entire album. It is very energetic from the beginning till the end. It doesn't have a balad, but some tracks like \\"Lay it down\\" have lyrics that could attract a wider audience. The guitar riffs and Pearcy's voice are excellent. This is their best album in my opinion. \\"Out of the cellar\\", which is often rated their best, has only a few good songs and the album is not as consistent. \\"Dancing undercover\\" would match the most with \\"Invasion\\". If you like a different rock tune, then this is the one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Ratt Album out there!!!!!!!!","review":"While Ratt's debut album is also a favorite of mine, I believe that this album is their best.

Of course, back in '85, these guys were just looking at girls.But when listening to this invasion of privacy, it seems that there isn't much meat on the bone. They get that 80's party rock beat, anthemic chorus, guitar solo, and very lean on the songwriting.The opening 'You're in love' is an excellent rock anthem with great riffs, 'Lay it down' is a very good song, and 'Between the eyes' is different enough to be interesting.Apart from that, the songs aren't bad, but there is very little depth in the songwriting, just chugging out that stadium sound and shifting the units."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been better","review":"I saw the You're in Love video and loved everything about that video, the songs that followed this track on the CD however seemed a bit less. As I would soon discover, it appears that Ratt used a lot of the same songs on CD from CD which made the collection as a whole somewhat not as good as others I've seen. Great look, but as for me and my taste this CD just wasn't on target. Try again."},{"rating":"2","title":"RATTS INVASION !!!","review":"Invasion of Your Privacy, one hell of a album ! Full of great rock riffs, and searing lead guitar by DeMartini, Ratt laid down some serious rock. Steven Pearcy's voice was and is still unique in the world of rock making Ratt unmistakenly andimmeadiately recognizable.I beleive that we have to give Ratt their due just for this album along. How can anyone not listen to the song Lay It Down without cranking that baby up and listening to that heart beat bass rythm. Thats one of the best bass lines in rock n roll period !!! This album certainly belongs in the top 20 albums of the 80s.Invasion of Your Privacy is a 80s collectable for certain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tha package came imcomplete, I sent it back","review":"I bought it but i sent it back because the package came with just 2 shield, the frame and another shield was missing, I got my money back later on"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best series available","review":"Yes, I think it's better than Hung, SOA, Weeds, and all the rest.Just wish I didn't have to wait until the season was over to get all of the episodes!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This show is losing its quality","review":"The first two seasons were the best.

For me, this was a huge bust because I was going to make candy corn cupcakes for Halloween, and these were going to be the decoration on top. 2 stars though because it tastes good.

Target and Toys R Us have a 5 car pack designed just for the Blast and Crash for around $[...] dollars so I grabbed that as a stocking stuffer and it has worked great.

It seemed like such a good idea to me, I always carry my baby on my hip, but she is 9 months old and 24 lbs. so it's really difficult. I thought this would be a great help. It is so uncomfortable! The strap that was up by my neck was choking me and the strap is scratchy and uncomfortable. My daughter kept trying to lean over the side because she felt uncomfortable too, and if you don't position them properally they can slide through the leg openings. I don't see any possible way to use this without keeping one hand on your child, which it actually says in the instructions, so what's the point?! I tried this out a few times thinking maybe I was doing something wrong, but it's the same everytime, and now when I try to put my daughter in it she screams!

The weight is distributed differently and there is less strain on the back with the hammock. It's easy to use and folds up nicely."},{"rating":"2","title":"We Love It!","review":"My 19 pound 6 month old and I both love this carrier. It feels almost exactly the same as when I hold her on my hip minus the tied up sore arms."},{"rating":"2","title":"big AND disabled babies","review":"My son is a 20 pound 6 month old. He was born with club feet and has a Dennis-Browne Bar between his feet. We can't put him in a shopping cart because he wears the brace all the time. We used to use a front carrier, but chunky butt got too big for it and it was a hassle to put him in by myself. I used the traditional sling with my other 3 kids, but couldn't use it for this little guy because of the brace. We just hook the hammock waist strap on, feed the rest between his legs, pull up and over my head, tighten and we're ready to go! I love it. I superglued some bathtub no-slips to the inside of the neck strap to keep from sliding. Works great. Highly recommend for anyone looking for nonconventional methods of transporting nonconventional kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for quick trips with my 10mn old and 3 yr old!","review":"The Hip Hammock is very easy to use. Just snap it around your waist, place the baby on your waist and pull the strap and over the baby and your heads.I place my 25lb, 10mn old in here and am able to have both hands free to take my 3yr old to the public bathroom and help her wash her hands. That's a big help to mom!Normally when my baby is on my hip (w/out the Hip Hammock), he's never still and I'm constantly having to pop him back up onto my hip. I think the Hip Hammock makes him feel more secure and doesn't feel the need to move around.I do agree with the other reviews about the shoulder strain. However, I've found that if I tighten so the baby is close to my body, I have less strain. I've vacuumed for an hour or more at a time with my baby in the Hip Hammock(my shoulder is definitely requesting a break by the end...), but I've at least gotten the house vacuumed and with an active infant you need all the help you can get!"},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT!","review":"I recommend this product to everyone I see, even if I don't know them! I get asked about it a lot as well. My son is 7 months and we have been using it since he was about 5 months old. I also was not comfortable with a premaxx sling/baby bjorn/ultimate baby wrap... lots of money wasted on those three, but you never know until you try it! When the hip hammock is digging into my neck it just needs to be adjusted and can be done easily. I get SO much more done with this than a stroller, it is especially handy for taking him to crowded places, I always worry with him in a stroller because it only takes one distracted moment for something to happen. When he's in this he's happy and secure and I can devert my attention as much as I want and still know he's there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for about 5 minutes.","review":"My son is 10 months old and weighs close to 25 lbs. I put this on , tried adjusting it as much as possible trying to find the comfort but the entire pressure of the baby rests on the neck. I went in and out of Toys R Us to get diapers with this on and when I was done I was left with a red mark on my neck like whiplash. I cannot imagine wearing this with a baby close to 35 pounds. Even though it was not good for me.. my baby seemed very comfortable. I will now look for a back carrier."},{"rating":"1","title":"SO NOT WORTH IT!!!","review":"I bought this for my 13 month old and she hated it and it dug into my collar bone. I am not a very tall person but my husband is a lot taller and he felt the smae way about it. I returned it 20 minutes after buying it. The store salesman said that about 30-40% of them have been returned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Painful! Great idea but not comfortable for me","review":"I thought I would love this but just returned it. It hurt my neck so badly after only wearing it a short time (10 minutes?) Maybe I'm too small (5'2\\")or my baby (5 months and 18 pounds) is too large. Either way I still find the Bjorn much more comfortable. I would like something where the baby is more sideways on my hip like this than either facing me or facing out and so confined as he is in the Bjorn, but I couldn't stand wearing! Very painful."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Hip Hammock is just dreadful!","review":"I bought a hip hammock because my daughter had grown out of the snugglie and she still wasn't big enough to sit in a basket on her own, so I thought it would be good for shopping. I tried to adjust that damn thing a bunch of different ways, but never worked right. All of the wieght of my 22lbs. daughter was resting on my neck . .it was dreadful. The weight does not rest on the hip as they say . .they are lying! Don't buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Does the job!","review":"Needed something to replace our baby bjorn. My son is 8-1/2 months old 21 lbs and it was just too much on my back. I love this hip hammock. I think others that said it hurt their neck are not using it the correct way. I honestly feel like I am not even holding the weight of him and I am also 17wks pregnant so I needed something that was not going to push on his little brother. We went pumpkin picking and it was so nice to have both arms free and not get an arm cramp like I do when I hold him for too long... he is a little tank."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this!","review":"This is great for whenever but especially when your baby is sick and wants to be on you every second of the day or when your shopping and baby gets fussy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product! Easy to use.","review":"This is a terrific -- much easier to use and more comfortable than the front carriers. Only complaint is if you wear the shoulder strap as they show in the picture, when you raise that arm the strap shifts up closer to your neck, so it's just easier to leave it there."},{"rating":"2","title":"citizen watch","review":"I have owned this watch for over 5 years and it is wonderful. it's very lightweight, doesn't catch on items.

It is always the parents that desire to have an outsider \\"fix\\" the child, feeling that it is the child who is at fault. Parents that cannot take a good close look in the mirror and embrace the messages that this book exposes and details will miss an opportunity to turn their family around, and really help themselves while helping their child. It is not about blaming but about honesty, and how to correct beliefs and patterns that may have been handed down from old generations that don't work so well in our current life-style. I found the book to be a worthwhile one among other resources to become informed and WORK on all of us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Helpful? Ha.","review":"The gist of this book is that if your child is defiant, it must be because you, the parent, is too controlling. Give the child what he wants and quit bugging him.Um, no. Has this author ever spent any time with a defiant preschooler? If I didn't try to control him somewhat, he'd spend most of his life naked in front of the tv eating cookies. This book was no help at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expected More","review":"I was disapointed in this book, I was hoping for more meat and pictures of these guys when they were kids, but the price was inexpensive and there are a few pictures I have never seen anywhere else, plus I did learn a couple new facts so I won't totally say it was a waste. But I was hoping for more."},{"rating":"2","title":"I MUST'VE SEEN A DIFFERENT DVD!","review":"The quality of the DVD I saw was no worse than many films not fully restored that have a video quality about them. Sometimes it was very clear and the colors were very nice. But what about the FILM ITSELF? CHRISTOPHER PLUMMER IS BRILLIANT as the Inca. He is such an underrated actor. He is one of the finest actors it has been my pleasure to watch during my life - up there with Olivier. Robert Shaw gives a good performance, and the film is one of the most moving and challenging works I have ever seen. If you want to see a brilliant performance from Christopher Plummer and be highly moved, buy this DVD. If you want perfect picture quality, stay away and miss out on a classic film. Hopefully this film will be remastered in the future - until then, I'm quite satisfied with this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst quality I have ever seen or heard on video","review":"This is unwatchable, The sound is not in stereo though advertised as such on the label. Barely audible and full volume is needed. Cuts in the video, dirty copy off a print.Widescreen bars top and bottom an annoying blue.

Two other Simitar DVD titles (\\"Sports Blooper Encyclopedia\\" and \\"The Titanic\\") have caused me to conclude that I will never purchase another Simitar DVD. I emailed Simitar suggesting they should recall the DVD, redo it and re-release it using a much better film print. I also suggested they should apologize to their customers. They did not respond."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simitar destroys superb movie!","review":"When this movie became available on DVD I immediately snatched it up, because I remembered the lasting impression it had made on me the first time I had seen it in the 60s.Unfortunately the production values of the DVD version are worse than if it had been produced as a high school project in someone's garage or cellar. Virtually every aspect of video and audio is simply abysmal. I sincerely believe that Simitar could not have done a poorer job if it had tried. This movie deserves so much better! So I would recommend that if you like the movie stay away from this DVD. It's awful!

It's a pity, as this is still an intriguing take on religion and imperialism. Shaw's performance as Pizzaro is both commanding yet convincingly conveys his credulousness in his new surroundings. Plummer as the Incan ruler with his petulant keening is more of a distraction. He sounds like Olivier and looks like Cher.If this were ever restored, I'd give it another go."},{"rating":"1","title":"Royal Hunt of the Missing Scenes","review":"This is a remarkably amateurish movie based on an intense play. Very poor and strange performances from what could have been a great cast. Not to mention horrible cutting, and camera work. Not at all what I expected."},{"rating":"1","title":"Christopher Plummer is just weird","review":"Terrible transfer, badly cut, chopped, savaged - a lot like Atahualpa himself, played by Christopher Plummer using some improbable modern invention of the high chirruping sounds of the \\"ancient Incan language of the sun kings.\\" It's hard enough taking Chris for the Inca, let alone taking him seriously as a bird. Everyone walks about looking mildly amused and very theatrical. Too bad, because it's a brilliant play and could be wonderfully and powerfully filmed - or, not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious tasks, uninspiring cast, awkward host","review":"I'm a huge fan of Project Runway and am often amazed at the drive and sheer skill and creativity the designers show.I had great hopes for this as well but it was a watered down dull copy at best.The hostess was lovely but wooden or painfully over-sincere. The talent feedback often subjective and individual rather than educational and enlightening. The contestant rarely thrilled with their creations and were almost uniformly forgettable as designers.Capable perhaps, but not breathtakingly good or bad for that matter.I watched and watched and hoped for growth or the feeling I was watching talent and creativity but was so uninvested that I didn't care at all who won in the lackluster finale.\\"Project Accessory\\" is the programming equivalent of diet cream-cheese on a day old bagel; wait until you can see it for free on Hulu or something, it's not worth paying to watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Biggest Misstep So Far","review":"This episode had two glaring problems. The first was the use of a catsuit. This outfit is so horrible, sexist and dated that it was virtually an insult to all women to use it in the show. I couldn't get past the catsuits as they came down the runway. They looked so awful that I could not focus on any accessory. It would have been better to use a burlap bag as the outfit.Second was the use of Kelly Osbourne as a judge. This is a woman with no talent other than a big mouth and a celebrity father. She is billed as a \\"television personality\\" which is to say she has made a name for herself by being linked to a famous person and behaving in an obnoxious manner in public. She also has an atrocious fashion sense. Currently she is keeping her name alive in the media by criticizing Christina Aguilera's body left and right. She seems to miss the fact that the object of her scorn can sing, dance and act, which she cannot.This show needs to do much, much better than this episode."},{"rating":"2","title":"EVERYTHING WAS RIGHT","review":"I'M A FRENCH CUSTOMER; I THINK IT WAS A \\"LITTLE LONG TIME\\" TO HAVE THIS GIFT?

Young 17 year old Domine was orphaned at a very early age but was put through school by a rich old man who seemed to be fond of her. After he died, she had to leave her convent school and was thrust in the home of James, her new guardian. Although 20 years older than herself, she still found him very attactive, as he did her. But he fought his feelings for as long as possible, until neither could deny their love anymore. A pleasant story, although a bit boring and stale in places, and sometimes Ms. Mather was a bit hard to understand where she was going with some scenes and plot lines. But over all, I'd recommend it to anyone who likes romance of a lighter flavor.Cyndi"},{"rating":"2","title":"BACK COVER REVIEW","review":"Seventeen-year-old Domine thought she was alone in the world when her guardian and only relative, Great-Uncle Henry Farriday, died; so she was rather daunted when she learned that Great-Uncle Henry had consigned her to the care of the unknown James Mannering until she was eighteen.She was no less daunted when she actually met James and went to stay with him and his mother in their home in Yorkshire. For James was only thirty-seven and a very attractive man, with what seemed like a harem of equally attractive women vying for his attention - and soon Domine found herself unwillingly joining their number.But in the face of all that competition, how could she imagine that he would ever see her as anything but a child?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Who Knew ?!","review":"First time that I used Amazon for making purchase.

When I was a kid, I watched this documentary. Before Anthology, the internet, and all sorts of Beatles books, cd's, and dvd's.The film is not as complete as Anthology. The drawback is that the interviews are from 1982 (when the film was made) with George Martin and none of the surviving Beatles participated. If you want more recent, and in depth, perspective look to the Anthology DVD.With that said, this is a good 2 hour lesson on the Beatles beginning to end. The advantage to this is you don't have to sit through 11 hours of the anthology. Here you can get the basic story. This is a great documentary considering Apple records had nothing to do with it.

The light was Amber. After waiting 30 mins I pressed the button on the unit but this time it registered \\"RED\\". I moved the unit to another outlet and charged it for another 48 hours. Same Result (RED)! I plugged in the 40 watt table lamp and it lasted only 20 mins.I love the idea Xantrex had for a portable electronic generator, however their execution came up a little short on this one. The unit is going back!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Xantrex XPowerpak","review":"I've had mine for over two years and it has been a godsend for me. I have used it three times to power my sump pump during power failures. When my neighbors have been flooded, I just hooked up my power pack to my pump and it was able to run my sump pump for over 24 hours.

Well, I had the \\"spare\\" compressor, but the same thing happened to it.I contacted the company by email and was given a confirmation number stating that technical support would contact me -- that was last week and I am still waiting for an answer.

Her humorous side is quite apparent here and her characters, are very believable.The first novella, Lesley Castle, is told entirely in letters. Think chick lit of Austen's century, think cabot and her novels (like the guy next door, written in email form). You'll laugh at the obvious exaggeration in some parts, and giggle helplessly at the turn of events.Then comes 'A History of England', Austen's take on another historical book. This parody would surely give you a glimpse of the author's sense of humour and you might even side with her when she attacks Queen Lizzie.The last novella, Catharine, was entertaining, humorous and light.Any Austen fan should read this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible quality","review":"I was so surprised at how cheap the wood looked when this arrived, I didn't even bother putting it together.

I would never order from this company again"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Value","review":"Good value for the price. I was able to assemble by myself in about 90 minutes. The instructions were clear and the parts well marked. The only problem I had was with one board whose holes were not properly pre-drilled (was able to fix quickly with my drill). Assembled unit works very well in my guest bedroom and looks nice.

The message it contains is a good one, not only in our dealings with other worlds, but in dealing with our own world. It is what happens when people try to \\"kill the messenger,\\" or when mob mentality wipes out the most innocent and the mob becomes the very thing the mob is trying to eradicate. Patricia Neal (that marvelous voice) takes every production she is in up at least one notch. Michael Rennie is believable as Klaatu and Frances Bauvier (Aunt Bea) and Sam Jaffee (Dr. Zorba) are fine supporting players. The robot, Gort, is one of the most entertaining visuals in Fifties Sci-Fi Films.

This is one of those films that you never get tired of seeing, at least I don't. There's actually a cult following, especially the phrase \\"klaatu barada nikto\\", which is what the starring female has to deliver to the ever imposing robot, Gort, with his military melting eyr ray. This is a film about what will happen to us if we keep up our warring ways. Anything we don't understand, there's always a military solution. Sounds pretty familiar, doesn't it?"},{"rating":"2","title":"thought provoking on many levels","review":"Have loved this movie forever, but never realized the Christ parallels till I watched the director's comments.

Then it dawns on me. Maybe I've been seeing the wrong type of movies all this time. Maybe it not always necessary to live in a worlk where I am afraid to walk alone at night. Maybe the life on other plantet is more smarter than us. It get me to thinking and that's what I like so much about this move. You realize that a great movie can be made with some people just talking a d enjoying each other. Maybe even some people will make friends from smarter people from outer space living on another planet or two.

Even now, some 55 years since its theatrical release it delivers a timely, almost prophetic message to the world that is more important today than ever. We are not alone in the universe and what we do affects more than just this one little planet. Whether you interpret the films message spiritually or environmentally, what is ultimately at stake is undeniable. Learn to live in peace, or perish."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Day The Earth Stood Still","review":"I first seen this movie when I was 12 years old, now I am 64 years old and I think the movie is still great.

To finally own it and to see it how it was meant to is wonderful. This wonderfully intelligent and entertaining movie is a most enjoyable lesson in humanity, tolerance and responsability while still being a great sci-fi thriller. Who can forget their first sight of the mighty Gort walking down the ramp or melting entire tanks, or Klaatu's empassioned farewell plea for humanity?

My favourite scene is the one where Klaatu finishes off the mathematical equation on the blackboard - great stuff.I think the reviewer below, Therooksnook, should perhaps rewatch the film. What the US is doing to Iraq is not what the film advocates at all. In fact it's just a shame Klaatu and Gort can't land in Washington now and put a stop to the warmongering of Bush and Blair that the rest of the World objects to. Clearly they need to watch this DVD before it's too late."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Greatest Sci-Fi Movie of All Time","review":"The movie that all future science fiction directors looked up to.

Not bad enough, but the real problem is THE CHANGE COMPLETELY ALTERED THE ENTIRE STORY, AND DESTROYED THE WRITER'S MEANING. IT IS ONE OF THE WORST DISTORTIONS IN SCI-FI HISTORY.

I disagree. There are great movies from the early days of film (The Phantom of the Opera) to the most recent days. This film, however, isn't one of them. The Day the Earth Stood Still might have been though provoking in its time, but it remains a movie relevant to its time with more of a historical interest than a timeless classic. Not to mention the wooden acting and the dated effects. At least a tenth of the film could have been edited out without changing the story or the message. Not that the message that humans need to be more responsible is either new or riveting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"I have always loved this movie - I think our government should take note of how this planet handles themselves - I know it's fiction, but whoever wrote this movie should be President of the United States!

I'll have to go with the 2008 version because this 1951 version is so dated by comparison. Although Michael Rennie as Klaatu is arguably superior to Keanu Reeves, I like the fish-our-of-water approach Reeves took, sort of Spock-like. Basically, the 2008 version took everything about this version and made it better: color, drama, f/x, Gort, the Christian typology and the spectacular apocalyptic climax.That said, this '51 version was great for its time and is definitely worthy of one's video library. It has a nice eerie 50's sci-fi score.Some parts of this version are just lame and boring, but I found it interesting to see how the USA was back in 1950, the way people dressed and talked, etc. Other than that, though, the 2008 version is leagues superior in every conceivable way. Unless your thoroughly tainted by nostalgia, it's the simple truth."},{"rating":"2","title":"hearts stood still","review":"shared this favorite of mine with my students who are so-o-o in to special effects...and the new version out now...showed it in increments...and they begged for more...gave them an appreciation for black and white, drama without destruction, and the power of music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie,so why no DVD?","review":"The Day the Earth Stood Still is a classic science fiction film and is well directed by Robert Wise.Michael Rennie puts in a good performance as Klaatu and the storyline is always interesting with good performances all around.So why isn't this classic availiable on DVD?"},{"rating":"2","title":"More relevant now than it was in the 1950's","review":"A cautionary tale, showing the stupidity of the Earth's people in their inability to live in peace. It was a wake up call.If only it would happen for real.But much more than that,it also resonates with young boys who don't have a father. Rennie makes a perfect father figure, even to the brilliant scientist played by Sam Jaffe. This movie opened to me, as a young kid, the wonder of science, and left me with hope of finding a wise man that had some answers. I'm still looking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Correction...","review":"Robert Lane's editorial review says that Gort destroys the Capitol. I've seen this film dozens of times and the robot never destroys any public buildings - except the wall of the prison to free Klaatu. He destroys weapons (and occasionally people) but not the Capitol.This is really a great film with a great score. I watched this film again shortly after Sept. 11, 2001 and it was a chilling experience to realize that everything in the world really could come to a standstill.

I feel he's a under rated actor and should of been in more movies but, just the same he was perfect for this role.I agree with many of the others comments this film held you in suspense and it was due to the professional acting and directing,plus the story was great!I feel this movie will live on and continue being a classic.It is one of my most favorite movies,I've watched it many times over and was captivated every time.

The original ending which most viewers would have not guessed but found astounding is that Klaatu is the servant and Gort is the master. Wow, even Rod Serling doesn't get any better than that. Still it's a great film, but with one small change it would have been better. BTW: Forget the remake...it was all about money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mildly Entertaining","review":"This is a science fiction film that is moderately good at times.It was made in the early 1950s so the technology, special effects, etc. are minimal. That is understandable.The story itself is more problematic. It is basically propaganda camouflaged as entertainment. The gist of the story is about an alien from another planet, Klaatu (Michael Rennie) who comes to Earth along with his robot Gort (Lock Martin) to threatent Earthlings with their extinction if they continue along their 'warlike path'. There is a scene with Klaatu that is an allegory of the resurrection of Jesus Christ. That is rather tasteless especially considering that the message delivered is one of death threats in complete contrast to the message of love and life given by Jesus. The basic message of the interplanetary traveler is: 'be peaceful or we'll kill you'.If not for the questionable messages given, this might be considered a pretty good movie from that period of time. As it is, I do not recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic","review":"Extremely well-written and superbly acted film that perfectly captures the unease and suspicion that was prevalent among Americans at the start of the Cold War. Francis Bavier's not-so-subtle reference to the USSR reminded me of the Harry Potter characters aversion to \\"He who must not be named.\\" Give me a great story and effective pacing and flawless direction (thanks to the brilliant Robert Wise, whose credits also include The Sound of Music) over special effects any day.

The film is based on Evans's own book and he provides the narration as well. His weary, gravelly voice provides authenticity and I wouldn't change it, but I did switch on the sub-titles after a while because his idiosyncratic vocal rhythms are sometimes hard to follow. (Don't miss Dustin Hoffman's hilarious impersonation of him during the closing credits.) The filmmakers add moving elements and faux 3-D effects to still photographs for an innovative visual look. Evans's versions of events differs from those of many other concerned parties, but he tells an involving story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Evans comes out hitting a homerun","review":"Robert Evans was behind a bunch of hollywood masterpieces such as Chinatown, The Marathon Man, Rosemary's Baby and The Godfather (just to name a few) and why he was involved with Popeye I have no clue.

He was friends with some of the greatest actors, directors and actresses of our time: Jack Nicholson, Mia Farrow, Roman Polanski, James Cagney, Dustin Hoffman and many more I honestly thought this was a good documentary about life in the hollywood eye. My favorite part is during the credits when Dustin Hoffman does the impersonation of Evans, that's a classic right there. If your interested, watch it and if your not, watch it once and then dont."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a wonderful life with a few bumps in the road","review":"This is quite possibly the best documentary that I've ever seen. From his beginnings of being \\"discovered\\" at a Beverly Hills Hotel swimming pool to his marriage to Ali McGraw to his stint as the head of Paramount Pictures, all of his stories were great. Robert Evans shoots from the hip, tells it like it is (or was) and pulls no punches. The producers of the film did a wonderful job in casting Mr. Evans as the narrator for his own life story. His insight was told in a way that only the person that lived this life could have told it.If you like movies and what takes place behind the camera then this movie is a must see. Better than any E! True Hollywood Story that you've ever seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, well, at least it was only $1.49","review":"There were some redeeming qualities to this disc as far as cinema history(although not enough), and it was nice to see the young Ali McGraw(and a glimpse of Sharon Tate inThe Fearless Vampire Killers, or Pardon Me but Your Teeth Are in My Neck, but any reason why this was released escapes me, except as a fundraiser or ego stroke for Robert Evans. It's like some piece of dreck from the those serious journalists at the History Channel or A&E;, except it's told in the 1st person. Thank God that we didn't have to hear Evans spout off about being a victim and suffering from the \\"disease\\" of cocaine. It was about twice as long as was needed to get the point across."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor packaging","review":"When I first opened the package, I was surprised to see The Kid Stays in The Picture was in a clear plastic case when my past copy had been in a older model cardboard set up with the plastic casing. The actual cover's edges were cut off by more than a 1/4 of an inch and the back part has a scalloped edging.My first thought was boot leg and was worried the DVD wouldn't play right, which it did. Still, I question the seller of this product and will never purchase from them again. I don't condone repackaging or boot leg DVDs and would return it if the cost of shipping it wasn't more than the actual dvd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big phony","review":"For a guy who strikes such a macho pose in the way he talks (as someone else noted, like a character in a 30's gangster movie) and his fondness for women (though not for \\"women\\" as people, only as sex objects), Evans looks a bit effeminate, does he not? This is the goofiest documentary I've seen.Definitely entertaining, although Evans is a big phony who lucked out with a job at Paramount, and took credit for other people's achievements. All he ever did was produce \\"Chinatown\\" which he admits he didn't understand, and \\"Marathon Man.\\" Other than that, he was more of an agent, a recruiter of talent, than the producer he claims to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Banality raised to the level of ..............banality","review":"I realize that the poor guy had a stroke, but to listen to him mumble through an entire film's narration is just too painful. This film is a celebration of one man's achievments and failures in the Hollywood film industry system. Certainly not one life's loftiest goals, but in pure Hollywood style it has been raised to the level of Godliness. This movie should appeal to perenially hip and chronically insecure types."},{"rating":"1","title":"and the point is???????","review":"I just didn't get it. The movie was painfully boring. The only remotely redeeming aspect was some interesting cinematography."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable movie of old Hollywood!","review":"At the time, this movie was no longer on netflix or amazon prime so I bought it. I loved it, I had seen it before and wanted to see it again. It is greatly narrated by Evans himself and he has great insight and advice from his well lived life! If you're a movie fan and a bit of a history fan this might be a good choice for you. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Bio-Pic","review":"He's an amazing visionary producer and its really great to see what an amazing life he's led and how many great films he nurtured to fruition. I learned a lot just from watching this DVD. Please release it on Blu-Ray and put more stuff on the discs. I KNOW Mr. Evans has a crap-load of stuff and information they haven't even touched on. Truly great docu-film and well worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Film","review":"I adore this film. The slow and sensuous way it was filmed makes it better than most films which are made purely for entertainment. This one makes a shift in your life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great doc. Totally worth owning","review":"Producer legend Robert Evans is the subject for and narrator in this wonderful documentary of the classic \\"rise and fall\\" variety. This is just a really vibrant and dynamic film, and really seemingly raises the bar for biography documentaries. Evans himself narrating is funny and self-recriminating about his past, and by the film's end, one really feels to have a better understanding of the time period as well as Bob Evans himself. The way the film plays with moving around still photos kinda spells out the entry of the flash/photoshop generation into film, and this is not such a bad thing, at least in this genre. Film fans will adore this, everyone else will really enjoy it. The extras feature some of Bob's acceptance speeches upon receiving lifetime achievement awards from various sources, and are well worth a look."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another winner","review":"Not only is this a good mystery and a good read but those of us who have read the entire series have seen the heroine and her family grow along with our families.

This superb compilation features songs that deal with adultery, its consequences and the viewpoints from those involved in such affairs. Shirley Brown, James Carr, Isaac Hayes, Phillip Mitchell, Lloyd Price, Candi Staton, Millie Jackson, The Soul Children and others sing truly convincing (and at times heart-wrenching) tales of love, lust, longing, desire and heartbreak--all of which remain relevant to this very day. Listen with an open mind--and without judgment--and you are sure to enjoy a rarely anthologized side of the classic Soul ballad from singers who knew what they were singing about.

Molly Ringwald shines as Andie, an avant-garde teen who styles her own clothes and has a constant battle with the popular crowd. Enter Blane the prep and her best friend Duckie, love triangle and high school clique politics. Molly captures the era well in this tale of love from the wrong side of the tracks."},{"rating":"1","title":"5 stars for item; 2 for more corporate scuminess","review":"We saw this on the shelf at a Target a few weeks back.

James Spader's performance as the detestable ringleader of the \\"cool kids\\" gives a sneak peak of his future repeat performances as detestable characters (see: Boston Legal, Secretary, etc.). Andrew Shue is as irritating as ever with his wide-eyed \\"innocence\\" and pursed lips which are, apparently, meant to indicate internal self-flagellation during his less-than-sensitive moments. Annie Potts and John Cryer give the only two performances without reproach (and Duckie's famous dance to \\"Try a Little Tenderness\\" is not to be missed)but are, sadly, relegated to second-tier characters. This film isn't even up to par with the other Brat Pack films as far as storyline and character development (which isn't saying much!), but, in the end, at least you'll get a chuckle out of Andie's pink polka-dot atrocity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty in Pink","review":"Can't even watch it as it was made in Mexico it doesn't work in any DVD players.

Me and my best girlfriend bonded over the fact that we couldn't believe that Andy ran off with Blaine (Blaine, he was like the wallpaper, he was so boring) instead of being with Duckie. I tend to watch the film right up until the end and then just turn it off.When they release the film on DVD with the original ending of Andy and Duckie together, only then will I buy the DVD.The soundtrack I don't need, I have that for years.

A real blast looking back at James Spader who starred in many great films and currently on Boston Legal and Jon Cryer currently in 2 and a half men. Both were great in their opposing sides of the track during those highly impressionable years in senior high. Regardless of the years that pass, the high school pressure is the same.

I have tons of Freud blades and router bits, and my biggest complaint is they almost never have any instructions. The biggest problem with this bit set is when you remove the glass bead. If you are of a 32nd of an inch the tenons will be either to short or to long, and in the earlier case there is no way to correct it.

Almost every duet pairing and song selection is uninspired. And the schmaltzy strings and most of the arrangements are just terrible. The whole thing seems like a poorly executed marketing project. The duet with Diana Krall is probably the best cut on the album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tony Bennett is better on his own..","review":"I am a huge Tony Bennett fan, but the duets on this cd are absolutely horrible.

Nice songs, beautiful performance but, here is a big black ship on this CD and a question for Tony: Do you really need to invite such an \\"artist\\" as Juanes ?? This guy sucks !!

And I am still thrilled by his voice, even if he became 80 years old last year. He and his son had a good hand in choosing the right duet partners and the right songs. And for me, being a professional musician, I love to listen to the great musical arrangements. A must have!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A \\"Boomer\\" and \\"Gen X-er\\" must have!","review":"It is said that if it tastes good it must be either fattening or bad for you. This rich collection of songs is neither, so dig in!Let's face it, if you've been alive the past 40 years or so, these songs echo in your mind. And if you're lucky, they provided in part, the soundtrack of your life. That you have the added bonus of such a talented lineup of contemporary singers singing in concert with Tony Bennett brings an even more familiar element.I should add that it is also a soul-satisfying counterpoint to the usual -and very often loud - noise this classic rock fanatic usually listens to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pandering","review":"Listening to this CD makes me wonder why he did this. I am a big Tony Bennett fan but the gap between his live performances and his recorded work is huge. This CD is evidence.It has long been known that Bennett pays relatively little attention to his records/CDs. On this point, compare him to Sinatra. Not only would Sinatra be intensely interested in the songs and arrangers whose work he performed but he gave them full credit in a live performance.Compare this to the recorded work of Tony Bennett. His cohorts are there and any interaction between the two of them seems forced and superfluous.Tony Bennett was challenged on two CDs, his two duet albums with Bill Evans. Bennett sounded different in those CDs, as he stepped on the gas to keep up with Evans. On this CD he lets someone else do the driving."},{"rating":"1","title":"A huge disappointment!!","review":"As I said, a huge disappointment. I really enjoyed the Duets CDs from Sinatra, and, being a Tony Bennett fan, I had high expectations for this cd.Don't bother with it - it is a real loser in my opinion. Dull, boring, just plain bad.Sorry Tony - but this one is a stinker."},{"rating":"1","title":"If it were only Tony alone","review":"This album contains 19 tracks.

Tony, as always, sounds great."},{"rating":"1","title":"TONY-YES / GUEST STARS-NO","review":"There's no doubt that Tony knows his business and the types of songs that fit him best. And while this CD is filled with many \\"superstar\\" guests singing duets with him, it just seemed lackluster overall.Practically every song had Tony singing the first verse with the guest artist coming in on the second verse. Both usually wrapped up the song together; but not before verbal praise was dished out from Tony to his co-artist (come on...Stevie Wonder...full???) or vice-versa SOMEplace in the song. Come on...cut the yapping and sing the song already!This SHOULD have been a much more entertaining CD. Unfortunately, it drags along from start to finish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Up to Hype","review":"I fell prey to the advertising, and found the songs on the disappointing side of enjoyable.

Fortunately and for the most part, the artists that join him on this CD add meaningfully to the songs selected. They also freshen them up. I especially liked the first selection, Lullaby of Broadway, where the Dixie Chicks show range that could pass for those expert harmonizers of yore, the Andrew Sisters. The overall line-up of artists is really impressive. If you like listening to an old-time crooner, joined by more contemporary stars, you'll like this CD as I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed","review":"I am sorry to say this is one of the worst CD's I bought.

This was the first Samantha James book that I have read and it will not be my last! Olivia and Dominic were well developed as indivduals and together they had fantastic chemistry. I dislike weak female heroines and really dislike overbearing male heros. Olivia had a quite strenght and it showed in her ability to live a hopeful life after suffering so much sorrow. Dominic being 1/2 gypsy and treated so cruelly by his father and society desperately wanted love even though he didn't know it until he met Olivia. Minor intrigues added to the story as well as Olivias sister Emily's romance with Andre didn't distract from the main story.The love scenes between Dominic and Olivia had just the right amount of romance and sensuality. Sizzle without being crude.This book is a keeper for my library.Sensuality rating 4 out of 5"},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT!!!!!!!!!!","review":"FIRST BOOK OF MS. JAMES THAT I'VE READ AND IT WAS VERY GOOD.THE CHARACTERS WERE VERY REAL AND IT JUST REALLY KEEP MY INTEREST ALL THE WAY THROUGH...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful story!","review":"A tale of prejudice and overcoming the odds, I found this book a totally engrossing read; in fact, I couldn't put it down! Dominic was a perfect dark hero and Olivia is just the match for him. I also found the love story between Emily and Andre just as engrossing. I can't wait 'til her next book comes out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A steamy, poignant and moving story.","review":"This was the first book I read by Samantha James and I was very touched by it. The hero was sexy and kind to the people, despite their wariness of him. The way she represented the village people's prejudice was very accurate and I felt for Dominic. She portrayed him as a man who feels just like anyone else, despite his stern exterior. The electricity between him and Olivia was extremely good, but I also liked the tenderness between them as well. I liked the way the author gradually began to wear away the heroine's prejudice and the secondary love story with the heroine's sister was good, too. I'm hoping there will be a sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 1/2 stars","review":"I liked the story, however, there were some issues I had with the theme of the book.Emily, Olivia's blind sister, is incredibly shallow. She goes on and on about how she wishes she knew what her admirer Andre looked like and that she hopes he's very handsome. She's blinded (no pun intended) by her hatred for the gypsy who killed her father, so much so that when she finds out Andre is a gypsy she tells him she hates him.Olivia was kind of weak, never telling Dominic that she doesn't fear him because he's a gypsy, but because he stirs desires within her she has no idea how to handle. She coddled Emily far too much, even if she was blind.The mystery came from nowhere. I don't even remember any mention of how the two main characters even know the villain. The last scene of Olivia and the two children being rescued was flat, and how he was captured was just incredulous.James has written way better than this. I think it could have been a good book, but the characters failed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable, not necessarily memorable","review":"This was an enjoyable quick read. I went back and forth with these characters though. I just couldn't understand why the author didn't better explain the heroine's feelings with more depth. Ok, her father was killed by a gypsy, but then she seems to trust the hero but not enough to really love him...why? If she sees he's a great guy, then why the fear of his being a gypsy...explain the fear that remains. The prejudice just seemed to go on and on for the heroine even after she likes the guy. Also, I wasn't sure why he fell in love with her...was it just that immediate feeling, because she seemed to spend so much time avoiding him. I did like the hero's belief in fate and in his conviction that he was supposed to be with Olivia."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!!","review":"I loved this book.

The plot was wonderful, and indeed, that is what inspired me to purchase the book, but the writing was so cliche and dull, I couldn't bring myself to finish the novel. The author does too much exposition up front and tells us every detail about the characters history before we have any questions. There's no mystery, at all! Everything is very predictable and the motivation for their actions was very weak."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Boring Night","review":"I found this book to be a very flat and dull read.

It neither provides useful intuition nor rigorous analysis. The book is written as if it were an introductory text but it fails to cover a lot of fundamental topics (especially basic transistor circuits) that are critical for such a book. Additionally, the book spends a lot of text making useless analogies (like LRC oscillator to a pipe instrument.)The overall approach of the book is to take a very detailed theoretical and practical explanation of a specific (NORCAL 50?, I think) radio. The approach makes it very difficult to apply its lessons to designing your own radio or high frequency electric circuits."},{"rating":"1","title":"Electronics of Radio","review":"This book is composed by Prof. David Rutledge. His class required the book, which is the sole reason for the book entering my hands. This book, and the related course EE20 were the bane of my existence. The book is useless at explaining the basics of electronics. The book solely serves as a cookbook for the construction of a NORCAL radio. It fails at teaching important conecepts, and could only be used by the most faint-hearted hobbyist. On a related note, I have a spare book if anyones interested in buying one.

I had a hard time getting through this book. I read 2-4 pages a day at the most. It is not that the material is hard, it is that it caused me to reflect so much that I had to spend time digesting all the stuff that it brought back to my mind.Yes it is somewhat repetitive and relies on a lot of quotes- but- big deal? It is not meant to be an authoritative work of discourse on some academic matter. It is meant to help people in distress.It is not a solution to all problems.

Round and round and round we go and where he stops, nobody knows! Additionally, I found all of the quotes distracting and for the most part, unnecessary. Perhaps the reason Levoy used them is because he can't claim to be an expert in this field and had to back up his statements with those of other, more well-known experts. This book is not for someone looking for a clear direction in which to proceed. However, if you like spirituality and new-age philosophy in the abstract, then I guess you'll like this book.

Yeah, I said it!!! Face it people....some bands are simulur, and some simulur bands are better. Like it or not, Interpol is making great music, all the while staying cool about it and not begging up any mainstream success or hype. This band is worth your money, and well worth adding to your CD collection...if you know good music when you hear it. Great record!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Today My Heart Swings!","review":"Well, Our Love to Admire is typical Interpol. It is just more of the same. All you get here is absolute brilliance, complexity, endless texture, power, passion, and a CD that you can play for a year straight without getting bored. If that's the type of pedestrian stuff you are interested in then I guess I can recommend this album to you. But seriously folks! What an astounding release. The only song that caught my attention the first time through was The Heinrich Maneuver. By the third and fourth hearing I had already become arrested by Pioneer to the Falls and Rest my Chemistry. At this point, I love the entire disc and have to say that Interpol is the best band of this new century. Putting out a great album is something, but to put out three in a row is amazing. I have to apologize for all the fawning but I just do not see anything wrong with this assemble. Interpol, please keep working, recording, and giving so much back to your fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointment","review":"This CD is like meeting a beautiful woman and finding out she's your sister. The fist song, Pioneer to the falls, is one of their best. Unfortunately, the rest of the CD simply does not live up to the first song's standard. I hope this is not a trend with Interpol. Each new album is not as good as the one it replaced. I once called this group a revelation. After this CD, I'm not so sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Major label debut","review":"Not nearly as good as \\"Antics\\" or \\"Turn on the bright lights\\", but for neo-new wave, this is still pretty good.

Otherwise, start with one of their first 2 albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not exactly new growth, BUT..","review":"This CD isn't exactly taking them into a new direction, but I believe it's pulling more of what was hidden the past couple of years. Mascara was a great song, but it wasn't on the first or second album. This new CD has more material that sounds like it would've been hidden material similar to mascara or the specialist. Most of the songs have that droning, dark voice of Paul Banks, with the exclusion of \\"The Heinrich Maneuver.\\" It's a hard comparison among all three CD's, but they have not turned for the worst. If anything, the CD sounds like antics, but the songs are powerful enough to have you coming back if you listen to them thoroughly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why is this a good album?","review":"Well, it's not a good album. Everyone who is looking at this review right now loves Turn on the Bright Lights. If you liked Antics, then the drugs must be working better for you than for me, a decent album though. Without their name, Our Love to Admire would go completely unnoticed. There is nothing happening on this record. It is a parade of the same banal recipe. Their first single is semi catchy, but, other than that, no other songs jumped out at me. Please find some inspiration for your band, so you can inspire your fans like you once did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missed the mark again","review":"After being pleasently surprised by Turn On The Bright Lights and how it's subtle understated songs became so infectious that I wanted to hear them again and again, I was quite dissappointed by Interpol's next release Antics. The band was quite aware of the appeal of the first release and tried desperately to repeat it with no luck. While Antics had some glimmers of special moments Our Love To Admire is absolutely lack lustre. The boys once again try to capture the magic of Turn On The Bright Lights but fall even farther from that goal. And believe me, I wouldn't care at all if they did something vastly different just as long as it was good. Our Love To Admire is not good. At this point I think Interpol themselves must be wondering how they managed such to write such great songs their first time out but can't seem to even come close to writing a memorable song these days... I know I am."},{"rating":"1","title":"Booooorrrriiinnnngggg","review":"This album starts off very strong with the first song, Pioneer to the Falls.

So I'll keep the review short.I keep hoping against all hope that one day Beyonce will give the listeners something from the depths of her soul. With this CDs drop, I see now that my hope was in vain.The same over-emoting vocals, repetitive beats and elementary songwriting skills, none of which have not matured at all, are all over this sophomore effort of Destiny Child's lead diva.Worse still, the noteworthy tracks are curiously absent from the disc completely. Where is the floor-pounding hit ala 'Crazy In Love' with its propulsive horn sample? Where is the experimentation and expansion (for Beyonce, a pop entertainer), i.e., 'Baby Boy' with its flavourful middle eastern beat? Where are the hits hiding?!Answer: nowhere. They are just not present. And that must be disappointing to her loyal fans.To sum up the review, boring, boring, boring.

B'Day Deluxe Edition is just a way to make more money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Medicore Second Album","review":"Like many before and like many after her, Beyonce truly has hit the sophmore slump with her B'day album.

She's not only a great singer but a great dancer, great performer, great songwriter, great producer, great designer!. People are talking bad about this re-make but I think she did a great job. First, as a Latina, I'm very proud of her recording in Spanish for the first time! She's a smart girl and now she will expand her territory to Latinoam��rica. Second, people don't see that Beyonce wrote every single song and produced this record, and she's only 25 years old! I'm proud of you Beyonce! Great job! Must have it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Um...what's really the deal","review":"I see Beyonce as a very talented young woman, having heard her sing acapella on a television show with Destiny's Child and her vocal and acting ability on THE FIGHTING TEMPTATIONS just to name a few. Her vocals IMO belong on a VOCAL album, whether it be R&B;, Jazz, or Gospel. The productions are really good, I just don't think it does much for her...she seems buried under all the horns, synths, and such. Too much screaming and strain on her awesome voice. And as I have much luv for Jay-Z, her two songs he is featured on, DEJA VU and UPGRADE U all sounds like CRAZY IN LOVE pt. II and III to me.Save your money if you want to hear Beyonce SANG, but add this to your collection if otherwise."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the heck?","review":"This album is downright boring.

Many of her fans will be unhappy with this cd. I am one of those fans who expected a better effort from her. She said she completed this cd in 2 weeks and you can tell. Where are her amazing ballads. She has such a wonderful voice, yet it is not shining on this cd. I just hope this cd is not the end of her music career. Better luck next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good CD","review":"I am a beyonce fan, but this album is complete garbage. It is nothing like her first album. I heard she did this album in two weeks and that's exactly what it sounds like. It just seems like she just put something together at the last minute in order to release it in time for her birthday. My favorite song on the album is \\"Ring the alarm\\" and even then I am not crazy about this song either. There is only 11 songs on this album (the bonus track is part of song #10, you would have to fastforward to hear it). It's not quality music and her voice doesn't sound good either, it seems like she is screaming all the time. I don't even listen to it anymore. Don't waste your money like I did, you'll be thankful you didn't buy the album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly Disappointed!","review":"This has got to be the worse cd from the megastar.

At first I didn't love it but certainly didn't hate it. I liked Upgrade You and De Ja Vu. As time has passed I like the whole CD more. It's great dancing around the house music.I too thought many of the songs seemed materialistic and \\"I don't need a man\\" themed but when I heard that she wrote many of the songs from the perspective of saying the things she wishes her character in Dreamgirls could have said (perhaps with a modern twist) I \\"got it\\" with some of the songs and liked them more. I'm a fitness instructor and I use many of the songs in different classes and they work very well.I'm a Beyonce fan and I do have her other CD as well as several Destiny's Child CD's. If you are a music lover then you'll like this CD. Don't buy it expecting super deep thoughts about life and love...it's fun, straight to the point and dancy but that's fine for me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What the heck B!","review":"Looks like someone shouldn't be bragging about how it took them 2 weeks to make this album, because it definitely shows. The only thing that saves this cd is the production. Beyonce was able to get some great beats but put horrible lyrics on this cd. I'm disappointed.

But I made sure I'll get something for my money so I bought the package with the DVD on it for the same price as the cd. At least I know the songs featured on the DVD and havent seen them yet and I dont want to take a risk of buying a cd that I dont have any idea on how the songs goes and not familiar with the producer. Well, Im right the cd is so bad for me. All i hear from the 10 songs(only) are yelling repeatedly and has no melody at all. This is really a big joke for Beyonce's fans (maybe) I ending up hiding the cd from my daughter which i told her about it and just gave it away to my friend's girlfriend who's a Beyonce fan. She didn't like it too even it's free. That's really Bad. I'll stick to my Sarah Brightman DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you need a NoiseMaker to ring in the New Year Cop B-Day!!!!","review":"How can anybody in their sane mind praise this juvenile mess?! Beyonce is supposed to be growing lyrically, but she's regressed badly. Yelling, Screaming, Shouting, complaining about a man is not what I call music and it is below expectations. Beyonce needs to regroup with Destiny's Child, she's obviously experiencing the sophomore slump. Thank God for iTunes saving her floptastic singles! Beyonce is overrated, literally. I used to hear people say but didn't quite understand, but she is far from an independent woman. Nothing stands out on any tracks except ruckus!

I've never been a big fan of Beyonce mainly because as an adult, I felt that her songs were a little too forced, poppy and shoved down my throat. The music video for 'Ring the Alarm' is what first made me take notice of this new offering from Beyonce and ultimately led to me purchasing the CD. Listening to the different tracks it is clear Knowles has transformed into a real woman. The lyrics are bold and funky, the content direct and to the point and I can personally relate to many of the songs on the CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whole different sound on sophomore album","review":"After reading all the reviews written on this section, I was hesistant to buy the album. I liked \\"Deja Vu\\", but not enough to buy the album. After hearing \\"Ring the alarm\\" I changed my mind and got it. As everyone has said before, this album is very different from her debut. There are only two slow songs (if you don't count \\"Listen\\") and she seems to be singing higher, more like Tina Turner. What I like about this cd is that it's mostly a dance record, where Beyonce seems to cut loose entirely. If you're looking for the kind of lyrics she displayed on her debut album, you won't find any in here. I prefer this one; it shows a complete different side of her, one seen more often in her concerts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really Wish I hadn't bothered...","review":"I really don't like this album. There is nothing really solid on here besides her single De Ja Vu and that had to grow on me too. Even the titles to some of the songs just turn me off to the record.

It's that or you're not a r and B fan.This album is filled with hot new songs that get you dancing all day.Deja Vu is one of my favorites. It just sounds really good and I loved her dance moves in the video. I loved ring the alarm and many more songs on this album. I liked all the songs pretty much, but ring the alarm and deja vu are my 2 favorites.I loved this album mostly because beyonce stepped and brought her singing to a whole new level. Overall, her vocals were great, her music were great, and the videos were great. This album is hot!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"What a disappointment I loved her first solo cd her sophomore effort is inferior to say the least.

This album had to grow on me, too. But now I'm hooked. Beyonce sings very well on this album and everything jells together sweetly. I know that many people say that music from this albums era is bad. To be honest: let me tell you how good this album is. Even though Whitney Houston is gone and her self-titled debut album is excellent; but guess what: I'd rate this album B'day, slightly above it. Beyonce is the top chick in the game even til this day. I'm not saying that she is the best singer, but she is very, very popular. This is arguably the best album released a female in the 2000-2010.

Now I have a cd, I won't use with the wrong single."},{"rating":"1","title":"SOME NERVE","review":"Beyonce never was the star of her former group, Kelly Rowland was. This cd has one good song, Ireplaceble, and that is it. In her latest video she is comparing herself to Martin Luther King. Must be her father's influence. Nobody can take away her beauty, but that alone does not make a good singer. If you want the song, buy the single, the rest of this cd is so awful. This woman is so over highly rated only Diana Ross could fill her swelled head."},{"rating":"1","title":"not feeling it \\"b\\"","review":"sorry but i like beyonce but i didn't like this cd. yes it's different for her, but for the most part, it's not as nearly as good as her first cd. i only liked at least 3 songs out of 10. i think letoya luckett's cd is much better. just my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"B'day is a Terrible Day","review":"Beyonce's album is terrible. I didn't even buy it, I listened to my friend's copy which she got for free from a download. Well, I'm glad I didnt waste the money. She seems to delighted to tell the public that the album was done in 2 weeks, well... I could tell. It's terrible, just awful. The songs dont seem polished, nor does the writing grab or touch the heart strings of me as a listener. For TRUE R&B, go by MONICA's ALBUM or LETOYA's ALBUM. Those are the true saviors of real music.

I anticipated the release of this album for months and was very excited to get it. I know that people say that you shouldn't rate anyone if you don't have the same talents as they do but we the fans have the right to rate these artists because we are the ones buying their records.I love B's music but this CD didn't do it like Dangerously In Love did. I think that the CD was rushed (which is why it only has 10 tracks on it). I like the two songs that were released on the radio and I halfway like the song irreplaceable. The other songs sound crazy.Beyonce should have taken her time with this album instead of rushing it to be released on her birthday.Better luck next time B."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a good day","review":"now Beyonce channels Tina Turner but what is going for writing&Production on her Albums isn't reaching those heights. I think if she had a R.Kelly&Brian Mcknight Writing&Producing on her than she would expand on her Vocal Range fully. this album sounds like it was rushed&just made to meet a deadline,not a single memorable strong track. alot of B-Sides at best,but not a single A knock out track. when She Sings She sounds good,but way often than not she is following a formula that wears her album down fast she needs to seperate Business from Personal with Jay Z. enough of those duets. leave the street cred alone. let that Voice be your guiding Light. thus far she has put out two average Albums that arelong on Hype,but short on overall substance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounds like it too her 3 weeks to make this album","review":"This album is HORRIBLE! She switched up her style, she's screaming and over singing on every track, its like my goodness were u in that big of a rush that u couldn't even make sure your vocals were on point? The only good song on this album IMO is Kitty Kat, thats vintage Beyonce. Other than that song, they are horrible. She made the same mistake Ashanti made which is why Beyonce is as big as she is now. Ashanti switched up her style on her second album which Beyonce jacked Ashanti for her style from her first album and blazed her in 2003. Now Beyonce switched up her style and now somebody is gonna come out and blaze Beyonce this year. Don't even waste yo time downloading cuz u not gonna like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"GARBAGE","review":"Beyonce is not he best singer in the world nor is she the worst. This album could of been much better. A sophomore album should be just as good as the one before it or better; Unfortunately this is absolute garbage. Ms. Knowles forgets to sing on the tracks and instead it sounds like she is screaming on all of them. Recording an entire album in less than a month is nothing to proud of unless the album sounds like you been working on it for over a year. Dear Ms. Knowles if you read any of these posted reviews on amazon.com please take a step back, a deep breath, think, know what your capable off.. and listen to this album from beginning to end..and if you still really think that this is some of the best work you have ever done your full of the not so nice 4 letter word that I would prefer to use to describe this album!"},{"rating":"1","title":"JayZ spoiled it for me - Amazon you should label it elicit content","review":"I use to think that Beyonce' was a safe CD buy, (no cursing) and since Amazon didn't label it as elicit content I thought it was ok. When I went the music store to buy it, a lady was returning the same cd and said they didn't like it. She saw I was purchasing the same and offered me a deal to buy her's. Stupid me I should have asked what she didn't like about it, but when I played it and got to the song Up Grade U, and Jayz's intro with him say s---t that killed the whole mood of the CD for me. It made the CD feel negative. I said to myself I can't give this to my kids! Although Beyonce isn't cursing she has someone else doing it. Now I know Beyonce is not a safe CD buy I won't be buying any more of anything with her name on it. This is why the music industry has gone down not because of bootleg CD but people don't want to buy music with negative aura.

I was sadly dissapointed. The beats all sound the same after a while and I got real tired of listening to homegirl yell through her songs. I would say before you go out to spend money on a cd with only 10 songs (10 songs wtf?) borrow it from someone first. In no way am I trying to take away from how talented she is I'm just saying that overall this cd sucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Push-a-button musical production!","review":"This is a shameful CD.

You'd expect a more mature, grown sound, still without alienating her younger fan base. Yet instead we got remedial Destiny's Child lyrics circa \\"Bills, Bills, Bills\\" & \\"Bugaboo\\". Sure, you can dance to most of the tracks; great club beats. But for all that she is hyped up to be (the next Diana Ross), she needs an \\"Upgrade\\" HERSELF."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy It!!!!","review":"Im so dissapointed in this album. 10 songs is crazy. Comparing her to christina Aguleria's new album which has 22!!! You can tell she rushed it.

Take it form me, just get the burned copy from somewhere, dont buy it!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware---B'day is BS","review":"After her Dangerously in Love cd and the Deja Vu single, I thought this is going to be a great album. I wish to the store only to be highly disappointed. Has Beyonce's stardom gotten to her that she only can ofer her fans 10 songs upon wich 3 songs (ones being played on the radio) are of the only decent quality--*Deja Vu*Ring the Alarm*IrreplaceableMy suggestion is to purchase the singles or download your favorite songs to be burned. It's much cheaper and you don't have to waste time skipping through horrible filler songs.Sorry Beyonce you need to go back to letting her father have input in your production/songs because at least with him you produced quality cd's and songs. Goes to show that old Matthew was the real force behind Beyonce and Destiny Child and without him, it showing in your music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I have to admit that I really like 'Deja Vu' - I know a lot of people hated the song/video but I think it grows on you after a bit. The rest of the album, well...you can tell that this was recorded in (what did she say?) 3 weeks? There's a serious lack of catchy songs that can be put out as singles. The best part of the album is at the end with the slower songs like 'Irreplaceable' and 'Listen' (which I'm sure is B's attempt at an Oscar nomination for 'Dreamgirls'). Her vocals are strong no doubt about it but the songs are lacking in creativity. And 'Ring the Alarm' is a weak song...has she gone mad? She really seems like a lunatic throughout the song. The performance on VMA for the song seems like a blatant take-off on 'Rhythm Nation' doesn't it? She might outsell Janet but Janet's new album is MUCH better than this one, sorry B..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't B-other (part 2)","review":"I don't quite know to begin with my critique of this album so I'll keep it simple - spend your money on Rhianna's cd. This has got to be, given the hype and Beyonce's iconic status in modern R&B, the single most disappointing project of 2006. What a complete and unqualified mess and a significant fall-off from her debut effort. Swizz Beatz fingerprints are all over this tragedy so he must shoulder some of the blame, but B is slippin' big time here. I have barely listened to this nonsense and dont plan to. Don't be a sucka - look elsewhere, anywhere but here. This album presents a real opportunity for B's competitors - Rhianna, Ciara, et. al. - to close the gap on her and I hope they take advantage of it and teach her a hard lesson - that you cannot disrespect your fan base by producing something this absurd and expect to stay on top. C'mon now B - we know you are better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"WTF IS THIS???","review":"I was really giving Beyonce the benefit of a doubt,but as soon as I put this cd on I knew it was a big mistake,and I agree with others this album is horrible. =(...I really like Beyonce too,but thi is just shame,half of the time she is just screaming on this album.The only songs I like are Ring the alarm and Get me Bodied.Sorry Beyonce but this is no good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best","review":"First off I must say I have waited to write a review for a few days so I could listen to the album plenty of times and give a constructive review. Beyonce has a good voice. There is no doubting that. However, this album is a mess. She took just a couple of weeks to create this album and present it to her label. Were their ears plugged when they were listening? You can tell no thought process went into making this album. It was just thrown out to make the record company and Beyonce richer. That is a shame. This mess will make me think twice now before going out and purchasing Beyonce's music the day it is released. Trust me save your money and buy something worthwhile. I am a fan but this album is very very disappointing!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":". . .","review":"From the description, I see that this is simply the Best Buy version of the B'Day Deluxe Edition. It doesn't have \\"2 bonus tracks\\" as it claims, it only has one. \\"World Wide Woman\\" is a hidden track after \\"Listen\\" on all the regular versions of the album, so it is not a bonus. The only real bonus track is \\"First Time,\\" which is the same song as \\"My First Time\\" from the bonus disc of Beyonce's Live At Wembley DVD. It's a b-side from her debut album. It was produced by The Neptunes, but it's really nothing special.The album is excellent. It is my favorite album of all time. But the point of this review is there really is no point in buying this if you already have B'Day Deluxe Edition. And it's absolutely pointless if you have the DVD I previously mentioned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Refund","review":"Honestly this record was a disappointment. I was looking for a cd of good tracks and thats not what I got. Overall it wasnt Beyonce to me. I'm a fan but she was talking from someone else's voice and when its your cd, speak from your own voice. She shouldve spoken from her character's voice in the soundtrack to Dream Girls, not on her record."},{"rating":"1","title":"you're kidding right?","review":"next time, beyonce should let her father stay involved with her work. dangerously in love was heads & shoulders above this trite garbage. the songwriting is terrible [and downright offensive at times....creole anyone?], the beats are terrible, and beyonce fails to showcase her best asset: her wonderful voice. instead, she screams her way through half the CD, leaving my ears weary by the end.it gets one star for the song Ring the Alarm and another one for the song Upgrade U. The rest of the CD is complete junk, and i'm ashamed that Beyonce had the nerve to release this crap for her fans. please save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hot Garbage","review":"Yes, the beats are OK, but you don't buy a Beyonce', Mariah Carey, Christina Aguilera, etc. cd just for the beats. Even if they aren't singing about anything important, it should still sound like there was some thought behind the songs. Allot of the songs do sound the same, like has been previously said, and with only 10 tracks as well, come on now, it'snot even 50 minutes.I personally only listen to two of them, Upgrade You and Green Light. I will admit, Upgrade You is hot, but one song can't carry a whole album.I didn't know it only took her two weeks to make this, but the first time I listened to it, I thought it sounded rushed and she should have put more effort into it, go figure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Baby I Swear It's De Ja Vu!!","review":"Haters are gonna hate on Miss Bee all day long, but I don't care. It only took her 2 weeks to record this CD, and for 2 weeks she did a damn good job! And if you gotta feature only one artist, why not Jay? He's the BEST rapper ALIVE anyways. This is a CD you can put on a let it play. The whole CD is bangin'.With songs like \\"De Ja' Vu\\", \\"Freakum Dress\\", \\"Upgrade U\\" and \\"Get Me Bodied\\", I can really dance to the infectious beats and catchy lyrics.If you are angry with your man \\"Irreplaceable\\" and \\"Ring Alarm\\" will help you express those emotions. Bee does it once again and proves why she is the hottest chick in the game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sophmore Blues..It Happens","review":"Unfortunately the two weeks she spent on this album should have been longer. Unfortunately a lot of the beats are annoying, the words to the songs are somewhat boring. The format of the album is no good. I have to say the voice is definitely stronger but the lyrics are not her. She sounds like a woman who has to buy love to keep her man and on the other end a woman who will cut you up if you try to go near him. Tracks like upgrade you, BEyonce seems to play it off like she's a gangsta chick which doesn't work out and instead of originality you have beyonce, a well developed artist copying artists that dont sell close to half of what she does. On TV today she said originally there were 20 tracks for the album, then why in the world would she only give us 10. Tracks that i do like are kitty kat, upgrade u and irreplaceable. Be prepared to hear only two ballads, the rest of the songs are for the clubs. otherwise happy b day beyonce, at least you will get the sales you want."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont B'dumb and buy this album!","review":"Saying Beyatche' is overrated is an on the money statement. Her voice is about as painful to the ear as a police or an ambulance siren. Deja Vu, the first single is about as dead as the dancing in that bland video. Jay-z's verse was dull and forgettable like this single. Ring the Alarm is just as bad with Beyatche' doing her worst Kelis impression on the hook. Upgrade U is hot garbage plus another bad beat Swizz Beatz is too much. Also Jay-z's verse on this song is just as butt as his verse on Deja Vu/You call shots/ I call audibles/SIGH! Irreplaceable is the cheesy hoodrat anthem of the year and if I see another dude sing or bumping this song in his ride I am going to pull out all my dreads one by one! Kitty Kat is probably the only song on here that is somewhat decent but thats it. The rest of this album is trash. Call me a hater but it is what it is. This album is bootyhole! F*** this high class hoodrat!"},{"rating":"1","title":"HUM? WTF","review":"What was that? WTF. Come on now B. You know we love you, but what is up with this album.

The more I listen to her solo work, the more I miss Destiny's Child. She sounds a whole lot better when her voice is blended with the other girls. When she sings solo, her voice sounds strained and annoying at the same time; it doesn't change from one song to another. She has no genuine feeling or emotion in her voice. She sounds like she's desperately trying for a radio hit in every song, as opposed to being artistic and creative. With that said, the only decent song on the album that shows any artistic credibility is \\"Irreplaceable.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Beyonce is back again!","review":"She is back and equiped with a whole new album of great songs!The hit \\"Ring the Alarm\\" and the song that was exploding on the adio all the time,\\"Irreplaceable\\" are included in her cd B'Day.Beyonce Knowles is definitley back wih her fantastic songs.The only dissapointer is that the cd only included ten songs.Sad,huh?Well,it's not gonna matter when you pop the cd into your cd player,stereo,computer,whatvere and you hear her awesome lyrics and music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent CD ... Go Beyonce ...","review":"Let me tell you about my girl Beyonce she is a awesome performer and her looks is the best of all time. Beyonce has the body of a goddess and her voice is stimulating to the ear. She is Destiny Child greatest performer."},{"rating":"2","title":"1/2 stars--Edgy, Experimental, Brash and Bold","review":"Recorded in two weeks, B-DAY is Beyonce's \\"Dirty Mind\\". Like that classic Prince album, the music and vocal performances on Ms. B's second solo disc are raw, uncompromising, and fun. On \\"Ring The Alarm\\", Beyonce lets the mascara run down her face as she gets aggressive with a cheating man, while \\"Irreplaceable\\" and \\"Resentment\\" recall classic Aretha. Although \\"Deja Vu\\" isn't the strongest leadoff single in the world, it's charming due to the great 70's-like chord changes and the nice horn arrangement. The album's lone official sexy ballad \\"Kitty Kat\\" is well-produced by the Neptunes while the hidden track \\"Listen\\" serves as a great preview to Beyonce's upcoming star turn in the DREAMGIRLS film.Due to its experimental elements, B'DAY is an album meant to be absorbed after many repeated listenings. It's rare to find an album these days that you have to really dig deep to find even more treasures."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS WOMAN IS AN OVERKILL","review":"Like the reviewer said, how many videos is she going to release? Now she's re-releasing the same album??? This woman is just average and she's only getting all attention because the way she looks and dress. She oversings, she can't dance,her voice is average. This album is a hot mess. The lyrics are lacking, the music is awful. She tries so hard to be sexy and dress half naked on stage so you will forget about her awful music. I'm a guy and i consider this woman not classy but trashy. If you have talent, you don't have to act this way. When you don't have talent, you have to dress like a slut, scream and dance on stage like you're doing something and people will buy your music. American music is just sad, and it's not getting any better. I wish Jennifer from dreamgirls come out with an album and vanish this annoying screamer. At least Jennifer has class and true talent.

She said that she put this cd together in 2 weeks-well it sure sounds like it!! It's not your typical Beyonce cd. Now, don't get me wrong I'm all for Beyonce I've liked her since way back Destiny's Child but this cd just doesn't do her any justice. Even though I think this cd is not good it will probably go platinum just because it's BEYONCE and everybody wants to see what she's come up with since she hasn't been out in a while. All in all, I would not waist my money on this. Right now, I'm rating this as a \\"must play over and over and over again to like it\\" in other words it's really going to have to grow on me.

For all her unrestrained singing, and disregard, if you can, the visual swindle of everyone from Shakira to Mimi herself and-not-to-mention two puny cameos from b'friend Jay-Z, Beyonce struggles to sustain a cohesive course amongst the producers de trop, relying on their skill [or lack thereof] while forgoing all sense of her usual gift of melody.

My grade: C+"},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRID","review":"Only good songs on this CD are the ones eveyone has heard already (Deja Vu and Ring The Alarm.) Irreplaceable will probably be the next single. It is ok. The rest of the songs are so juvinile in the songwriting area. Not much thought behind them and the worst song on this entire CD infact the worst song Beyonce has ever recorded is FREAKUM DRESS. This song has no melody, no good beat. Sounds like an 8 year old wrote the music and a toddler wrote the words. I would give this CD one star. Only thing that saves it from getting a 0 is the fact that two of the songs on the CD are better than average and close to excellent. Do not buy this CD sight unseen ( I mean without listening to it yet.) Does not have mass likeability.

Intially when I listened to the cd I thought ok its not as catchy as Dangerously in Love it is just going to have to grow on me, but that was not the case. I have given this cd several chances but it is just not working. First, it is only ten songs with a bonus track that doesn't help the Cd out at all. Second, the songs seem a little off even on the \\"ballad\\" Resentment the quality of her voice is awful. I don't even know what the direction of this cd is it just seems all over the place.

Dianne's singing is magnificent and moving. Two tracks stand out for me: Obsession and If You Could See Me Now.

MAXIMUM OVERDRIVE suffers from too much of the same thing; a pretty bad cast except for the delightful Yeardley Smith as a whiny newlywed; amateurish special effects and plot holes a mile deep. To King's credit, he has some pretty outlandish sequences, including a bloodbath at a little league game. Emilio Estevez, Pat Hingle and Laura Harrington are some of the actors lost in ill-conceived roles, and the suspense dies early. Aiming for schlock effects and gore, this movie is not one of King's high points and is viewed merely as a kind of \\"cult\\" classic in those cheesey B movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maximum Overdrive","review":"Leonard Maltin has it right, Maximum Overdrive is stupid and boring, at least.

Predictable and pointless plot make this movie dull, static, and easily forgettable. The opening \\"machines attacking\\" scenes have almost nothing to do with the rest of the movie, which deals mainly with trucks driving around aimlessly.

See USA network's \\"Trucks\\", etc.) Any movie in which Emilio Estevez is one of the best reasons for watching it is in trouble, not even Stephen King's name being attached could save it. It's boring to boot. For a quote that is about as original as the movie itself, \\"The Book was Better.\\" Check out Stephen King's short story (also a low point, actually) instead.

But if it takes more than that to trip your trigger, you will not enjoy this movie. It is little more than a forum for creative ways in which machines can maim people and pop their heads like grapes. The gore is over the top. The acting is... well, let's just say that Emilio is the best one here. The dialogue is laugh-inducing.Indeed, there is a high camp factor in this movie. If you want to have a few drinks with your buddies and laugh yourselves into a coma, this flick will do the trick (that's why it got two stars).

The movie started out pretty good which is why it got 2 stars, but plummeted from thier. Instead of continuing the idea of Steamrolers crushing people and lawnmowers chasing people,they make it into attack of the killer Mack truck. It is also kind of funny that the shop owner has an RPG and m16's convieniently sitting in the back of his shop.

But then, who doesn't harbor a fear like that? I loved this movie, mainly for the wild machines...

While it wasn't a good Idea for Stephen King to do and have Emilio Estvez in as the hero, it still has it's good sides. Example? Sure! AC/DC does the score to the movie. They do almost all their songs, though, which makes it a little hard to understand. At the end, when all the survivors get away on boat and the dialouge says that a Russian Satilite kills the cloud (The weird alien cloud that was controling the cars and trucks), AC/DC completes the move with their #1 hit, \\"you shook me all night long\\" which is one of my favorite song. sort of good film, but best if you rent and not keep."},{"rating":"2","title":"if you like this, you must see....","review":"if you liked maximum overdrive, you have got to see murdercycle. murdercycle is the greatest achievement in american cinema to date. the part with the \\"cycle\\" is cool."},{"rating":"1","title":"I see why this film is so infamous.","review":"Emilio Estevez is a cook who takes on a bunch of trucks that have come to life. Stephen King's first and only directorial attempt is a campathon, a schlockfest with plenty of car mayhem and destruction (which make for a few amusing moments), but precious little in the way of genuine fun or thrills.

Ok, can I stop right there? Probably one of the cheesiest and moronic horror movies ever made, this noisy, nonsense has music from AC/DC in its credits which why they did it, I have no clue why..you tell me. Emilio Estevez seems like he knows he's in the wrong movie. The acting is so lame and the dialouge is too stupid, you dont care who lives or kicks the bucket. I would add to say though that the truck with the big green goblin looking clown on the front is a cool truck, but this movie....is not cool...its a epic annyoance of poor proportions. The special effects are cheesy as well. Steer away with caution.

In the case of \`Maximum Overdrive', The bullet never even made the distance to the target. The only reason I was even attracted to it in the first place was the soundtrack by AC/DC, and even that didn't improve the movie's quality. Although I gotta admit that the ATM teller machine insulting the character played by Stephen King himself at the movie's opening is pretty hilarious. And King even drawls a pretty good Southern accent in response. Or was that dubbed in? I'm not too sure. Either way, it's one of the few high points in this whole sad affair.If you want to take a look at a good Stephen King flick, I suggest you pick up the theatrical version of \`The Shining', \`Stand By Me', or \`Misery'.\`Late!"},{"rating":"2","title":"killer trucks!!!!","review":"I personally was not very impressed with this movie,however my four year old son LOVES it so I give it four stars for keeping him occupied."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good truckin movie","review":"Maximum Overdrive is not the greatest horror film to the average movie critic.

A very young Emilio Estevez stars as a parolee fry- cook working in a rural North Carolina truck-stop when cosmic energy causes machines to become man- eating killers. Don' t think too much deeper about it than that. The characters aren't compelling, and the \\"horror\\" kills are only scary by 1987 standards. The best thing about this movie is the awesome soundtrack and classic songs we got as a result from AC/DC. The song \\"Who made who\\" is easily the main reason you' ll identify with this movie.

I must note that he is an expert and I am not.Bottom line, there is a reason these young men are being convinced to construct and place the roadside bombs that are killing troopers over here, and it's not because they hate baseball and apple pie.

Bin Laden is even available to teach Americans how to be faithful. More research into Bin Laden's writing should have been conducted.Bin Laden's teachings are remarkably close to Islamic teachings and actions as far back as 700A.D.

This book seemed, to others in my family as well as myself, like a collection of what other people said in their books or newspaper articles. I just grabbed the book off of my bookshelf so that I could glance at it to help me with this review as far as what to write and I noticed something. A large percent of the pages that I flipped to had qoutes from other people. It seems like no matter what page I flip to I see *as so in so wrote in the New York times or just like so in so warned in 2002* it seems to never end. I personally just don't care for books like that, I think that it's cheap, not to mention the fact that it seems like if you've read one book about our present situation in the Middle East, you've read them all.

Found out accidentally that unplugging the power to the receiving unit cured both problems for the remainder of the session. The next time I used it, the problems came back. Logitech Support told me I had a defective unit. I returned it for a replacement.

I bought it in November of 2007 and I had to replace the unit twice, about a year apart each time, but it was under the warranty fortunately. Whether it was the battery or the base unit that charges the remote that went bad I am not sure, but Logitech does honor the warranty and was very quick and professional in the replacement of the device. I would give it a higher rating (I really like the device) but the overall lifespan takes away some stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor performance","review":"I purchased the product expecting to play music from my laptop using my Sony home entertainment system. The concept and design of this product is good. A receiver connected to my home entertainment system, a transmitter connected to my laptop, and a remote to control the music. It took only a few minutes to get everything setup, connected and playing music. I was at first very excited when the music played. However, in the span of not even finish playing one song, I already heard two or three skips in the song. My setup is simple. The receiver and the transmitter are approximately 9 feet apart in an open room. Yes I do have a wireless router around it but approx three feet apart. In my case, I already have a decent PC speaker system setup so it was not worth it to use this considering that is skips so easily."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont buy it","review":"I followed all the instructions carefully. It seemed to work fine for about two minutes and then the music started stuttering. My computer and the receiver are only about 30 feet apart. When I went on Logitech's own forum I found out that the company doesn't even support the thing anymore. According to one person the problem has to do with the receiver overheating and he was putting the thing next to a glass of cold water to get it to work. I followed the recommendations in the manual to improve the sound to no avail. It is too bad, because the remote control is quite slick. I sent mine back."},{"rating":"1","title":"does not function properly","review":"Many users complained of the music skipping. I thought this must be due to improper set up.

I could not get the skipping to stop regardless of what other devices in my house where running.

But the Kindle version of this book is gravely flawed. Why oh why would you publish ANY anthology and fail to include a table of contents? This makes the book entirely useless for browsing. I now face the unpleasant task of manually paging through the book and creating bookmarks for every story. Frankly, I'd like my money back, please.UPDATE: It turns out that the Kindle version contains ONLY the story \\"The Perfect Host\\" (hence, no table of contents.) So if you want JUST that story, you're good to go (but at a fairly steep price for a single story.)

I read one story per week - though I die to gulp them down and make a feast of reading this book. Each precious tender love story - only one a week. Once in a week I sit down and switch the world off and read about love - because that is what Sturgeon have been writing about all his life. He takes you by hand and shows you that somebody's Eden is always somebody's else Hell; and makes you walk beside a quiet girl - quietly..

Some of the stories depict courageous acts and an enthusiasm for underwater adventure that make the book engaging. There has been better and more scientific studies more recently on sharks of course, but this book is worth having in you library if you are interested in the subject. The illustrations by Jean-charles Roux are excellent. The photographs are good. This book is also certainly a history too: a history of the popularization of our excursion into the underwater world by the Custeaus. Not a five star because it is dated, but five star in most other respects.If you were to collect the whole collection I would think it would be quite a good set at that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy A Twin-Task!!!!!","review":"I think the StreamLight company is great, BUT....I have had nothing but problems with my Streamlight 51005 TwinTask 2L.

But I found the characters a bit too stock, the research into consciousness non-existent (for example, the author routinely confuses unconsciousness and dissociation), the editing and structure sloppy and choppy, and, as someone else pointed out, the ending wholly unsatisfying. As for the dream sequences, the author would have been advised to leave that kind of thing to Stephen King and to not jump back and forth between the dream world and the conscious world. It also would have been a much stronger book had the author maintained a single point of reference with just one character.One highlight of the story was the grandmother.

This dvd is a must for people who love hardcore wrestling. Abyss seems like a Mankind rip off, but still fun to watch. Monsters Ball with Jeff Hardy doing the dive onto Abyss has to be one of the sweetest wrestling moves ive ever seen. The only downside to this dvd is the Dudley Boyz and Rhino VS Jarrett and AMW. They brawled thru out the building and made it hard to follow the action. They also missed out on some amazing points in the match. When Rhino set Jarrett up on a table on the entrace way, I thought it was going be a friggin sweet gore. No dice and that kind of left a sour taste in my mouth. The Sabu VS Abyss barbwire match was ok but wasnt as good as people say it was. TNA has more wrestling then WWE right now, but I still love WWE. This dvd is a must for fans who love hardcore matches.

Sadly enough, this movie is dull and pretty uninvolving. It tells the story of four college students who play a game called Mazes and Monsters, which ultimately results in Hanks' losing his focus on what is and isn't real. There's no real suspense and the dialogue just panders along without any real crucial meat to it. Hanks shows a spark of what was to come, but even he can't rescue this one. Add a young Wendy Crewson (SANTA CLAUSE MOVIES, THE JOANNE KILBOURNE MYSTERIES), Chris Makepeace (MY BODYGUARD) and cames from some well known supporting players: Vera Miles, Anne Francis, Lloyd Bochner, Murray Hamilton, Peter Donat, Louise Sorel and Susan Strasberg, and you have a competent cast in a sorely developed storyline.

For example, before Jamal's fight Tito said \\"Jamal no matter what I'll stick with you forever, because you're my friend.''

I went down to the local hardware store and bought a box of 20 \\"contractors\\" cleanup bagss for thirteen dollars. They are made of heavy duty (black) plastic, and they fit into the dust collector (actually they are a little long, but if you overlap them over the retaining ring by a foot, they work well). They are sturdy and hold up well. I have been doing this with my dust collector for the last year and it works well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expensive and prone to holes","review":"For the price these should really be constructed better. A recent box had two that split along the bottom seam, and two that punctured within a few days of installing. The punctures were from debris sucked into the collector, not from anything hitting the bag externally. Unfortunately you usually find the hole(s) after you realize your shop is getting 'foggy'. Hours spent cleaning sawdust off everything is better spent making more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful to look at. Wished the crystals didnt fall out though","review":"This watch is very nice.

I just wish the video editor was as good as the audio editor, but both of them could use a little more editing. How many times do you have to heaer Mark yelling \\"Thank you\\" to the crowd?

Of coarse I knew who they were from the radio and MTV, but as I watched their front man/lead guitarist named Mark Knopfler play a very long version of Sultans of Swing I couldn't believe my ears. This guy was the best guitar player I had ever seen. I went out and bought the cassette and I have been a HUGE! fan ever since and see him live whenever he tours my area. Every show is GREAT! This latest tour Roadrunning with Emmylou Harris is no exeption. The blending of their voices is so much better than you can imagine. When the new cd/dvd was released I ordered it the first day. What a treat. As always Knopfler surrounds himself with world class musicians and they all play flawlessly together. Both cd and dvd are of great quality. I highly recommend it to any fan of guitar."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two legends do not disappoint or amaze.","review":"I ordered this CD with high hopes. While I was not disappointed, I wasn't blown away either. So I guess you could say I was, in fact, disappointed that I wasn't blown away =) Mark is the greatest guitar player of all time and one of the all time greatest songwriters ever. Paired up with one of the most beautiful voices and songwriters of all time, I had hoped for more new song writing collaborations as well as shared performaces from them, but instead, Mark did stuff mostly from his Golden Heart album, while Emmie Lou did stuff mostly from Red Dirt Girl. Don't get me wrong, it was all GREAT, but they only even shared the stage for about half the concert/dvd. I think Mark was by himself for 3/4 of his songs, while Emmie Lou was alone for half of hers. All in all it's a great album/DVD, but buy it knowing there isn't a lot of new stuff or collaboration between the 2. I give it 4 out od 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Geat Stuff","review":"I like this album and DVD so much that I purchase them as gifts. What's really special I think is that there is a big difference between the live performance and the CD.

Great stuff for both mediums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hose Adapter Scores High","review":"The quality of this adapter is excellent and I would recommend it to anyone requiring a 4 foot gas line."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant book even survives subtitles","review":"In always dreaded the appearance of Bulgakov's brilliant book on screen -- what if the fantasy, the humour and the tragedy did not measure up? An early, small-scale Italian production was not encouraging. But the Russian TV version is worthy of The Master. Splendidly cast, beautifully directed, it captures the sinister atmosphere of Stalin's Moscow in 1935. It survives the worst subtitles I think I have ever seen -- though I admittedly had the advantage of reading and many times re-reading the book. But for any Bulgakov enthusiast, this production is very stroingly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Master and the Margarita","review":"What a disappointment the movie was. I was so anxious to see the movie having loved the book. But the movie starts with dialogue with no translation (no subtitles). Who would dream that there might be passages of 3 minutes with no sub-titles. I came to the natural conclusion that subtitles weren't on the discs. I am returning the discs. Might be cutting off my nose to spite my face (I wanted to see the movie), but I don't want to wait minutes on end to know what is happening. How do they make a 7 hour movie from a book which was only 200 - 300 pages long???"},{"rating":"1","title":"More awful than I could have imagined possible","review":"This DVD was a huge disappointment. Everything about it is just wrong. The cinematography is clunky and amateurish, everything is overlit like a daytime soap, the acting is stiff and unconvincing. The character of Woland looks more like a tired old pensioner than the Prince of Darkness. The whole thing looks like as it's been made by a group of not particularly talented film students.I was bitterly disappointed. Bulgakov's novel deserves a much better treatment.Do not waste your money on this disaster."},{"rating":"2","title":"The ONLY DVD Available for this Masterwork","review":"While the subtitles are nothing especial, the overall production is very true to the novel. Every character is well cast and acted. Margarita, in compliance with the plot, is indeed nude and thank goodness the actress is beautiful in face and figure. The action follows the novel almost verbatim. I really love the novel, one of my all-time favorites. So, seeing a production that matches my imagination was a treat.I do wish, however, that someone would undertake another try at making an updated movie using current special effects and, needless to say, a better English translation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Master and Margarita","review":"I haven't seen it all the way through, but it's a fine production, faithful to the novel. I got it for someone else. We're still waiting to sit down and watch it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Master and Margarita","review":"The Devil arrives in Moscow. A fantastic, swirling adventure by Russian author Mikhail Bulgakov - and a harsh critique of Soviet society."},{"rating":"2","title":"good movie but hard to find subtitles","review":"I love the novel Master and Margarita and I found clips from this series online. I was amazed at how close they stay to the text and the woman playing Margarita is gorgeous and perfect for the role. There are parts that are a bit cheesy and there is nudity (duh!) but it is an excellent movie series.The reason this gets 4 stars instead of 5 is because while it says it has English subtitles they aren't listed in the main menu. You have to go to your task bar and find them there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good English translation, but Arabic typeface is too ornate for novice readers","review":"Yusuf Ali's English translation is positioned as the column to the left of the column of the Arabic text. The Arabic text, however, is somewhat difficult to read because the ornate typeface employed is too distracting. I preferThe Meaning of the Holy Qur'anby Amana Publications of Beltsville MD, which uses a much plainer and easy to read Arabic typeface that is similar to that used in beginning Arabic language textbooks. The Amana Koran is more suitable for novices such as myself. The Amana Koran employs the same English translation by Yusuf Ali as this book published by Muhammad Ashraf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pages out of order!!!!","review":"The pages are out of order!!!!

Even though it is a stretch, the author almost convinces me to believe in time travel. I will be ready other works by her soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous","review":"My rating of this book would be zero stars if the system would allow it. This was easily the most ridiculous book I have ever read, and I read a lot. I have never before written an online review of anything, but I hope to spare as many people as possible the pain I suffered by reading this book. Laughably bad premise, overly-descriptive language of the sort one would find in a high school creative writing class, and a complete lack of editing to reign in the author's language. Truly, it is an insult to Jane Austen to have her name in any way associated with this book. Please, please spend your money on other books. Or just save your money and spend three hours watching paint dry on your wall. Your time will be better spent that way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment!","review":"I am a Jane Austin fan so I love books by her, about her and about her work. However, I was truly disappointed with this bit of fantasy. The characters lacked depth and passion, it was slow moving, boring, and - pretty much - plain goofy. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for a romance novel","review":"As far as romance novels go, this one is well worth the time and money. The time traveling set up may be a tad overused, but the twist in using Jane Austen as a character is interesting, especially to fans of Jane Austen. The end unfolds much like many romance novels, easily and neatly. If I were to judge this against authors who are continuing the stories of Austen or trying to write in her style, or even against just plain old 'fiction' (as this is labeled), I would have to give it three stars instead. It is cute, light, and has the added bonus of the historical Jane Austen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too simplistic","review":"I hate writing negative reviews because I know how much work went into publishing the work, but... This work is sub-par, and I believe the author could do better. I like the idea of a modern retelling of the original story, which is what I thought this would be, and I even liked the time-travel twist for the most part. Unfortunately, the writing itself was too simplistic for an Austen-inspired story. Better writing, more along the style of Austen herself, would have added to the integrity and credence of the story. However, if you're stuck in a car and looking for meager escapist literature, you may enjoy this book. Just get it from the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This book was not at all what I expected.

I firmly believe that if Jane were to time travel to the future she would throw this book in the trash were it belongs and run, not walk; back to her time travel machine.

The names of the characters all throw back to Jane Austen stories, including the cat(Wickham!?!?!) I am all for escapist reading but this was un-readable and left me angry and annoyed.

If you have never read Spencer before,\\"Endless Love\\" is one of the great love stories of all time. If you've read one of his books, you will want to read them all.

His stock in trade is atmosphere, rich characterization and plotting a beguiling narrative that reveals as much to the reader as about the reader. His novels work as mirrors in which we see ourselves. WAKING THE DEAD is no exception to this rule, but it is exceptional in many other ways. This a novel to treasure for long, chilly nights by the fire (or to recreate them in the subway). Reading Scott Spencer is an intimate act and this novel, as most of his work, will take you far away and remind you that sometimes, if you get lucky, nothing is what it seems, specially trade paperbacks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Due to many positve reviews, I started this novel with high expectations.

It was a good book but then someone suggested Dragon Seed. While Good Earth was certainly a great book the Dragon Seed was even better! I would put it at the top of the list of books I have read and certainly a must read for those interested in Chinese culture. This one will be read by my children and I am looking forward to reading the rest of Pearl S. Buck's books. Simply and amazing and talented story teller."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting","review":"As I was reading this book, I felt impatient with the language Buck employs. It seemed convoluted and stilted at times, sort of like \\"And it came to pass that...\\" I'm thinking it may be an attempt to sound as it would sound in the original Chinese. At any rate, the story was interesting, and I felt compelled to learn more about the Chinese/Japanese conflict of the 1930's after reading it. Even though I did feel impatient with it at times, I find myself thinking about it sometimes, and isn't that what literature is supposed to do, cause one to think?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Five star writing in a pragmatic binding","review":"Buck delivers one of her best works in Dragon Seed. While set in China during the Japanese Invasion prior to WWII, this timeless story is not limited by time, culture, or circumstance. And though it was written in 1941 it is as relevant to modern readers as it was to Buck's contemporaries.The binding is a nice quality paperback which makes it easily portable and affordable. A story of this quality deserves a leather binding, but then that would keep it on the shelf instead of in the hands of today's readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"World War II China","review":"Pearl Buck describes the simple life of a village family in China before and during World War II. She follows the lives of each family member, the daughter & her husband who cooperate with the Japanese, the sons who escape to the hills & join the Chinese resistance, the youngest teenage daughter who is sent away to avoid rape, the simple aging farmer & his wife who stay with their land at all costs. While the village & nearby city are never named, it is evocative in some respects of the new book, \\"The Rape of Nanking.\\" I've read this book twice."},{"rating":"2","title":"novel of a lifetime","review":"I always preferred reading magazines rather than novels because i thought novels were boring and reading them was a waste of time. After reading Dragon seed my perception about novels took a shift in the positive dierction. No other author can bring out the subtle aspects of life in times of difficulty as pearl buck has did. I read this novel as a thirteen year old but i still remeber every part of it(i am 22 now). Such is the impression this novel has created. one can read a lot of books on philosophy and humanity but still miss out on some key aspects. i promise u will have the feeling of having read a thousand books on the human nature in this one novel. The novel ends with a positive note and a glimmer of hope which will make every reader search for the silver lining even during the most turbulent times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dragon Seed (Pearl S.

Mr Gray has always known how to produce a visually and physically appealling book. His playfulness in this wide reaching book makes the history of literature human: which, of course, it is.

Unfortunately it does little to support them. Time and time again the author says something interesting about Japan, but fails to give an example or statistic to back it up. The result is that this appears to be a collection of one man's opinions, but gives no basis for believing them.Let me give you an example \\"It has long been symptomatic for the Japanese to blame others for their problems...\\" Really? So what? Give us an example! Prove it to us!

A far far more compelling book than 1984, Kallocain probes what it means to be a good citizen. That this book is not more widely know is unfortunately due most likely to the fact that it is Swedish and that it has been issued by a university press. But this is a rip snorting good tale that will keep you riveted and make you think. And there is lots to ponder: surveillence issues, the idea of good citizenship; the question of who or what is \\"the enemy\\"; what war is about; the use of mind altering drugs in the management of society; and so on.

And what a great decision that was! Had I relied on just Lonely Planet's Rio guide, I would have been as hopeless as a lost puppy. Most of the information in this book are outdated or plain incorrect. Important areas such as music, nightlife, etc. were neglected and many recommendations such as those for lodging & dining were off. My suggestion is that one should definitely look for alternatives to this guide as my copy is awaiting a more useful future near a recycling plant on outskirts of Rio.Of the 3 guides that I purchased, I found Rio for Parties the most useful.

Its publisher, Sterling Publishing Company, puts out dozens of \\"Giant Little Encyclopedia\\" books on various subjects, so I was expecting some new-age gobbledygook thrown together for the mass market. To my delight, the runelore is solidly based in history and Norse mythology, with comprehensive discussions of each rune and its meanings and uses in writing, divination, meditation, and magic. It's a nice book for beginners or for quick reference. The author has done her research well. My only dissatisfaction is with the little book's awkward size and shape--short and squat.

I was surprised that the new C4 Tasklight was way dimmer than the new Junior. After reading some reviews, I found that I could install the old lens from my Luxeon Tasklight, and it improved the brightness and spot light quality to almost as good as the Junior.

I have numerous 2-AA Maglites as well as other brands, and never had such a problem, only with the 3-AA models. I only kept and used them indoors, and so I'm convinced it has nothing to do with outside elements. Both this and the Maglite I used a handful of times, maybe 10 times over a period of around 6 months, and kept them in a drawer, and now useless.

Solving the tactics exercises would require you to apply your creativity and probably learn to avoid mistakes by not allowing these situations to go unexploited, but honestly, if you have a tactics book already, then you have the basic idea already: practice, practice, practice.I'm glad I have the book nonetheless because these problems do require imagination to solve and are not \\"composed\\" problems, they're from actual games.Four stars for the reasons other people have given: the instructions are rather sparse and the book doesn't indicate beforehand that these problems are for intermediate players or better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ahmad Jamal is wonderful - this CD is not","review":"Unless you like editied and shortened versions of live works, DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS CD!All I need to say is this - on this CD \\"Poinciana\\" is 2:56 long and is a recording that Jamal made at the Pershing in Chicago in 1958.

This features two problems: (i) it attempts to emphasize Plutarch's role as a historian and (ii) abolishes his credibility as a moralist.

The latter I've used for years and I've ripped a lot of wood with it.I ripped 5/4 hard maple and 5/4 Jatoba (Brazilian cherry) and it cut both nicely and with little effort but there was some vibration. I have a Delta Contractor's saw with a 1.5 HP motor and the original v-belt, so that is part of the problem. I use a Forrest blade stiffener also.On 4/4 red oak it was pretty much the same as my old Freud 24T when it was sharp. I had to do a little planing on the edges. Overall the blade performs well and I haven't seen any splintering on the edges so far.

No brains at Paramount it seems."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic from my childhood...","review":"This version of King Kong is a classic, in my movie-collection anyway. I have seen the original 1933(?)-version, and it sure is the first one, but the best..? In my opinion, no! First of all, because it's ooooooold! And if you didn't think this 77-version brings Kong as close as possible to life, then what would you say about the version from 33. Some ideas from the 33-version should have been used, the dinosaurs could have been great - and in that way made the skull island even more facinating. Giant spiders in the abyss where Kong \\"pushes\\" the rescue theme of the girl were edited from the oldest version of King Kong, I'm exited to see what Peter Jackson can make out of this consept, he should have a lot to work with on this movie as well. Good luck!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Romantic and savvy re-working of classic 1930's picture.","review":"I saw this film when I was 11 and was mesmerized by the awesome ape on the big screen. I will always love the original classic, but this one has a touching and sad ending, which comes out of the relationship between Jessica and Kong. I would love to see a widescreen/THX version on VHS soon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"King Kong 1976 : Great Movie, Wonderful Acting,","review":"The year was 1976, oil was a big problem in the 70's because there was a shortage of it. So the plot in this movie that involves Fred Wilson ( Charles Grodin ) fits just perfectly because it is a reflection of what was going on at that time,and a lot of people critize this movie because of that.they need to look at the facts, what was going on then. the idea of having the Twin Towers as Kong's final stand was excellent because in the flashback sequence they remind him of the two large mountains that were at his home. Now the biggest success of this movie was the lifelikeness of the Gorilla except in the famous shea stadium sequence... The Cinematography was great and so was John Barry's haunting score, this movie is a modern beauty and the beast retelling and should not be compared to the original. a must see....watch it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Luck Getting It","review":"This is a review of the DVD. While I like this version of the movie more than most, good luck actually getting it. I've ordered it twice, and both times they've sent me the Faye Wray version, even though the order clearly stated Jeff Bridges and all is in order. Amazon needs better fulfillment partners and quality control or they are going to go the same way as the Atari."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pales beside the '33 original","review":"Like most remakes, the film exhibits good intentions and even starts off well. However, its fundamental production quality and even its special effects (!) are dwarfed by those of the 1933 original. The acting in the 1933 film is also much more convincing, in my opinion. I formerly owned the LaserDisc issue of the 1933 King Kong, and that edition was terrific, featuring the movie in its _unedited_ version as well as a director's commentary pertaining to the detailed aspects of the making of this great film.I suggest that you _skip_ this mediocre remake and save your hard-earned bucks to purchase the upcoming DVD version of the original King Kong. If it is anything like the LaserDisc version (it actually should be more, regarding \\"extras\\"), you won't go wrong!"},{"rating":"1","title":"STICK WITH THE ORIGINAL!!","review":"The thinking behind this remake escapes me. Why redo a nearly perfect movie, and leave out the dinosaurs? There is one encounter with a giant snake that's not bad, but that's it. The first half of this movie is an acceptable adventure story, but after Kong is captured, it goes downhill, becoming a politically correct monster movie(ie, Jeff Bridges cheers Kong as he defeats the military). Just stick with the 1933 movie, perfect in every way, almost, and keep hoping they find the lost footage of the spiders at the bottom of that ravine!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Kong","review":"I remember my dad taking me to see this when I was 9 years old at the time. I also remember King Kong being really popular. Like everything else during that time, it was heavely marketed. I even had a pj's with the classic scene of Kong on the twin towers on them. All in all, it was a good movie, not great. I liked it. The only thing that I hated about the movie was its really sad ending. I could have done without that, but I guess it had to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"BURN THIS MOVIE!!","review":"Zero stars actually! I won't waste much effort and space on detailing all the reasons why this movie should be destroyed but I must say it is an INSULT to the original. When this movie came out I was a kid and I remember wanting to like it, even to the point of defending it. After several years I saw it again and had to admit what even as a kid I had known deep down inside; this is a truly awful film. Rick Baker's ape suit is pretty good given the technology of the day. Jessica Lange, Jeff Bridges and Charles Grodin are all fine actors but in each case this film is the stain on their resume. Many of the customer reviews here say \\"don't listen to the critics.\\" Well, don't listen to those people! The critics in this case are right. There is good reason for any true lover of the original to revile this mess of a movie. I say burn it and let's pretend it never existed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Man in cheap ape suite behind blue screen","review":"This movie was total garbage. Annoying enviro wacko themes and unneccesary anti military scenes, Jeff Bridges character cheering on Kong as he attacks the military.Shows the fool De Laurentis is since Merian C Cooper was a WW1 veteran and a blue blood American and helped create the original 1933 Kong.This movie inslults him as well as his work on KK 1933.Movie shows viewer it was made on the cheap. Jungle is NOT convincing. Looks like the fake jungles from soap operas. No other creatures except a rubber snake.You could see the seams in KK's costume.Bad effects + annoying characters + anti capitalist/anti military themes =BOMB."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD,BAD,BAD","review":"What a real rip-off this movie was in fact this is not a movie at all this is trash wet smelly trash.There where no dinosaurs just King Kong fighting a gaint snake but thats it and it only lasted for like what less then a maniute,King Kong walked like a man,and the spiecal effects where really cheesy.It won an oscaer for that maybe to laugh at and the island did not have a name.I got the origanel black and white movie of King Kong it was not how I expected but much better then this garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Story Embraces destruction of an Animal.","review":"Regardless of what people think, this story is a sad story.I don't like the ending nor anything at all about King Kong or any other version that exists out there. King Kong should have taken the Woman with him, back to that island that he was from. You see the prejudices of the human anglo race toward this giant Ape. This is like gloryfing the destruction of an animal! People like to show off that 70's were great but indeed the 70's were racist time and the message here is one of killing an Ape, even though it is a movie, but destorying an ape is the message here. Even though the movie is just a movie, i don't feel right about that, the stupid writer should have written a better plot or ending for the animal as compared to its total destruction. Anyone enjoying this movie is one thing: An idiot( man or woman.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"No doubt this movie appeared to the best till i watched the original 1933 classic.I cant believe how De laurantiis could dare to make a movie like this, killing the original concept.Even the size and structure of the ape is not proportinate.would have done much better.One logic question - If the 30 ft plus ape can climb the world trade center, how can a 30 ft fort prevent it to cross the wall?"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a joke. Isn't it?","review":"If a re-make is attempted then surely the idea is to make it better than the original. But this is not a patch on the 1933 version. The great ape is just a man in a suit here. The animatronic model ape looks nothing like the suit version, and perhas it's a blessing that it's only on-screen for a matter of seconds. And where are the dinosaurs? The only monster Kong gets to fight in this film is what seems to be an outsize draught excluder. Have special effects regressed since 1933? There are some memorable moments, but they're mainly due to the excellent scenery and haunting soundtrack. They're certainly not due to the Fay Wray wanna-be cuddling a giant rubber finger. The Son of Kong was better than this tame disapointment. I'd give this two stars for having a good soundtrack but it's better to ignore this dross and buy the score on its own on CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not A Patch On The 1933 Classic, They Should Have Called This Kink Konk","review":"Oh my gosh, what a mess this movie is, where are the dinosaurs? all you get is a fake looking snake and that's it.The acting is so bad it looks like they cast from a tv soap, and as for the effects, Kong looks more camp than scary, the only scenes that actually work are the scenes with the natives early in the film , put this up against the 1933 classic and see which one shines, I have this film in my collection but I find it very hard to sit through and not cringe.A cringe classic maybe but not a classic in a good way.Buy The original and see real kong fury."},{"rating":"2","title":"King Kong 1976 movie is on point!","review":"The movie was all good.

But when I saw it, the special effects were much better, and the island seemed more tropical than prehistoric. The wall on the island looked better than the original, the dance the natives perform is alot better, and Kong seemed more apelike. It was great when Kong fought that giant snake on Skull Mountain, and was actually sad when Kong was gunned down. The ending was dramatic and powerful, but sad. Despite the fact that the end of the movie didn't have the famous saying, \\" It was beauty that killed teh beast,\\" I still give it a 4! ****"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazon's critic M. Fine should be fired!","review":"King Kong '76 was one of my favorite movies as a child, when I saw it for the first time I tought it was phenomenal. Now as an adult I can see the movie has many flaws, mainly Jessica Lange's acting, but to be qualified as utter trash as Mr. Marshall describes it, it is just plainly unfair, this movie has many qualities: great cinematography, great music score, natural sets, an atmosphere that only 70's movies possesed and the monster itself while not great, is better than any CGI garbage. I prefer this movie a 1000 times than Peter Jackson's fiasco, he is one of the most overrated movie directors ever, that movie has bad acting all over and doesn't look real to me (I'm not a big fan of CGI). I think movie critics are biased most of the times and not objective, I think this movie deserves a chance to be seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why Ruin The Good Things?","review":"I love King Kong. I Like King Kong, King Kong vs. Godzilla(dispite the ending), and I want to see King Kong Escapes(a movie that's not on amazon but the soundtrack is). When I saw this movie I was bored out of my mind. They did nothing on Skull Island but having a fight with a giant snake for 15 seconds(I'm not joking) and a girl flirting with a gorilla that looks like he just kissed Ethen(a kid at my school and it means the ape looks like wax). The bummer is, there's no dinosaurs or humoungus plane fights! I gave this monstrosity a 2 because one it followsthe origenal plot and two, it's better than King Kong Returns."},{"rating":"1","title":"King Kong '70's version","review":"Not the greatest when viewing it now. I purchased it because I now have all three versions; the original, the 70's version and the newest CGI version. It brings back a lot of fun memories on earlier acting techniques and I can remember when the special effects of this movie were considered great. I won't leave out the great performance of Charles Grodin in this version. Not Jeff Bridges greatest acting nor the new Jessica Lange but it has sentimental value."},{"rating":"1","title":"A brave failure.","review":"Despite notoriously flopping at the time of its release, Guillermin's remake of 'King Kong' has many admirers, who see it as a black comedy, a moving inter-species love story, a critique of U.S. global capitalism, U.S. razzmatazz politics or U.S. foreign policy in the 1970s. 'Kong' even has an old-fashioned psychoanalytic reading - a boat full of unrelieved men rescue a beautiful woman; one in particular is interrupted three times from making love to her - Kong is the bestial emanation of these unspoken or frustrated desires.'Kong' is all these things and is thus worthy of respect - other wannabe blockbusters should be so brave or intelligent. I just didn't get it. The lack of camp made the old-fashioned material look silly. The mismatch between live action and special effects seems more dated than the original. The direction and narrative never sparkle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Corny!!","review":"This was one of the worst movies that I've ever seen, I am not sure which is worse this or the original King Kong movie from the 1930's, but anyway both are awful!

The other versons of King Kong are great and classic. But for King Kong (1976) & King Kong Lives, the producers were obviously not thinking straight. I mean King Kong climbs up the National Trade Center rather than the Empire State Building. Jack Driscoll looks like Jesus Crist. Ann's name is Dwan? Carl Denhem dies by getting squshed by King Kong. So no \\"The Beauty killed the beast\\" unless it was said by someone else!!! So don't give this one a chance but go see the other ones. It's with it :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"THE ORIGINAL KONG'S UGLY COUSIN","review":"Abominable remake of the 1930's classic updated for 70s counter-culture sensibilities. Pales next to the original in every conceivable area--acting, characterization, sets, cinematography, and writing. *Especially* writing, as this has to win the prize for all-time worst dialogue hands down. Even the FX are inferior to the original's, which boasts a far more dynamic and empathetic titular monster and vastly more convincing and exciting action sequences. It's all particularly disappointing considering the talent involved in this picture's creation, produced as it was by Dino de Laurentiis and boasting a cast of Jessica Lange, Charles Grodin, and Jeff Bridges with Rick Baker handling the special effects. But for whatever reason, it just doesn't work. The final product is a trite, brain-numbing and instantly outdated parody of its classic forefather. I'm afraid the best thing about this turkey is how much more it makes you appreciate the original."},{"rating":"1","title":"a movie at its worst","review":"this is 1 of the worst movies ever made i urge u if u have taste dont buy this buy the 1933 origanal in videothis version is not only bad its insulting to any true kong fan and as a film stutent i can honestly say i could have made a better film the kong looks better in the original the acting is better the effects may not be as good in the 1933 version but the stop motion is amazing people still cant belive thats a puppetif you want fun exitment and drama watch the origanal if you want to waste a couple of hours of your life and your money watch this"},{"rating":"1","title":"How Un PC is this??","review":"It's got the lot.

Released in 1976 and starring multiple famous actors in various stages of their respective careers, this movie all but killed any interest in monster movies until Spielberg released Jurassic Park over a dozen years later. Why was this movie so bad? Multiple reasons. First, the acting is horrible; many of the lines look forced, as if the actors and actress are reading from a script. Second, all the monster scenes look fake. King Kong really looked and moved like a grown man in a costume. And the snake he fights on Skull Island looked like a gigantic puppet. The other special effects were fairly bad too, most noticeably the final fight scene with the helicopters. The copters looked and moved worse than remote control copters; they looked like they were dangling on strings. Overall, a crappy movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"26 Years later and finally a little \\"respect\\"","review":"Granted I recall the film with a \\"twenty-something's\\" memory, it still holds fond memories for me. Like most that were disappointed to find that the great ape was nothing more than Rick Baker in a very convincing costume, I found the movie to be enjoyable, like many, for its wondrous score, the jungle sequence, and the use of the Twin Towers in place of the now-ancient Empire State Building.I also recall thinking that the young maiden in the Fay Wray part was certain not to have a long career. Boy, did Jessica Lange prove me wrong.It just goes to show that talent can flourish when given the right role. It is obvious that Miss Lange chose better in later films.Not a triumph but still better than that latter-day bomb, \\"Godzilla\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK remake.","review":"Though certainly not up to the level of the 1933 original, this film does have its moments. The spfx are good(excepting the stiff robot Kong used for a few long shots). The giant snake is pretty disappointing, making one long for the original's parade of prehistoric monstrosities. The score is decent, adding much to the proceedings. Unfortunately, the campy attitude exhibited by the filmmakers and played up by the cast nearly sinks the whole film. Gone is the awe and wonder of the original Kong. In its place is a plethora of knowing smirks and goofy jokes. Still, this film is fun and diverting, though it will NEVER make anyone forget the REAL King Kong!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT???????????????","review":"i watched this twice just to be sure,and i was right!!!,i still don't understand just what this movie was about except that a lot of stunt men got a paycheck and several actors sliped down the list to become grade z list actors.avoid this stinker like the pox!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"this movie worked better in MST3k","review":"this movie is TERRIBLE!!!however, i think it's a shame that MST3K has yet to release this gem on dvd. i'd say steer away from the actual movie and try and find a copy of the MST3K episodeas the review above said you'll be rooting for the Omega and MEGAWEAPON by the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"chipmunk cheeks pro-anarchy","review":"OK.

His \\"in-depth description\\" of the meaning behind every Pink Floyd song is suspect at best, often simply rambling on about something I've read somewhere else before or by writing a description that often has nothing at all to do with the song itself. While the book has many quality color and black & white photographs, many have poor cutlines or misidentify the persons in the picture (in one instance, Jones misidentifies Roger Waters!!!). If you're a true Floyd fan, it's a quality buy for novelty alone. But if you're looking for the true meaning behind the songs of Pink Floyd, this ain't the book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is research?","review":"Okay, I didn't actually buy this book, I saw it at Borders and was thumbing through it. I didn't see Roger Waters name in the back of the book, judging by another reviewer it must have been a typo. And then the Discography was a joke. It mentions all the Floyd albums but only Syd Barret's solo stuff. So I took a look at the little timeline in the back of the book and it listed Radio KAOS as Radio CHAOS. And the guy lists himself as a Floydophile. He maybe a Floydophile, but he doesn't know the first thing about radio or Roger's albums. There's a reason its KAOS and that's because its a renegade rock station in LA. Sheesh. That alone was enough to turn me off the book.The sad part is that apparently this guy works for Rolling Stone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not The Best PF Book","review":"I was really looking forward to reading this book, however when I did finish it, I found it full of errors. The band member's birthdays aren't correct in a couple of cases. Not to mention... that Roger Waters is referred to as \\"Roger Watts\\" in some early picture captions. I would imagine Mr. Jones is not to happy about the typo butcher job. Not all bad either, some interesting insights on the band & songs, but if you know your Floyd, it isn't anything new.I wish I could be more positive, but I expected to find out something NEW! Not a rehash of other books. IMHO, even if these books are older you would do better to spend your money on a \\"Saucerful of Secrets\\" & \\"Crazy Diamond\\"... a great book about early Floyd and Roger Keith Barrett."},{"rating":"2","title":"Informative and fun","review":"I very much enjoyed this book and could not put it down. I own everything from Dark Side on but still read the early stuff to get a good idea of the early Syd Barrett stuff. I found it all very interesting as I love Pink Floyd. I, like other readers, noticed misidentifying Roger Waters which was quite surprising. I have been a Pink Floyd \\"fanatic\\" for a long time but most of the stories were not \\"old\\" to me. I expected a little more indepth understanding of the lyrics but it was still insightful. I would definitely recommend this book to the serious Floyd fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good","review":"It featured loads of great photos and the information on which inspired the songs is interesting although there a few silly mistakes in the book. For example, in one of the Roger Waters' earlier shots the book says it's 'a young Dave Gilmour' and some of Waters' quotes on the Wish You Were Here album are wrongly assumed they're originally by David, which is not true.In a nutshell - very good. It doesn't reach the five star rating though due to the errors pointed above.4/5."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent... Not Remarkably Worth It","review":"This case it not terrible, but I really would not recommend it. The black design is really boring after a while, and the leather starts to look a bit odd if you just keep it in your bag. The way it flips up can tend to be a bit odd, seeing as it is partially inhibited by the headphone jack.However, if you are just looking for something that will get the job done and is inexpensive, it will function. This product holds the Zune rather securely, and won't allow to buttons to be pressed while closed. Also, it snaps shut pretty tight. However, be careful because a bit of the top near the corners and the botton corners are exposed to everyday wear and tear. Overall, if you want crude protection without an ounce of flare, this is your product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Value","review":"This is a very high quality item. I still am amazed at how inexpensive it was. Maybe because the Zune is such a small market? Anyway, I highly reccomend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent case.","review":"I like the case a lot, it fits the Zune really well. My only problem with it, is the visibility of the screen suffers but that would happen on anything except one of those hard clear cases."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Nice","review":"what can I say other than this is a very nice case for the Zune. Fits like a glove, has a nice professional look, and protects the Zune while still allowing you to have good access to the Zune's functionality.I bought a case for the Zune at Target, got it home, pulled it out, and within 3 minutes, it was on it's way back to the store to be returned. it was AWFUL. But, this DLO Folio is very nice. I dont see how you could be disappointed. It does everything it should and looks and feels nice."},{"rating":"2","title":"yay.","review":"This is the best case for the Zune that I have seen so far..it covers all parts of the zune including the back and play buttons as well as the scroll buttons and screen..It matches well with the brown Zune also. The player stays snug inside the case and doesnt get scratched at all..the only negative thing I would have to point out is that where it folds it may get a few cracks in the \\"leather\\".go ahead and get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good quality but too snug","review":"I had this case for a year before selling it with my Zune. I wanted to keep this and use it with my 80GB Zune but I could not, for the life of me, get the Zune out because it was so tight! Overall the item is great so I'll quickly list each individual quirk that I've come accross1. Glare on the plastic is bad2. I left this in my car everyday and usually it was exposed to sunlight. The heat caused the leather to tighten and warp the front cover. Maybe thats my fault for leaving it out but I think its worth noting.3. Of course its too tight as mentioned above."},{"rating":"2","title":"dlo follio","review":"apears to be exactly what i wanted . noticed while working it was coming off my belt because i wear a wider belt. zune goes in very tight and comes out very hard hope it loosens up over time. all in all i like the style and looks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice looking, not very useful.","review":"The case itself looks nice on the outside, but once you put your Zune in it and open it up, you'll regret ever buying it. The plastic screen protector is so foggy and smudged that you're lucky if you can see anything through it. If you leave your Zune in it, the stitching around the center control leaves smudges and indentations around it. Mine is also falling apart. Be smart, stick to the fabric cover that came with the Zune. Don't buy DLO products, they're expensive cheaply made products."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horribly Dissapointing....","review":"I bought this case because I heard about all of the good reviews. What a mistake. The plastic screen protector is EXTREMLEY scratch prone. After a couple of days of use it was all scratched up! I DO NOT recommend this to anyone. Splurge on a better case."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stylish","review":"This folio makes me feel like a young executive even though I'm just about to start college. It has a belt clip which means that you don't have to keep it in your pocket and dig around for it when you want to pick a song or see what's playing. My zune fits very snugly, so it'd probably be a hassle to remove it. You can access the headphone jack and the USB slot while in the folio, so i haven't had to remove it yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"This case was cheaply made, and looks horrible.The picture is very misleading - in normal light, the colors look atrocious. Also, the paint on the sides of it was hand done by someone, and looks very tacky/poorly made. The whole thing feels very cheap and tacky, I would never take it anywhere. DLO was also very unhelpful, they refused to refund, exchange, or do anything about their crappy product. Worst $20 I ever spent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Example of French Pastry; Poor Editing","review":"For someone who has enjoyed Christine Ferber's jams, the news of publication of her two books (Mes Confitures and Mes Tartes) in English were very welcome. The mere flipping through the pages reveals the beautiful pairings of flavours, colours and textures as well as Mme. Ferber's genius in highlighting (rather than masking) the flavour of fruit.However, I was less impressed with the editing of the English edition of Mes Tartes. The first red flag was a mistake in the staple recipe for flaky pastry, which called for 3 tablespoons of butter (per 1lb of flour). Thankfully, the metric measures retained from the original edition provided the correct ratio (375g of butter per 1lb of flour).In other words, I highly recommend the book, but I would urge caution in relying solely on the cups/tablespoon measures provided. Use the metric measures prodived for guidance."},{"rating":"1","title":"company name too prominent","review":"Item appears to be good quality but the appearance is ruined by embossing the companies name from the bottom so that it shows from the top. Since it is a drip pan the surface should be smooth when you wipe it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very cheaply made","review":"Considering these drip pans were clearly marked 'Heavy Duty Chrome Plated - made in USA\\" I felt safe in assuming they would be made of a substantial, heavy grade metal, equivalent to the material used for my stainless steel rangetop and made to last a while. I was very disappointed to discover that they were very thin and probably easily bent by hand, if I chose to do so. It is hard to believe anyone could mistake them for 'original equipment' as stated on the label. Folks who pay thousands of dollars for a range would never find these drip pans acceptable as 'original equipment'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Needed Old Version of VMware Workstation","review":"I needed to run some old, but very important VMs that were created on Workstation 3.

So I guess one set of batteries is all you will ever have to buy for this flashlight.I would only recommend a flashlight that has on and off. This type of switch has to be a lot more reliable.

(Clancy Brown, William Forsythe and the surprising Larry B. Scott of \\"Revenge of the Nerds\\" fame)Hill does a great job editing and building up the tension in the final act of the film culminating in one of the best free for all gun battles ever staged.

I picked up this book after seeing it in a side-bar banner add on a popular peak oil forum. I was disappointed as soon as I started reading. my main comments on the book are1) The book doesn't offer any new data on the topic, but instead gives a rehash of peak oil along with some alarmist consequences2) The book doesn't offer any tenable strategies to survive the author's \\"power down\\" scenario. Kunstler in his book \\"Long Emergency\\" gives more meat here (though still not too much).3) The author gets sidetracked in a conspiracy theory discussion on Bush, the Iraq war, and various other ills of the military-industrial complex. Generally I think these types of theories don't add a lot to the discourse, and was annoyed to see \\"Bush is Bad\\" references sprinkled throughout.Bottom line is: not terrible, but not worth $10."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better Books Out There","review":"Time would be better spent reading the Limits to Growth ed.2004 and/or Collapse by Jared Diamond.Very little original material exists in this book.

In the context of the subject, it is no surprise that the author would strongly disagree with the regressive environmental and energy policies of Bush administration. The violent actions of a waning empire, desparate to control energy resources, will merely postpone the inevitable collapse of industrial society, while doing nothing to make our future any more secure.\\"Power Down\\" seems to be conciously written to be more accessible to the average reader than \\"The Party's Over\\", it covers a lot of the same ground but is probably easier for most people to absorb than Heinberg's first book.

There are several scenarios described, ranging from the optimistic, or least disruptive, to the pessimistic and catostrophic. Even the optimistic scenario is still disruptive relative to what we are currently used to. If you find the premise of the book to be credible and you are younger than 60 years old, it is well worth your while to consider how you will choose to adapt to or to influence the monumental changes that we will be forced to endure.

My two are in general household duty. Remarkably, both are running on batteries discarded from conventional flashlights. For common applications like finding small parts dropped on the floor, either of the two LED modes are excellent. The krypton bulb position gives only average performance compared to a Mag-Lite, but this really isn't important 99% of the time. In fact, the batteries I am using are so low that the krypton bulb barely lights, yet the LEDs are fully bright"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great while it lasts","review":"I purchased this item specifically for its claims of long-lasting light off a single pair of D batteries. My most recent experience is that the advertised battery life of 80 hours for the 5 LED setting was reduced to about 5 hours in ~15 Deg F temperatures. I got the light for use in overnight trail running where I didn't want to have to carry spare batteries, and was nearly left out in the dark. I've heard other complaints about the 3-way switches giving out, so that may be what's wrong as well. I'm hoping to be able to return it.On the plus side, it does make a nice amount of light, although I don't really see any difference between the 10 LED's and 1 xenon bulb to be honest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strange Product","review":"Liked Mag Lite, got tired of replacing batteries, and its a bit over large. Streamlight sounded good, more efficient design with LEDs and traditional Xenon combination and with aircraft alum construction.Realiy is that the construction is indeed great, equal of Mag. Problem is that the LED light is really strange flourescent-like blue that doesn't project much light at all. What it does project is off color and tends to distort colors of other things. Find myself going for more light from the xenon quite often (and in process loosing the LED efficiency benefit), but the way this designed, with 10 holes to accomodate the LEDs the reflector weakens the xenon into a short, limited beam. \\"A\\" for construction quality, but other than that this product doesn't satisfy if you are seeking real brightness."},{"rating":"1","title":"concur with previous review","review":"i concur with what someone else said, that the xenon bulb is practically no brigher than the led, very possibly the led is brighter than the xenon, therefore there is really no point in having a dual purpose flashlight. i didn't want to leave a \\"bad\\" review... but i returned this light for refund. i do think streamlight makes quality products and intend to someday buy a different model"},{"rating":"1","title":"don't waste your money","review":"Without a doubt one of the worst new wave flashlights I've ever tried.

See my other reviews for a far superior light."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This is an excellent product! The two types of bulbs (xenon and LED) provide a useful choice of brightness, color of light (the xenon is a \\"white-white\\" and the LED is a slightly bluish white) and battery life. There is a slight ability to focus the light beam. The on/off switch functions positively. The construction is sturdy. The batteries are easy to change."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic flashlight","review":"I've used quite a few flashlights in my time, including a good number of Maglites. I'm not a flashlight guru, but I'm pretty particular about things working well, and the this little 3-cell AA flashlight from Streamlight is simply fantastic. The dual feature of Xenon/LED lights alone make it exceptional, but add to that terrific battery life, a really well designed and rugged exterior, and a an excellent reflector and you've got a grade-A flashlight. My wife and I used two of these on a recent vacation to the Big Island of Hawaii which included a mile long hike across rough lava to a lava viewing site, the return trip of which was in near pitch-blackness. It felt great having such a wide, clear beam of light that was so bright it literally helped the people all around us, not just ourselves.

Also, it is sometimes hard to get stable on a slightly slanted yard. If you are serious about doing leaf shredding, then you'll want to set the machine on top of a tarp and move it around the tarp as the piles of shredded leaves mound up under the machine.The biggest downfall is how fragile it is: This is a leaf shredder only. It cannot handle even the smallest twig or branch without jamming or breaking the shredding devices inside. This was a big problem for me since its very difficult to 'screen' out every little branch before loading rake-fulls of leaves into the hopper. I got tired of having to constantly shut it down, unclog it due to some unshredded twig, restarting it, and then re-loading all the unshredded leaves, trying to screen out any twigs on the way.Because of this I have since stopped using it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaf Eater doesn't have much of an appetite","review":"Machine is quick to clog when leaves are slightly wet.

I determined in advance that it would only work for leaves. I am quite satisified. It allows me to make good mulch from leaves so that I have the moisture-conserving, soil-improvement of mulch without having to buy anything. I had used my lawnmower to chop up leaves but it fouls it up badly. This product is simple to use and does a very good job. A few little sticks by mistake don't do a lot of harm though they shorten the life of the strings that do the cutting. The item is light and easy to store away."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS","review":"Photos indicate a large unit sturdily built like my 15yr old shredder. Not so, the parts do not fit together, the hopper is only 15 inches across and would hold only a small amount of leaves. The black hopper attachment is a flimsy piece of plastic, Guess where this was made! I am hoping to return mine. Customer service at Flowtron recommended using oil to get the upper and lower units in place! When that didn't work, they offered to send another top unit as there have been alignment problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"Efficient Machine","review":"Last year we had 17 full bags of leaves. This year it was 10, so the Leaf-Eater did what it was supposed to do. The only drawback was that the leaves had to be dry.

I was happy with the product back then and am happy with it now. I am careful to sort out obvious twigs as I load it, but some slip by with no problem. It does seem to only shred at one setting. I did not notice a change in particle size when I slid the lever. No problem since the size that it does shred is perfect for my garden mulch. I'm very happy with this product. We have 6 maple trees and a couple of oak trees in our yard, so this item is very needed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless","review":"We tried to use this product. It jams up very easily unless you just sprinkle the leaves in. We had 22 bags of leaves; would have taken us an entire day of \\"sprinkling\\" to get through all those leaves. The legs are really short - what bag besides a paper grocery bag is this going to sit over? And regular leaf bags are too tall for a garbage can, which it fits on.However, when it is grinding up leaves, it does grind them up as fine as advertised. We ended up packing it up and sending it back. We received the refund promptly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as regged as it should be","review":"I tried only few minutes and I did not like it for two reasons:1) not rugged as it should be.

Freud really needs to put wax on the bit so it's protected!! Even Rockler has theirs covered with wax in their display box at their store. That said, mine was fine with no dings and it works great. It's nice to have the ability to quickly adjust your tongue and groove bit for different widths of board.So mail order is a little risky in this instance, but Amazon is always great on returns.

I love the hilarity of love and death, sleeper, and the like to the poignancy of manhattan, hannah and her sisters, and husbands and wives. also who can forget about the all around perfection of annie hall. However curse of the jade scorpion is absolutely horrendous. aside from my general dislike of helen hunt and most things she disgraces the screen with (aside from As Good As It Gets, she was wonderful there), these two have absolutely no chemistry. the hatred for each other seems completely forced. the entire film seems forced. honestly i could barely sit through it. come on woody give us another bullets over broadway or everyone says i love you. quit with this cutesy crap. ps i even really enjoyed small time crooks so im not all hard boiled and whatnot. this film was just complete and utter crap. definitely one of the worst of the year called one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Struggling to be positive about this one","review":"I felt like I was watching an amateur production of a minor, and long-forgotten play. I couldn't quite make up my mind if the cast were just incompetent, or the script was letting them down very badly. Probably both. Some of Helen Hunt's lines fell so flat I cringed for her. The interaction between her and Woody was possibly the least convincing bit of acting I've seen in a long time. I'm amazed he dare release it.Worse, the plot is utterly peurile and full of holes you could drive a truck through. And it isn't funny, except for a couple of minor gags.It makes \\"Small Time Crooks\\" look like a masterpiece."},{"rating":"1","title":"Woody's weakest film? Say it ain't so!","review":"I love Woody Allen. In fact, he's probably my single favorite director, a great writer, and an artistic hero all around. But this is the weakest film I've ever seen of his. It only warrants a two. It has some nice moments, some good jokes, some cute scenes, and EXCELLENT cinematography, but as a whole it is weak.Woody is getting too old to be a believable romantic hero (along with Clint Eastwood: who'd ever think I'd get them together in one thought!), Helen Hunt is an overrated actress at best and wooden at worst, but not as wooden as Charlize Theron. And I question the logic of taking a brilliant, brilliant comedic actor like Dan Aykroyd and giving him the dullest character in the piece.maybe twenty years of more serious films has eroded Woody's ability to do a straight comedy like the slapstick bits of brilliance he began with.Though Hollywood Ending was much funnier."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Curse of the JADED Scorpion","review":"is what must have engendered some of the negative reviews from this worthwhile, hilarious film. Either that or you all live in much cooler cities than the rest of us hoi polloi, because I would have KILLED to have this movie grace my local multiplex. I wont go into the plot-everyone else already has. The Picasso joke at the beginning is the best one, Woody Allen and Helen Hunt trade insults expertly(Hunt had a few weak lines, but is that her fault?) Skip the blockbusters and patronize things like this, maybe we wont have crummy movie years anymore!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a warning","review":"A lot has been said in the earlier reviews about plot, acting and what went wrong with this movie, so I won't repeat that. I'll just add a warning: If you, like I, really enjoy the genius of Woody Allen - stay clear of this one. It's way below his usual quality, and there are so many others to choose from. Any of his recent films, not to mention the classics, are more enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major misstep from Woody Allen","review":"This is simply a bad movie -- plenty of other top-notch Woody Allen movies though..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Underrated!!!","review":"I feel cheated... all these years I never bothered with this film over all the negativity surrounding it - including Woody Allen himself, who considers it his worst film. However, I genuinely found this story hilarious, and the chemistry of the cast was perfect for my taste. As a comic farce, I found it fast-paced and quirky with lots of zippy one-liners, and contrary to all the critics who hate this film, I was genuinely entertained with its flashes of original brilliance. Allen once said he felt like he let the cast down by putting himself in the lead, but how could anyone else play it? He's perfect. The pace of the movie reminded me of Allen's much older (and better) outings. Even the '40's soundtrack with some great snippets of his favorite ragtime throughout is very tastefully executed. I watched this on Netflix for free, but have since purchased it as a movie I want in my collection. I cheerfully recommend you give it a chance!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another brilliant Woody Allen flick!","review":"Say what you will about Woody Allen, but I think he's still one of the better film makers around. The plot was funny, clever, and very entertaining. The cast, especially Helen Hunt were great. I particularly liked the setting in the 1940's. Everything looked and felt true to the period. Too bad more people didn't get a chance (or wouldn't give it a chance might be better term) to see this film. Another Woody classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Somewhat Cursed Comedy","review":"A by-the-numbers Woody Allen movie, \\"The Curse of the Jade Scorpion\\" is another example of the more recent (and uneven) efforts created by the director. Essentially sitcom material, the movie\`s plot has some nice ideas and funny moments, yet it\`s way too light and linear to deliver an above average cinematic experience. The acting (Helen Hunt and Charlizer Theros are the Allen girls this time) is good, the dialogue sharp and witty as always (although a bit forced at times), and the photography is very competent as well. Add an interesting NY in the forties and you\`ve got a decent entertainment that\`s worth watching once, still it\`s far from a remarkable achievement.Mildly Recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Woody gets woodener.","review":"Time for Mr. Allen to move aside, I'm afraid.

He should have quit when he was ahead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Put Him Out To Pasture PLEASE!","review":"As a life-long New Yorker I have always felt a certain affection for Woody and his films. Admittedly, they started slipping as far back as Shadows and Fog, alternating with the rare triumph.But here we see the master in true, complete decline - decrepit, depleted, dull and disorganized. The script is littered with dozens of horrible grade Z jokes. The performances are uniformly horrible. The story is a two-line gag stretched out for an interminable ninety minutes. STOP HIM BEFORE HE FILMS AGAIN!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Importance of Being Earnest","review":"Asquith's impeccable adaptation of the Oscar Wilde play is a delightfully crisp, even subversive satire of British social manners and mores, featuring a splendid, quintessentially British cast. Redgrave and Denison are the epitome of rakish charm, while Greenwood and Tutin play their respective parts with perky, ladylike puckishness. No one outclasses Edith Evans, however, whose hilariously fearsome turn as the disapproving, gold-digging \\"gorgon,\\" Lady Bracknell, is pure comedic genius. Bright costumes, florid set design, and cheeky \\"bon-mots\\" are all part of the fun of \\"Being Earnest.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun romp with tradition script","review":"With very few exceptions, this is a screen production of the traditional stage show. As such, it is very faithful to the Wilde script, which is very helpful for those who want to see the traditional staging. The pair of Prism and Chasuble were perhaps [SPOILER NOTICE] a little old for the sudden romance that springs up between them [SPOILER ENDED], and the humor perhaps a little subtle for many American audiences, especially younger audiences, but it is a fun, faithful performance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Edith Evans, I love you! Oscar's not too bad either!","review":"The problem with this DVD is the sound quality which appears to have been taken straight from a bad BVU tape version. The actual show is the definitive version, there can be no argument about this - for a start, no-one feels the need to trivialise Oscar Wilde's script by having their lover's name tattooed on their bum! Unfortunately, the actual movie is ruined by its appalling sound quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"the movie cannot withstand the passage of time","review":"I want to clarify that I like Oscar Wilde's form of humor and cynicism.I have studied the Importance of Being Ernest when in High School and saw the movie during a class trip. I also saw the play at a later stage of life. Out of nostalgia, and for sentimental reasons, I bought the video when it became available. Well, it was a reality check for me. Granted that the Importance of Being Ernest was a farce, the lines still remained amusing and clever. However, the production was very stagey, the acting too pretentious for a movie, especially in the role of Gwendoline. The movie lacks the naturalism and spontaniety of a movie, and it lacks the dramatic effect, the immediacy and intimacy of a stage work. One can't help feeling that the movie creaks of old age!! So, Oscar Wilde fan, go see the play, go read the play, but avoid the movie, unless you want to relive your more innocent and impressionable youthful days."},{"rating":"2","title":"simply the best!","review":"This video should not only appeal to the ardent fans of the wit of Wilde but to all afficionado's of classic Brittish cinema.Every fan of Edith Evans will delight in her classic dipthong filled utterance of- \\" a HANDBAG!\\" The best version of the Importance, EVER."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Comedy of Manners Polished to a High Gloss","review":"One of the great films...artificial, mannered, hilarious. I wouldn't have expected Redgrave to be as good as he was in upper-class high comedy, but he was excellent. And Joan Greenwood...what high style, what lusty undercurrents, what sly eyes, what a voice. Check her out in Kind Hearts and Coronets and Man in the White Suit. She never lost that voice. If they ever make DVDs of Little Dorritt I and II, she plays Derek Jacobi's aged and sick mother. She's instantly recognizeable the first time she speaks.The Criterion package is first rate. If you appreciate wit, acting done to a high polish, and the type of film simply not being made anymore, get this one.You might also want to look at On Approval, another gem of style and manners."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Importance of Being Earnest","review":"Oscar Wilde. In a perfect world, I'd be able to stop typing with those two words and you'd know what I'm on about. Like the author I just mentioned, Oscar Wilde was gay, and thus very much the outsider, which gave him a special insight into Victorian ethics, which he sent up in his uniquely witty way. I'd say he poured everything he had to say into these 95 little minutes. I've reviewed the recent edition of this play and said very nice things about it. But the 1952 version sticks precisely to Wilde's original script, and thus I think it's superior. The real point, though, is that actors should keep performing it, people should keep filming it, and we should keep watching it. It's brilliant and you will laugh out loud repeatedly. I'll use this in class after the long overdue vacation ends."},{"rating":"2","title":"MARVELOUS CAST AND PERFORMANCES","review":"ALTHOUGH THE COVER ON THE DVD IS HORRIBLY INACCURATE, THIS IS, IN MY OPINION, THE BEST VERSION OF ONE OF THE MOST CHARMING, CLEVER AND ENTERTAINING STORIES PENNED BY ANY AUTHOR."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lighthearted and sprightly","review":"This is the old classic and still provides delight and humor with the intermix of characters played superbly by giants of the past.

Of course, as a Western film, the Mahdi is presented as a blood-thirsty psychopath, whereas he was in fact a holy and devout man who wanted to free the Islamic World from Western influence. In these days the Western powers didn't have cruise missiles and stealth bombers - they had to do their dirty work with the British bayonet, and more often than not, they paid a high price for their arrogance. This movie, however, presents a rather rosy view of colonial war. The British army effortlessly mows down the Mahdi's army as if Muslims were just so many sheep being slaughtered. When I watch this film, I feel that the West never really ended its crusades againsts the Islamic peoples."},{"rating":"2","title":"four feathers on DVD","review":"Film Buffs look to your neighbors across the Pond.

Generally, I like anthologies, but this book is a collection of hit-and-miss. Some of the stories are interesting, but many of them do not even have vampires in them, or are just so poorly written that they are hard to read (such as the last story in this collection, which is nonsensical and disjointed) Some of the stories are about psychic vampires - feeding off emotion, or sound, or whatever, but this was a plodding book to get through.

Aside from some rough language here and there, there is almost no erotica in this collection. This is a collection of horror stories, period. And the stories are quite dull at that. The only ones I liked were \\"In this Soul of a Woman,\\" by Charles de Lint; \\"The Alchemy of the Throat,\\" by Brian Hodge; and \\"Caf�� Endless: Spring Rain,\\" by Nancy Holder.

I knew in advance that it had its limitations - just about anything will clog it and cause it to stop working. However, the motor on ours quit working shortly after we began using it. I called the company and to their credit, they mailed me a new motor. I thought to myself during that call that they seemed to really grasp the issue - almost like it was a recurring problem. Anyway, the second motor also stopped working shortly after installation. The company's warranty policy seems to be something like \\"you mail it in at your expense and we will look at it.\\" No refunds. I've already sunk enough time and money into this product. Bottom line, maybe we got a dud - twice - but the product is junk, in my opinion.

I got it for one pretty specialized purpose, to reduce the volumn or more precisely the bulk of oak leaves for disposal, not to make mulch. For this purpose I have found it to be easy to use, fast and effective. I use a large scoop shovel and can shread shovel fulls as fast as I can put them in using the \\"coarse\\" setting. I estimate I get about a 5 to 1 volumn reduction. The unit is designed to set on top of a trash barrel (I use a 42 gallon barrel) and this is a very efficient system. The trimmer nylon line needs to be changed fairly often but it is simple and quick to do. I do recommend a dust mask, eye protection and hearing protection as the dust and noise can be fairly intense. As far as longevity goes since I just started using it I am not sure but the unit is pretty lightweight not super heavy duty.

The motor is also not sealed or dust proof - which would make more sense on something like this that is a dust, particle producing machine.Needless to say - I hate this thing! I have hundreds of bags of leaves to mulch and I get through about 20 dry bags of maple leaves and the motor burns out on me? This is crazy! You would think they would lose money selling these crappy motors, but apparently there are enough people who buy them and keep them with dead motors or something.At least I bought from Amazon and I can keep getting replacements or my money back.

The product was not easy to assemble, and appears to be cheaply made. While it eventually does what it claims to do (shred leaves), it is slow and tedious.

I would have gotten a better price value for my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Top feeder part doesn't stay together. Bad design","review":"Total design disaster. I had no problem putting the legs on this thing, but the top circular piece refuses to stay together and in place. I spend more time repairing it(with ducktape)than I do mulching leaves. Perhaps at $53 it's a deal, but not when you pay full price (as I did). Also, be aware that getting twice as many leaves into a bag makes it very heavy and lifting the bag afterwards is difficult."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flowtron review","review":"I purchased in order to reduce amount of leaves and time to bag. This product can only handle a few leaves at a time. It is very labor intensive and takes too much time to load. You have to stop and un-clog the leaves if you put in too much.

For now I've been only shredding paper (newspapers & magazines) and have been quite pleased with the results. I started rather tentatively, but soon grew confident in its ability to handle heavier grades of paper (definately not cardboard!).

Yes, it doesn't work well when sticks get mixed in. But the string is easy to replace (cut from a large spool).I'm a 5'1\\" female, so putting it on a trash can isn't a good option. Also, the can would fill up too fast. So, I have very good success putting the shredder in the middle of a large hard plastic kiddie pool. It will hold enough leaves to fill 4 33 gallon bags, about 15-20 minutes of shredding. And the slick bottom means it's real easy to drag around the yard.

I contacted Flowtron twice by Email about this problem and received no reply. This indicates they don't have an answer, don't care, this is OK as they sell more shredder line this way or all of the above.

The user should take care to avoid feeding twigs and small branches - often gathered up with the leaves - into the hopper. The easiest way to do that is to drop the leaves in manually and slowly - not one-by-one, of course, but in bunches of as many leaves as you can comfortably grab with both hands. This will enable you to feel and remove any twigs. While this might seem time-consuming, it results in longer life for the plastic shredder cord, no jams, and better shredding. At the end of the day, careful feeding probably saves time. Since we use a lot of shredded leaves as mulch, as an ingredient in mixing up transplanting soil, and as the carbon addition to our compost, we have found it a highly useful tool."},{"rating":"1","title":"leaf mulcher","review":"I have a half acre of leaves to mulch in a forested area at my cabin.

The strings do break if large sticks get in, but are easy to replace and available at any hardware store. Many twigs will fall right through without damage. You can't dump piles of packed leaves in, just put in moderate amounts of loose leaves slowly and it will handle them. The motor seems strong.

This year, the third year, our motor seemed to burn out, but frankly we were putting leaves through it in very large quantity. If you use a trash can underneath, make sure the buildup does not smother the underside of the motor. It would not be easy to replace the motor/parts, even if you could get them.

I mulched the leaves a second time to reduce the leaves further and I used this to mulch the garden area. Thumbs up on this unit! I figure that it would have taken 50 or more (at 50 cents each) of those large paper recycle bags to contain what I accomplished with 4 garbage cans.

Overall, very pleased with purchase and was delivered about 5-6 days quicker than we had anticipated."},{"rating":"1","title":"rubbish","review":"The first time i used it the plastic twines broke within 5 seconds, this was caused by small twigs being mixed up with the leaves, to be fair ? it does say the product is only to be used for leaves ! BUT when leaves fall you usually get some debris from the branches, if you don't sort this from the leaves then you will have constant problems, the idea was good but unfortunatley the product design is not man enough to do the job. $100 + thrown down the preverbally drain"},{"rating":"1","title":"Low quality for the price","review":"The Flowtron might be a good deal for $50 or $60, but is a rip-off at the advertised price. This flimsy machine is poorly designed, cheaply made and difficult to put together (and I am well experienced at putting things together). We followed instructions and did not overload it, but it continued to shut down every 2-3 minutes which required finding the circuit breaker which is inconveniently located under the motor. The second time we used it, the spinner assembly came undone and was lost somewhere in our pile of newly clipped leaves. That ended that and we had to order new parts. That said, we were happy with the mulch which made a good addition to our compost bin and vegetable beds. However, spend a few extra bucks on a mulcher or mulching mower. The limitations of this machine are not worth the effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flowtron Ultimate Mulcher","review":"I first became aware of the poor quality of the shredder during the assembly. Cheap plastic parts that snapped together poorly, the leg bracing and its intergated adjustment knobs that wouldn't work properly. The product claims to be the ultimate shredder. Within minutes of placing a hand full of dry leaves into the unit it shut down due to an over loaded motor. After locating the circuit breaker, again another poor quality item, the unit would only work when small amounts of leaves were shreded which makes the unit almost useless. I would advise those who are thinking of buying this product to look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mulches well but won't hold up","review":"This device makes great mulch. But the motor did not last one season, in spite of the fact that I was careful not to put in too many leaves at one time and did not put in sticks.

I have been kind of putting off using it because I thought it was going to be a hassel but it turned out to be quite easy to use. I had it set on medium mulch and I only mulched 2 bags but I was pleased with the size of the mulched leaves. I had read that this mulcher was hard to use because it would tip over or come apart but I had no problems at all. I didn't overload it however and I never even had to change the strings, another thing I thought I was going to have a problem with. I love the wide opening on top, easy access for the leaves. I also had thin sticks within my leaves and they even when through the mulcher with no problem. All in all I'm happy and am looking forward to the Fall. I would recommend this product to all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flowtron","review":"Here our land is like a forest around the house. This Flowtron is like advertised. Changing cutting strings easy.So many leaves here I put Flowtron on pick up truck. Using a face mask I recommend. Don't expect that Flowtroncan cut through branches - very small twigs okay.

I've used it to shred apple, red maple, and lilac leaves. I haven't had a problem with minor sticks, and have yet to change the strings. I've placed the unit over a plastic garbage can to build up my compost pile, and have also just left the shreddings where they fall. All in all, it's a useful tool for my fall lawn care."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy something else","review":"If you want to make a small amount of mulch for a small garden plot this thing is fit for that purpose, but it's extremely loud and will take up a lot of room in your shed.

Definitely not useful for yards that are larger than 1/16 of an acre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"Don't trust this company!!! My shredder started malfunctioning right out of the box. Motor kept stopping. Seemed like loose wire, so checked what I could see. Didn't take case apart, to avoid voiding \\"warranty\\". That's where the big problem began. The customer support numbers given do not work. Ended up contacting Chamber of Commerce of manufactors town. They didn't have a phone number, and they told me the address given for Flowtron was now condo's! Transferred me to the Clerk of Court's office, where I finally got a contact number. Contacted the most unpleasant woman I ever dealt with in customer support. Wouldn't honor warranty, but if I was willing to ship the shredder back AT MY OWN COST, they would look at it. Looks like I am stuck with a $150 piece of junk. DON'T TRUST THIS COMPANY!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for pine needles!","review":"Bought the mulcher based on the claim it would also handle pine needles. With several Ponderosa pines we have tons of needles. The unit was a total failure at those. It was impossible to get all other chips out of the mix, but I suspect the cords were probably being torn off from contact with the metal parts in the bottom of the unit.Might work well on wet products, but we used 24 strings and got less than two bags done. Returned for refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flowtron","review":"Really haven't had a lot of usage of this machine. I did use it on wetlawn clippings from my tractor bagger in hopes of making the grass clippings finer. It didn't perform real well.

It mulches well, but the feed rate is too slow. The electric motor should be larger. I bought it because I have to bag leafs, it just takes too long to process. It compress the volume, but does not save any time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flowtron shredder works but weak","review":"It does what it is advertised to do, but I am on my 3rd one in 3-4 years because the motor will soon wear out if you use it year-round as I do. I'd be happy to see a more durable version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Idea; Poor Execution","review":"Purchased the Leaf Mulcher in 2004. Having a small yard, I estimate I ran the machine a maximum of 25 hours. This past winter, it began making an awful racket and refused to run anymore. Upon examination, I found the motor shaft turns in a sleeve bearing. How CHEAP AND JUNKY!!!!!! The sleeve bearing nearest the spinner head had worn considerably, allowing such a wobble as to destroy the motor. I did like shredding the leaves, as they make good mulch for the garden. However, it was a real pain to use. Even the smallest oak twigs could break the line. The funnel never fit together very well. The stand was flimsy and the knobs would not stay tightened. With some improvements, such as high quality motor bearings and the ability to use larger cutting line,Flowtron would have a great product. Unfortunately, after years of people complaining, the company has not seen fit to engineer any improvements into the product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good buy for the price","review":"This is a quite satisfactory light duty shredder. It is not difficult to assemble. I gave it quite a workout, and stalled it a few times, but on the whole it worked quite well on a lot of leaves, mostly maple and oak, and the occasional twig. I recommend using the heaviest allowable string. Because it must be connected to an electrical source, the leaves must be brought to it, something of a problem on a large place such as we have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flowtron Mulcher","review":"After debating whether I should or not, I finally purchased the Flowtron Mulcher this Fall. I have a couple of very large oak tree on my property so needless to say I have plenty of leaves to rake in the Fall. The mulcher worked great - -it's very easy to use (a bit bothersome to put together, I thought) and it handles leaves, wet or dry, pretty well. One thing I did notice is that it doesn't handle tree debris (twigs, etc.) very well. My lawn mower handles small twigs without a problem - - the mulcher does not. This meant I had to make sure I removed those before mulching the leaves. That was the only negative thing about the mulcher. All in all, I'm happy I purchased it. It greatly reduced my yard waste to 1/4 of bags I usually need - - don't tend to use the paper lawn bags because I just require so many that it isn't worth it. This year I was able to use them for all my yard waste."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timing","review":"Lots of trees - lots of leaves - bought leaf shreader. Reasonable. Using the Flowtron Leaf Shreader was easy. It is light weight and can be moved from place to place or over cans and bags without strain. The controls are simple: On/off and adjustments are accessible and may be used without having to second guess a decision to do so. Probably the main issue is that one must be patient when putting the shredder to continuous use, though this is natural given the size of its motor. Working too fast will shut the unit down and require resetting, the control for which is hidden away a bit. One other issue is that the elastic cord intended as a hold for bags underneath cannot be depended upon beyond what are obvious physical limits. (But who wants to press obvious?)The best thing is that it actually cuts leaves down by a considerable proportion. So, looking for leaf mulch and having the time and patience (well, not always the patience), I'm keeping it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good product for home use","review":"I like this product. Assembly was simple and string change is very easy and chops a lot of leaves. If I had a complaint it would be how dirty it is when operating.

The next day my husband tried it and it would only operate for a few seconds and the reset button would again pop out.

In fact, the first time I used it a part came loose and was lost, and it took a couple of weeks for it to be shipped. It's hard to rake leaves without picking up some small twigs, and small twigs cause this machine to hangup. Someone needs to design a machine just like this, but with metal blades.

Sam Shepard, although in a small role, helps a lot.The script is a bit dated and some may be tired of the same old Southern cliches, but all in all, it's a pleasant way to spend a couple of hours.

Instead of being quirky humor characters, they say many interesting things that may make you reflect on your own life in that manner. However, the movie may become uninteresting, with many repetitive/unnessecary scenes in the middle.Compared to, say, Harry Potter this movie is brilliant.

Another overrated \\"classic\\".","review":"For years I heard what a magnificent film THE GRAPES OF WRATH was. Perhaps the build-up was too much, and I expected a masterpiece. It isn't. Fonda and Jane Darwell give good performances, but the film feels wooden and dull most of the time.Fox's presentation also leaves something to be desired. The print is not up to the kind of restoration a film with this reputation would seem to warrant. Further, the extras are pitiful for what is supposed to be a \\"special edition\\". A particularly banal and recycled A&E biography is supposed to be the highlight. The \\"expert\\" commentary is by a film historian who gets his facts wrong. (In discussing Henry Fonda's lost Oscar to James Stewart, he says that Stewart lost the year before to Clark Gable in GWTW, when in fact Stewart lost to Robert Donat). You'd think an authoritative commentator would do his homework!I'm sorry I wasted my money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shameless communist propaganda","review":"I rarely write movie reviews, but I was so appalled by the insidious nature of this film and I felt compelled to write something, albeit brief.This film is a thinly-veiled, trite, shameless communist propaganda piece presented as a folksy yarn about economic hardship in 1930's Depression-era America. Hopefully, now, 70 years later, people no longer fall for such communist nonsense.Propaganda aside, this movie is unrealistic in the extreme, as a poor family makes a 1000-mile-plus journey from Oklahoma to California in an old jalopy truck that looks like it couldn't make a 100-mile trip, let alone a 1000-mile trip."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grapes of Wrath","review":"Did hollywood really believe it could take a John Steinbech novel and turn it into a propaganda tool for socialism? Not quite. Having seen this film forty years ago, my recolection was a family of the dust bowl 1930's coping with the harsh realities of a changing deprssion era time.Small family against big banking; david against goliath. The most graphic and telling sequence is when the evangeliquel government agent appears just as thejoad's truck quits working. The Joad's now have to coast their disabled truck to the lights that turn out to be a US Department of Agriculture \\"sanitary unit #4\\".This film was made at the time, before the second world war and after FDR's welfare state programs.

Since seeing the movie, I can't read the book without hearing his voice when Tom speaks.If you aren't familiar with the story, it's the story of the Joad family. During the Great Depression, these people were forced off their farm in Oklahoma by a combination of dust storms and bankers.

The problem was the DVD. On the back cover of the DVD, they list 10 different special features listed. There are only two special features, and I considered them very boring. The two \\"Special Features\\" you will get is a Steinbeck historian/Depression Era historian giving oral commentary over the film as you watch it (oh....what fun), the second feature is an extremely brief prologue of the movie to the UK (as if people in the UK had never heard of the Great Depression!). The missing features would have been very interesing, as another customer has noted about this DVD.

This is of no consequence now. The Grapes of Wrath and Dead End were the only two movies coming out of the 30's showing the social upevels of the time. This movie has been discussed to death; its John Ford's masterpiece. In my opinion, the rigth way to look at it is that it is an important piece of AMERICANA. The movie deviates some from the novel, showing a more human and optimistic outlook, and rightly so. For comparison, the big band was also a big piece of AMERICANA that started at the same time, a magnificent introduction of a new, optimistic, uniquely American music. This is our heritage, and I am thankful to all the talented people who made this possible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This was an excellent purchase.

I guess my only complaint, if I had to list one in order to justify not giving it five stars, is that it was made in 1940. The actors are good; the story is great. If you like classic movies--like I do--you'll really like this one. It's better than most of the classics I've seen. But I can also sympathize with those people who find that the older movies put them to sleep. If that's the case with you, you probably won't enjoy this one, either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looks good","review":"This film version of the classic Steinbeck novel may seem a bit leaden to modern audiences, with its stylized acting.

First of all, it was listed in the psychedelic section, so obviously we are thinking of something similar to The Wall, or at least as visually stimulating. No. The \\"flashing lights\\" that were supposed to be psychedelic were about as mind-blowing as Christmas lights. I don't want to sound too critical.

They are little pieces of cardboard (with admittedly very good artwork), but they don't function well in place of miniatures, and that is quite literally what they are intended for.The breeze from a nearby shutting door will scatter these flimsy little things. If they had plastic stands, they'd be fine. I even tried hardened chewing gum, but nothing worked.Don't waste your money; instead, just buy the plastic pre-painted mini's (which weren't available when I bought this)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another inferior geological thriller","review":"While not the worst book I ever read, this one comes close. The author, Earl Blinkhorn, does not have a good grasp of grammar, and apparently no editor or even literate friend provided him with any assistance. The very first sentence sets the ungrammatical tone: \\"Loren and Paul were just recounting when their adventure that began those many years ago now.\\" It does not improve. Another large problem is his use of earthquake and volcanism data. He just dumps it into the text instead of integrating it. It is frequently unclear what relationship the geologic factoids are intended to have to the plot. He also needlessly repeats the data dumps. On dialogue he does do a better job than some, notably he handles it better than David Golemon did in <u>Ancients</u>, another geological thriller. The plot itself is ungainly with a supreme naivet�� about government agencies and how they operate."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved it, BUT.....","review":"I loved this book, finished it in 2 days. At each chapter's ending, I found I could not easily put the book down. It was very interesting to see what MOG would come up with for Jane to do next. I do have some issues with the lack of follow up on who/what MOG really was. I did love the twist in the game towards the end, but we never really know how MOG chooses his players. All in all, I greatly enjoyed the book, I just think some more explanations about the Master might have made it a GREAT book."},{"rating":"1","title":"How greedy can you get???/","review":"I have to agree with the other reviewer that said this book and its character Jane were very unlikeable. Does she not have any common sense at all? The things she will do without even thinking about consequences are ridiculous, she is not even concerned by the fact that MOG can get into her house and write on her body when she is asleep...HMMM, can we say 'stupid'? Also rape is used against her and she apparently comes through it with no mental or even physical injury even though the writer of this book portrayed the man as brutal, I find that very upsetting and it downplays a horrible act. I have ususlly enjoyed the books by Layman but I think I wasted my money with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't think... read!","review":"This is a thick book. I finished it in less than a week. Don't do alot of rational thinking while reading this book. Just enjoy a roller coaster ride and let it happen. This book moves fast. Real fast! It's just fun.

I thought, if this book is going to continue like this, I can't read it. However, once Jane got involved in playing the game, it became a matter of overlooking some of the dialogue and actually following the storyline. It was a good story, one which makes you think. Just how far are people willing to go for money? And where do they draw the line? All in all I have to give this book a four rating as I did end up enjoying it. The deeper Jane got into the game, the faster paced the action became, and the harder the book was to put down. I believe I will read other books by this author in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good...","review":"I am a huge fan of Laymon. I think this is one of the better books. Not the best but in my top 10. I thought the idea of this so called scavenger hunt was wonderful. How far will a person go for money? Amazing! I would of quit way before her! I thought the house by the cemetary was a little wicked. Yikes! The overall story was good...I have read better by Laymon but it was worth my time. (someone else in reviews wrote about the ear deal at the hospital...I thought that was weird as well. I had a few questions left unanswered myself!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Closest thing to a rollercoster in print!","review":"Laymon is always a fun read and here he is in top form. As usual there is a deceptively simple premise: A librarian begins playing a game with an unseen person who refers to himself as MOG. She gets increasing amounts of cash for figuring out riddles and going to where the next clue is hidden. But the game gets increasingly sinister and she finds that MOG won't let her stop. Creepy, violent, graphic, twisted, is what you should expect from Laymon, but I for one had a blast playing/reading this book. IN THE DARK is a great horror novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"So great...but the ending sucks","review":"I really liked this book. It went at a breakneck pace--and that's what I'm looking for in my horror. But the ending was such a letdown. It was really rushed and I expected a more detailed explanation about MOG and the purpose of the game. I mean...that's the entire premise of the book, and then to not explain it--it's a big disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was written by a man for men","review":"I agree that Richard Laymon's In the Dark is fast paced, quick read. But the main character needs to be convincing and likable in order for the story to work. I never believed the actions of the primary character, Jane Kerry. Her interest in playing \\"the game\\" was believable ONLY in the first encounter, but her behavior gets more and more unbelievably bizarre. Only a woman who is disconnected from reality would kill dogs, sleep in coffins, and write messages on her own body just to keep her stalker and his cash flowing. By the middle of the book I just kept hoping she would fall in a hole and disappear. But the most annoying aspect of this book was Laymon's use of words that showed him as a product of the 70's...\\"Jane dropped her switchblade knife into the pocket of her culottes.\\" Culottes? Come on now!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Well ..... ?","review":"The idea is good - admitted. But there is the problem of getting it into a novel. All the characters lack credibility, their motivations are not logical. The main character's tasks are ludicrous and the atmosphere is created in a cheap way - a way that the author thinks is traditional for the genre. The plot is improbable - which would be understandable for a horror novel -, but unmotivated and does not have anything to do with the main action. In addition it is a mixture of gore and porn, no I am not prude, but too much is too much. After finishing the novel I asked myself why I read it to the end. It could have been such a nice story. How far does a person go to get rich? There is a lot of power in this question. But in this book it is dealt with in such an absurd way that you do not answer it any more."},{"rating":"2","title":"laymon is king","review":"if you like laymon, get this.

His VERY JUVENILE perception of women and their various body parts makes me worry he is really, truly a sex starved little boy in a mans body. My LORD- what adult thinks the way he does ? Sure, women can be sexy and hot, but he always, in EVERY book I've stumbled through of his, writes as if he is a horny little 14 year old who has NO idea of how women really think or react. I can hardly believe he was married! Or that Dean Koontz was a best friend of his....but dont waste your money on his writing, the story lines on the back always are catching (duh- someone ELSE writes that!) and you will find yourself thinking,,hmm, maybe this sounds like a unique story! But his writing is childish and never, ever do the characters use common sense. Its very disturbing to me that he developed a following of readers!

I have read two of Laymon's books. With the exception of the vampire books, I will read more."},{"rating":"1","title":"First & Last","review":"This was my first & last Laymon novel. The concept is great but his characters ruin the otherwise fast plot. Jane, the protagonist, is a flat character who who is hard to like. Greed is the only thing that drives her. She runs into the situations set up by Mog without a care or worry, even though her life is a risk every time. Then she shows no signs of stress or depression or guilt afterward. She is a charicature of a woman the likes found in Friday the 13th movies: totally unbelievable.I must admit the plot was fast and kept the suspence high, but the ending was a complete let down."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book I've read.","review":"When I started to read the book it was for a book reading contest.

Some characters have two positions. For example, there is Linus standing up and Linus clutching his blanket for dear life.

I expected it to be more character-driven, with people I could like if there was more substance to them. I enjoyed the characters of Stephanie and her daughter from what few characterizations were given, but I still needed more. The people in this book are all ultra-rich which just makes the reader depressed that she/he isn't rich too. It seems like all the characters do in this novel is travel from country to country, which I cannot relate too. They also don't seem to change that much by the end of the book. The plot is boring and corny, with many other subplots popping up (like one of Stephanie's sons having an obsessive ex-girlfriend) that never get anywhere. The author also made it sound like Stephanie's daughter Chloe's father was going to be a big suprise in the end. It wasn't, just another rich guy. It would have been great if Bradford had made him someone who was average. Overall, I didn't like the book. It was too sappy and depth-deprived."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I could give it 0 stars...","review":"This was an absolutely dreadful novel. It should have been rejected by the publishers. The characters are completely inconsistent; their motivations for their behavior are non-existent. It's as though Ms. Bradford started writing, had no earthly idea where the story was going, and just randomly pulled plot elements out of a hat. Why in the WORLD did she decide to turn Stevie's father-in-law into a rapist? What purpose did that serve in the story? And what about Gideon's \\"stalker\\" ex-girlfriend? What was THAT all about? I kept thinking she would be the one to hurt Chloe, but instead we get the deranged ex-husband of a minor character in the book, whom we never knew had an ex-husband in the first place. And that Nigel...who is he--Jekyll and Hyde? I could go on and on and on...Don't even think of bothering to read this book unless you just want an example of what NOT to do if you're considering writing a novel yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't like these people!","review":"This was my first Bradford book, picked up in the airport to shorten the fly time. The description hinted at some mystery and intrigue, where my true reading interests lie, so I took the bait. I was sorely disappointed, and regret spending the $8.00. It's only saving grace is that it is a quick read, although if I hadn't been flying, I don't expect I would have finished it. The characters were extremely shallow and self-involved, with inconsistencies in their actions that I could not overlook. The plot was very disconnected, and the twists it took seemed very arbitrary and unrelated to what had preceded in the story. I thought perhaps I just did not appreciate this author's style -- I'm glad to see my opinion is not unique among others who have submitted their review. Not a book I will recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"A huge disappointment","review":"Ms. Taylor Bradford needs to find a new genre (along with a new photograph for the back cover.

Barbara Taylor Bradford is not a perfect author. But then nobody's perfect, so why would I want perfection from her? But let's go back to the subject: this book is about lost, hate, vingeance, and obviously, love and how we learn from these feelings.The plot itself is not very cool. Barbara has a way of telling the story that sometimes make the reader wonder why he/she is still reading the book. But what's worth with her is exactly this: the up and downs of the book and the good sensation you get after reading her books.Personally, I found this to be one of her best books. After reading it, you don't regret and, to the credit of Barbara - and to her cash also - you want to read another. Then you become a frequent reader of hers without realize it.

On a par with Gone With the Wind.Power of a Woman, in my opinion, was only published because Bradford had previously written a great classic novel. \\"Power\\" is dialog burdened with no character development and details to fill the pages to earn the advance i.e., the clean apron to be murdered in. Since Woman of Substance I have looked forward to a Bradford book, but this was not in keeping ith the quality of her previous work."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT IS THIS???","review":"This is absolutely one of the worst books I've ever read. I can't help wondering what the publisher was thinking about when putting the book to print. And this is an author of a dozen other books?

What a birdbrain product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did Bradford really get paid for this?","review":"Less than halfway through the book, I began to wonder if the author's grandchild had written it.But, no, I said to myself, it would have been more appealing.

I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timeless","review":"Like the reviewer (below) from 1999, I read this in grade school back in the 1960's. A friend recently asked me why I became a writer and reader. I cited this book. Then I ordered a used copy and read it again a week ago. My 15-year-old daughter read it too -- pretty much in one sitting. This is a captivating story. The main character is very resourceful and a tremendous relationship develops between \\"Steve\\" and a coyote on the island. The writing isn't spectacular; it's a little bit of \\"Steve did this and then Steve did that.\\" But the story is an inexorable tug of survival and man versus nature in all forms. Highly recommended for pre-teens and young teens looking for a bit of adventure."},{"rating":"2","title":"wow!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"i thought this was the best book ever and i dont like to read much but i couldnt put this book down the author did a wonderful job. this is sorta like your tipical book about someone who is stranded on an island but then again it is so greatkind boring in the begining but after that its great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not run!!!","review":"It has never run.

After a week or two, there were already visible scratches, just from putting utensils on it and normal use. I only washed them using soap and water and a soft washcloth. It is too bad because I haven't seen any designs as adorable as these. Now, months later, the placemats are all scratched up and really need to be replaced. (I worry about whether any of this ink has been consumed with their meals...) I considered buying new ones and having them laminated, but it seems like too much trouble.

The motor and recipe screen seem fine, but the plastic gears in the blade's base won't budge. This caused one of the plastic gear teeth to break off.

Escobar provides an introductory glimpse at the biblical basis for missions and practical implications.Having been published in 2003, some of the information is starting to show its age. I hope there will be a revision in light of the sixth Lausanne Conference that happened last year in 2011, reflecting more current global missions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Book","review":"The author is well knowledgeable about this topic and adds his own perspective into the writing quite a bit.

You can hold the straps and do wrist curls, or (holding the straps) lift and lower behind your head to strengthen that flab under your arm, and any other work outs you can think of. Only problem is, they tend to slip off the arm due to the size of them. However, if you take some of the sand bags out, you can tighten them more, and they are less likely to slip off. Wearing a wrist band (normal, NOT weighted) underneath them, it also aids in them not slipping off. And yes, they do come with workout instructions. But you can be creative, and make up your own.

I look like I have gorilla feet, even when I remove 3 weights off from each. They look durable and long lasting, but the velcro is almost too strong to be taking it on and off frequently... in fact my thumb's sore from tring to rip the velcro off.I think my husband (160~170 lbs martial arts buff) would be happy to make better use of this, but I might need to order something a bit smaller and formfitting for everyday use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for larger ankles","review":"These weights are heavy.

This book is a revealing look at New Age practices and the dangers involved.

The jacket claims she is on faculty at Denver Seminary and she is certainly deeply invested in her faith but an element in all possession includes the invitation of the phenomenon by the possessed. To try to blame it on someone else who happens to be at odds with her faith is a bit much. Anyone with a scanty knowlege of New Age teachings can't help wonder whether this is just a piece of devotional literature cooked up by a fantasy prone individual.

I especially enjoyed reading about the effect that the distinct personalities of three Brittanys had on the owners. The special attention that these two people gave to their dogs and the pain that they experienced when the first two died is particularly poignant.

Sadly, I was bitterly disappointed. \\"Living with Brittanys\\" is a frustratingly OVER-descriptive, self indulgent short story that actually made me angry in parts because of it's non-relevance to the subject matter.

When I pull my camera out of its little hammock space, the lens gets caught and is pulled out at length.

It is not completely understandable unless you first read the bible as the quran takes many highlights and references from bible parables and passages as basis for its text. The quran has no chronology, and is basically 480 pages of rambling, repetitive love and wrath of God that could be boiled down to 15 pages. When it's not preaching heavenly rewards for believers, and fire and brimstone for non-believers, it's contradictory or inflaming.Don't take my word for it.

Levi capitalizes on earlier research, debunks many of the more fanciful theories about the bard, sorts through the legends (who really wrote the plays; Shakespeare's gay lover; etc.) and provides a balanced, lively, and readable account of the Elizabethan period, life on the stage, and the origins of his writings. The latter is where Levi shines. He examines dozens upon dozens of texts, contemporaneous, ancient, obscure, and well-known to identify the sources of the works. He goes through the plays one by one with pithy comments on sources, themes, and the social and historical context for each. He has a tactile understanding of poetry and what makes Shakespeare great. His is a patient scholarship, respectful but not reverent. The biography is engrossing.

Instead, critics of this book choose to condemn the author as a racist, without even discussing the facts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Doin' the crime without doin' the time","review":"Having heard about Jesse Jackson over the years, whether I wanted to or not, I had some suspicions that he could be a slick character (not unlike our former philanderer in chief).

It is well written, well documented, and sorely needed at a time when the media provide less than the truth. It is also an excellent study of how someone possessing only deceit and greed can rise to the top.

The only way to stop Jackson is with the truth, and this is it. The case is all the more convincing when Timmerman liberally quotes black and liberal activists who repudiate Jackson over and over again.On balance the book contains no surprises for me, just the details and data to prove what I always knew: that Jesse Jackson is a complete fraud. The \\"public\\" Jesse doesn't exist. He is not a man of compassion. He is not looking out for the black man, or the poor. He is looking out for #1.

In fact, I haven't seen the word 'communist' used as a pejoritive this much since leaving college. Maybe I should read the National Review more often.

I the past I've experienced unbelievable ear pain with the pressure changes--fortunately, it seems, that is no longer the case. However, I like the plugs for engine noise blocking. Scoured the airport in Anchorage for the foamy ones--NONEXISTENT. The only ones available were EarPlanes--1 pair/$10.99!!! There was no amount of ear pulling and contorcioning that enabled my getting these things situated. I left them in as best I could and finally had to pull them out because they actually made my outer ear canal hurt. The money would definitely have been better spent elsewhere! And if for some reason you do like these, definitely do not buy them at the Anchorage airport."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didnt work for me!","review":"I get extreme ear pain on planes and nothing used to work. I get it regardless of allergies or colds. I tried sweets, gum, medicines and nothing worked except ear plugs. Plain old ear plugs.. I squish them and pull on the top of my ear to get them in good and I wear them for the first hour until I am we are done ascending. Then when it gets near to going down I put them in again. The trick is to get them in early. Any kind of descent will make my ears hurt immediately. Anyways for my last flight I bought these earplanes thinking they would be even better then earplugs and no way. They didnt work at all. I got pain right away and had to take them out and get my old trusty earplugs. If you are nervous you should wear the plugs throughout the whole flight but if its a long flight then it should be okay to take them out once you are up and level. Hope this helps!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me","review":"I also bought a pair of these and used them on my last trip. While they worked for the most part, they were not as good as the foam ones like the flight attendants give you. Additionally, they are so rigid they don't shape to your ear the way the foam ones do. Thus, they fall out more easily and I don't like putting something in my ear that's been on the floor.

I really wanted this book to focus on her diagnosis and more how she dealt with the fact that she was going to die.

In Knowledge of Angels, she demonstrated her talent in adult fiction as well. A Desert in Bohemia continues the trend of brilliant fiction. Paton Walsh brilliantly blends the historical setting of Eastern Europe behind the Iron curtain with fictionalized elements. Her use of multiple perspectives gives her narrative an epic scope while still creating rich and full individual characters. A Desert in Bohemia is a wonderful introduction to Jill Paton Walsh's work for those who have never encountered her before and a definite must-read for those who are already fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Richard Mallery, it's time to move on.","review":"Barbara Wallwrath makes effective writing and speaking a joy.

But when I realized that it was more than a read-once, in fact a reference book, I ordered the hardback - a terrific exploration of far more than grammar, despite Barbara Wallraff's email moniker at The Atlantic - our language, how it is changing and how we use or abuse it, and all said so nicely. It's beside my desk, handy for a quick read or a reference."},{"rating":"2","title":"Word Court is great!","review":"I bought Word Court several months ago, and now I'm not sure how I got along before I had it. It's true that this book doesn't give you radically different advice from other usage guides, but as Barbara Wallraff explains, it can be hard to know whether the usage notes in a decade-old dictionary or manual still apply or whether standards have changed. The real point of a book like this is, what kind of use of words seems contemporary, intelligent, and tasteful -- neither too stuffy and old-fashioned or too trendy and self-consciously cool. If you care about that, you'll probably end up feeling the way I do: Word Court is great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Entertaning, but not terribly helpful","review":"I bought this book with high expectations after having hearing the author on National Public Radio. I thought that it would highlight the degredation of the English language; I hoped that it would help me hone my use of English.However, the book did not do this for me. Perhaps I was wrong in expecting it to. In fact, however, it didn't do ANYthing for me but raise new hackles. Instead of providing any kind of guidance as to \\"more accepted\\" and \\"less accepted\\" uses of English words and phrases, it left me hanging. The book has an annoying tendency to present letters from people who make various observations, only to couple with the author's brilliant commentary which, distilled to its core point, tends to be \\"Hmmm. Interesting point.\\"I guess I'm just the kind of person who prefers not just to raise questions, but to have some attempt at answering them. This book doesn't make those attempts to answer."},{"rating":"2","title":"when words really count","review":"i have enjoyed barbara wallraff's column in the Atlantic for many years. what a joy to have all that helpful witty advice under one \\"roof\\". in addition, their is much more in this lode stone, than has appeared in the Column which only adds to the experience. buy it for yourself and for all those you love who still believe that speaking and writing \\"properly\\" can be fun!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't stay in your ear!","review":"Horrible design!

I don't think my ears are particularly small, as I used and loved JABRA's earbud with the medium sized gel. I am certain nodoby's ears are perfectly round like the speaker end of this unit.

It's a camera you can get into to explore your imagination and photography to it's fullest.Pros: 5MP, 8Xoptical zoom, point and shot, aperture priority, shutter priority. Plus you can add on lens, filters, and external flash.Cons: Buy an extra battery or 2, batteries last 90 minutes of continuous use.

The autofocus doesn't work correctly in anything but bright sunlight. If you're shooting inside under slightly darker than normal conditions, the autofocus just hunts.

In other words, for a fast moving scene, it is almost impossible. Another major draw back is a flare across the view finder.

The optical quality is superb, the zoom is excellent, and the function is fairly intuitive. It is compact and cleanly designed. I have problems in three areas however. As others have noted, the autofocus is annoyingly slow. Also, you cannot raise the flash manually when you know you will need it. Instead, you must depress the shutter button, which results in an unintended flash photo occuring half the time. Lastly, the close focus limit is rather distant making macro photos impossible.

This watch while heavy is very comfortable. Much more so than my Rolex Submariner so I now wear it every day.Pros: Comfortable, and a good every day watch. The dual time is great for traveling.Cons: Display is hard to read in mid to low light without the light. The analog and digital times are not syncronized."},{"rating":"2","title":"Choose another one","review":"This watch is really good. But, it has one big deficiency, the analog watch and the digital watches are not synchronized. In detail, the analog watch is getting earlier every day. I think if I do not synchronize them once a week, after a year, analog watch will catch the digital one. So, which one I should follow? Analog or digital one, which one is the correct one?The other things are great.

I thought this would be a sturdy, inexpensive addition to my collection, but I'm returning it. It's practically impossible to read in any lighting condition. There is no easy way to cycle through and display different city times. Also, the most ridiculous feature is that daylight savings time correction is applied to all time zones at once including UTC! Hence, making the watch's worldtime feature inaccurate half of the year. Pulsar has the potential for a good watch, but until the digital programming and lighting is fixed - don't buy this model!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pulsar Men's Tech Gear Flight Computer Watch #PM7001","review":"Sent it back.

Don't you think?I'm a member of a music club and in a misguided attempt to live dangerously, I decided to order a cd from an artist I knew absolutely nothing about. From the cover, I thought I was ordering a cd from a woman. I received the cd, looked in the sleeve and much to my horror, saw this hippie looking dude with long stringy hair. If that wasn't bad enough, I listen to the cd and realize I do know who he is. He's the dork in that music video who was riding his bike in the busy city streets of NYC where even Russell Simmons was kind enough to make a cameo appearance.The music isn't bad, just forgettable. I listened to it twice and had absolutely no desire to listen to it ever again. At least with other music that has to grow on you, it gives you some inkling of promise that forces you to return. Not this though.Bottom line: Mediocre music from a guy who needs a haircut. I recommend Justified instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"I absolutely love this album","review":"I think Thicke is a musical genius. He is so talented and it shows in ever way in this album. He is just brilliant. I asked for the album this Christmas because I had liked the single \\"When I get you alone\\" I was so happy I asked for it because I think it is one of the best albums I have. I love every song. I just wish that Thicke would get the acknowledgement he deserves. He is so good but no one really knows him. If you like Jim Hendrix, Lenny Kravitz, The Beatles or are just an open minded person for music you should get this album. This album is for people that really appreciate music. Thicke is the really deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another underrated artist","review":"I'm having a MAJOR problem with *a certain record company* that has signed some MAJOR singing/songwriting talents and then do nothing to promote them. Case in point: Robin Thicke, an awesome songwriter with an awesome voice. You should check out Jordan Knight's debut album, which Thicke co-wrote and co-produced(including the hit \\"Give it to You\\"). Another underrated artist that *afore-unmentioned record company* simply couldn't classify or market properly. I must admit that the songs he wrote for Knight are better than those on Cherry Blues Skies a/k/a Beautiful World (I might be prejudiced since JK is my favorite male snger): great arrangements, great lyrics. That sort of makes Thicke's debut disappointing, because I know what he's capable of. You simply have not seen the best of Thicke yet. This guy is going places (with the right hook-up of course...)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A lil somethin for everyone","review":"Once you get pass the shock that Thicke's father is the dad off of Growing Pains, you can really begin to enjoy his music. The range he shows in his music is impressive. For most of the public, they would like to place a label on his music. Is it R&B, POP, or Alternative? It's just music, man. The biggest problem that Thicke has is his label. With little airplay, and postpone release dates, I hope he can at least make gold. later."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Major Disappointment","review":"I was disappointed with this album and that was probably because I listened to Evolution first.

Can you spell Vanilla Ice? Where was Dre when he was needed? If he has any sense, Robin Thicke will buy up every copy he can find and make sure they are destroyed quick, fast, and in a hurry. I bought the cd based upon other reviews, listened to 8 bars of each song and tossed it in the trash. Buy the real music he puts out on the Evolution of Robin Thicke and give \\"A Beautiful World\\" to folks you can't stand. I can't think of a more appropriate gift."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just buy the single & save money!","review":"Save yourself some money and just buy the single of \\"When I get You Alone\\" if you were thinking of buying this cd.I think the lyrics to all the rest of the songs are boring, unimaginative and the music is not very catchy either."},{"rating":"1","title":"As flavorless as cottage cheese","review":"This CD sounds like pop culture collapsing in on itself. There is no orginality or individulaity. It is more like a maticulous prediction to what would seem to sell. The regurgitation of Mozart in what hopefully will be this albums only single, When I Get You Alone, is played out and pathetic. The rest of the album is as worn and tired as a spring jacket in summer.

On the first listen it was like, \\"What the ...\\", but after I took another listen I started to grow on me like a fungus. Though he sounds alot like Timberlake vocally, he has a different feel to his album. Thicke's album cannot be put into a solid genre because it transcends most, which is what i like the most. If you want some good music that is obviously missing from today's radio, this is it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love, Peace and SOUL","review":"This is a very funky album, but I mean that in the best way. Thicke has mad talent, and his influences are very diverse- funk, Latin, folk, rock and R&B. All of the tracks are very listenable, but be sure to listen to the funky 'Suga Mama', soulful 'Stupid Things' and catchy 'Brand New Jones.'All of the songs are good, and Thicke has mad talent. The only one I didn't like was 'Flowers in Bloom'- good music, but a little too folksy for my taste. That being said, of the folksy songs the best one was 'Make a Baby'. It's silly and sweet. The lyrics to all of Thicke's songs are original and interesting, and everyone can relate to the songs. If you like Musiq Soulchild, Nikka Costa, Stevie Wonder or the Beatles, you'll enjoy Thicke."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whoa! not the good kind of \\"whoa\\"","review":"I would recommend finding \\"other\\" sources to listen to this album rather than buying it.

Sounds sooooo sexy when he does. More of the high notes were done on his 2nd album. This album is a \\"pass\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Thicke Never Thin","review":"This album is solid from beginning to end. I have been waiting for it to drop for quite some time now. The release date was pushed back many times and the name of the album was changed. It was worth the wait. Lyrics are more clever than in depth. Great delivery.

I am very glad I still own the original laserdisc of this film when it was titled \\"Zentropa\\" as it has English subtitles.

It tells the story of the first Black paratroop squadron, which served in WWII. As was similar in many of the early US military/minority encounters, these men were trained to fight but then given kitchen duty. Eventually they were given a chance with the 82nd Airborne and went on to have many successful missions.I found the book to be inspiring and humbling.

He appeared to be very talented and his video represented what I thought were excerpts from his DVD series. They were not. The DVD series is a very poor representation of Maman's abilities and I think his teaching skills. The information was sub standard at best. He is a very knowledgeable instructor and had the opportunity to truly represent these skills. In this DVD series he did neither. I am uncertain if this is the classic \\"marketing scheme\\" of showing \\"sort of\\" Krav Maga or IDF techniques, all the while knowingly giving very convoluted information and not staying true to really putting the information out there. \\"Krav Maga\\" is the new buzz word and it appears that this is a money maker and not a true representation of the system. Krav Maga is a very effective and well thought out program. These DVD's do not show how good the system or how effective the IDF and Israeli methods are.

I have all of his recordings. This recording is described in detail as 2 sets from the Cambridge folk festival in 1981.Most of the tunes will be familiar. What i miss is the stage chatter-there is some, but not much. This adds insight into the performer, flavor, humor, and intimacy to these type of recordings. Theres not much here (compared to Real Live John Sebastian, for example).I also will mention that the recordings have a 'one trick pony' aspect to the sound-ie John on acoustic or electric-solo. Its a bit lack luster. One reviewer mentioned the technical quality of the BBC live recording as below par. I didn't find this detrimental, but, I did find the performance a bit plain due to the lack of other instruments. I urge anyone to listen before they buy to see if its your cup of tea. Im sure Ill not be listening to this frequently or repeatedly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great DBA reference","review":"What a great reference for DBAs who need to support SQL Server.

To my surprise, the movie was completely opposite of what I expected. The beginning was boring and slow. The characters were great, but the story just wasn't. The relationship between Dil and \\"Jimmy\\" is so confusing, I don't understand how they could possibly *love* one another. Also, how could \\"Jimmy\\" not notice that Dil was not a man? The facial features were so obvious. I wouldn't waste your time on this movie. Just listen to Boy George's ballad \\"The Crying Game\\".

I kept hanging on, hoping that it finally improve and live up to the hype that I'd heard about it, but I was utterly disappointed (no pun intended). I agree with the viewer that asked who could possibly not see the big \\"surprise\\" coming; it was painfully obvious.

That is the only drawnback. I love the performances the best, which are classic cinema to me. It's actually quite difficult to pinpoint the brilliances of each actor since they all trumped eachother with moments of brilliance in their performances. I of course love Jaye Davidson's character, I related to alot of her pain, and emotion. Miranda Richarson was the most intense and passionate and agruably maybe the best performance if I had to choose. Her character is so venomnous I want to bash her face in at some points during the movie. I always knew Forest Whitacker would go on to do more great things. Any actor that drools and spits out his mouth in almost every role is worthy of AN OSCAR!!!!!! He deserves the praise and the reward. Glad he won the oscar for \\"Last King Of Scotland\\".

It is now less than an hour after the movie ended and I still have not been able to shake the incredible depression I felt when it was over. There are those who claim the movie was about the power of love to conquer all but I simply didn't see that anywhere in this film. All I saw was two miserable, lonely people who had nothing in common attempting to form a bond that was doomed from the beginning. Dil's desperate neediness was heartbreaking to see. I felt she manipulated and took advantage of the kindness and good heart of Fergus at every turn. I was terribly disappointed with this film and cannot recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Would-Be Theatrical Triumph","review":"When I watched this movie at the time it was released in theaters, I did not like it. Then I watched it on HBO last year, and it was OK, but still not very good. The soundtack is good, even if not very original. My problem is that without Dil's shocking nude scene and sexual innuendo throughout this movie, the whole thing would have been completely bland and ordinary. Why should you care about the characters in this film? Because most of them are violent and dangerous people and some of them are of ambiguous [...]? And the worn-our scorpion tale told from prison at the end of this movie? I am sorry, but this movie plays on its shock value, and that's where it exhausts itself.I felt that the Irish issues was merely used as a backdrop here, some would say abused, for the purpose of making some statement based on an obscene scene. The acting was good. And I have a lot of respect for Miranda Richardson, but the cast cannot save this would-be tale about the power of love."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS FILM IS ABSALOUTE S****!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"THE worst film ever made about the Northern conflict.Richardson's Belfast accent is an absaloute joke.Some twist,I had to get my da to point it out to me.Watch IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER.It's better by far."},{"rating":"1","title":"give me a break!!","review":"this film is terrible!! i don't get why people keep saying it is a good film. i was excited when i got the chance to see it,especially because of all that Oscar nominations and a wonderfull cast.The begginning is exciting and i was really enjoying, but after the character of Stephen Rea meets \\"jill\\" it becomes boring,stupid and confusing.I don't get why all this crtical acclaim."},{"rating":"1","title":"dvd is annoying","review":"This DVD starts with a super noisey sound effect's demo.

Jaye Davidson had never acted before but done an outstanding performance. Stephen Rea and Miranda Richardson and the whole crew were absolutely great! This is a must see movie and the collector's edition is a must own. It has an alternative ending, trailors, the making of the movie, which I am very glad I got to see. This movie has alot to offer the audience, Kidnapping of a soldier and cleverly befriending one of his captors to do something for him if he is killed. The picure takes on alot of twist and turns that makes this movie one of the best pictures of its time. I highly recommend the collector's edition.

Consequently I was not able to tighten it very tight.I am afraid that the product will slip on the door knob and that someone in the bathroom could be trapped in there. I left the wrench in the bathroom but I don't know if I could talk someone through using it from the outside of the door.

A dark haired woman moves to a small town in MN. She finds herself irresistably drawn to the chief of police. They try not to get involved but, of course, they end up in bed. There is a jealous colleague and rumors abound in the small town. Blah blah blah...too much of the same in each book.I picked up Ashes to Ashes, Still Waters, Night Sins and Guilty as Sin at a used bookstore. I'm from Mpls. and enjoy if when there are references to a place I know. I read Ashes to Ashes first and enjoyed it. Still Waters was okay. I'm going to read Guilty as Sin because I have it, not because I really care about the characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"I could not put it down!","review":"This was my first Tami Hoag book given to me by a friend and I put off reading it as I'm not much of a mystery reader. I ran out of books to read so picked it up and now I'm hooked on Tami Hoag! I read in one day and then read Guilty As Sin. Thoroughly enjoyed both and plan to buy all her books.

Thanks, Tami Hoag, and keep on writing such good novels!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Long romance","review":"As far as plot movement is concerned, the 650 pages contain within them a 150-page story. The rest consists of enough filler to make Charles Dickens blush-- too bad Hoag is no Dickens. Be prepared to slog through 1200 pages, because the mystery herein is not revealed until at least the end of the sequel, Guilty As Sin-- but then again if mystery is what you are looking for you can stop reading now.This is a really a rather repetitive, unrealistic romance. I've read (or, to be more clear, skimmed) several Hoag books and the formula she hashes out in work over work: Tough career woman gets beat down, realizes her dreams of career were hollow, turns crying to her alpha male and accepts role as happy housewife.650 pages. Yawn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"This is my first and definately last Tami Hoag book. Most of the characters were annoying and vulgar and should use have their mouths washed out with soap. The identity of the villain was predictable and the final fate of the kidnapped child seemed rather unlikely. If you are looking for a cheap Harlequin type novel disguised as a thriller, this book is for you. If you want a better quality book, I'd advise you to save your money and skip this book. If I could give this book less than 1 star I would."},{"rating":"2","title":"From one Minnesotan to another - great job Tami!","review":"This was my first Tami Hoag novel and was quite surprised she is from Minnesota as well as I. So this made the reading more interesting because I could relate to the way the story played out in a Minnesota winter (loved the time and temp readings at the beginning of each section). It's also fun to pick out names of local places and references to the Twin Cities. I felt the story itself moved well, but it did drag in a few places. I came to like and respect Megan O'Malley and Mitch Holt for who they were and who they wanted to become. I specially liked the catfights between Megan and the reporter Paige.I don't necessarily consider this story a thriller , but more of a mystery drama. I would like to read the sequel Guilty As Sin as well as other Hoag novels to gain more of a feel for Tami Hoag's writing. So far it works and I suggest you read this book on a hot summer day!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing and cliche-ridden suspense novel","review":"This is a book that started out promising to be an interesting read, but quickly degenerated into one of those \\"I know I'm wasting my time, but maybe something interesting will happen in the next chapter\\" books. I was especially disappointed in the ending, where the conclusion became a promo for Hoag's sequel novel. I'll pass on the sequel. The characters were cliches of characters from bad TV series: The tough but tender-hearted cop with a secret in his past, the tough but vulnerable female cop who falls for the tough but tender-hearted cop, etc. Hoag tries to spice it up with some mild sex scenes, but in the end you wonder what these two cops see in each other -- with as many hang-ups and pieces of emotional baggage they're carrying, it's a wonder they're able to function"},{"rating":"1","title":"Caricatures rather than characters","review":"If you like your characters stereotyped - the downtrodden, ground-breaking female detective with parental and trust issues; the strong, grieving chief of police; the narcissistic sheriff; the interfering media; and of course desperate parents and obvious bad guys - this is the book for you. Top it off with an ending that requires reading a sequel, and you have the makings of frustrating read, very similar to the sexual tension she attempts to build between the protagonists.Sure Hoag writes well but that does not compensate for characters you get sick of in a place you don't care about orbiting around unresolved \\"mystery.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Tami Hoag is a skilled author who typically crafts well-written and exciting stories that totally grab my attention and keep right up until the final page. Unfortunately, in Night Sins, she fell far short of her mark.The book starts out with a prologue that sets the scene for a thrilling suspense novel. That thrilling suspsense novel never materializes. The plot is okay, the characters are okay, the twists and turns are not unexpected...the entire book never moves past the okay mark until you reach the ending. The ending is nothing short of lazy. It feels very much as if this author grew bored with her own story and decided to wrap it up as quickly as possible so she could move on to other things. My question is, if the author grew bored with her story, why does she think it's acceptable to sell it to her readers?Do yourself a favor and skip this one. It's not worth the time it took to be disappointed by this author's failure with this particular story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible writing....","review":"I had read a couple other books by Tami Hoag before I read Night Sins - Prior Bad Acts and Kill the Messenger. I enjoyed both; they were well written with everything I would expect in a good mystery/suspense novel. Wow - what in the world happened here??? This book is so poorly written, with incredibly redundant diolog, and adult characters whose emotional behavior is equivalent to teenagers, or even worse, preteens. The ONLY reason I kept reading the book was to find out whether they find Josh or not. To tell you how bad it was, I was able to read the first few words of a paragraph and completely get the drift...everything else was just \\"filler words\\" after that, stating the same facts or thoughts over and over again. Ive read a lot of novels and I have to say, this is some of the worst writing I have ever run into. I don't know what happened to Ms. Hoag here, butI would not recommend that you bother with this book!

In comes Amazon.com with a recomendation of Night Sins -- Yes what a great discovery. Not only have I discovered a fabulous book but a great mystery writer as well. Tthis book grabs you up front and twists and turns its way into an ending that leaves you wanting more. It deals with the difficult subject of Child molestation without weaving you through stuff too uncomfortable to read. The characters are intense and portrayed in a way you either love em or hate em.

How else to explain the fact that the sex scenes in this book (and there are WAY too many of them) are incredibly overdone?Add points for the thriller and mystery aspect of this book (which Ms. Hoag does extremely well), but deduct points for the ending - which leaves you wondering exactly what happened to Josh - did he just walk away? Was there an accomplice? And what's the diagnosis on him after he comes home?There are just too many unanswered questions at the end of this book, and the romantic scenes are just too unreal.

Last reader would have been kinder to have placed the novel in the garbage. Page after page of stereotypical characters, sexist idiocy, and pointless page filler. I have never read Tami Hoag before so maybe this is not typical of her writing style. I will have to try another of her novels to see if her name is the reason this made it onto any best seller list.

You could read the first 50 pages and the last 50 pages and not have missed anything but confusing sex and a dragged on plot line.

There was a little suspense in there but not enough to get more then two stars from me.First of all all the love scenes with O'Malley and Mitch were just awkward and creepy in light of the kidnapping case.

I have not finished it however, because I actually groaned out loud at the \\"female heroine who is investigating the crime who gets involved with the man who is bad for her\\" theme. It is exactly the same in these 3 books. Maybe I can tolerate finishing it after a few months when I forget how much this book is like the other ones. Other than that problem, I have found her books to be most enjoyable.

It should be thrown ... with great force. I bought this book while on vacation, just looking for a little mindless escape. I had just finished reading the latest from Jeffrey Deaver, so I was in the mood for another good mystery. This one isn't. The characters are cardboard, the romance is corny and contrived, and the plot - such as it is - just plods on. I kept thinking that it would get better if I just kept going a little bit further, but found myself skipping whole paragraphs until I finally gave up after 116 pages.

I will buy the second book just to see if my conclusions are correct or if the author succeded in finding a way to twist the plot"},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable and insipid","review":"This isn't a thriller, not a police procedural--more a meshing of Ed McBain and a romance novel. The story is contrived- the \\"villian\\" is revealed far too late, and with no fleshing out of his character. The notion that Megan would hop in the sack a few days after hitting town is moronic, and the sex scenes read as if they were written by a nun.Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Moderate Thriller that really costs double what you see on","review":"This was a passable mystery, not great but a decent beach read, until you get to the lack of an ending. At that point you realize that what you have bought is actually the first half of a sequel and that what was an acceptable ...540 page book isn't worth the time or money at ...1000 pages.

A good way to make people buy more books is to leave you hanging for a sequal. This book makes you see how things often work in real life. A lot of times, there aren't all the answers. Sometimes, you never find out what really happened and you never know how someone could do such a monstrous thing.The book made me really feel the pain that many of the characters felt. The mother's emotional as well as Megan's physical pain. That's what makes this a good read.

Instead of clinical information, the book focuses on feelings associated with growing up, and does so with a total lack of sentimentality that kids will appreciate.

They stupidly went with a company other than Jim Henson Productions.Splinter looks like he's been smokin some of that good stuff!! A lot of the plot elements suck as well.Lets take the scene where Mike rescues Yoshi from the burning house. Wouln't you think they would have bonded after that. Instead he bonded with Ralf.

The story starts with the Turtles down in their new subway lair (discovered in II) just hanging out now that Shredder is dead and buried. April stops by with an ancient Japanese device she picked up for Splinter at a garage sale. The device turns \\"on\\" and transports April to feudal Japan, a young Japanese prince taking her place. The Turtles spring into action and travel back in time to save their friend. Of course complications ensue and the Turtles find themselves in the middle of a revolution of sorts between the prince's father and the prince's rebel girlfriend. The great part of the film is that the Turtles must decide if they want to stay in the past, where they are accepted and revered, or return to the present and remain outcasts.And perhaps the best part of the film: No Vanilla Ice!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"TMNT forever!","review":"Arguably not the best of the series, TMNT III does have its charms. Even though it did not contain my favorite turtle villian, the Shredder, it still was an entertaining plot that offered the same things as the first two films.

It's not the best ending to a trilogy, but hey it's better than not having a third film at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Listed online as a DVD, but it was a VHS","review":"I was very unsatisfied with this purchase.

But THIS, what is THIS?!? The costumes look like something you'd buy in a halloween store (esp. Splinter). And SPlinter's new voice, ridiculous. But even worse there is NO PLOT!!! Thats right none at all. The Turtles go back in time to bring April back to the present when she accidently send herself back via some old flea market egg-timer.Even Ninja Turtles: Next Mutation is better!Watch TMNT I or even II, but stay away from this!Now if youll excuse me i have to go read my Eastman & Laird Mirage TMNT books before its too late!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass this one up!","review":"This time April buys some ancient Japanese antique which turns out to be a time septer and she switches places with a Japanese king's son.So the turtles have to go and get her and return within'a 48 hour period.Not all that interesting,event tamer than part 2.The best thing about this is Casey Jones,and the 4 Japanese guys, who switch places with the turtles,watching hockey and playing video games at the bar."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as its predecessors but...","review":"Not as good as the first two, but a worthy buy nonetheless.

While myself and some of my friends argue whether this one(#3) or #2 is the 2nd best TMNT film made, its still in my opinion the worst of the 3. By far in my opinion #1 is definatly the best. No question asked. This deviated from the whole storyline and really had no place. I saw this as more of a kids movie than anything else...whereas I could get into the first two more. I'm rating this pretty low as I think they could have done something a lot better with the third film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as the first two","review":"The turtles are at it again for the third time, but this movie isn't nearly as good as the first two, one of the reasons why is that Splinter's voice was awful, it seems to be that he was shaking and his voice was a little upbeat, also there are no foot soldiers or the Shredder, just a bunch of Japanese villians, and the idea of going back in time wasn't that great either, fortunatly we do get to see Casey Jones back even though he had only a minor role and Corey Feldman returns as the voice of Donatello (he didn't do the second one due to rehab for heroin addiction).Paige Turco returns as April O' Neal.The only reason why I give this movie 2 stars instead of 1 cause it has Casey Jones in it but other than that, it's just not a great movie, only recommended for only the diehard turtle fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Update.

The history of the backroom meetings as the upper-tier pilots tried to get Goering to allow them to use jets as fighters rather than bombers (as Hitler wanted) is enlightening.

Roebling had the great idea of building a bridge not with stiff beams, but with two big soft ropes made of fibers of strong and elastic steel. An idea, which now is used with nearly all Bridges of wide span. I love this book, because it is not an engineering report, but the touching story of the life of mainly the elder Roebling brother, who dedicated his health and his life to this bridge.I could read this book nearly 40 years ago, and still it is one of my favorites. I do not posess it, and I deeply regret that it is not available any more.

Perhaps they were viewing the earlier release (which still seems to be offered on Amazon).As for the movie itself, yes it develops slowly but every minute is enjoyable. And there is a climacticbattle for those who demand action.

Based on some actual events in early 17th century Japan, it tells one of the most well-known stories in Japanese History. Inspired by the movie, I have visited the graves of the 47 Ronin at the Sengakuji Temple in Tokyo (right beside Sengakuji station on the Tokyo Subway System). The final encounter when the ronin lead by Oishi go in over the wall in the snow may be the most riveting in all world cinema. As a teacher and student of Japanese History, I am thrilled that the movie is now available on video. I will be teaching an entire course on traditional Japan around the video. Many thanks to those who made this movie available on video whoever and wherever you may be!

I don't mind it being so incredibly slow-moving, I should probably clarify -- in fact, that's a part of what I enjoy about it. I admire movies that take their time. The problem here, is that due to extremely horrendous subtitling, the movie is almost impossible to follow. I have only seen it through once, I can only hope it becomes clearer with repeated viewings. In any case, as long as you get the jist of what's happening, and you are predisposed fondly to old Japanese cinema, there is plenty here to enjoy and enrich -- just be warned, the subtitles are annoying and unclear, and leave you guessing as to exactly what's going on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Technical quality unacceptable","review":"The technical quality of this DVD is dreadful.

You'd think for the price Image Entertainment would do better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great historical fiction","review":"As always this came very quickly. I first saw this movie in 1979 as a college student. I was a member of an international movie club and had lived in Japan for two years and speak the language.

This is about a lord who was forced into committing Sepicou (ritual suicide) by another lord.Masterless Samurai are called Ronin. They could have hired themselves out to other lords but preferred poverty until they could take revenge against the evil lord, then they all committed suicide, too venerate their dead master."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yucky","review":"This book wasn't as good as I thought it would be...

Read as historical documents, these select homilies reveal the central preoccupations of his intellectual life, including his high sacramental theology and ecclesiology. But these works are also marked by the acute pastoral sense that made him beloved in his own day, and by his passionate desire that even the simplest of believers understand and embrace the life of Christian holiness. A substantial introductory essay by Maria Poggi Johnson sets his sermons in the context of Victorian religion, outlines the main themes of his thought, and suggests ways in which his homilies are relevant to contemporary Christians and students of religion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kiss My Face soaps are awesome","review":"If you have small hands, try the 4 oz size (assuming you'll be using it in the shower). The 8 oz size is difficult to hold onto. It is great soap though and leaves one feeling ultra clean. It takes some getting used to because it doesn't lather like the chemical-laden soap and beauty bars, but it's better for the environment and leaves you feeling squeeky clean."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good stuff...","review":"I wasn't sure what I would think about this organic soap, it looked very strange when I took it out of the package. It is the strangest color or brown and very little smell. I have used this soap several times since I purchased it and it makes my skin very squeeky clean. I bought it because I thought I was having reactions to everything else and I thought the Aloe would be soothing and moisturizing, which I think it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good and economical","review":"I've been using it for a while and it does the job. I like it because it's free from a lot of potentially harmful chemical additives and it's easy on my skin which tends to get dry easily in the winter months.

Instead, when I lathered it up, it smelled like tar. I kid you not, it stinks.

I have to say that I often wondered if the mildew did not get worse after I started using this product. Another peculiar happening was that it caused calcium to extrude from spots on my grout. I thought perhaps they were locations where the sealer was thin and there was an interaction. I'm not sure but it started after I started using the Scrubbing Bubbles product.It is a great fantasy to have something cleaning my shower but I found I had to hand scrub it harder occasionally to keep the lime & mildew at bay.

I actually feel like I forgot something everytime I go to the bathroom and forget to push the button and close the shower doors.The bad part: The refills are expensive. Compared to same sized bottles of Tilex or Shower Fresh, they are about 50% to 75% more expensive. They are actually more expensive than any other bottles at the cleaning isle of the two supermarkets I go to!

I was excited to try this since I had been eyeing it at the store. I don't know if I was sent a defective unit or if this is the standard for the product but it wouldn't work when it was initially set up. Took the batteries in and out several times and finally got it to work. Sadly it only worked 5 times before breaking again. The only way to get it to work is to take the batteries out and put them in again and it will then run ONCE. Too much of a pain after each shower.

So needless to say I had high hopes for this product.Well, to start with my shower was not exactly sparkling clean but not very dirty either...this product did NOT clean the shower and certainly did not prevent it from getting dirtier. It does not clean the wall on which it hangs, it does not reach above face level, and it does not even reach the far wall of my shower, making it pretty much useless. The refills are ridiculously expensive and the cleaner has a strong, offensive odor when combined with the steam from the shower.

Sure, it cleans the one strip where it sprays, but I still had to wash that part. And yet in their commercial they show all those maids scrubbing the shower!

I have a very small shower stall, and I thought this would work easily due to the shower's size. After the entire first bottle, the only change I saw was for the worse. It not only did nothing to clean my shower, mold or mildew, but it actually made it worse by leaving a white film on the walls and glass that I never had before. I am a very busy person and though this product would save me some time, but I am VERY disappointed.The main problem is the fact that it only sprays for maybe 10 seconds, and the cleaner doesn't even have a chance to run down the walls to reach the bottom of the shower.

All I got out of it was a constant 'gush' presentation between two men who, we cannot help but like. Liking them just doesn't make this a great or even good novel. It's very redundent listening to chapter after chapter when the author uses 'babe and endearments' over and over again. Everyone accepts these two men too easily and 'giggling' ends any hopeful topic worthy of follow-up. A handyman falls in love with a postman and everything is picket white fences.

Only a few complaints. One may come across minor errors and contradictions, for example: At one point it says that the historian Tacitus was the father-in-law of Agricola, but later in the book corrects itself and says that Agricola was the father-in-law. On page 122 on the map of Egypt the Nile river is missing (a rather significant omission that should have been caught). Bio's of the emperors are extremely brief, so buy a copy of Michael Grant's The Roman Emperors.

The whole thing sounds empty, the visual effects are average. Just an overall disappointment. I would recommend \\"Live at the Bijou\\" as a good Grover album.

Do not buy this soup expecting a thick pea soup, just expect a tasty soup, which is what it is. Amy's doesn't make anything that is \\"bad\\". Good soup, not pea though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"This is the worst split pea soup I have ever tasted. There are way too many onions... I usually like a lot of onions in soup, but this was ridiculous. There were more onions than peas! It tasted more like I was eating onion soup with \\"split pea\\" flavor. On top of that, the onions did not even taste fresh, they were bitter. Amy's usually makes great products, but they desperately need to change this soup. I give it 2 stars only because it is healthy, and there might be a small chance of someone liking this if they like tons of onions.Walnut Acres' Split Pea soup used to be perfect, but they changed their recipe recently after I reviewed it. It is still ok and still tastes better than Amy's Split Pea.Walnut Acres Organic Soups, Split Pea, Fat Free, 15-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)"},{"rating":"2","title":"I recommend Amy's Organic Split Pea","review":"Amy's Organic Split Pea is healthy, tasty and convenient. I like it better now than my old favorite and have for several years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Obsolete","review":"Can someone please explain to me what the point of this box is now that a trilogy box is probably only months away?"},{"rating":"2","title":"ultimate b-movie ambiance","review":"This is perhaps the single most enjoyable b-movie I have ever seen, including even \\"Plan Nine From Outer space\\" (which I know is high praise). John Agar delivers a good trooper performance in a storyline that is bizarre to say the least, and the infamous \\"balloon brain\\" scene near the end only makes the film more appealing to those interested in low-budget special FX. The high-temperature desert scenes, including both the exaggerated armpit-sweat stains and the hamburger-and-onion barbecue dialogue, demand that this film be watched in the middle of summer, preferably during a party with both burgers and cocktails served."},{"rating":"1","title":"The case for this DVD is environmentally damaging.","review":"This review is for the entire shopping experience and the physical item shipped by Amazon. If you are after a \\"pure\\" movie review I recommend you also see the The Internet Movie Database.The DVD case is full of holes, is lightweight and flimsy. This of course, requires the case to be replaced with a more substantial one (with no holes) and the original case goes into a landfill.Light can also pass through the DVD case, which may shortening the life of the DVD.If a sturdier case with no holes were used this senseless waste could be avoided.Good movie, fun to watch. This movie features an evil brain and a good brain.Some fairly well-known actors with a decent story."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Camp\\" at it's best!","review":"Talk about your super cheesy, low budget horror movie! This one is great and John Agar gained a cult following for his work in it and \\"Attack of the Mole People\\". Breal out the popcorn and cold refreshments and enjoy this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"no cigar","review":"I've been putting this on occasionally for my 3 year old for several months but he is still just not interested. It's quite simple so it might be good for those much younger but for any child that has been exposed to colorful cartoons (even simple PBS shows likle my son) this will be boriing to look at. It's so low budget I can't even stand to watch it myself. And where are the articles? They may not be necessary in English but they certainly are in any language that includes them."},{"rating":"2","title":"love it!","review":"This dvd was great. My husband and his parents speak German to our kids and they understand what they are saying but always answer in English. We own other DVD's to help our kids with German but this is the 1st that got my daughter to speak German -not just understand it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best","review":"This DVD was just very dull. I got it for my son when he was a little over 1 1/2 years old and he never watched more than a few minutes of it at a time. Naturally babies don't focus for long, but he will sit and watch several minutes of Dora and other shows like that which are designed to hold a child's attention.Honestly I also found the DVD quite boring and never watched the entire thing either. I also tried to play it for my 4 year old nephew and he hated it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst purchasing experience I ever have","review":"I ordered this DVD \\"Bilingual Baby: Teach Baby German\\". However, the company DIRECT USA sent me the wrong thing \\"Bilingual Baby: Teach Baby English\\". I don't need the DVD to teach my kids English. I contacted the company about this issue through Amazon but never got any response. I wasted $12 dollars. This is the worst online purchasing experience I ever have. Please never buy things from DIRECT USA."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent, for the price","review":"These minigrabber test hooks are decent for the price. The spring loaded mechanism for retracting the hook is a little stiff and sometimes needs a little help. The wires themselves are good. Considering the price this overall a good value."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Clip Leads","review":"I have been in the electronics industry most of my life and owned my own electronics manufacturing company for 25 years. In that time I have used a lot of clip leads. In the old days, the only thing that was available were alligator clips which were a bit bulky. When integrated circuits came out, mini grabber type clips became available and are much nicer to work with than alligator clips. Since I'm retired but still fool around with electronics, I still need clip leads occasionally and most of the ones I have from the past are pretty beat up. I bought these, and I'm very pleased with them. Fairly heavy gauge wire, thick installation, good length, multiple colors, good quality clips, and reasonably inexpensive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not professional quality","review":"These are not the high-quality professional clips you are looking for. These leads are made of a cheap-feeling plastic, and are molded to a very low tolerance. They just don't have the crisp, precise movement of the good leads, and that makes them hard to work with. They might be fine for a student or a hobbyist on a budget, but professionals should stay away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misrepresented and Cheaply Made!","review":"I bought this item from RTE Scientific seller. When I received this item, I immediately noticed that this is not the same item as pictured. I've used the same minigrabber before so I was expecting to get what was in the picture. I was expecting the product to be the same quality as what I've used before. To my disappointment, the item I received was not even the same as shown in the picture. It is cheaply made and I even wonder if this is even the real Elenco Minigrabber that I ordered. When I contacted the seller, I received I reply asking, \\"DID IT NOT WORK?\\" So I guess it doesn't matter whether you're getting what was represented as long as it does the same job. It's not really worth saving some money buying form untrusted seller. Next time, I'm buying something and it's available thru Amazon, I'd get it from them and pay the extra. Lesson learned!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very cheap","review":"Wow! These really are cheap junk. Unfortuntely the only good mini-grabber test leads I can find cost $44 for ten of them.I should have known better. Now I will have to order the better ones anyway and either waste my time returning these or wasted my money and throw them in my junk pile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"The jumpers don't extend far enough to hook around component leads. The hook metal is very cheap quality, it bends and deforms easily making it difficult to get a good mechanical connection to the component lead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yikes! Spring's didnt work","review":"Only 2 out of 5 actually worked smoothly. The remainder's springs wouldn't retract. I would not recommend this product, even for occasional use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Right tool for the right job","review":"They look good and work correctly. Hooks at the end may need to be bent a bit more to grab for example test probes for VOM, but then may not work as well for IC and transistor leads. Fortunately cheap enough to use however."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tommy Bahama Lotion","review":"The Tommy Bahama lotion I ordered was a really good deal. I've used it before but I thought I'd have to order the whole set. I was thrilled when I found it by itself.Thank you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lonely Planet Panama","review":"After I bought this book I borrowed the Moon guidebook to Panama from the library. By the time I was finished with both, the Lonely Planet guide was black in the margins and index from all the stuff that was left out. The writer seems unaware of Chagres National Park, the main ferry landing to go to Bocas Islands, how to get around without a car, and so on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outdated","review":"I was looking for a good guidebook for Panama. It is a great guidebook, but is the 7th edition, written in 2001. Most of the information in it is way outdated, and the book is useless to me. Had I known it was an older edition, I would not have bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mine was unusable","review":"It had something metallic rattling around inside of it when it arrived.

Don't be suckered by \\"Swiss Made\\" or the photos of bespectacled watch engineers. (Any watch with a decent Swiss movement will be over $100.) I bought an Activa very similar to this one (a \\"pink cow\\" watch), which has stopped working within one year.If you don't want your kids to be disappointed, I would recommend some other brand. I'm sure Timex has some inexpensive kid's watches (e.g.,Timex Kids' Time Teacher Flowers Stretch Band Watch #T89022), and their unglamorous Chinese movements seem to work just fine for years and years. But if your kid is going to break the watch anyway within a few months, or can't tell time, or doesn't even care if the watch hands are moving, then I guess the Activa is fine as a sort of watch-like bracelet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Staind, not what I expected!","review":"This Cd is not what I expected.
