They collapsed immediately after baking and the cakes were wet and sticky.Since then, I couldn't bring myself to try yet another recipe in this book.

We have one page showing three (unidentified) cupcakes with two of them out of focus. If all those full pages that were dedicated to artistic fulfillment and depth of field exercises, had instead each shown 2 or 3 cupcakes each, every recipe in the book could have been presented.

I tried increasing the bake time to once I baked them for 40 minutes, not overmixing and they still sank. Maybe it is something else I am doing wrong, they just seem too wet.

Especially when you *paid* for the book.I already had \\"Hey There, Cupcake! 35 Yummy Fun Cupcake Recipes for All Occasions\\" but there was no recipe in there to make the kind of frosting that piles up sky-high, which is why I bought this book (I have recently developed a love for cupcakes).

Then the book fizzled out seemingly in mid-story. Having just purchased \\"London Bridges\\" in hardcover, I am even more distressed that one novel seems to have been clumsily finessed into two. If the font were any larger this book might be classified suitable for the visually impaired. The margins are huge. It is fine to divide a story into small chapters. Except that if you're already to Chapter 9 by page 29 (curiously, the novel starts on page 3) and each chapter starts on a page with only about 3\\" of rather large text on a 9\\" page -- that is a LOT of empty space. The story continues to be padded by a limp sub-plot. In my opinion, this book was not worth the $27.95 cover price.

Patterson's previous Cross books were so good I couldn't stop listening to them. I think he wanted to hurry up and finish this one.All Cross was doing was getting on a plane and not staying long at each location, going to London, other places were the Wolf was to blow up bridges, seeing his son, Jamella and coming home.

Without a doubt the worst James Patterson book I've read and I've have really enjoyed all his previous books. This one, however, seemed to be written in a hurry. All Alex Cross did was jet from one city to another. The entire premise was bizarre and the outcome of events was, well, boring. Without giving anything away to those who have not read this, there are a couple of events at the very end that were so badly glossed over that you wondered if Mr. Patterson was trying to get to a dinner party and had to finish in a hurry. Nope, not a good read at all. I'm hoping his next book will be a huge improvement!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Big name author writes a dud","review":"I was very disappointed with every aspect of this novel. The story line was choppy and the plot was weak. None of the characters were well developed and the action sequences just didn't have any flow whatsoever. This was an amateurish effort and I'm a little disappointed that the reviews on the back blurb were so favorable. I'll need to check Amazon reviews in the future, to get a better sense of things next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time","review":"I have read several other in the Alex Cross series. This bookwas disappointing. The dumest part was the where the \\"wolf\\"warns of a terrotist attack on New York. Later he has his henchmen attach plastic elplosives to an unguarded bridge. Itwas hard to believe. The rest of the story was difficult to follow and I found myself speed reading just to finsih it.

This is truly an insulting waste of the paper it was printed on.I do not believe that James Patterson even wrote this; if he did, he has suffered major brain trauma. The plotting, tone, characterization, dialogue, etc. are juvenile and vapid. Chapters average 2 pages in length. You should not expect any complex sentences or thoughts as the writing is geared to a sixth-grade mentality.This is not the Alex Cross you have known and loved in the early novels. He is quite the dunce in this, incapable of speaking complete thoughts or thinking coherently.I guess Alex Cross novels 'jumped the shark\\" with \\"Roses Are Red\\" and 'Violets Are Blue\\".Please, protect yourself. Save your time and money and avoid this mediocrity. Go buy and read a good Alex Delaware or Easy Rawling novel instead. You will thank me for my advice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gratuitous Violence","review":"Much too much gratuitous violence particularly in the later pages. It serves no purpose.

Then this is not the book for you. Staring at the back of the seat in front will provide more gripping entertainment. This is the worst written book I have read in decades. Am I allowed to give zero stars? In a narrative full of supposedly critical deadlines his 'hero' is inexplicably AWOL from the action for huge chunks of time. He peppers the book with tidbits to imply that someone did some research, but you learn nothing that an hour on Google would not have provided.

Each one has been harder and harder to get through. The ONLY reason I gave this one even 2 stars is because I am hoping the GOOD writing we have come to expect from Patterson will return soon.This book had so many turns and twists it was like being on the Tilt-A-Wirl and not in a good way.Then after growing to hate and fear the Wolf the character is ended like that??!!! Give me a break.

However, maybe its my sense of paying attention to the fact that thriller writers or wannabe thriller writers have so much realistic material to draw from these days that I am simply not willing to accept the fantasim of thriller writing any longer. In 'London Bridges' I enjoyed the opening of the story; however, I felt as if I was on a downhill ski slope, and I was speeding thereafterUnfortunatley, 'London Bridges' is predictable and leaves to many loose ends to clean up, which Patterson does not. Current suspense/thriller fiction, I dispear, seems to be less insightful, and so, less meaningful. Patterson could and should have done much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"We Need a Do Over","review":"I've read all James Patterson's novels, so LONDON BRIDGES was a real letdown. It read more like a news account, rather than a novel, and I found myself skimming the pages as I would a newspaper article. Character development was zip, zero, zilch.I have a suggestion for the next Alex Cross novel. Alex could awaken from a bad dream, the details of which are already fading, except that it involved both the Weasel and the Wolf and unbelievable worldwide chaos and terror. Then Alex could go downstairs to have breakfast with Nana Mama and the kids, and the REAL tenth Alex Cross novel could begin.Please Mr. Patterson?"},{"rating":"1","title":"An unmitigated disaster","review":"A disjointed and plotless series of events with no coherence, this book just details one bombing or killing after another, instigated by Freddy Krueger's omniscient and omnipresent half-brother.

Good thing I checked this one out of the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"London Bridges falls down!","review":"This was the worst James Patterson book I've read.

It was a total waste of money and a major disappointment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Absurd","review":"One shouldn't waste many words in reviewing this. The plot is out of some silly, puerile comic book of old. The characters are often laughable, especially the villains. The atmosphere is all over the place and never real.

In short, the book is a total waste of one's time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Even Bother","review":"This is only the third Patterson book I've read, but it is definitely the worst.

It sort of reminds me of the 10th season of a TV show. Tired. Cliche characters. Not good at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly not worth the wait","review":"I read Big Bad Wolf in a marathon session and couldn't wait for the sequel. Unfortunately, London Bridges didn't live up to my expectations. I expected that the story would be equally riveting and instead found a convoluted mess of characters that had nothing to do with one another at the core. The story line was disjointed and full of truly ridiculous plot twists that ultimately had little or no bearing on the outcome. Perhaps I missed the point? I don't know - I'm a big Patterson fan but found London Bridges to be lacking the mystery and intrigue I've grown so fond of. By the end, I really didn't care who was the Wolf. Not up to the usual Patterson quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insults Your Intelligence","review":"I have not read the other reviews but to me this book insults my intelligence. Other than making money the only reason to write this book was to terminate a couple of bad guys from previous books in the Alex Cross series. I have enjoyed this author's previous Alex Cross novels as well as his lady murder club series but this book is truly bad. The story is preposturous and no one can possibly believe it could happen. It is a very fast read with large print and two or three page chapters. Don't waste your money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry James, but this one really stunk...","review":"I've been a big fan of James Patterson, and his novels, following them avidly. But recently, the Alex Cross novels have began to take a downward slide. I keep reading, in hope that perhaps the next will be better than the previous one read, but so far, I've been let down. London Bridges was terrible, and made no sense at all. It appeared to be slapped together without any thought at all. I'm confused... I thought the Women's Murder Club novels were superb, so what's happening to Alex Cross?"},{"rating":"1","title":"worst yet","review":"This has to be the worst yet of the Alex Cross series I have read so far. WAY TOO MUCH unnecessary detail and what a way to drag out a plot. This book took me 3 weeks to read, which is triple what it usually takes me."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!","review":"This was not the typical Alex Cross series. The Big Bad Wolf had me shaking in my boots....I was traveling alone in Florida and was terrified...I was hoping for the same level of excitement/terror in London Bridges. Instead I got an Alex Cross who didn't seem sure of anything. I got a Wolf with an emotional motive. The storyline was weak and unconvincing. The wolf is never TRULY identified, although he was sure he killed him several times...I thought James Patterson should have delved into the female slave trade, he could have used the Weasal better...ANYTHING that pertained to the Wolf in the previous book....WEAK WEAK WEAK...don't buy get from local Library or wait for paperback. WEAK"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfascinating","review":"I love James Patterson but I have to say this book is a weak book. Characters seem to pop out from nowhere to give information and useless pieces at that. Even catching the Wolf at the end was such a letdown after using two books to tell the story. Reading this book didn't do it for me at all or maybe it's cos there's now a huge difference between reading his books when I was 17 and in high school and now when I'm 20 and in college."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plenty of action...with little cohesiveness","review":"The Wolf...and the Weasel...are back. And, of course, their sadistic methods of murder, zamochit, and sexual deviancy are on full display from almost page one. The plot, however, is full of more holes than a sinking ship. Although I read this book in a few days(it is no doubt a page-turner), it wasn't nearly as suspenseful or enjoyable as The Big Bad Wolf.Not helping matters, the dreadfully abrupt ending proves painfully anticlimactic and rings hollow. This is nothing short of formula-driven and was without a doubt written under the pressure of a submission deadline undoubtedly pushed by JP's publisher. It shows."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"I have always enjoyed Patterson's novels, particularly the Alex Cross books. London Bridges however was very disappointing. There is too much left unexplained with a lot of incomprehensible plot twists, don't get me wrong I love twist and turns, but in this book Patterson seems to be making it up as he goes along. The ending doesn't leave you wanting more as much as it leaves you going \\"huh?\\". Patterson has written some incredible stories but it is beginning to look as if he now just wants to crank them out to pay the bills."},{"rating":"1","title":"A THIN STORY - NOT THE AUTHOR'S BEST BY FAR","review":"I had to agree with \\"Book Worm's\\" review on this one. This is a rather empty shell of a book and certainly not the author's best work. The story line could have been rather good, but there was just too much \\"filler\\" stuck in between the meat of the story. I almost have to lay blame for this on the publisher. They should have known better. If you read this one, I certainly would recommend you check it out from the library or borrow it rather than plunk your hard earned money down for it. I have enjoyed this author's work before and do hope for better from him in the future"},{"rating":"1","title":"A real disappointment","review":"The plot was absurd, the behavior of key characters (such as the leaders of the FBI and CIA) was unbelievable and unrealistic and the role of Alex Cross puzzling.

Too much was crammed into the book.I will not be buying James Patterson again."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Wolf","review":"Of course, I am an Alex Cross fan. Unfortunately. I did not start this series from the beginning so I am playing catch up. London Bridge did not disappoint. Now some of the later and earlier references make sense. Great read and plenty of action to keep you interested."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow, how did this ever get published?","review":"This is just a REALLY bad book. First I blame James Patterson, but I really REALLY blame his editor. What editor worth his salt would allow this mess to be published?The villains are so grotesque as to be almost cartoon villains. Just - over the top. The plot line is unbelievable. Aside from Alex Cross and the two villains, nobody in this book gets more than a few pages before they disappear forever. Alex Cross spends more time eating meals than using the resources of the FBI to foil the villains. This is supposed to be one of those \\"the villains have given us a deadline before they blow up the world\\" type thriller but - there's no sense of urgency, and the law-enforcement agencies on the case are poorly sketched, and inept (but not deliberately written that way).I could go on and on but it's not worth the words. This book is REALLY a waste of time. I can't believe anybody published it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought the problem was me","review":"I finished the book and couldn't understand how the pieces fit together.

This one was the frosting on the cake. The chapters were one and two pages, the print is too big and suddenly the book ends. We hear that Alex's family was kidnapped and then nothing more except that they were returned five days later. What happened? We're introduced to several new characters without a second mention of them again. We find that Alex is flying all over the world chasing the Wolf and within a few pages, he's supposedly captured. Or is he? The detail that is stetched out so vividly in the beginning of the book is nowhere at the end. It seemed like Patterson lost interest in the story and wrapped it up in a few chapters without any consideration given to fleshing out the storyline. Shame on you, Mr. Patterson. We have learned to expect more from you than this book has given us!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Michael Nails","review":"Again--James Patterson get up a good head of steam and fizziles in the end.

Patterson should have stopped with \\"Along Came a Spider.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time!","review":"After reading The Lake House, I swore I wouldn't read another Patterson book except for his Alex Cross series, so I bought Big Bad Wolf. It was awful, but I figured I'd give him one more chance and bought this one. What a waste! This book has the short, choppy sentences and short chapters like Where the Wind Blows, The Lake House, and Big Bad Wolf, and he continues to use italics to show emotion, instead of WRITING emotion. I don't know what has happened to Patterson, but this is the last of his books I'll ever buy! Why waste my time on a second (or third) class writer? By the way, did you notice how similar the dust jackets for this one and Big Bad Wolf are? Not just the writing that is boring..."},{"rating":"2","title":"He has done it once again.....","review":"ALL of the \\"Alex Cross\\" books by James Patterson are exciting reads....I can never seem to put one of his books down!

Now THOSE were two great books. If this were any book other than an Alex Cross novel, I would only give it two or three stars, but because it fills some inner need of mine, I liked it. Not that any of the Cross books are deep, nor are they supposed to be, but this one was far more shallow. Patterson kind of jumped around and left us hanging more than he needed to. Because these books don't come out much more than once a year, I need some DAMN closure man! Work with me. Oh well, until the next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment from an avid fan","review":"I have read all of the Alex Cross books, and have become a fan. This was by far a disappointment. It felt like Patterson wrote an outline and published it. There seemed to be a lot of holes in the storyline. The book seemed to be missing chapters. The ending....go back and finish your book Mr. Patterson - I think your fans deserved better than this. Not a strong effort by Mr. Patterson."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Too Implausible","review":"I have been a long time Alex Cross fan, but this book is just too ridiculous for words. I'm really wondering if this is James Patterson indulging in self parody. The villian is a cross between Dr. Moriarty, Lex Luthor, and Svengali who we are supposed to believe has \\"eyes and ears everywhere\\" and can easily subborn into treason high ranking police & intelligence officials all across North America & Europe. If Mr. Patterson is bereft of fresh ideas for Alex Cross I suggest he start a new series."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste of Money and Time","review":"I have read all the Alex Cross novels, and was so happy a new one was out.

That's supposed to mean a good book, right?Wrong.The writing is bad. The dialogue--no one talks like that!The plot would have been good in someone else's tender arms. Patterson has written a novel worse than Carol Higgins Clark's POPPED.And I was expecting an explosive ending. It was more of a dud.One star is too good for this simple, unrealistic novel. Come on, Patterson, if you're a master, write a book that lives up to that name!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst book of the Alex Cross series","review":"If you, like me, are caught up in the season and decide to invest your hard-earned money in this piece of pablum, then you should know that it would have been better to have made the 1% interest in your savings account. The book has over 120 chapters in under 400 pages. Say anything to you? Patterson phoned this one in. Captivating dialog like, \\"Nice is nice.\\" (speaking of the city in Frace) Patterson has become a caricature of a novelist. The plot is simplistic, the verbage sophmoric, the ending like a bad TV mini-series. Save your time and save your money... otherwise I really liked it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is Patterson Really the Author?","review":"After reading the reviews, I am fully convinced that Patterson did not write his last 2 books. This is a talented author with a imagination and writing style that is unique. Why must these authors submit to the mass market just to publish. I felt the same way about Sidney Sheldon's new book. I guess I'll read London Bridges when I can buy it for less that $1.00"},{"rating":"1","title":"I want my $20 back!","review":"The release of London Bridges was the equivalent of Hollywood releasing \\"Police Academy 7\\". I agree with the reviewer that pointed out it appeared as if Patterson was in a rush to make a deadline when he wrote this (perhaps the actual \\"Wolf\\" was holding a gun to his head making him write). In any case, I really enjoyed his previous Cross novels and Beach House-- but this book lacked any real depth, plot or character development. He jumps around and assumes the reader knows the multitude of characters he introduces. The chapters were over before they started and the weak storyline was tired and predictable. After reading the likes of Lehane, Crais and Connelly, it really made it stand out how boring Patterson can be and how bland his writing is. I'd start with his earlier Alex Cross novels and then stop after Kiss the Girls."},{"rating":"1","title":"You've said it all","review":"And lets not forget Theo. Another loose end that pops up out of nowhere (actually Seattle) and withers on the vine. It appears most of these reviews have had more thought and planning put into them than the latest from Mr. Patterson. But, c'mon, what did you expect? 'It is what it is', as they say. If you are surprised or disappointed his stories are quickly and unbelievably tied up, written in an open-ended style that can spawn ten more 'follow ups', have big print and short chapters and now cost $27.99 hardback, then either you haven't read his other books or failed to scan the pages in the book store before buying. I agree though, it looks like he did finish the book quickly to have a beer with friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumbed down","review":"I've read previous Patterson/Alex Cross mysteries and enjoyed them, but this one was disappointing. It felt like most of the story was about the agony of waiting helplessly for a terrorist's deadline to arrive. Many situations arose in which Alex Cross could do nothing effective or interesting, and the thrill of the chase was absolutely not there. Not much sleuthin' goin' on! My advice would be to forget \\"London Bridges\\" and read (or re-read!) some earlier Patterson/Cross stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Attempt","review":"It seems as if the author wrote this while running for a plane at an airport.

Not me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely not his best ....","review":"I'm a big fan of Patterson's \\"Alex Cross\\" series, but this one was just not very good. It was very far-fetched and the ending was like hitting a brick wall. It was also tough to keep up with all the characters that were introduced.

Now we have a patched up unconnected 3-4 page chapters. Long gone the detailed hero and instead we have this James Bond/Batman hero charatcer who is more fit for a Marvel comic book than a serious crime novel.This book is not even worth borrowing from library and reading for free. I had more thrills reading Sunday classifieds than this one.Shame that someone like JP would produce something so low quality like this!

There is still some of the old James Patterson magic, but this comes across as almost a parody of Patterson's work. Wolf and Weasel come across as more likevillains from a James Bond book. (unlimited money, unlimited manpower and unlimited bombs) The pace is fast and furious as with all Patterson books but that is where it ends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely preposterous","review":"I've been reading the Alex Cross mysteries since the beginning. They started out strong but it seems that Patterson, in his attempt to up the ante with each subsequent release, has gone totally overboard with outlandish plot devices, ridiculous set-ups and character motivations that defy all logic and reality. I wouldn't be surprised if next time Cross finds himself battling shape-shifting aliens from the tenth dimension.Also, the quality of the writing has begun to slip. Nail-biting suspense has been replaced with shock-value reveals and bait & switch routines that can be predicted chapters in advance. By the time the final climax occured, I'd stopped caring. I'm just glad I pick these books up at the library. If I'd paid $25+ for this book I'd be mighty pissed."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little disappointed....","review":"I love the Alex Cross series and was really looking forward to reading this book. I was a little disappointed. I gave the book my full attention, but I felt like I had to go back and re-read some sections so that I could follow the storyline....perhaps it was the really short chapters that seemed to flip flop too quickly. The ending wasn't that good and I found it to be a little confusing at times - maybe it was just me. I would compare this book to a Saturday matinee movie....it was okay to fill the time with, but you wouldn't want to see it again or pay full price.

The chapters are short and written for those with an attetion span of a two year old child. James Patterson who was my favorite author until this book has failed MISERABLELY! With each book we watched Pattersons writting style change from intese psychological thrillers to this water downed mush that seems to have been written without any imagination or time.

All the 'international intrigue' is lost in a jumbled mess of cliches. The saving grace here is the interaction between Alex and his family, always a welcome break in any Cross story, but here, the only thing that seems to 'belong', and remind the reader that this really IS an Alex Cross book!I'm encouraged after reading 'Mary, Mary', that Alex seems to be back in his element, and I hope Patterson is, too. He does good 'police suspense thrillers', but he should leave the terrorism drama to more qualified authors."},{"rating":"1","title":"worse than spam","review":"This must have been a ghostwriter.

The story goes out of the main plot so many times, or rather I say it goes in the plot so little that you forget what are you reading.The Weasel:If you already read 'Pop Goes the Weasel' you'll know that the way Dr. Cross killed the Weasel is pathetic. Why? Because the Weasel is suppose to be ruthless and relentless and independent and very cunning. Everything that happens to him in this book made him conceit and reckless and meek and tame.The WolfI don't know why JP wrote so many pages with this character, at the end of the book, the way the FBI's director knew who he was was dimwit. He could do that kind of investigation in the first pages of the book and we could save some paper and time with that. The way Dr. Cross get him was hilarious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really weak ending","review":"I agree with the others, this book drags for much of the story and the ending feels like Patterson just got bored and wanted to end the book.If you must read it, borrow it or get if from the library, it is not one you will want to keep or spend money on!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Expectations weren't exactly met...","review":"I personally thought the book was quite elementary to say the least. My wife said that it is supposed to be \\"fun reading,\\" but I think the book was at a level far more brain numbing. Maybe it's because Mr. Patterson was so hyped, and this book actually had advertisements on TV, as to why I thought that it might have been a good read, but I believe that it would have done him well to put a bit more time and thought into the actual writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never even finished it","review":"I got about 100 pages into this book and decided it was about as deep as something I could watch in an hours worth of drama tv.

His earlier books were much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is getting bad...","review":"I liked the earlier Cross novels for leisure reading when not in the mood for more serious fare, but these newer ones (especially this one) are getting ridiculous, make no sense, have stale dialogue, and have crossed the boundary from serious detective stories to comic-book idiocy. The two vampire books were bad, but this one is unbelievable. I can't believe Paterson wrote it. In fact, I don't think he did. It had to be a staff-member of other amateur. The people who rate this book highly must be company plants. Alex Cross fans are more than disappointed. The series is no longer worth following."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ending leaves you flat","review":"I look forward to my \\"junk food reading\\" and sat down to read this one with excitement.

I asked for this one for Christmas. Sadly, I was very disappointed. The writing is stilted and the plot questionable. I feel, as do some of the other reviewers, that this book was churned out to meet a deadline. The only reason I finished it was because my husband paid full price for it as soon as it came out. Next time, I'll wait for the paperback version, or better yet get it from the library so I don't feel so ripped off!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Treating fans with contempt!","review":"I think this is the last Patterson novel I will read. Utter rubbish, badly written (in five minutes?), and just for the paycheque I'd say. The prose includes so many italicised sentences and words: does Patterson want to emphasise EVERYthing you READ, to MAKE YOU UNDERSTAND what he's TRYING TO SAY? Give me a break, I can read already!!!God, he's taken a huge fall here. Bad plotting, idiotic suppositions, poor flow, and - honestly! - a writing style you'd expect from a (just reasonable) writer as a first attempt at 16 or 17 years old. I'm no writer, but I know I could do better than this crap.I have no idea how much Patterson or his publishers paid for the editorial reviews included here at Amazon, but they should be ashamed of giving praise to such a contemptible treatment of a (formerly) entertaining writer's fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Alex Cross novel ever","review":"I've read and enjoyed all of the Alex Cross novels but this one is flat out no good.

It has a ridiculous plot, a hero that doesn't seem to care what happens, a villain that somehow comes back to life without explanation, meaningless glimpses into the hero's home life, etc. The publisher should be forced to refund every buyer's money. And the book cover should be amended to list what the reviewers hopefully said:\\"Any thriller writer would do well to study London Bridges...\\" Publishers Weekly (they left out \\"...so they will know what a really terrible book looks like.\\")\\"...it is impossible to stop reading this book once started.\\" BookReporter.com (they left out \\"...because you can't believe how bad it is and you keep waiting for some glimmer of intelligence to show up on the pages.\\")Shame on the publisher and shame on the reviewers."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a total disappointment","review":"Having been disappointed by several of the Pattersons with another authors name atttached, I thought wow he really wrote this one! But I was so disappointed the story was boring the writing way to spare. Even for a trash reader this was awful. I think soon we will find that Patterson is really dead, cause I doubt he wrote this one. His books used to be so rich and suspenseful now they are just boring. This will be my last Patterson, and if you read his kid's book you would join me in the feeling that he is just not writing anymore, he has people doing it for him. He is just a brand name and it has lost its luster."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time Reading","review":"By far this is the worst of the Alex Cross books!

My wife loves his books and had bought this book but had not read it yet. It was on the shelf and I had nothing else to read so I asked her if I could read it before her. It was very disappointing. No character development at all and in my opinion the plot was very unrealistic and the ending anit-climactic and foreseeable. I knew how the book was going to end at the half way point. To me I got the impression that the author was trying to rush out another book to make his publisher happy. My wife has since read this book and admits that this is not his best effort. She is trying to get me to read one of his other books because she promises me he is a good writer. So my suggestion is to skip this one and try one of his other novels first."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is going on?","review":"I love James Patterson. I love the Alex Cross series. I am not sure what happened here. Usually, when I am reading I can't put it down, that was not the case with this book. I felt as if it were all over the place.

That sounded like a strong endorsement. Having purchased and read it, I realised they must have meant it as an example of how a book should NOT be written."},{"rating":"1","title":"another unsatisfied customer","review":"Wanted to chime in with another negative review of this book. I think this is easily the poorest Alex Cross offering to date. Big Bad Wolf was good and I was excited to find out how the saga would unfold. The end was such a let down. After 600 pages of build up the final confrontation between the Wolf and Cross couldn't have felt more anticlimatic. Big thumbs down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time.","review":"Disjointed, utterly predictable plot, and poor character development. Obviously, Patterson phoned this one in just for the bucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"London Bridges","review":"I only gave 1 star, because that was the lowest available. I forced my way through this book, because I was incredulous that it was published. This is a prime example of an author, who takes a great character and destroys him. I loved the early Alex Cross books, but they have progressively deteriorated, culminating in the horrid London Bridges. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME. There are many other good books out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disaster!","review":"I rushed to buy this Alex Cross novel, snatching it from beneath the unsuspecting nose of another fan! Die- hard Patterson fan? Yes indeed, devouring Pop the Weasel, for example, in the space of a single afternoons' sun worship! But this? I find it almost inconceivable that he could have produced such unadulterated nonsense, incoherant from beginning to end, pointless, ineffective, need I go on? Even my husband, to whom I introduced the pleasures of James Patterson, described it as complete rubbish! As a result of this, I have sought my literary pleasures elsewhere, barely casting a glance at 4th of July in the shops.

The story was confusing and poorly resolved. There was no depth to the characters and at the end of the book I was not personally invested in the story or the characters. Deaths, bad guys and good guys were incidental. The bad guy impersonators, meant to be red herrings were pointless and contrived. And at the end, I just didn't care."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book contains story-like substance.","review":"\\"Story-like\\" might be too generous. I've gotten used to reading fillers in the Cross series, but this one takes the cake. Really, every other chapter is mindless babbling.It's a true \\"page turner\\" for me because the blather got so bad that I just read the first sentence of a CHAPTER then go directly to the last sentence to get a sense of what happened and what's in store for the next one. More often than not, the first sentence is exactly the same as the last.If you took out all the \\"here we go\\" and the \\"what's going on\\" and the \\"nothing makes sense\\" stuffs out of the this book and the previous, I think it's possible to make a somewhat tight story (yes, despite the improbable ineptitude Patterson instilled on everyone in the book not named Wolf), instead of having two really bad ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely the worst Alex Cross novel so far...","review":"I read all the novels in the publication order and thus I am very disappointed with this part. It simply did not deliver. One of the biggest annoyances for me was that a character that has been built up over many years is killed off in two sentences. Also some plot points could be written in much more detail as mentioned in many other reviews here. Not a very good novel. For me it is the worst I read from Patterson so far."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really? This is the best ending Patterson could come up with?","review":"Lucky for me, I've been getting the Alex Cross books from my local library.If I had to pay for London Bridges I would have stopped reading anymore of Patterson's books. The plot had so much potential, but it felt as if Patterson got bored and decided enough was enough. Really? This was the best you could do Mr. Patterson? You couldn't take a few chapters and fill in the blanks so that all of the scattered pieces you dropped along the way could get put together? I'm very disappointed. All the build up for that lame excuse for an ending.And what about the Weasel? That was the best you could do with him? Sad, very sad.You should start writing under the alias of Milli Vanilli.

But...I must say, this is his worst book ever. I started it maybe like a month ago, and it failed to grab my attention one bit. It took me forever to read because I just wasn't interested in what happens. I almost contemplated putting it away without finishing it. There was no real plot to speak of. Nothing is ever satisfactorily explained. Characters from previous novels are brought back for no logical reason. And while I used to like Patterson's style of writing very short chapters, it seemed almost juvenile in this book. Literally like something a high school student could have written.

Patterson's early Cross novels (Spider, Girls, Jack & Jill) were great, but the books as of late have been getting progressively worse--and now London Bridges is the worst of all. The Wolf is an absurdly powerful enemy, and seems to have access to unlimited money, manpower, information, etc. Not only is the Wolf and the whole London Bridges storyline ridiculous, the multiple \\"fake\\" endings are even worse. Every time you think you know who the Wolf is, the rug gets pulled out from beneath your feet. Does Patterson even know who the Wolf is? Does he care?

In London Bridges Patterson continues to beat a dead horse, rehashing his failed relationship with Christine, rehashing the evil villains of his past books, etc. It's time to put these issues to rest once and for all and come up with a new and fresh (read: INTERESTING) path for Alex Cross' life!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Patterson Loses Touch With Reality Completely","review":"the blurb reads \\"a Russian monster \\"The Wolf\\" and another psycho \\"The Weasel\\" control tactical nukes located in four major cities and the dysfunctional Alex Cross is assigned to save the world\\"does this sound like an old comic book, a bad \\"B\\" movie, something even worse? if so it's probably the latest James Patterson book, written to a level that would be emabrrassing to most other authors; can't we just chip in and send Patterson a blank check every couple of years so he doesn't embarrass himself again"},{"rating":"1","title":"Only a true Patterson fan can say this...","review":"This book was horrible.

I am sorry I bought this book.Patterson's imagination needs to take a break.

I was really disappointed on how London Bridges ended. The book had me wanting more, but as far as I know that story is over.

It's heartening to see others underwhelmed with this vapid 'thriller' because I quite frankly don't understand why Patterson bothered beyond the first three Alex Cross novels.His writing has only gotten more pedestrian, his plots more bromidic, fresh from the read-along-and-dont-ask-questions school of action writing. Quick 3-page chapters seem set up for pace but muddle the flow instead, there isn't a smidge of build-up.Twenty pages into this tripe I was all but ready to smack the addle-pat reviewers at Publishers Weekly who glowed with odes like \\"Best of Patterson's work!\\" Well, that it isn't.In mood for a well-oiled thriller? Try 'Paranoia' by Joseph Finder or almost anything by Lee Child."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love it or hate it!","review":"Judging Patterson writing is a tricky business. He publishes three or four books a year, mostly written by somebody else. His style (or the style of the people that writes for him) is very simple, maybe seventh grade. Chapters are very short, and that can be annoying or make the story move really fast. One has come to expect countless twists and cliffhangers in the story, and again that can be exciting or exhausting.This book is no exception. The plots move at the speed of light, characterization is poor, we move from one murder to the next and when we are overloaded and we don't care anymore explanations and the real killer are revealed.This is a carbon copy of his other books. It is entertaining if you don't expect much.

One or two small ones to keep the audience on their toes, if not to justify this novel as a thriller in genre.Worst of all, James Patterson wastes Alex Cross, super cool Washington DC-based crime fighter and devoted family man on yet another watered-down plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"why?","review":"This is the worst Alex Cross novel ever.

With Patterson's London Bridges release, I can unequivocally say I am truly disappointed by the book's incontinuity and abruptness. It's almost as if Patterson takes on more than he can chew by taking his readers literally all over the globe in an incomprehensible terrorist plot. What's worse is Patterson's tendency to rush from one sequence to the next without any clear transition. Also--Patterson seems to rehash recurring character themes (Cross' conflict between family and work--yawn) without providing any indication of resolution. I found myself skimming over and over again to get to the \\"bottom-line\\" when one wasn't apparent. While this book is action-packed and reintroduces readers to old villains, I felt the material was rushed from start to finish.

Some are better then others. I read the Big Bad Wolf in a day and thought it was pretty good. I figured the author would not be able to have Cross dispatch the bad guy for a couple of books due to the mysery surrounding his identity. I started London Bridges looking forward to a good novel. At the start it was indeed a very good story. However the ending was perhaps one of the worst I have ever seen. I don't want to give anything away but it was like the author was bored and wanted to finish the novel quickly. So he cooked up the dumb solution to catching the Wolf. It ruined the whole book for me. Why must all of the authors novels be so damn short? Either leave a cliffhanger or just write a bigger book! The ending just made no sense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Written by high school sophomores?","review":"I've enjoye;d a number of Cross's books, but can't help but wonder if he farmed this one out to a High School boys' creative writing class. In short, it was just plain silly. Not bad, not thoughtless, just plain silly. The formula used by which every hireling of the villain does his task and then is summarily shot, blown up, knifed appears to come from boys who do a lot of video gaming, pressing buttons, watching people die. Please, Mr. Patterson, take some time off, relax, recreate, refuel, don't write a word for a year or so, then come back and give us another good Alex Cross story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spare me...","review":"I was seriously disappointed in Patterson's latest attempt to write a book. I've read a lot of his books and this one was, by far, the worst. The story line was so far-fetched I wondered where it would all lead, as I'm sure Patterson also contemplated. And obviously, he failed to come up with anything tangible. The ending was so bad, it was almost as if Patterson's publishers were like, \\"Alright now, you need to finish this book today!\\" So, he quickly jotted down something and sent it on it's way. It'll be a while before I pick up another Patterson story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Patterson's worst novel","review":"I've read, and enjoyed most everything Patterson has written, but this was terrible. My advice is to try something else instead. The characters are cardboard and the story is like a comic book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Retire Alex Cross","review":"This book was a waste of time. Two page chapters, lots of blank spaces on the paper - is this to make you think you are reading a long book and getting your money's worth? The character of Alex Cross needs to be retired as I don't remember him actually solving the crime in this book - he just seems to travel around the world, watching what others have done.Definitely not Mr. Patterson's best effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the hell happened?","review":"For anyone like me who has been an avid fan of the Alex Cross series, it has been very sad to watch the characters and writing deteriorate into a sloppy mess. The transformation from say \\"Kiss the Girls\\" to \\"London Bridges\\" is astonishing. It's almost like Patterson took some sort of pill overnight and forgot what made the Alex Cross novels so good. Pretty much every Cross book by Patterson since \\"Violets are Blue\\" has been weak (the exceptions being the very good \\"The Jester\\" and \\"The Beach House\\" - two of his best). People looking for suspensful thriller series involving a detective already know that Michael Connelly is currently the best out there. Go read a Bosch novel and forget this guy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth The Time","review":"This is, without a doubt, one of the worst examples of a novel I have ever encountered. While the book starts with an interesting story and lots of action, it devolves into literary trash about three quarters of the way through. The plot twists start to make no sense at all, seemingly pulled from a hat somewhere; the characters do things that make less sense than the 'new, improved' plot the reader was just introduced to half a paragraph before; a sex scene, which, honestly, does nothing to help the book and could (should?) have been omitted entirely, could have easily been written by a vocabulary deficient 14 year old boy. In all, this was the worst Patterson novel I've come across, ever. But it does illustrate where the true genius lies: with the screenwriters who turn his novels into movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Patterson Dud","review":"James Patterson fails his faithful readers with his latest Alex Cross novel. The story seemed contrived and unbelievable, almost like a report of activities. The dialog was trite and didn't draw you into the story. I kept wondering if Mr. Patterson actually wrote the book and I certainly feel cheated that I paid good money for a new book. Like Patricia Cornwell before him, I guess I'll no longer automaically buy his new books."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste of my time........and Patterson","review":"Mr. Patterson has written a dissappointment. After Big Bad Wolf, I couldn't wait for the sequel. Now I could! Didn't hold my attention and the end was sudden. I expect more from one of my favorites. I shall be somewhat more careful in my next purchase of Mr. Patterson's creations."},{"rating":"1","title":"An awful book","review":"this is the worst Patterson book yet -- trite, thin, formulistic. He dwells on the same themes, goes over the wall on the plot and is totally unrealistic. not worth your time reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hope you love the Ted Turner logo!","review":"This one wins the \\"worst presentation on DVD\\" award. They've sandwiched the \\"Ted Turner\\" logo in-between the overture and the main title. You start the film, listen to the beautiful 5 minute overture, and are then assaulted by the Turner logo (at a higher volume) before the main titles start. I guess we're not supposed to forget that Turner had an integral part in the production of this classic film. What next? Stick to the laserdisc -- they didn't screw it up there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Movie Making","review":"Wonderful example of what movie making should be and sadly no longer is.

There were two visible stripes on the left and right hand side of the picture frame in the wide screen mode."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible, terrible, terrible. Save your money!","review":"I love westerns. I grew up in the 50's watching western serials, and seeing western movies. But even the great names of Hollywood (Fonda, Peck, Cobb et al)couldn't save this movie from itself.The brassy, overblown acting of Robert Preston grated on me. I expected him to leap any moment into a Music Man song. The plot was awful and dull.But worse than anything was the absolutely cheesiest screen appearance on DVD. It looked just like you are at a drive-in theater with three dirty movie screens pushed together with no attempt to hide the awful un-matched color and exposure on each one. What an insult and a rip off. Surely someone could have digitally enhanced this on."},{"rating":"1","title":"This fine old film deserves better treatment (11/30/98)","review":"It appears that the original wide screen version was divided into three sections with a separate camera filming each section. Apparently the film masters for each section have aged differently. The result is that you can see color balance differences in each section of the screen. For example, the left and right may look OK while the center appears faded. The 3 areas of the screen are quite distinct from each other (especially in bright outdoor scenes). For me, it was somewhat like viewing the movie through a kaleidoscope and I found it distracting."},{"rating":"1","title":"How The West Was Won","review":"Along with the failures in the picture quality, I am surprised no reviews mention the time length of only 155 minutes. The original was 162 mins. I suspect they shortened or completely left out the great soundtrack music in the Opening, Intermission, and closing orchestrations. Since I read the other reviews, I did not buy this version. Can someone help me as to where the missing minutes are?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Years Later...","review":"I first saw this movie when I was a kid at the Cinerama Dome in Hollywood and I loved it. Today, many years later, I don't love it anymore! On the positive side, some of the scenes and sets where excellent. The film was shot in Cinerama and it's hard to watch on television. I found the line breaks on either side of center very annoying. Overall the cast was a who's who in Hollywood but mostly these ordinarily great actors where cast in corny, unbelievable roles. My recommendation is to watch it on the Western Channel if you don't have anything better to do. Save your money and your movie library space."},{"rating":"2","title":"incredible picture!","review":"The blu-ray picture is so good that this version is like I remembered it in the theaters 45 years ago. Awesome. well worth the money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!!!!","review":"This film came out when we were young and decided that while it was available we wanted to have it on hand so we could watch when we wanted.

I had already seen it, and like to collect classics that I enjoyed.This one is a very nice addition to my collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great movie - bad DVD","review":"This classic is a must-see for anyone who likes westerns. I've seen it twice in a theater. I bought the DVD and what a disappointment! The bad transfer made viewing unbearable, impossible. I cannot tell you how sad and angry I am, or this review will not be published. This DVD is a complete rip-off. Do not waste your time or money. The people who produced this DVD must learn that customers will not accept this kind of rubbish. By the way, with modern computer aided film restoration techniques, this wonderful film could have been presented in pristine condition. They just couldn't be bothered. And what's the difference between the [two] DVD versions? A clamshell case and collectable booklet? The marketing mavens are running amok. They must be stopped."},{"rating":"2","title":"BluRay Release -- an epic in proportion","review":"HTWWW Blu-Ray release is definitely a MUST-HAVE for all collectors who enjoy motion picture epics. I remember watching this movie in its original 3 projection panels and mesmerized by the larger-than-life moving images and surround-sound. Watching it again in Blu-Ray format, especially the SHOWBOX version, really does more than justice to the original intent of the movie producers. I also followed its various stages of releases from a dismal VHS tape to laserdisc and DVD formats. And being a HTWWW avid fan, nothing gives me the plesasure of reliving the magnificence and grandeur of this original celluloid masterpiece right in my living room...thru the magic of Blu-Ray."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice, but not the best ever...","review":"This movie is pretty good overall, but still there's minor action, like a few gunfights, one Apache encounter, and so on. I'm not saying this is bad, but I'm saying: if you really think about it, it's not the best ever made. For example, \\"Chisum\\" and \\"Stagecoach\\", which are both John Wayne movies, have way more action. Besides, why did Wayne play such a small part in this video? It would have been much better had he played a longer part. Also, if you want better movies, there are two \\"Stagecoach\\" movies. Watch the John Wayne one, because of the singer in the color movie. Another example is \\"True Grit\\", and \\"Rooster Cogburn\\". I won't give any more examples, because I wouldn't have a well written review. But what I can say is that you should watch this movie, and there are better ones, but this is a neat one. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"VHS tape would be better format for this film","review":"The transfer of this movie from it's original \\"Cinerama\\" format, leaves two crease lines on the screen, so it appears you are looking at a fold out poster. The characters are exagerated in how they move from the front of the screen to the rear, and back. And as a charater moves across the screen, the distance is so distorted, it is difficult to watch. This is a prime example of a motion picture that was designed for the big screen and should always be viewed that way. (One cannot view the Grand Canyon from pictures of it.) My recommendation is to steer clear of the DVD, and purchase this in a 1.33:1 VHS format for a standard TV. The widescreen transfer is such a poor quality, it should not be sold."},{"rating":"1","title":"HOW THE WEST WAS LOST!","review":"Can anyone tell me is there a DVD copy out there \\"HOW THE WEST WAS WON\\" in Dolby Digital 5.1 sound???? not 2.00 stereo."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Has Happened to Warners?","review":"I didn't buy this, thank goodness, because I was suspicious after being burned by another recent Warner release. The double feature disc of \\"Kelly's Heroes/Dirty Dozen\\" has a similar issue with \\"Dirty Dozen\\" being incorrectly labeled as being a 16x9 transfer and containing special features that are not actually on the disc. It is also an old master with the Turner logo at the beginning."},{"rating":"1","title":"widescreen blur","review":"The movie was as poorly presented as i remember seing it the first time.

I am sure the Blu Ray version is fine, but we shouldnt have to buy Blu Ray to get a decent image, if epics of this era such as \\"Ben Hur\\", \\"Doc Zhivago\\" etc etc can be properly enhanced to fill most of the screen, why, with the so called modern technlology cant Warners do a decent job on this film.

Many studios are scanning the movies at 4k for blue-ray (as it is in the upcoming God Father blue-ray set) so that they will not spend a fortune for restoration when the next 4k format launches.

This Blu-Ray digitally doctored version certainly comes closest to that experience. Most older films don't look any better in HD than the regular DVD. This one is an exception. In Blu-Ray it gets me very close to the original AND the missing lines between the cameras is a huge improvement from the previous DVD and LaserDisc incarnations.Others have covered the plot and cast and the lore behind the film.

I remember this epic western and wanted to see the widescreen version on DVD. It was filmed with 3 cameras and you can see the seams between the 3 pictures throuighout the movie. Usually one of the 3 pictures was darker than the other 2. This was very distracting. Add film burn spots and that is enough for me to discard this DVD from my collection as unwatchable.

They are great for practice workouts but I suspect they might become a bit redundant for performance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Repetitive, boring and not danceable","review":"As a fan of contemporary Middle Eastern pop music, I bought this cd with an eye towards using it in dance performances. Unfortunately, I was completely disappointed. Most of the cuts are mindless and annoyingly repetitive. They are not at all catchy and certainly do not make me want to jump up and dance. Rather, they make me want to get a refund for the good money I spent on this album. Almost none are suitable for a performance of any type. They remind me of rave music, which may be fine for some, but I can't even stand to have this thing playing in my car while I drive. Please take the time to listen to the samples Amazon has up: the songs don't get any better."},{"rating":"1","title":"TALL SCREEN!!!","review":"Ditto, all the 5-star reviews. The film is fan-f**king-tastic!But the star-rating asks \\"How do you rate this ITEM?\\"This \\"item\\" violates director Fosse's original widescreen film by presenting it in \\"NORMAL\\" format... you know, chopped off at the sides to fit into those old, square-screen, heavy, glass, cathode ray tube TVs... remember those? No widescreen version of this DVD even exists.WTF, Warner Brothers???!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"STAR 80","review":"The film is well produced, well directed and extremely well acted. I use the film in a college class on the \\"Theories of Intimate Violence.\\" The final physically violent ending notwithstanding, all of the events leading up to the tragic finale represents an excellent example of a subtle form of intimate violence that frequently goes unrecognized by the general public (and the victims who get trapped in it)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A bleak portrait about the other side of the fame!","review":"Dorothy Stratten was the playmate of the year in 1980. But her life was not exactly a garden of happiness; her brief existence is told with an impeccable narrative style, supported by a very documented script around her intimate hopes and triumph 's desires that simply vanished in the night 's brume.The artistic concerns of Bob Fosse always focused around the inner dragons of the human beings. Although he will be always be reminded for Cabaret, just a few Directors were so bold like him to propose dark and somber films such Lenny or All that Jazz.Dense, mature and superb film that will always be (to my mind) a treasured gem of Bob Fosse. Maybe Mariel Hemingway and Eric Roberts made the best role of their respective careers."},{"rating":"1","title":"why get it?","review":"as amazing a recoding as this one is, you can only listen to it if you have a sacd player. it won't play on a normal cd player as other sacd's do, and forget about your car or discman. sony should learn from their previous mistakes and release products like this one in dual layer formats so that the few people that still buy cd's will spend $25 dollars (more than a dvd) on a record they are able to enjoy fully instead of just download or copy an inferior quality version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wretched","review":"Some online reviews suggest that there is some merit in this CD.

I've had this music since it first came out on vinyl, and it has not aged at all. One of the best Miles albums ever, in my mind. Right up there with Jack Johnson, On The Corner, and Get Up With It (you might notice I'm a little biased towards the later fusion period). Some of the most amazing sounds ever recorded.I noticed that Michael Henderson even took the time to post something here. Thanks Michael! He's one of the best bass players ever. His playing is perfect throughout. Just perfect at keeping the groove going, without the pointless ego tripping that flaws the work of so many bassists these days... Awwwwwww...so sweet."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"That which description may never justify\\"","review":"When I first tried listening to this album, at the age of 19, I found it... intimidating. Its restless energy and bizarre oceans of sound were almost frightening. Because of this I was always fascinated by it, and went back to it over the years until I really got to like it. At times it seems that Miles has achieved something that isn't quite music but isn't non-music either --- \\"that which description may never justify.\\" Those who are accustomed to the jazz styles of the 50s and 60s may find this a tough listen, but it's well worth the effort, for its sheer wildness and reckless courage. A major effort by one of the authentic musical geniuses of the 20th Century."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Live Tracks","review":"The previous reviewer is wrong when he says the muscians on this albumn are not jazz musicians. Keith Jarrett, Jack DeJohnette, John Mclaughlin and Gary Bartz were (and still are) some of the most techincally accomplished musicians around. Only Michael Henderson, who plays bass on this albumn, had no previous jazz experience. All of the above are playing at a career best on this album.I'd say this albumn is better and more focused than Bithces Brew and includes some of the best fusion music Miles ever played. 'What I say' is a highlight for me; surely this must be one of the most angriest, intense tracks ever recorded. Finally, Miles' playing is on top form and he plays with amazing confidence and speed. If you've listened to a couple of Miles Davis's electric albumns and you like what you hear; then get this."},{"rating":"1","title":"This not works","review":"This not works on any of my two dogs.I have a #1 Chihuahua and a new-born Fox-Terrier.I use on them and next day i have to teake the thicks by myself.

Skeet Ulrich plays the hacker, Kevin Mitnick, that feels hacking is an innocent way to expose the governments shortcomings. The problem is he has downloaded government files and proprietary documents, therefore stolen, files from the top security analyst and others. Now of course these files expose that the analyst wasn't so innocent either, but that hardly justifies what Mitnick does. The hypocrisy with most of this is hackers would be hell bent for justice, revenge, or payback if someone stole their software. Overall good story, acting, camera work, and directing. Check out as rental, but you may want to add to your collection if you enjoy the hacker movies. Good quality DVD with decent replayability.

It started out slow, but once he got on a roll it turned into a book I just could not put down. Many twist and turns in this book. Many times of holding my breath. This is a well written book. I am looking forward to the next book The Last Witness. Thanks for a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Needing a great thrill?","review":"It seems fitting that Joel Goldman's debut novel, Motion to Kill, is set in the \\"Show Me\\" state of Missouri, because Goldman certainly knows how to show his readers what can happen when things go wrong.

It has been compared to John Grisham and Michael Connelly, but it is good enough to stand out on its own.This is Joel Goldman's debut legal thriller introducing attorney Lou Mason (not Perry Mason!). It is a fast paced, page-turner mystery thriller with a legal background.Lou Mason is a partner in a law firm where both the principal and his closest partner are murdered. An unscrupulous major client threatens the existence of the firm and Lou gets involved in preserving both the firm and his own life.The plot is extremely complex, well crafted and rewarding with plenty of action and thrills. I have only marked it down to 4 stars because at the end of the book I was left with a couple of unanswered questions from key parts of the plot.Lou Mason is a great new character who features in several later books, which I am looking forward to reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"An eclectic pulling from the past who dunnits","review":"I'm only half way through. It's not bad enough for me to discontinue reading. But I get the feeling that I have read or seen it before, in the movies. A hodge podge of Earle Stanley Gardner, Barry Reed and others. A far cry from Grisham. Some portions are very readable. Many are not. I would not buy another one of the franchise."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT comparable to Michael Connelly","review":"Goldman is a lawyer so I suppose the legal issues in the plot are authentic. Beyond that, his writing is full of cliches, his dialog ranges from ho hum to juvenile, and his main character rarely behaves or thinks like an adult - more like a smart ass college freshman. I suspect Goldman writes fast and lets the words spill from his brain with very little attempt at craftsmanship. Comparing him to Michael Connelly is like comparing airplane food to fine dining. No more Goldman books for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flabbergasted","review":"How anyone could rate this book above 1 much less 5 is beyond me. Strewn with names, not characters, who appear with the barest introduction, not development, left me totally confused before I was half way through which was as far as I got before I trashed it. It belongs to the dime novel genre and is no bargain even at 99 cents. The abundance of 5 star ratings calls the value of such into question. If you check the raters other ratings you will find that not one of them has ever read anything other than a 5 star book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Good Lou Mason Novel","review":"Enjoyed the book but without a background in economic crimes it was confusing at times.

It clips along at a great pace - not so fast that you feel like you have missed something, nor so slow that you want to skip pages - and keeps the pages turning long after the lights should be out!Mr. Goldman does not try to stuff our heads with a bunch of legal gibberish, rather he builds a stand-alone story that happens to involve lawyers, cops and legalities. The plot includes some seemingly improbable situations that, rather than pretending are completely normal, the author fully acknowledges within the story as improbable. The twists and turns will definitely keep you guessing!I fully recommend this to anyone who enjoys legal thrillers, detective-type novels, or just plain action!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"I bought this for my 5-year old so that she would have some point of reference for starting school and POSSIBLY dealing with teasing about wearing glasses. Great book. We already had a lot of Arthur books and have occassionally watched him on PBS, so she's slightly familiar with him. Reading about what he tried and went through really helped her think about people teasing others about being different.

I bought my copy through the school system, and on the cover, they had a picture of Arthur like he looks on the TV show. However, inside the book, Arthur and his family look like rats, not like teddy bears. My kid couldn't even recognize the characters. He kept saying that this wasn't Arthur. I hope all the Arthur books aren't this shoddy, but I hestitate to buy another without flipping through it at a store. It literally looks like a child drew the pictures."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading graphics","review":"If you look at the cover, it shows the current Arthur.

There is a concentration exercise using a number 2 pencil that I still remember to this day.

FS and his favorite arranger Nelson Riddle are both in TOP form in this SENSATIONAL swinging album that contains more knock-out numbers that any other album Sinatra ever recorded. Every Riddle arrangement on this album is a \\"10\\" -- from the opening WHEN YOU'RE SMILING to the closing YOU DO SOMETHING TO ME. The three add-on songs in the later re-release of this album were not part of the original 12-song LP. In between these two bookend songs, Sinatra and Riddle soar to heights that other singers and arrangers can only dream of. Listen to Frank on BLUE MOON, SEPTEMBER IN THE RAIN and I CONCENTRATE ON YOU. You'll never hear singing like that again in your lifetime. This is swinging pop music at its absolute best with two masters creating a musical nirvana that likely will never be equaled."},{"rating":"2","title":"Notes and Comments","review":"This is one of his best, particular in the version which has been digitally remastered.

It is beautiful to read; thought provoking and gently stimulating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book, unique perspective","review":"Elliot saw Afghanistan during a few visits over a period of years when huge changes were occurring. He had greater nerve than most travelers to the country and this allowed him to see and experience things most visitors have not. His descriptions are vivid, he includes some historical context, I like his sense of humor, and he was quite sensitive to the nuances of his hosts and fellow guests. The last pages offer a very realistic take on the current (2011) situation there. I enjoyed this book a lot and felt I learned from it as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating","review":"The first I ever really learned of Afghanistan was when our country went to war in Afghanistan. Ever since, I've been yearning to learn more about the country, the people, the culture of Afghanistan. This was an excellent book, and quite unexpected in many ways. It was not dry, though it contained academic information. It was funny and much like a conversation with the author. He took the reader along with him on his journey by being so rich with detail and vivid with his language. At times, the book was a little hard to follow because of my lack of background knowledge, but I enjoyed being swept into a new world none the less. The book was written in 1999, which was obviously before Sept. 11, 2001. I am very curious about the changes that have since occurred in Afghanistan. I keep hoping for peace."},{"rating":"2","title":"More Than A Beautifully Written Travel Book","review":"This book is more than a travel book. It's an opportunity for the reader to enjoy, know and appreciate the country and people of Afghanistan in the years during and just after the Soviet occupation post 1998. It's more than that too. It's a beautifully written and thoughtful book which is a stand-alone example of literature at its contemporary best.Elliott made at least two trips into Afghanistan as an independent journalist in the 1990 and in this book he chronicles the magnificence of the landscape, the quality of the Afghans, cut off and on their own and the warm and the hospitable nature of their customs. But don't cross them1It was a pleasure to read, my only caveat being that Elliott used a map with names and places which don't appear on my National Geographic Atlas (you'll want to read it with a magnifying glass and a good atlas at hand). As travel literature goes it can't be beat!"},{"rating":"1","title":"an unexpected boredom at the end of the day","review":"Being a keen reader of almost everything that I've found about this terrible and fascinating country, I bought this book and the reviews on the back and front covers made me expect a great read. But after having reached the last 100 pages, it unexpectedly ended up falling from my hands, and so far I have not had the desire or the willpower to finish it. All the 1 star reviews in Amazon are worth reading before you give a try to this long, pretentious and boring travelogue. However, there are a few passable moments, as can only be expected in over 500 pages dealing with Afghanistan. In the end, an unsuccessful attempt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Manadatory reading!","review":"This book should be required reading of all Americans who are concerned about our national involvement in Afghanistan.It is an extremely interesting and intimate look at the people of that country and a review of their turbulent history over the past 30 or so years."},{"rating":"2","title":"In the Top Ten Books I Have Ever Read on the Middle East","review":"As a resident of the Middle East for almost a decade, and a professor, speaker, writer, journalist, for over 20 years, I have done thousands of hours of research and read hundreds of books on the Middle East, Islam and the cultures in that part of the world. \\"Unexpected Light\\" is one of the best that has ever been written.

I picked up the book because I will be travelling to Afghanistan and wanted to get an idea of the land and people of this mysterious country. Jason Elliot is a wonderful writer, extremely talented and gifted for sure. I still can't believe this is the first book he has ever written. He has made this country and its people come alive for me. Mr. Elliot knows the history and cultures of the peoples of Afghanistan well and creatively interweaves this with his own story. I can't wait to get there and meet the people myself! I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A masterpiece","review":"A must have. If you have any interest in faraway places get this book. If you want to be absorbed in a story get this book.

Others have explained why this book is so boring -- just not much 'action.' The author recounts a couple of times that he was 'shelled' by the Ruskies. Admitedly, one cannot expect to have many 'deep' political discussions with the locals; so, sadly, most of the author's converstations with the Afghani are pretty boring: \\"how's the amputee?\\" Maybe it was interesting when first issued back in 1999, but a decade later, it seems to just have no 'substance.' No meeting of the war-lords, just some of the donkey drivers. You will find much more enjoyable 'action packed' stories by reading the monthly issues of SOLDIER OF FORTUNE. I had hoped for something nice to say about this book: it finally ended. I junked it, I don't want anyone else to suffer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unexpected Light","review":"Sane, sympathetic and trustworthy exploration of a difficult subject.

Elliot seems to want to place himself among the ranks of the Thesigers, Starks, et al, and fails miserably. To give him some credit, there were several passages that were really worth reading. But overall, it really was NOT worth the effort! I got about halfway through, and gave up. Thank heaven I had saved the receipt, and that the bookstore took it back! Never again!..."},{"rating":"1","title":"A review of An unexpected Light by Jason Eliott","review":"Jason Eliott is simply not a Dalrymple and he will never be. \\"An Unexpected Light\\", is a long, verbose accounting of some travels in wartime Afghanistan. It is tedious reading. It is boring reading. It grieves me to read that when the author attempts to be instructive and presents the nomenclature of the genus and species of trees in Latin, they are all wrongly spelt. This is an indication of the \\"sloppiness\\" of this novel. This is the first book which I have bought and which will find its way to a second hand bookstore quickly. I suppose, having worked two years in Afghanistan during the late 1970s' and having returned during 1991, that this makes me realize that I expected much more. Pity, he rode a donkey and produced a donkey's tale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comprehensive insights into Afganistan","review":"Very well written with humor, empathy, and thoughtfulness. Provides in-depth insights into way of living for Afghan people. Jason doesn't miss a small detail in his observations, and it is the inclusion of the small details that allow reader to visualize the events. About three-quarters of way through, book started to get a bit \\"preachy\\". Maybe the book was form of therapy for Jason who is part Afghani(???) Not sure where his strong ties to the country developed. He definitely wanted reader to feel sympathy for Afghans which is not difficult. However, I was reading the book during 2-week tour of Uganda over the 2009 holidays, and couldn't help but think that Ugandan's live in equally similar conditions. I hope Jason has found a way to help a country he seems to so closely identify with, just as I am finding ways to help Ugandans having been so impacted by their poverty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beyond typical analysis","review":"A great book that made me think beyond the realm of typical ecological and social analysses."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"rumpole rests his case\\" is NOT a new book","review":"I have not read ALL of the Rumpole books, and probably can't remember ALL that I HAVE read.

However, I ended up sending it back because it would not work at all. I tried it with 2 Qwest DSL modems, an Actiontec GT704-WG on an ADSL network and with an Actiontec Q1000 on a 20Mb VDSL network. The problem was the phone's Ethernet port would not connect with either of the DSL modems, the light for the port would not come on, it wasn't recognized and it wouldn't do anything. If the device is not recognized as being connected to one of the Ethernet ports there is nothing else you can do and it's dead in the water. I found that I could connect an Aastra VOIP phone or a SunRocket VOIP adapter made by InnoMedia in place of this phone and they both worked perfectly so I know there was nothing wrong at my end.

First of all, there is the longest movie that tells you the story of the princess and about the snotty person named Jamie. By the way, if you are a boy, Jamie is a girl. If you are a girl, Jamie is a boy, that means you can marry him/her. My first day was OK. You don't have a barn or anything! You have to buy the barns, and then buy the animals! It's to hard for me.

Like, 'I couldn't stand it and had to turn it off' cheesy.I liked Wonderful Life for Gamecube much better. Magical Melody tries to be kinda like Friends of Mineral Town, which I've already played, so I was looking for new imporvements in the game!

It is easier to collect money in this game than in previous harvest moon games. it is also easier to get friendship points and keep track of progress. there are many more different crops in this game compared to the other harvest moons that i have played. There are also many bachelors and bachelorettes to choose from in this game. The only cons in this game is that it takes a long time to have a baby and it is hard to marry Jamie. Overall, however, this game is one of the best harvest moon games i have ever played."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very fun and addictive game","review":"I thought this game was great. It was a definite improvement from Harvest Moon: A Wonderful Life. You can do a lot more and it keeps you occupied. The only disappointing aspect about it is that your kid can't grow up. Otherwise, I definitely recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun! Fun! Fun!","review":"As an adult I find this game extremely entertaining when I want to just have mindless enjoyment! I find myself looking up hints on the internet to get ideas on how to make friends with the other villagers. I am playing as the girl and started another game where I am the boy so I have the outlook of both characters, great fun. I am quite busy looking after the livestock and watering or picking my crops, the days are varied and you can do as little or as much as you want in a day. You do have to be careful not to exhaust your character though. Recommend for everyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard!!!","review":"When I bought the Harvest moon magical melody I was really excited. But after playing it for about 10 min. I got frustraited and traded it in. For this game was a huge let down compared to Wonderful Life harvest moon.

There are more festivals, the seasons go by quickly, and there is more to do. All in all you get what you paid for :)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harvest Moon Magical Melody is the BEST!","review":"I think Harvest Moon Magical Melody is the BEST HARVEST MOON GAME EVER! It was the 3 Harvest Moon game I ever got and its still my favorite Harvest Moon game. I think it is the perfect blend of easy and hard. The only flaw is that it is very hard to marry Jammie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harvest Moon Magical Melody","review":"I haven't been a player of Harvest Moon for very long, but I think this game is probably the best one. There's a lot more personalization options than, say, A Wonderful Life. There are lots of ways to make money, so you don't have to work the fields if you don't want to. (I personally prefer anything other than actual crop farming.) You can choose boy or girl, and there are 10 spouse options for either gender. There are also lots of mini games and festivals for participation. It takes a while to get your farm started, and you have to be creative in ways to get money saved up, but if you like Harvest Moon that's not a problem. And this game goes on forever so there's no rush on when you have to get married. I definately recommend this game!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Farming Fun","review":"This is a great game in the Harvest Moon series. The graphics are cute and bright the music is fun and is a pleasure to hear every day instead of a pain. The gameplay is like the rest of the games and involves crop growing and raising animals on a farm. There are plenty of festivals to enjoy throughout the year, lots of interesting characters, a variety of mini-games and a wide range of choice for marriage. The best thing about it is the ability to play as either a boy or a girl! It's a brilliant game that will keep you playing for months."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun for the whole family","review":"I bought this game with money from Christmas and now my parents are playing this game as much as or more than I am."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING!","review":"an amazing game for farm loving games<3 i absolutely ADORE this game<3 it is a definite must have game! its great for kids, teens and adults<3 all ages and all sorts of fun :D get this game!"},{"rating":"1","title":"okay","review":"I just start playing it. It's alittle more complicated than the other Harvest moons. One thing I dont like: At first you can store more than 5 things in your rucksack. You dont have the option to move the camera angle around to see where your going. You will get lost quick. You see when you play it. I will continue to play... Also you have a tired meter and you can revive youself by eating or sleeping. If you do too much and food is not around you will faint and end up in the docs offices. It;s fun once you know what your doing."},{"rating":"1","title":"ADDICTING.............BUT HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Even though all the other Harvest Moon games are great, this one, however, is not good at all.It's addicting,I'll admitt that, but the graphics are horrible and very hard to accomplish. I've had this game for about three days, and i'm not even a quarter of the way through with it. True, it has a good story line to it, but not my first choice. If I was you, I'd stick with the first ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard, but fun","review":"When I rented this game, I knew it would be fun, and it was, but, it was really hard.

It worked fine for a couple of weeks. However, it has been failing ever since. Once (last year) I returned it to an authorized dealer, and they told me the main board had a general failure, and they replaced it. However it has continued failing (the most annoying problem is that it sometimes resets itself). This is not the whole story. The hybernation mode doesn't work properly: if I close the display for it to hibernate or to be in stand-by, it won't restore. It also has problems with display lens: if I leave it on for a while, the display turns off, and when it turns on after moving the mouse, the display doesn't work well. I called Toshiba's hotline to see if they could replace it, but they refused. You may say I had bad luck....well, I've been finding out that I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE. So, I strongly suggest NOT TO BUY TOSHIBA LAPTOPS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"Had the 4600/1Ghz/256/30Gig/DVD/CDRW for about 3 months. Love everything about it.

Glass is thin and handle is flimsy","review":"I love the size of this press and certainly the cost was a benefit too. I didn't find problems with the seal or loss of heat others complained of. Unfortunately, it is another case of you get what you pay for. The glass is so thin, it broke very easily when it came in contact with my faucet. I then ordered a new beaker for $20 and it was broken before I opened the brown Amazon box. This just further illustrates how thin the glass is. The handle is flimsy too. It certainly works, but it feels like it is ready to break. I would save your money and get something that is a bit more expensive. It will last longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not happy","review":"The product works perfectly, however, it is advertised as a \\"THREE CUP\\" which it certainly is NOT.

However... my HUSBAND loves this stuff as much as I do. We've tried many \\"flavors\\" and the Cinnamon Buns smells just like walking by Cinnabons in the mall. I have my hair highlighted, and this product actually works great on color treated hair. It's not too harsh, and has a light conditioner (although I choose to use additional conditioner). It's great for traveling. One bottle for shampoo, soap, conditioner.I bought a no brand 3 in one product at Target, it was much cheaper, but not as silky and foamy as this product.Angela"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me","review":"I love the way it smells but it gave me a rash!

I picked the remainder of it out with my fingernail and it looks better than it did with the filler in the chip.What kind of company ships a product poorly repaired with wood filler right on top?Probably should have returned it, but hey, it's only a napkin holder.Made in Taiwan, btw."},{"rating":"2","title":"Trendy & Stylish","review":"We bought this holder for when we entertain guests with our everyday tableware & we've received tons of compliments! The front flap bends forward & back to make it adjustable (which means when you have less napkins than the size of the holder when both flaps are straight up & down, the napkins don't droop), which means when there are less napkins and the flap is folded inward, you can pull napkins out with ease without tugging & tearing.This system makes it quite trendy & it is over all very stylish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"It would have been a nice napkin holder if it had arrived in good condition.

What more could you ask for?I was looking for something that could sit on the counter all the time and not appear tacky - like a plastic holder would."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bamboo adjustable napkin holder","review":"I love this item because you can tighten the holder so that the napkins don't blow away when you are outside.

It also matches my other bamboo items that I bought."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was very disapointed in this item","review":"I purchased this napkin holder and when I received it, it was not packed in bubble wrap just a package and when I opened it up it was all in pieces.

This could have just been a fluke, hopefully other holders will be just fine for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Napkin Holder","review":"This fits in good on my breakfast table.

The main song \\"Tomorrow\\" by Salif Keita isn't among the selections for this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"The one and only Jean Valjean","review":"I saw the movie for the first time when I was 10. I am not of the French background. I fell in love with the mistique of France. Partly it happened because of the inspiring characters created by Jean Gabin and other gaints of the Hexagon. A discovery for everyone who thinks about G-d, destiny, duty, revolution. To my opinion, that is the only version that wouldn't have made Victor Hugo livid had he seen it. Jean Gabin will always remain the only \\"authorized\\", canonic Jean Valjean. All other musicals and shows, no matter how flamboyant and and new agy, are lacking that \\"since 1815\\" cognac-like nobility that Jean Gabin embodies so well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Les Miserables à la Dickens","review":"This film was disappointing, particularly in the awful dubbing. The voices bear no resemblance to the stars' actual voices and I was shocked to find that it was not in French with subtitles. No, it did not say that it was, but I guess I assumed it would be, not being a really well-known foreign film. The Javert doesn't hold a candle to Charles Laughton's evil portrayal; this guy just looks like a dithery older man who somehow got into a bad situation. The Cosette also seems like an airhead. Though the story can hold it's own through almost any treatment, the dubbing was the biggest problem. It did, however, point up the Dickensian situations and characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"review for the 1957 Miserables with Gabin and Blier....","review":"...distributed by Unicorn Video. I have to be specific because somehow it seems that the Blier and the Ventura versions got mixed up. I love the movie, it is one of my favorites, but the DVD is absolutely horrible.

Errol Flynn is the \\"real\\" Robin Hood."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect film, outstanding extras","review":"Warners have celebrated Errol Flynn's greatest film and one of the studio's greatest achievements with this spectacular 2 disc special edition. The merits of the film are well documented - perfect casting, perfect score, a timeless adventure, spectacular colour. The print is perfect and the extras on this DVD are overwhelming. Try this for starters:- a beautifully paced and delivered commentary by Rudy Behlmer, filled with interesting information from the Warner's archives and production notes- an hilarious Daffy Duck cartoon with Porky Pig as Friar Tuck.- recently discovered outakes from the vaults with Rudy Behlmer explaining where they fit in- home movies during taken production.- a complete soundtrack of Eric Wolfgang Korngold's score- a documentary on the history of the legend of Robin Hood including scenes from Douglas Fairbank's silent versionThe is just a sample of material on this DVD.

Such as James Cagney was origianlly picked to star as Robin Hood but had a fight with the bosses and walked off the lot.There's also a short about one of the masters of the bow, Howard Hill. A couple Merrie Melodies cartoons starring Buggs and Daffy. And best of all, a behind the scenes look at the stars who made up the extraordinary cast.For those of us who grew up on such fare, this is a must have.

So when Errol Flynn's Robin Hood finally came out in DVD, I knew I had to get it. I was afraid, like other old movies and TV sitcoms, that the passage of time would not be gentle to Robin Hood.

I really enjoy this story and have for many years. But BD expanded capabilities should have been used. Even though, as expected, the movie is 4:3 it doesn't appear that any effort was made to find the best print. This WHOLE thing, even extras, is just a copy from DVD/VHS versions. Some of the extras have no tie overall and in fact a few are just simply filler. The History of Robin Hood files is filmed 4:3 format in 1998. Clearly any film prior to 1953 should only be purchased on normal DVD. Between 1959 and 1960 one will have to see how it was shot, print used or extra content before purchasing a BD version.

Must watching for teenagers being brainwashed by the NEA. Shows the evils of government when evil people take control."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this version of Robin Hood","review":"After studying Robin Hood in school, we were looking for a dramatization that was not too intense or violent for 5 and 7 year olds. This Errol Flynn version is light hearted and funny, communicating the fun elements of the legend. Love the optimism of movies from this period, even if they are \\"unrealistic\\" to some degree."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timeless Fun","review":"I had forgotten how much fun it would be to watch this Hollywood classic again after so many years. It's beautifully produced and acted by it's cast ensemble. Can be a little silly at times but, what the heck, I had lots of fun throughout watching it.Errol Flynn is in a fabulous athletic shape wearing his Robin Hood's tights and Miss De Havilland just looks gorgeous in technicolor.The DVD itself is a very decent version of BluRay without many of the grainy artifacts I encountered on others BluRay's titles purchased recently.So, if you just wanna have fun and be delighted with the extravagantly colorful scenery os Sherwood, the price is just right."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Greatest American Film","review":"Like any great work of art, this movie transcends the passage of time -- a storybook come to life, as one critic put it. Beautifully designed and photographed, perfectly acted, and magnificently scored, it's got everything a movie should have. A few years ago, I saw it in a revival theater and they read a letter from Olivia de Havilland in Paris, who said it had a special place in her heart for reasons that are obvious. Amen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Family Fun","review":"This is a wonderful classic adventure film, which can be enjoyed by the whole family despite the fact a number of persons meet their end by the sword or bow and arrows of Robin Hood. The action scenes are well staged but there is little in the way of blood spilled on the silver screen. Errol Flynn does a superb job of filling the role of the hero and the other actors are also well cast and rise to the occasion.As for my criticism, Robin seems a little too over confident at times during the situations he places himself in but I guess being familiar with the script helped Errol with this point. For someone who can split an arrow in half with his own from many yards away it is also difficult to believe that Robin could not recognize King Richard from a few feet away. Finally, some of the costumes seem more suited for a high school play.If you can overlook these latter points and just going along for the ride I am sure you will enjoy this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good picture but no so good sound","review":"Very good picture but no so good sound,I d'nt notice there is a sound treatment on it, now a day there area lot of digital technics for reberding a new sound aspect, the image thanks to technicolor system ys verygood for me (I'm 70) this is the best version of the film, good scenarios, good lighting technics anda very appropriate team of actors, the only issue that d'nt matches the quality of the whole film is sound quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"They Don't Come Any Better Than This!","review":"For 30 years this has been my favorite film. Everything came together perfectly for this movie and it wears very well. It's full of sweep, romance, and spectacle. The 3-strip Technicolor used back then, and subsequently abandoned, holds up better than modern films whose color can degenerate to purple within 7 short years. I can only echo the comments made by others on the casting,the costumes, music, etc. Flynn, De Havilland, Rathbone, and Raines were never better. This is such a fun movie; you cannot watch it without feeling uplifted or exhilerated. James Goldman, I think it was, said that while the story of King Arthur is the most important legend in English speaking countries (because of its theme of fair government); the legend of Robin Hood is the most beloved. Rightly so. No other movie depicts the reason why as well as the 1938 Warner Brothers version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet Movie","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I normally do not watch movies more than once, but this one proved to be an exception."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get the DVD if you want to see this movie","review":"It's a romance. Very sweet. The love scenes and kissing scenes alone would be worth seeing, I believe, by most lesbians or anyone interested in very steamy woman to woman affection. The DVD shows more detail than the VHS does. The entire movie is very artsy in nature and the circus scenes are really fantastic, particularly the two female trapeze artists."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite by far.","review":"This is my favorite lesbian film ever made and trust me, I have seen just about everything out there.At the time it came out and even today, it is a radical film because of the character's lack of shame ultimately for how they feel and who they are. The film is visually so artistic and beautiful and also very magical in many ways too, just ask the dog. The actersses are beautiful in a very natural and real way and their chemistry is intense. It is a unique story too, done in a way I have never seen before or since. I am not a artsy person really but so many of my friends are and often I find their interests/creations/tastes over the top for me in stretching my open mind. This film has some scenes that are very circus (dont think elephants think Cirque de Solais) like and very magical and they are entertaining in a unique way. They often have a dream like quality that simply makes you feel good. Some scenes from this film are so strikingly beautiful they stick with you forever."},{"rating":"2","title":"romance2thefullest!","review":"i liked this movie alot i didnt realize how open minded i was the 2 actresses had great chemistry u thought of them as a real couple! and the music no words can descibe this music i love it but i cant find it anywhere but ill keep looking.

Each time I find myself falling in love with the both characters, they appear to have a chemistry I liken to Xena and Gabrielle. This is different though, as we only see this unfold in the course of a few weeks. The opening scene becomes very important, as we see Camille's inner desire, and when she kisses Petra for the first time, you can feel the excitement and utter fear of the realization of ones sexuality. That scene alone could foretell the final scene...What joy for a film of this genre to have a happy ending. Watch this movie with an open mind, admire the courage of accepting differences, and appreciate love...all love"},{"rating":"2","title":"makes me want to join the sideshow","review":"if you are any sort of romantic person, any sort of artist or poet, or simply enjoy watching original films- check this out. aside from being a stylish lesbian love story involving performers with fire and such, it is a story about taking risks and letting go of what identifies, and mis-identifies us as humans.the set/design and cinematography are lush, the women in the lead rolls are relatable, and the plot is tangeable. great mix.i saw this movie in the theatre when it first came out, instantly adored it. When Night is Falling had such a lasting impression on me that i have been urging others to see it since."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sexy, romantic and elegant","review":"This movie is all of the above, plus it is visually stunning.

It has an air of mystery and sensuality that it pulls off very well. I loved the storyline, the Sirkus of Sorts, the funny quotes added in. A favourite \\"romantic/lovestory\\" movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tender, beautiful, believable, warm, wonderful story!\\"","review":"This beautiful, tender love story is another of my healing and gentle \\"recovering from Christianity\\" gems (see the book Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit by Jeanette Winterson). Petra gently, patiently and lovingly draws Camille out, and does it with love and tenderness. Camille is not greeted with the same love and tenderness in her other life, although she is admittedly not met with the hatefulness and viciousness so typical of present day fundamentalist/charismatic Christianity. She finds her redemption and resurrection in the love of a beautiful woman. The story is beautifully drawn, the plot flows, and where there are awkward spots, they reflect the awkwardness the heroine herself is feeling. I have seen this movie several times and I have loved it and seen something new in it each time. I recommend it highly as a superb love story, gay or straight!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best Lesbian Films","review":"I am a Lesbian. I have seen plenty of lesbian movies.

I wouldn't consider him an aggressive baby or even iron man but this toy only took about two whacks from the hammer and it cracked in about 5 places and started coming apart in pieces. I returned it and found the plastic Fisher Price version which is hard to find, it's not made anymore, but you can find it on Ebay or in resale shops. It's well worth the search because this toy does not hold up."},{"rating":"1","title":"this toy is not age appropriate","review":"I thought my twin boys (15 months) would enjoy this toy as they love beating on pots and pans and I thought they would like the cause and effect aspect of this toy. However, it takes so much force to move the balls through the holes that they quickly became frustrated and lost interest in the toy altogether. Even my husband has a hard time moving the balls through the holes-he has to beat on it full force about ten times before they go through! I think the toy is good in theory but your little one would have to have the strength of Hercules to enjoy this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well made but beware","review":"This is a nice wooden toy that kept my little one busy. However, the wooden balls are heavy and my older \\"spirited\\" son managed to wing one at our van window and shatter it. Just keep that in mind :o)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Design!","review":"I bought this for my 14 month old. I figured that it may take a few tries, but he would be able to hit the ball through the holes. After trying this myself, I regretted buying it immediately. I myself got so frustrated trying to get the ball hammered through the holes, I had to put it away. As for the comment about the sandpaper, we tried it and it doesn't work because it's the size of the inside plastic ring that controls the size of the holes and that cannot be altered. If you remove the ring, the balls just fall through. I consider this a useless toy and would not recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brett Dennen review from www.mmreview.com","review":"This is that rare and wonderful thing-a brilliant debut album from a mature young artist with a sound like nothing you have ever heard. Dennen's voice sounds like it's caught somewhere between adolescence and adulthood, but he sings with the idiosyncratic confidence of Van Morrison. His guitar playing crackles with jazzy melody and he has already learned that less means more. Dennen's unique phrasing syncopates with the playing to make you tap your toes as you absorb his superbly crafted songs. The material is often unabashedly spiritual, invested with down-to-earth intensity and sincerity. Brett Dennen has it all together and the production lets it shine. It's all that good-essential! -Michael Devlin"},{"rating":"2","title":"Reminiscent of Paul Simon","review":"You can't deny the spirituality and heart that Brett puts into his music.

All of the songs on here are so great. My 3 favorites are: Desert Sunrise, By & By, and Just Like The Moon.

It has 250,000 words and phrases, and 400,000 translations. It also comes with 24 themed pages of illustrations along with some color maps. Larousse calls it a dictionary with an encyclopedic touch and I would have to agree with them."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Dictionary is great!","review":"Wonderful dictionary, contains all one needs to study the French language.

He is orphaned by a car accident, and has to live with his \\"square\\" aunt Enid. Suffice to say, Enid isn't that glad to have Harold around; she's afraid her lover Archie won't like Harold. Added to the mix is the sudden reappearence of Enid's father(and Harold's grandfather) Abe, who is dying. Harold learns some things about himself, but everyone in the novel is frankly unlikable and dull. Albert doesn't help things by making us want to yell at Enid. All in all, at less than 200 pages, it is brief enough, but it is a dull way to pass an afternoon"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pricey but nice","review":"I've had this for going on five years.

Wide and then tapered it is topped by an imaginative ruby tone shape - a pout, a kiss, a heart? All of these signify romance, which is most definitely appropriate for this subtly sensuous fragrance.Princess Marcella Borghese launched this scent in 1993 and like all classics it has withstood the test of time. Its floral fragrance is as fresh today as it was when introduced. A very feminine scent it has additional notes of fruit - plum, peach, plus musk and cedarwood.I never tire of Il Bacio - summer, winter, springtime or fall.- Gail Cooke"},{"rating":"2","title":"My fav fragrance","review":"Had just about given up on ever wearing this fragrance again since it had been discontinued at the major department stores but was pleasantly surprised to find it at amazon.com!

There just is no scent and lets face it that is what draws most of us to the philosophy line is that great smell. All this being said, from the other reviews I gather I am in the minority and have to figure that the bottle I received was defective.

Whereas I counted countless errors, I think the most telling is that the authors did not know that Cesar Chavez was the eldest son in the Chavez family.

Originally slated to be called \\"Sold Out!\\" and then \\"Standing Room Only\\", this Golden Globe winner offers fans a rare glimpse into \\"behind the scenes\\" and on stage of an Elvis Presley 70's tour. In his lifetime Elvis performed nearly 1,200 live shows! All the excitement of an Elvis show is captured here. Catch Presley back stage rehearsing, recording in the studio and entertaining thousands of fans across the country! There is something for everybody in this film. It's just too bad that literally hours of footage from these tours remains locked away in the MGM vaults.

He dons jumpsuits and gains weight. We see his increasing boredom. Elvis disintegrated after his divorce from Priscilla. Lyrics became morbid. Burning Love was the last big hit. His records were good until the end, but there was little recording the last two years. The film got the Golden Globe Award for Best Documentary. It is chaotic but worth it because it is candid Elvis. The quote from his father about guitar players not being worth a damn would not have come out a decade earlier. Elvis' songlist is filled with hits by other artists. His own Lawdy Miss Clawdy sounds as sexy today as it did in the beginning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elvis Slipping Away","review":"This is Elvis in a decidedly post-comeback funk, looking tired, stoned and bored much of the time, going through a routine that he, very obviously, was no longer enjoying a great deal. At one point in the film, Elvis is sitting in the back of his limousine after a show and asks, half-heartedly, \\"How was the sound in that building\\" as if he could care less. As one of his bodyguards noted after his death, Elvis needed a challenge more than anybody he knew, and the challenge by 1972 was no longer there. Compare this depressing documentary with the exuberant, involved Elvis of his '68 Comeback Special and Elvis--That's The Way It Is in 1970 and you plainly see the rapid deterioration that ultimately would lead to his death in his Graceland bathroom only five years later."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest Christmas gift of all","review":"I love this dvd.

For example, he explains that what happened at Zeitoun in 1968 \\"becomes clear\\" (or was it \\"becomes completely obvious\\"). Well, it certainly wasn't obvious to me, and, for my money, it cheapened an otherwise careful, thoughtful analysis to proffer such flubgubbery. I also found it disappointing to read such fascinating occurrences--documented, absolutely-true-you've-got-to-trust-me and all--only to discover that the \\"references\\" for them were to be found in the august likes of National Enquirer, Weekly World News, and such (never forget the sight gag in \\"Airplane!\\" where, while all the other journals tell of the airline disaster, Weekly World News's headline is \\"Boy Trapped in Refrigerator Eats Own Foot\\")."},{"rating":"1","title":"The best Freddy sequel in the series","review":"A couple of cheesy killings and Freddy going on a wild rampage at a party actually make this entertaining.

Anyway, the horrid plot, if you want to call it that, is Freddy returns to the kids on elm street, via the main character's body, played by Mark Patton.

Kim Myers is a good actor but she does not fit in this roll like she did in Bloodline. Freddy still is a psycotic killer but he changed into more of a jokester which really is killing the series. Also Mark patton's character whines and cries through out the movie like a little baby and it really kills the movie. This movie is just for hardcore fans or people collecting the entire series. This only gets two stars because of the violence and gore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easily the worst of the series","review":"I always wondered why this movie was even made. It made no sense at all. From the begining I never even understood why Freddy has to posses someone's body in order to come back and terrify Springwood. Later on in the movie, it is impoosible to the way Freddy would haunt tenagers and dissapear in thin air, way too unrealistic and confusing. The part where Freddy came out of the boy's body and killed his friend was sick, and not very scary. A disgrace to the original. A good thing Wes Craven was involved in part 3 which should have been part 2."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but some parts didn't fit","review":"Surprisingly enough, I liked this sequel to a much much better movie. You can't really take horror sequels too seriously, and this movie is proof of that. It definetly takes you on a different twist compared to Nancy's story in the original. Basically, a teenager and his family move into Nancy's house 5 years after the \\"incident\\" and weird things start to happen (Birds spontaneously combust) and of course the star of the movie starts having Freddy dreams. But in contrast to the original, Freddy starts to take over this boy's body, and well, I don't want to spoil it for you. It is a pretty well mapped out movie. There is tons of gore, even the kind that makes you cringe a little bit. Freddy kind of stays in the shadows and eventually pulls into real-life, which is the problem, he just starts to pop up in real-life without any explanation, kind of inane. Oh well.

A lot of it having to do with the gay undertones (Coach Schneider...well you know what he was planning on doing when he took Jesse to the school). But besides that, I give this movie props because it is definetly the last time we see Freddy being dark and scary. I started out not liking this movie. Then I started watching it more and more and realized that they did a really good job with it.Another problem some fans have is the pool scene. And in all honesty, I'm not thrilled about it either. They should have established Freddy as being a killer in dreams more before taking him out into the real world. In my opinion, they rushed that idea a little too quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"There is only one good thing about this film.","review":"I rented this film and the only good thing about it was that I did not buy it.

Released in 1985 on a small budget of $3,000,000 the film made over $30,000,000 at the box office and continued people's fascination with Freddy Kruger played to perfection by Robert Englund. Wes Craven, the writer and creator of the original refused to be a part of the movie citing he never intended for \\"A Nightmare on Elm Street\\" to be a franchise and he simply didn't like the ideas the studio and producer's had for the sequel. Also, Freddy only appears in about 13 minutes of the film. Despite all this the movie is fun, exciting and features a bunch of new actors who prove they do have acting chops, especially openly gay actor Mark Patton who receives top billing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Freddy Returns... Too Bad the Scares Didn't","review":"Wes Craven's \\"A Nightmare on Elm Street\\" is one of my favorite films of all time... It combines a campy/low budget feel with really creepy music, a manic and freakish villain and creative set pieces that immerse the viewer in their worst nightmare. It's really too bad that the only amazing thing about this sequel is Fred Kruger (played once again to chilling perfection by Robert Englund.) The main character is really hard to relate to, and he's not the best actor either! Lisa was a character I liked, and the ending was stellar and frightening... but only heightened my disappointment in the overall wastefulness of this film. (2 stars for Freddy, Lisa and the amazing score by Christopher Young.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good follow up to a great movie","review":"This was awful. Nobody can really say 5 was worse than this. Weak movie with bad acting and awful plot. Freddy Kruger wasn't the least bit scary in this and most of it was just down right stupid.

To be fair I think part 4 wasn't bad but it only proved how bad part 3 was. I mean don't get me wrong part 3 had good acting and a somewhat believable progression assuming that Freddy is what people say he is. However part 2 kept with the formula Freddy is a man to be feared. Why because he'll chop your bird into pieces in the middle of the day and haunt your dreams at night. No but seriously unlike part 6 that says the whole story was just a movie franchise and \\"Dream Warriors\\" this movie actually haunts congrats to the director! Ok so some of is strange, but sit back and enjoy the ride!

It might be a good movie if it wasnt N.O.E.S. 2. Its kind of like Halloween 3 is the black sheep to the other Halloweens.

The movie starts out fine with Freddy trying to scare the young man Jesse in his dreams, but the movie gets out of line. Freddy then starts to possess Jesse's body out of nowhere, and later Freddy comes into the world and even dissapers again, and the movie get's real confusing. It tries to scare the audience but too many things did not make sense in the movie as it sarts too get boring very rapidly. It had some gruesome scenes that seemed more gross that spine-chilling, at least to me. Luckily Wes Craven got involved in Part 3 which should have been part 2. This movie does not even relate to the rest of the other Nighymare movies. Avoid at all costs, the movies a joke."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst of the series","review":"This movie doesn't really even take place in the dream world; it's all about freddy using this guy's body in the REAL world to kill.

Freddy Krueger was supposed to be terrorizing children of parents who burned Freddy not anyone who just moves into the house. The acting was bad and there wasn't much action. The movie also seems really short, lasting just over and hhour and 10 minutes. The only good part was the bus scene at the begining and end because I hate school buses and they had the right idea with that one. I don't recommend this movie at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not A Very Good Sequel!","review":"This isn't the best sequel, that's for sure. But Part 2 is better than Part 5.

It is very painful to watch. This is one of the reasons I wouldn't recommend getting the Nightmare On Elm Street Collection. The plot is to laugh and loop holes just seem to be abundant. After watching this once it is almost impossible to watch it a second time (unless you've had a few beers, maybe). It is a film about a kid who becomes possessed by Freddy and cannot control himself from killing those he dislikes. Really awful gym teacher character who we'd rather not see in leather or naked at all. I would recommend the 1st, 3rd, New Nightmare, and even Freddy Vs. Jason over the rest of the bunch, but this one I would have to say is the worst. We could all live without."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nightmare 2 Review","review":"Poor sequel to Wes Craven's brilliant original film. In this awful follow-up, they decide that rather than following the format laid down in the original, they want to go and make Freddy into what they believe he should be. Rather than a film about a maniac terrorizing teens in their dreams, this is pretty much a really bad haunted house picture.This one has a new kid (Mark Patton) moving into the house from the original. For some reason, Freddy is invading his body and subsquentaly driving him into insanity. There are a few cool sequences with a school bus and a pool party but the story really kills this one before it even gets started. A thinly-disguised bisexual subplot is thrown in for reasons unknown and never really fully explained."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my favorite, but it has the BEST horror death!","review":"In general, this is by far, not my favorite horror film (actually, I don't watch horror films anymore). However, the very best scene in any horror film is in this one: the murder of Coach Schneider in the shower! It was both hysterical and gruesome at the same time; I LOVE that scene! I'm surprised that not many other horror fans comment on that scene. It is SO COOL!

The film then procedes through sequences of demonic possesion by freddy as he corupts the mind of young Jesse, until the poor boy does not know if he is the killer aka freddy kruger or himself. Not bad for a second outing for the nightmare series."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a farce","review":"Well it started out good, but as the movie drug on it became weaker and weaker and weaker till it finally lost all elements of horror.

This movie is a bad movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"A major step down from the original","review":"After Wes Craven crafted a classic with the original Nightmare on Elm Street, this second installment debuted a year later with Jack Sholder (The Hidden) at the helm. Much of the suspense and eerie atmosphere from the original film is replaced here with some great gore effects and set pieces, but as a whole is a very poor comparison to the original with an uncompelling and contradictory storyline (the presence of Wes Craven is sorely missed) and characters that we could really care less about. Craven would return as co-writer in the next installment, Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors, which was a big step above this lackluster entry in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE SEQUEL HAS IT'S MOMENTS, BUT NOWHERE NEAR AS GOOD AS THE ORIGINAL!","review":"I am reviewing the entire Nightmare on Elm Street series, but not this DVD release. I own the box set and I wanted to do individual reviews for each film.The original film is viewed by many as a \\"classic\\"! Even though I do not share this opinion, I do like the original film a lot more than this confusing and uneven sequel. It's still a fun film to watch around Halloween and it does have it's moments.

Jesse befriends Lisa and he tells her about his nightmares. Together they find out about Freddy and what has happened in the house. Grady warns Jesse but he doe not believe him at first.

I've seen movies that couldn't scare an infant, The Ring, and I have to say that this is taking too much heat. What is wrong with it? I don't see any problem with it. When do you watch a horror movie for the acting or story? You watch horror movies to see jumps, scares, gore, sex, drugs, nudity, and especially a sick sense of humor that when you think about it when you laugh, you feel like you must be the most evil person ever. ... I don't care if a horror movie has bad acting, the acting should make you just want to watch to see their fate. I want enough to get the the scares, gratuitous nudity, drugs, sex, and gore. I don't care if the story is Citizen Kane, horror movies are meant for people to just shut their brains down and watch something that they can talk with their friends about later. A popcorn movie.

In fact, fans of Freddy Krueger find this movie awful. I tend to agree.

Wes Craven was right to decide not to have anyything to do with this film. He never even was on any of the credits until the very end of the cast at the end.

The viewers most certainly feel the brunt of his anger in this movie that seem to have been produced only to cash in on the success of the first movie.The story is about teenager Jesse Walsh (Patton) that move in to Nancy Thompsons (the heroine of the first movie) house.This time Freddy's aproach to killing off kids is different, as he apparantly uses Jesses body to commit the crimes, and it is up to his girlfriend to put a stop to Krueger(Englund).The movie seems to lack alot of the charm and the humor that the original had. The only reason to be thankful for this movie, is that we got A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors, which in my opinion is the best of the movies"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Underrated Nightmare","review":"NOES 2 is very well acted, with characters the audience believes in and even sympathizes with. Clu Gulager is great and funny as usual, and Mark Patton plays a very believable scared kid. Freddy is what he should be, an evil, maleovent, boogieman everyone is scared of. The opening scene is right out of any school age child's worst nightmare, and ties in well with the bleak ending. The effects are top rate, and it contains some disturbing scenes and images. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"The dookie stain of the series","review":"Five years after the events of the original film, A teenage boy who's new in town [Mark Patton] moves into Freddy's old house and he begins being haunted in his dreams by Freddy. Soon, Freddy begins killing the local teens and he's also making an attempt to possess the boy's brain. This movie was a sure misfire. What started as a truly terrifying story with the first film spirals down into a mess with this film. The characters are boring, The story's extremely weak, Freddy seems to have nothing to do, and the movie as a whole seriously lacks direction. I say you should just skip this movie because it ain't even worth a watch. Not even the murders in this movie are good. Probably the worst movie in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not scary","review":"I just didn't find this second installment to Nightmare On Elm Street scary at all. And neither did my Dad. It's definitely, so far, the worst Freddy film. The only bit that really freaked me out was the demonic parakeet, and that's mainly because I have a bird myself. I didn't like the lead guy either - he was a bit wimpy wasn't he? It also has the highest body count of all the Nightmare films, but none of them were that different to any other slasher movie.I hope the rest are better, cos I did buy the seven disc box set. Hmmmm. It also doesn't use Charles Bernstein's original theme, or a variation of it, which is disappointing, as I do like that theme.I'm gonna try and forget this film, and keep watching the rest, I just hope this was just a mishap.Oh, and look out for the REAL Robert Englund in a very, very brief role as the bus driver in the opening sequence. It's very quick, and you'll be thinking \\"did I see him or didn't I?\\" Yes, it is him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Your WORST Nightmare!","review":"Nightmare 2 was definatly the worst of the series. It was more gory and obnoxious than scary. The movie was released in 1985, a year after the original was released, but it's supposed to take place 5 years later? There were some good scenes though. Like the school bus scene and the pool party scene. The rest of it was gory, confusing, and stupid."},{"rating":"1","title":"ACCEPTABLE","review":"part 2 in the series isnt \\"ridiculous\\", its just lacking. The killing count is too low in this movie. The plot wasnt all that bad but Freddy could have caused more blood shed than he did. I like when he raided the pool party but it did over step the boundaries, because Freddy is supposed to be mysterious and hardly anyone knowing about him. i think it could have been a hell of alot better. Bottom line Part 2 did \\"just enough\\" to spark another sequel, had it been any less than what it is, Part 3 may have not gotten any attention."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please Tell Me Why this Was Necessary","review":"Once \\"The Very Best of 10cc\\" was released in 1997, it was the collection to have.

For some parts of the songs, there's too much \\"empty\\" wordless space and in some spots as well as too much crammed in some spots.

Everybody and I mean everybody dies, except for the plant. What I did like was the deleted scenes of utter mayhem with Oscar worthy special effects / miniatures. To see these deleted scenes you have to get this version. And it doesn't have the option of 'alternate endings'.

That I used to watch it on averidge at least twice a week untill I was about 13? It's true. This is what got me into musical therter, and I'll always love it.The romance between Seymoer and audrey is so sweet and touching, and is really the best part of the musical. Add in something *really* interesting like a man eating plant, and you've got a great story.Oh, and the music.

I really like the special features on the DVD. I didn't know some of the cast memebers could sing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Unsung Gem","review":"This little gem of a musical cannot be recommended more. It stars Rick Moranis as geeky Seymour, a guy whose totally in love with his sweet co-worker Audrey. However, she is in a relationship with an abusive dentist. When a talking plant appears from outer space though, things have got to change for the better, right? An astonishingly original concept - which was actually borrowed from the horror original by Roger Corman, with an early appearance by Jack Nicholson - is brought to life by Frank Oz, director of The Dark Crystal and Bowfinger, also starring Steve Martin. The songs are outstanding and are performed with much gusto by the leading actors, particularly Ellen Greene, who reprises the role of Audrey which she played in the stage version. The film was not a huge success when it was first released, but has rightly established a cult following since then. Long may it continue!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Total Entertainment","review":"This version of Little Shop of Horrors, is a rare case of a remake surpassing the original.

The music is great, the story is hilarious, and the casting is perfect (I'm not a real big Rick Moranis fan, but I can't imagine anyone else playing the part of Seymour Krelborn).

After finger pricks aren't enough to satisfy the original thinker, the sweeper begins killing people to feed the plant until is learns to feed itself and alterior motives come into play. Outrageous ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW genre flick is one of the best of it's kind and a rarity to be blunt.

I had been anticipating and looking forward to seeing this masterpiece finally be perfected; unfortunately, I discovered the devastating fact that the image quality was still just as poor as the edition that was first released back in 1998. This reality caught me totally off guard since Warner Brothers has come such a long way in dvd quality, especially with the release of \\"Pee-Wee's Big Adventure\\". Don't get me wrong, but it is rather upsetting that Warner was able to do such a good job on the \\"Pee-Wee\\" dvd and still only do a so-so job to the visual quality on such a cult classic as this much-loved gem.

A movie with a superb soundtrack and filled with comical, lighthearted situations.Recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"No \\"mumbo-jumbo jive\\" here...","review":"As always, Dolly is down-right adorable, exuding style, grace and class, and at the same time looking lovely while she shares her unique pearls of wisdom in both her dialogue and songs; the latter being largely tailor-made for the film and still strong enough to stand on their own. In addition to her remarkable singing voice, what an infectious laugh this talented lady has! James Woods is at his most charming and comedic. The cast as a whole does quite well and the story is engaging. This is a fun film that has held up well over the years. A nice respite from the cares of the world that makes you want to believe that life could really work out this way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Likeable, light romantic comedy, not stars' best work","review":"The somewhat schmaltzy formula used to concoct this film makes for a very light story that is funny in a family-cute way. The predictability for me is well summed by the self-indulgent irony the creative staff displays in things like naming the reporter \\"Jack Russell\\" like the terrier. I enjoy the film and came to Amazon looking to order a copy because it is a nice all-family entertainment piece, though in story and characterizations are unsatisfying, as they flatten James Woods' natural charisma and fail to elicit the endearingly sincere and uncontrived quality Dolly Parton demonstrates in Steel Magnolias. She can act, but this role might have been better served by an actress who was, and was openly perceived as, stretching into the role of Shirley -- while Jack Russell, given Woods' casting, would have benefitted from a little more spotlight and a much longer leash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yeah right...","review":"Dolly is saved by stranger Jimmy while \\"attempting\\" to jump off a bridge.

The pairing of Dolly and Woods makes no sense - it's hard enough to believe that they simultaneously act - but in the same movie? Also not to sound perverted but Dolly's characters are always the same - the cocky, wisecracking, yet down home and innocent cowgirl played out long ago. Straight Talk, unfortunately offers little laughs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Straight to basic cable","review":"I saw STRAIGHT TALK on a basic cable station, which is probably where this film played its second week of release.

Don't see why it was issued at all, seems like it was slapped together indifferently and packaged in a kitschy psychedelic gatefold jacket; I'm sure there's other stuff out there, including the complete Isle of Wight performance. And the sound is awful for an official release. It doesn't help any that the band is plugged in throughout the 80-minute set, and Chick Corea's electric piano sounds unbearably harsh and quite often at odds with the rest of the music. Same goes with Steve Grossman's dime-store Coltrane imitations. The hero here is drummer Jack DeJohnette, but it's near impossible to hear him over Corea's electronic mayhem. Really not worth the money, and the curious will likely be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage!","review":"Now, don't get me wrong--I'm a big fan of electric-era Miles (Bitches Brew, Tribute to Jack Johnson, In a Silent Way). But when you take him out of the STUDIO, and put him in the LIVE arena, the results are (in this case) truly unlistenable. The tip-off should've been the liner notes, in which the musicians praise Columbia Records for being \\"brave\\" enough to release this \\"difficult and uncompromising\\" piece of music. Brave, indeed. This is one of the very few albums where I've actually had to suck it up and sell it back to the music store at a loss of $15."},{"rating":"1","title":"More dischord from jammaster Satan.","review":"hysterical virtuosity,fractured jazz. i think it was a bad-afro day in miles davis's universe on april 10, 1970. if you like it 'out there', get this. if you want to clear the room, get this. no tender musings here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Black Mountain Breakdown","review":"This book was not up to Smith's standards in her former books.

Smith writes well and creates a vivid milieu, but my overwhelming reaction was, \\"So what?\\" Crystal, despite the vast amounts of text devoted to her thoughts and feelings, remains essentially a non-entity and her troubled life contains no redemptive or cathartic aspect.

I have recently read a couple of books about James Dean, and have watched a program in the past year where Frank Mazzola (\\"Rebel without a Cause\\" cast member) said when Elvis hit it big and went out to Hollywood he asked Mazzola all about Dean, knew all the dialogue from \\"Rebel\\" etc. Watching Elvis in \\"Jailhouse Rock\\" I couldn't help but think of James Dean and how I bet Elvis loved playing that part since he idolized Dean who had died tragically in a car crash before Elvis became a big star.Elvis was always known for being polite and well-mannered, but he plays a rude, big-headed punk very well in this film.

Then, Andy Taylor realized he wanted to be a rock and roll star, had a huge fight with John and left the band as well. That left Simon, Nick, and John turning to Nile Rogers, and the result is the band's first flop. It sold worse than the previous 4 albums combined. The disc had one smash hit which was the title cut.

After all this is a point where they lost many of their screaming girl fans, but gained new listeners who discovered that they had wronged a great band. Half of the album is more melodic with tracks like Hold Me (I don't know why but I hear Pearl Jam in this) and A matter of feeling, two stand outs which are among their best songs ever.

This book was orginally written in 1938 when Master Ueshiba began to develop his Aikido art from Aikijutsu. At that time he called his art Aiki-Budo. This book has several pictures of the author in his younger years demonstrating Aikido. The wonderful book tells about the background of Ueshiba and the many different martial arts he had studied. He was trained and certified by the historically famous Master Sokaku Takeda of the Daito-Ryu Jujitsu school before developing his own art of Aikido.

He develops a frighteningly realistic scenario, combining the effects of the politics of disengagement; lapses in leadership, good order and discipline; and technology undeployed or spread too thin with the unsettling specter of information warfare effectively applied by a fanatic enemy. It is a fascinating examination of today's Navy vainly trying to fight tomorrows's war against a small, highly motivated force using yesterday's weapons. CAPT Meadows also captures the pride, heroism, technical savvy, and sometimes quirky customs found in the fleet. Active duty sailors and Navy veterans of the Sixth Fleet will easily recognize themselves and their shipmates in this chilling tale of how quickly everything can go very, very wrong. \\"SEAWOLF,\\" Meadows's next book, can't get here too soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wagner Orchestral Music/Herbert von Karajan CD","review":"I would recommend this CD to anyone who doesn't particularly like to hear all the never -ending vocal part of Wagner's operas but loves the orchestra."},{"rating":"2","title":"A key resource for your Jazz Guitar Practice Regimen","review":"A great method-supplement for Jazz Guitar, but not the first or only book to buy if you are just starting out in Jazz Guitar.This is a good chord method book/CD package, heavy on method, lighter on comping, chord melody, and chord soloing, and jazz standards.

Anyway, its all talk and very little action. I liked that the killer they were searching for was an incredibly intelligent woman. That is that she was smart enough to get away with it for many years.

This also screws up the hole story line, because Rinker already used the information in the first call to inform the press. And now it seems like the two never made contact at all. Lucas even gives her his cell number twice. I almost chucked the book in the can. Unfortunantly I usually share my books with others, but this one will go out with the monday trash.

This is one book that failed the test. It would seem that any author who set about offering an alternate theory of IQ would not be able to fail to create an interesting discussion, but this author did just that.We did not need to know about all the structures of the brain that make it such that intellect is such a separate thing from emotion. With the functions of only 10% of the brain known, the author is setting himself up for someone to prove him wrong.

The examples that were used in each chapter were helpful in understanding Goleman's theory. It is encouraging to learn that not only are we academically evaluated, but we are emotionally evaluated when figuring out a person's overall intelligence.

The best thing about the book is that every claim the author makes is backed up with a scientific experiment or a practical example from the real world. The bottom line is that if you have enough experience and knowledge, you may get the job, but in order to advance, or even keep your job, you should have emotional intelligence. Some of the things in the book are common sense, but the author shows us how much they really affect our performance."},{"rating":"2","title":"emotional intelligence is IQ tempered with maturity","review":"This book reviews how people need to be educated not justintellectually with facts and figures, but emotionally.

So why two stars? Today, in 2012, 17 years after the original publication, so much more is known, and there is so much more that should be added that this book is in need of a serious and extensive rewrite. If one is using this book as part of series of books and papers on this important topic, then the book in it's original form is where you must start.But, as a single source of information, it is not so useful.

However, Goleman also brings together an authoritative array of research which \\"connects up the dots\\" of many separate fields of science. The picture of our selves and our society which emerges makes plain what, somehow, was not -- we need to learn what emotions are, how they work, and what skills we lack, and what those skills can accomplish. I think it is fair to say that there is no one who could not learn something seminal from this book, and those who deal with society -- educators and lawyers -- yes, lawyers -- should lead the pack in reading it. Thirty-three weeks on the best seller list says that we are hungry for this information.

You just about need to have a Thesaurus handy to interpret the text along the way.Unless you are a master of the english language and enjoy the challenge of understanding words you have never heard on a sentence to sentence basis, do yourself a favour and invest in one of the other great texts available with regard to understanding the importance of recognising, controlling and utilising the emotional reactions of the human psyche."},{"rating":"2","title":"People Smarts","review":"Emotional Intelligence by Daniel Goleman has been around a long time, I only wish I had read it sooner, especially when my kids were little. One of my daughters was naturally high in EI but kept comparing herself with her two siblings who were more gifted in the IQ department. She kept saying she felt \\"dumb.\\" I think I would have had more tips on how to encourage her and make that period of her life smoother. The second half of the book has a lot of material for teachers and educators. There is also a book based on this same concept called Primal Leadership which I read as a follow up. It applies this understanding to the workplace and would be of interest to employers and managers.Also very helpful, though I found this one a bit repetitive."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is his classic work - I recommend it to all my clients.","review":"This is his original classic work. The term \\"emotional intelligence\\" has become iconic yet not fully understood. Start discovering the concept with this first in a series of books by Goleman. Emotional intelligence involves the ability to identify and manage our emotions; to recognize our impact on others; to empathize; and to generate and direct emotions in ourselves and others towards a constructive goal. This ability can be measured, and more importantly, it can be improved. I egularly encourage my business and life coaching clients to read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great starting point for learning about relationships","review":"Yes, there are heaps of boring sections in the book...it ain't a fun read. But the heart of the message is incredibly insighful: That empathy is a key life attitude. If you work your way through the book you'll understand why I give it 5 stars...even though I forced myself to finish it.I'd recommend this book to ANYONE interested in understanding the human condition. Then I'd follow it up with any book by Thomas Gordon (Parent Effectiveness Training, Leader Effectiveness Training, Teacher Effectiveness Training), as these books show you exactly how to put to daily use the skills that nurture and develop emotional intelligence.I read Thomas Gordon's books first and then found Emotional Intelligence. But either way you're promised an eye-opening experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhat Useless","review":"I found some of what he said intriguing. I agree with his assertion that \\"emotional intelligence\\" is more important than IQ, but there seems very little realistic chance in improving your EQ if you weren't born with it. (Goleman certainly doesn't present any good ideas on how). Goleman seems somewhat unsophisticated in his view of how people can improve their EQ. Read Howard Gardner. His books are much more substantial, providing better analysis and more complex, viable solutions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than I expected","review":"I'm not sure what I was expecting out of this book but it was more than that.

I can only imagine that the readers who gave this book positive reviews were were so hard up for advice that literally anything positive they came across would have had a positive effect. Good for them. However as someone who was looking for a better understanding of human emotions through science, I found most of the content of this work cliche and generally useless.

Sometimes it won't stay on, but it is still better than this product. The Wahl 5537-500 is very light-weight; it's very loud, making one think it has a lot of power. It does not. It would not go through his beard. It sounded as if it were getting bogged down. The guides were difficult to attach and remove; I couldn't find one short enoughto give him a nice, closely groomed beard. I tried shaving his neck without a guide; it didn't do a good job there as well. I finished the job with his old trimmer. Hopefully, I will be able to replace that model.

This set is a nice casual introduction to the band that started the worldwide reggae movement. it was released in 1984 3 years after Bob Marley died, and includes many hits that you are probably familiar with. Songs from all the albums are not included here which is the only downfall of this disc. The booklet that comes with the cd is a good way to learn about this legendary man and his band the Wailers. The Wailers are one of the most talented groups of musicians ever, and the instrumentation and variety on this disc proves it.The second disc is all remixes, and it is interesting to see what others could have done if they were studio engineers for the band.

This greatly reduces efficiency of heat transfer, since conduction requires contact. The pot would work fine over a gas flame, but I do not have a gas stove.

If you think of Kind Of Blue--how Miles stripped the music down to basic elements to allow for freer playing, this works the same way.

If Kind of Blue is a stroll, this is a sprint.Get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A flawed, yet worthwhile, gem","review":"I agree that this particular concert was not recorded properly, but the poor sound quality does not detract from the often breathtaking music. Miles Davis was always way ahead of his time and this concert was no different. Those who give it a good, patient listen will be rewarded. Miles on a bad night was still infinitely better than almost any other band on a good night."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brace Your Self","review":"This is a fascinating album if you are into Mile's 70's music. I agree that the sound quality is not the very best, but it is still pretty good and acceptable. This is funky electronic music that should not be judged with once or twice listening. One of the great advantages of this double cd compared to the rest of the Miles live double cd reissues by Columbia is the absence of Electric \\"Corea and Hancock\\"! This double cd does not have the distorted and overly powered electric keybord sound that the other double cd reissues have. Again if you are into early 70's Miles music buy this cd and enjoy the trip. My only complain as with other double live cd's is that both cd's are in the 80 minutes range, and should have been put in one single cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"SOMETIMES LESS IS JUST LESS","review":"This double disc set strikes me as the poor cousin to LIVE-EVIL. LIVE-EVIL is a much better set.

It would be difficult to eat just a small quantity of them, but I found them to be a delicious, non-filling snack as well as being healthier than the fried kind. I will certainly order them again in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Went from $21 to $33 upon checkout????","review":"while i love these cheese puffs like they were my own kids, i am livid that Amazon's prices change so overwhelmingly. i added these to my cart yesterday at $22, and when i went to check out the price went up $12!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! disgusting, Amazon, how you try to trick people. buyer beware - CHECK THE PRICE AGAIN BEFORE CHECKOUT!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"yum - cheese!","review":"If you love your cheese puffs as I do - this is a great product.

I recognise that other reviewers really like this album. But if you like Carole King's music, it's odds on you won't like this. Her parents are great pop songwriters, but Louise has too many issues getting in the way of popular appeal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy this haunting CD immediately","review":"I wasn't sure I even liked this album when I first purchased it, but after the 3rd play of the CD, I was a born-again convert (as are about 6 of my friends who have heard it since its purchase).I have 2 older vinyl albums but they are so far removed from this CD I wasn't sure what to expect.Not only is Louise's voice wonderful (just like her mom's - Carole King), so is her backup band. The combination of the voice and the music are what make this CD so sensational. In the words of a friend that just heard it this weekend - \\"What a haunting album\\". After trying to fall asleep the other night, all that was going through my head were several of the songs from this album. Couldn't think of a word to describe it until my friend made that comment. You will not waste your money on the purchase of this superb CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent set","review":"Having enjoyed the other three Louise Goffin albums, I was fairly confident that I'd like the songs on her new one. One listen confirmed not only that, but also the fact that Goffin has excelled herself with Sometimes A Circle. It's by far her strongest effort (at least to my ears). Her voice is really supple, and the production and instrumentation (which I didn't always favour so much on the earlier albums) is perfectly suited to her here. The songwriting is consistently great. Bravo"},{"rating":"1","title":"Average","review":"I bought this CD when I heard her sing the theme song from the TV series Gilmore Girls with Carole King, her mother, good reviews as well, this album has no real direction, it wants to sound like a cross between Jazz and Indie, it just does not work, no song on the album stood out, listen to it twice in a row, I just could not get myself to like it, her voice is good, the materiel is just not up to it, the lyrics just don't blend, at first hearing it starts out much like the group IVY, though not even close to the excellent music they perform, sorry a waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not cheap but worth getting...","review":"If you are a serious collector or serious seller, you need this book.

Worth every penny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money!","review":"We purchased this book for our tour from Rome to Barcelona and found it absolutely useless. The route follows major highways while missing quiet backcountry roads. The author completely misses the true beauty of France and Italy in bypassing the Amalfi coast, Umbria, Tuscany and Provence.

When every ounce counts, this is not a book you need to lug up a 1000 meter pass."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dear Josh's Family: Thank you, thank you, thank you...","review":"Dear Josh's friends and family: Thank you, thank you, thank you...

I admit I purchased this cause it was inexpensive. I did listen to samples and liked the classical music. I thought this type of music would be general enough for the not-so-serious or new to yoga. The cd turned out to be a flop because the music does not flow one to another and the loudness changes from one song to another. Terrible for a class as I found myself wondering what happened to the music. I suppose this cd would be okay if you don't want to spend alot of money and just want some background music in your home but not for yoga practice."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Real Science Behind the X-Files","review":"This is a great book for X-Files fans, but also for anyone who has even a passing interest in science. If you think science is dull, boring, difficult, only for nerds or without a shred of imagination - read this book. It is filled with lots of scientific facts and anecdotes that are, sorry Chris Carter, better than the X-Files. It turns out real science is more interesting than science fiction. The book is written so people of all levels can understand the concepts behind the X-Files, and some other ideas that are at the forefront of scientific research in the world today. I wanted to share this with a lot of my friends, and not only my science friends. I never new science could be so exciting. It turns out, that, science, like everything else, needs a little bit of luck, hard work, and a lot of imagination to discover the \\"microbes, meterorites, & mutants\\" that make this planet go around. A great gift, and get one for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Wonderful !","review":"I love the X files and I'm a mixture of Mulder and Scully with regard to their beliefs. But after reading this book, I think I have become a scully!This book is so lucid and simple in its explanation of certain \\"paranormal\\" phenomenon. The author does a wondeful job combining biology and humour to explain to the lay person that not all things are paranormal and that if you do a little scientific research most of the things out there will make sense. All my knowledge on DNA, chromosomes, cancer comes from this book !Though she herself admits that not everything you see on the X files can be explained by science, most of the things that happen on a macro scale in the X files happen on a micro scale in real life. Genetic mutation is a reality, a virus surviving an cosmic travel is plausible, and so on. Finally, for those of you who are deceived by books written by the layperson/idiots/quacks, read this book and you will become fascinated as to what science has to offer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Way More Entertaining than a normal biology textbook...","review":"Sexual tension aside, the coolest thing about this show seems to be the questions it poses about nature and science as we know it. And being a molecular biology student, I always get a kick out of shooting down the supposed theories that the show's characters spout out. It's hard sometimes to figure out if Chris Carter and the powers that be are really serious about certain phenomenons/ideas. This book clears it up nicely. Dr. Simon is completely knowledgeable about these topics and presents the information with much more gusto than your typical molecular biology textbook. I'd rather be tested on her book come final exams, but such is life! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A witty and intelligent guide","review":"Simon writes wittily and intelligently about a number of subjects, all of which have been dramatized on the hugely popular television show \\"The X-Files.\\" There have been other books about the show, episode guides and the like, but for my money this book is best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great accompaniment to When God Was a Woman","review":"Merlin Stone has collected a comprehensive sample of Goddess mythology and presented it in an easy to read, logical format. As always she approaches her work in a scholarly fashion, meticulously researched, and delivered in such a way that there is no doubt as to the validity of the material she presents."},{"rating":"1","title":"long on social politics, short on scholarship","review":"Merlin Stone, a good writer, but not such a good scholar I'm afraid. If one wants to feel good about goddesses and about women, by all means read this book. If one wants information about goddesses in specific or citations to other scholarship, don't look to this book. Interpretations can be amusing when one has read the primary sources and knows about the cultures she looks at to a deep degree. Much better for the layperson or someone looking for positive female strokes than for a student or scholar."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent 'Best of' Mix of Priest - Heavy and Light","review":"This is a good 'best of' for casual fans of heavy metal and hard rock who do not already own any Judas Priest CDs. If you have already have the Judas Priest essentials like British Steel, Screaming for Vengeance and Defenders of the faith and are looking for a more comprehensive best of collection, get the Metal Works '73-'93 compilation. Of course, because Judas Priest is my favorite band, I advocate getting their complete collection of individual CDs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very representative of a great band...","review":"This compilation is a fan's dream come true;for those new to Judas Priest this is the best starting point as it surveyes some of the band's strongest output from the late seventies up to 1990 showing that Judas were true pioneers of the genre.The order of tracks is very fortunate and quite original since it starts with music from the seventies and ends with live tracks from their 1979 album 'Hellbent for Leather-Unleashed in the East'.The inclusion of'Some Heads Are Gonna Roll'from 'Defenders of the Faith'(1984)is a very nice surprise since that song did not make it on the previous best of package'Metal Works'(1993)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST for any \\"JP\\" fan!","review":"What can I say folks, it's Judas Preist doing what they do best, crankin' out the tunes Hard-n-Heavy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing WAY too much","review":"I am giving this compilation two stars because it was the album that got me into Priest. There are so many great songs missing from here, it really should have been a two disc set. First off, including a live version of Victim of Changes was a stupid idea. I like the studio version much better. Second, I don't know how the could make a compilation without \\"Beyond the Realms of Death\\". That is one of their best songs. Here are some great songs not included on the compilation -1. Beyond the Realms of Death2. Exciter3. Stained Class4. The Ripper5. Dreamer Deceiver6. Island of Domination7. Sinner8. Hell Bent for Leather9. United10. Metal Gods11. Rapid Fire12. Screaming for Vengeance13. Painkiller14. A Touch of Evil15. Night Crawler16. Between the Hammer and the Anvil17. Hell Patrol18.

But you wouldn't know it by this terrible compilation CD. It's not terrible because the songs are bad, but rather, because they're only the POPULAR Judas Priest songs, not the GOOD Judas Priest songs. \\"Hot Rockin'\\" was one of the worst songs off of \\"Point of Entry\\", and \\"Breaking the Law\\" certainly isn't the best. Better Priest songs are \\"Painkiller\\", \\"Blood Red Skies\\", \\"The Sentinel\\", so on and so forth. Not only that, but I'm not sure if this is even an Official Judas Priest license (if it were, it would appear in their discography, which it does not). Consdering the cost of Judas Priest (remasters) these days, which is about $12, you're better off buying \\"Screaming for Vengeance\\", \\"Defenders of the Faith\\" or \\"Painkiller\\" as opposed to this. I think that Judas Priest has a lot more good work than what's here - especially from the \\"Sad Wings of Destiny\\" album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Music Poor Sound Quality","review":"Great Music from a great band but the sound quality of the cd is bad.

Basically I bought this after buying Halford's \\"Resurrection\\" album. I'm also a massive fan of Iron Maiden, and I was under the impression that Judas Priest sounded a lot like Maiden. For those of you whose interest in this lies amongst liking Iron Maiden or similar bands, I think you should hear a few songs on MP3 first or something, because this offers a much lighter, slower, slimpler, feel-good rock sound in many places, rather than metal. It certainly sounds more 70s rather than 80s.I'm sure all you Priest fans will hate me for it but I felt that I had to say it so that somebody in my shoes didn't make the same uninformed mistake. If you like hard-rock/70's metal then this is great. But otherwise, stick with the more aggressive Iron Maiden."},{"rating":"2","title":"totally worth it","review":"This CD provides a broad sampling of music from the legendary rock band Judas Priest.

(it is of course one of my favorite bands.) but i think that this compliation really does'nt do them much justice. i'm sure that for a couple of bucks more you can get metal works. or instead of testing the waters jump in buy an album like screaming for vengence. the songs sound a lot more impactful when heard in context. if your an entry level fan you can do much better than this...trust me i know this was the work of some record executive and not priest and thats what it should be seen as."},{"rating":"2","title":"Judas Priest - 'The Best Of...

I must give credit to Coco Chanel's No. 5 perfume commercial for bringing my attention to this wonderful songtress' voice when I heard one of the songs \\"I'm a fool to want you\\". It aroused my curiousity who the singer was and so I searched on the internet which indicated it was the incomparable Billie Holiday that sang this sultry piece. All the songs on \\"Lady in Satin\\" are beautiful and relaxing to listen to, especially on rainy days. The sound and pitch is excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Billie's Best!!! Only 3 other reviews here? Great Ballads!!","review":"Every cut here is close to a masterpiece, except the nine-plus minute END OF A LOVE AFFAIR: AUDIO STORY, simply a recording of the whole session, talk and all. I'M A FOOL TO WANT YOU, one of Sinatra's all time greats is done here, is given the royal treatment in three takes by Billie and Ray Ellis in a very beautiful version. But the whole CD is of this high quality, and you'll never hear another voice quite like this one, even if a little shaky. This is Lady Day towards the very end, one of her last recordings. A must hear!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"LADY DAY AT HER FINEST!","review":"Whether or not you're a fan, you just gotta hear this! It's not WHAT she sings, its HOW she sings it. Although Lady is traditionally backed by a standard Jazz ensemble, not this time. She's all dressed up, with the heavenly Ray Ellis orchestra behind her. Now you will feel it. If you've ever love someone and lost, you will understand it. Noone has ever delivered these songs like this before. Don't let this one get away. Add it to your collection now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Heaven.......","review":"What can you say about \\"Lady in satin\\"? Is there a word strong enough to express the intensity of her singing here? \\"I'm a fool to want you\\" is the definitive version, I have heard so many other covers of this beautiful song, but nothing can compare to Billie's, it' simply a part of her. Just about the same I can say about \\"You've changed\\", one of the best jazz standard ever written in my opinion: her rendition is so passionate, full of grief and tears and regret,she lives it! And what about \\"The end of a love affair\\", \\"For all we know\\" and.....oh well, all the songs of this work are just heaven! A must have, no doubt about it, anyone who had a heart and knows about musicianship will be touched by Billie's magic here, more then ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"LADY DAY AT HER FINEST!","review":"Whether or not you're a fan, you just gotta hear this!

Add it to your collection now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lady Day's Somber Final Bow","review":"\\"Lady in Satin\\" was Holiday's personal favourite recording, and it is plain to see why. It is a retrospective take on failed romance, the pain associated with it and regret. Holiday's voice is decrepit and worn, and thus perfectly complements the album's cathartic lyrics. It is as if Billie has reached the summit of love, realizing that she can only turn back now and face some of its more disturbing realities. Ray Ellis' orchestrations are captivating and flawlessly document Billie's voice in her final stage of life, as few other composers could. \\"Violets for my furs\\" and \\"You've changed\\" are my favourite songs for precisely this reason. They capture a rare and timeless chemistry from one of the most renowned singers of the twentieth century."},{"rating":"2","title":"You Will Know What Love Is When You Listen to This","review":"Billie sings, \\"You don't know what love is until you have the blues.\\" With this incredibly deep and beautiful recording, you'll have a pretty good idea what love is, and what heartache and dispair are too. This is a very touching collection that is a must for all Lady Day fans. Yes, Billie's voice is a bit rough around the edges and has lost some of its range, yet, her emotion and phrasing are astounding and perhaps better than ever. The orchestration is awesome and compliments Billie perfectly. Lady in Satin is a one-of-a-kind jewel."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love Billie!!","review":"Lady in satin is sooooooooo good!!!! I love her music so much!! She is the BEST!! jazz and blues singer in the world!!! still!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lady's last holiday","review":"Holiday's last great recording glows with her innate and letter-perfect phrasing and musicality. But the voice, ragged from a life of pushing too hard, playing too much, succumbing too often, is harrowing. There's still flexibility in it, and its very rawness makes the album terribly moving. But stacked against the insouciant bravado of her great early recordings, \\"Lady in Satin\\" is almost too painful to listen to all the way through."},{"rating":"1","title":"an essential classic ?","review":"Having just read an article entitled the most essential jazz music of the past century I went and purchased ths Lady in Satin. This was an album that was professed to be one of the great ones. Powerfull and essential in Holiday's catalogue.I placed it into the CD palyer with great anticipation, first was the orchestration, big full and accurate. Then the horrific, screatching, off key shaky voice of the singer.I went onto the next track and more of the same. Fantastic big band orchestrations marred by this scared vioce. One track is an outtake and she speaks as if she was drunk ! I understand she had her hard times but at least the recording engineers could have taken the bottle out of her hands.This was a horrible let down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dying groans, same appeal as Elvis' last concert LP","review":"This recording contains the dying groans of Billy Holiday. It appeals only to the voyeurs of human tragedy and misery. Holiday's singing is barely in tune much of the time and she sounds about 100 yrs old. It reminds me of Elvis In Concert, in which Elvis likewise, was obviously near the end of his life."},{"rating":"1","title":"rubbish!!!","review":"this is the most terrible voice i've ever heard!!!!a loaf of rubbish and a waste of time and money!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A collection for posers","review":"I love Billie Holiday when she is backed by Jazz music, especially the saxophonist Lester Young. She was a Jazz singer afterall. This CD has her fronting a very cheezy, langorous, muzak-like string arrangement. Much of her youthful insouciance is gone in these recordings, made during her last years of life. The music painfully plods through just about every hit song Billie sang, each one introduced with a flurry of terrible sounding strings. There's hardly any alteration in her tone and, if you're not listening very closely, you might think the CD was covering an extended version of the same melody. There are Billie Holiday collections much better than this one, such as 'Love Songs' or the two cd set of Billie Holiday with Lester Young entitled 'A Fine Romance'. It is in these recordings that the true beauty and charm of Billie's voice comes through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Something wrong later part of CD","review":"It took a few weeks, it was little longer to arrive me.And CD was just CD only, no jackets and something wrong later part of CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"not her best","review":"I listen to this cd because billie is my moms favorite singer and she heard this is one of her best boy were they wrong. Her voice is so bad becasue of all the drugs she has done and music is way overproduce. Billie was at her best with a more strip down sound with just a couple of musicans not a few blowed orcherstra. Fans like this because it is billie and if she sang the phone book they would by it and the fact that her life was just as bad as the songs that she sang. You make love a artist a whole lot but you got to admit when they have done something that is far from there best that does not mean that you should love them anyless.

The line between \\"art\\" and \\"life\\" has never been so blurred--in fact, the entire album, by combining these classic songs and lush orchestrations with Holiday's frail, fading voice, raises the question about the relationship between art and life, the beautiful and the tragic. Perhaps the most haunting and heartbreaking moment in the history of recorded music occurs when Billie comes in for the second chorus of \\"But Beautiful.\\" Listen to her voice crack when she gets to the word \\"heartache,\\" the emotional climax of a song about the paradoxes of life and love. I don't play the record much because I don't need to--Billie inscribes these songs deep in your heart forever, but it requires a painful surgical incision. I'm glad I had it done, but for me it's now simply enough to know the album is in my collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"missing part makes it useless - twice!","review":"Three times I purchased the plasma car for my kids and twice it's missing a part.

He did not get off of it until I made him, about 30 minutes later, because he kept running into people in the store. There's something about this \\"car\\" that he loves and when he saw that Santa brought it for him on Xmas, it was all over. He gets such a kick out of how he doesn't have to really pedal, just steer, and it moves. It is not meant for carpet, only smooth surfaces. He \\"glides\\" all over the place in my house, it was definately worth the $50 I paid on amazon. It was by far his favorite Xmas gift this year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Our children love these cars and Santa too!","review":"Wonderful toy, wonderful value.

I have to say we were all disappointed with the results. My grandson was frusterated with wiggling the handle so much, he is very active in sports etc but I guess he needed more 'instant gratification' as he grew bored quickly. It might have helped if the road out front of his house were a bit smoother. It seems that the bumpier the surface, the more difficult the maneuvering to get it to move faster than a slow walk.

Not that I suggest that, it could be dangerous, we just haven't had any accidents yet.

Luckily our driveway is smooth enough for proper operation. I can see how the car would get bogged down on a rough surface. When we move our cars out of the garage the PlasmaCar is amazing on smooth concert of the garage floor. I've read other reviews about people using the PlasmaCar indoors. I'm sure it would work well on our hardwood floors but we're not comfortable with the car zipping around inside.Overall the car is a lot of fun (even adults under 220 pounds can ride it). If you have a flat smooth open area this toy is perfect for your kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, fun, fun...","review":"My duaghter really like this toy.

Some of the wheels are stuck. Luckily it is the smaller front wheels which barely ever hit the ground. Other than that they do love riding on them, even though they use their feet to propel them, they don't work well on our paved driveway just using the handlebar thing. So all our shoes are developing holes where they scrape across the ground.The kids all love them though. It is the first fought over riding toy in the daycare.."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is poor imitation, not the real PlasmaCar","review":"I ordered original PlasmaCar by PlasmaCar, not an imitation poorly made imitation. The package was so poor, the product doesn't even look sturdy. I'm trying to contact the seller, and return the product. I don't undertand why amazon doesn't review the product before they let the 3rd party sell their product. They shouldn't make it look like they are selling the original product that buyer's trying to buy, they make it look like the original, and made me buy because it was on trusted Amazon site, and what I got is a piece of crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way Too Slow!","review":"I wish I had known that this car only really moves on a smooth surface. We tried it out on our sidewalk (which isn't too old or too cracked), and it goes unbearably slow. After my 3.5 year old became frustrated at the snail's pace, both my husband and I tried it out - we couldn't get it to go any faster.We tried it in our house, which is 80% tile, and even on the 12inch tiles it didn't move very fast. The only place we could get it up to a \\"normal\\" speed was in our tiny garage. Ironically, that is where this toy now sits, unused...in our garage.If you have access to a large, *very* smooth floor, than this toy is worth the outrageous price. However, don't plan on using it outside for walks, or else you will end up with a very disappointed child."},{"rating":"1","title":"An imitation!!! Not a real PLASMACAR!!","review":"I bought this product for my nephew, and when it arrived it was in a multicolored, unlabeled, cheap box, with generic assembly directions and a cheap plastic plasmacar imitation! The product was essentially unlabeled except for a \\"made in China\\" sticker on the bottom. This is so misleading! The real Plasmacar should have a yellow sticker under the steering wheel (nicely demonstrated by another reviewer here in a you tube video), a name brand box, and is made in Canada by a company called \\"PlaSmart.\\". Sadly, I learned all of this AFTER receiving this cheap imitation and researching it better. Sending mine back today! What a disappointment. This is my first review of a product, and it was unfortunately inspired by feelings of bing \\"duped!\\". Buyer beware!"},{"rating":"2","title":"should have bought two!!","review":"What a great toy. The kids love it and it gives them exercise at the same time. I got this for my 3 yr old grandson to ride when he visits. I should have gotten two though. My 1 1/2 yr old grandson loves it too. It sits low enough to the ground and has a straight center so even though he hasn't mastered the \\"go power\\" of it, he pushes it around with his feet. Other \\"Big Wheel\\" type toys we have are too large for him, or he runs over his own feet with the back tires as he tries to go. I rode it around too and its even fun for grandma!! Delivery was fast and product came packaged and in perfect shape. Easy to assemble."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for all ages!","review":"This car is SO much fun for everyone!

When I originally looked at this product a year ago, it was maybe $30.00 or a little over. The fact that I paid $54.00 for this product is disappointing.

Though this was a gift, this is one of the the WORST TOYS I have seen in years. To the point of a scam! Perhaps it would work better indoors and destroy your floors. It did not work outside. The way it is designed to generate forward motion like a skateboarder uses side to side motion, the wheels are hard plastic and would generate very little forward motion. A push car would be better. In a period of two days the wheels were ground down. This product is so bad I'm looking for what plastics were used so that I can break it down for recycling as the raw materials are worth more than the product it's self.

Soon it spread to the other side, then on my upper lip, then on both sides of my nose! The pink turned to a bright shiny red. Using this product gave me a condition called \\"Perioral dermatitis.\\" Google it, it's not fun. It has now been over 2 months since I've used the product and the rash is still here. I can take antibiotics for it, but as soon as I stop taking them, the rash will come back.

The movie is amateurishly produced and the limited angles prevent viewing the way she loads her brush. It is not organized step by step as she moves from one topic to the next, she mumbles into her work, instead of speaking up into the camera and the strokes are too quickly executed without adequate explanation.

Other painting tapes can be played on the computor which is indeed a great joy and one watches them a lot. I am now stuck half way with this disc waiting for an opportunity to play it when noone else is around, probably will wait until next winter.

In the picture it looked the the top of the stopper was smooth, but it isn't - it has sharp ridges. When I reach in to unplug it the edges of it are so sharp it hurts my fingers, so instead I have to use a knife to remove it, which is annoying. I tossed both of the ones I bought after only one week of use - I just couldn't stand them and the price to ship them back would have been almost as much as I paid for them. If you don't mind the sharpness then you might like them. I had no other problems with them. Truly though, I think it is cheaper to just buy ones at the grocery store and save the shipping costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy it for the pictures","review":"Nick Bantock does not refer to himself as much a writer as a creative artist. This is reflected in the Capolan set.The art is excellent and pure Bantock: colorful, expressive, off-center, collage-ish. The book is not good, though. The book tries to be pure Bantock - that is, meditiative, somewhat sad but fulfilled, and quietly anti-commercialist. However, it tries too hard. Artists agree that art should make the unfamiliar familiar, or the familiar unfamiliar. I believe Griffin and Sabine made Bantock's unfamiliar concepts familiar because of the familiar root - correspondence - combined with the rich, concrete detail rooted in basic human emotions. Capolan fails, though. Although the concept of a nomad nation is known to westerners, it is not familiar, and it is not made familiar since there are few rich, familiar details. Unless you are a Bantock devotee or an art lover, skip this one over."},{"rating":"1","title":"mycra pac disappointment","review":"Ordered this to replace my old one, bought several years ago and recently stolen. The older style was very romantic and almost ankle length with a very large hood, worthy of the opera or a formal evening out.

If I could contact the maker I would urge them to bring the old style back. I hear the style change only recently occurred in fall 2012, so all the wonderful reviews are for the older style.

Gone is much of the gamelan music, many scenic shots of Indonesian countryside, and one of the hotest make-out scenes in cinematic history. Just as Mel Gibson and Sigourney Weaver are about to go at it the scene abruptly ends. Even the sequence of the original is changed. The over all effect is a coursening of what had been a classic.

Good family movie with good interaction between the generations of the boy and his parents, the boy and his grandfather. But it's mostly the story of a boy and his love for his dogs, because he got not one--but two after perservering through the old fashion virtue of \\"he earned them\\".There is conflict between the boy and the neighborhood bullies, and great drama when a terrible thing happens.

When I finally turned it off, the kid was cutting down a beautiful old tree just so he could kill the 'coon that was hiding in it.

In my composition class, I was required to read this book and I loved it. But when I watched the movie it stunk. I hated the movie compared to the book. The movie skipped where Little Ann wins the beauty contest. The book has so much detail when I closed my eyes I could see myself there. I think the director should make another movie as similar to the book as he can get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't even deserve one star!","review":"I hated it. I read the book in 7th grade and saw the movie right after. I liked the book but hated the movie. They didn't follow the book at all. They changed the names of the dogs. The book came first, so that's not fair. You can't understand any of the characters and they skipped events. If a movie is supposed to be based on a book, it should have the same names and events and basically should follow the book. This movie didn't do that. It actually didn't do anything. The actors and actresses didn't put any effort in and they didn't even try to be good. Nor did the director try to be good. In my opinion, this movie was a low blow to Wilson Rawls, Disney, and the book of Where the Red Fern Grows. If you read the book and like it, I advise you not to see the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where the Red Fern Grows","review":"Our seventh grade just read Where The Red Fern Grows. It was the best book ever and the rest of my friends think so too. It just became our new favorite book and then our teacher, Mr. Cutlip, asked us if we wanted to watch the movie. We said yes -- we were so excited and when we first starting watching it we were so excited but the more we watched it, the more we did not like it. We got so mad at it because it was leaving some real good parts out because the book was just so good we all figured the move was going to be real good. We all were wanting to know if you could go back and remake the movie all over BUT this time make it as close to the book as you can -- then you will have the best book and movie ever. And trust me everybody would buy it -- I would be the first one to buy it because your book is so good my mom is going to buy the book for me and there is not one book that I liked to read until now and it is Where The Red Fern Grows."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Movie Ever","review":"Wow! They can turn one of the best books ever into the worst movie I think I've ever seen. I read the book in my Language class. I thought that the book was alright for something that we had to read. But then when we watched the movie, it changed my whole perspective on Where The Red Fern Grows. The actors were horrible, the same with the special effects. And if you get this movie to watch what you read, you need to find something else. It leaves out some of the best parts of the book. I was disgusted with this movie. It may be the worst movie I've ever seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"the movie had no ending it just stopped in the middle!","review":"I was very unhappy with this DVD the thing just stopped a little more than half way through I will never use or refer anyone to this company!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best \\"Man's Best Friend\\" Movies...Period!!!","review":"Anyone who loves animals, and dogs in general, and hounds in particular will absolutely love this movie. This movie has no high tech props to speak of, only a simple country family with a boy who longs for his own hounds and ends up with two Redbone Coonhounds that he orders through his Grandfather. The boy's obvious love and the immediate bond he shares with the two hounds (lil' ann and big dan)is heartwarming, making for an incredibly enjoyable movie.I will warn you, the ending will leave you sobbing and if any man, woman, or child seeing the whole movie is not completely moved to tears upon the ending of the movie, nothing will make that person cry.In short I loved the movie and would put it up there with Walt Disney's \\"Old Yeller\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like Little House on the Prairie or Old Yeller, you'll like this","review":"The production is very distinctly dated, and not quite top notch, but the sentiment is so unfailingly earnest and mild, the story so appealing, that those inclined to this kind of film will love it. Maybe a touch less saccharine than Little House on the Prairie, rather like The Waltons, with love between boy and dogs in a country setting. A paradigm of \\"family film.\\"Includes portrayals of the deaths of a boy and animals, should be fine for most children, especially if they follow the plot to the end.

Download NOW","review":"This book was written with great intelligence and insight into a woman's heart and soul; a woman who lives by her wits on the streets of London in the 1700s. The fact that the heroine begins her story at age 14 and faces her the result of her decisions by the age of 16 is riveting. Historical drama with real quality. Sordid details that are pertinent to the nature and intent of the story. Emma Donoghue expresses a deep understanding of a young girls longing for beautiful things in a barren world. The red ribbon is poignant and one of the only things with Mary throughout the story. Great history! Great details! Great story!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Something to think about...","review":"I thought that this book was really great. When I thought that nothing else bad could happen to Mary it did. At the begining of the book I was a little shocked as to how graphic it got but it showed the reality to things in those days. I really enjoyed this book very much. Many people didn't like the graphic nature of it but I found it very interesting and a page turner! AMAZING!"},{"rating":"2","title":"ENTERTAINING ENGROSSING DISTRUBING","review":"Emma Donoghue gets kudos for writing this type of book, an often distrubing story of a young teenage girl in prositution in the 1760.

The plot moved the story forward and I thought Mary's characterization was excellent -- we saw her grapple with issues and thoughts that were completely new to her, and in completely new environments -- wherever she was. This was a book I couldn't put down because I wanted to know what happened to Mary.My only criticism was that the ending warrented more space than allowed by the author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vivid, Enthralling....a Guilty Pleasure","review":"Addicting is the word I'd use to best describe this unabashedly sinful novel. I'm a fairly avid reader and I'd say it's one of the best books I've ever read. I'd give it five stars but it's not the type of book that *should* be five stars...it's no Dickens masterpiece...it's slummy, slutty, at times digusting but always realistic. I honestly think if an 18th century whore could write (in modern English no less)- this is what she'd tell us.Fascinating imagery, incredible characters, you'll wish you could travel in time.Don't leave it on your desk at work- graphic is an understatement. If you have a weak stomach or high falutin' morals, pass it by."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disliked the characters too much","review":"I had a very hard time getting through this book.

Give it a miss."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get Ready for Setback after Setback","review":"This book was sad and depressing from beginning to end.

Its theme dates to the Garden of Eden. Ambition blinds us to the treasures we have and causes us to see only those we have not. Are pride and ambition the original sin, or are we right to risk even our souls to rise above our lot from birth? Are street whores, housewives, and maids all prostitutes in the same sense? Each reader will find his own answers, along with historic detail, filial love, pornography, and tragedy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Engaging but a bit forced and inconsistent","review":"I ordered Slammerkin at the same time I ordered Year of Wonders by Geraldine Brooks. Someone who had read both recommended Slammerkin as the better title. While the story was engaging, I thought the structure was inconsistent and the themes a bit forced . Though the book's narrator is the omniscient third person, you read only Mary Saunder's thoughts through two-thirds of the book. Once Mary gets out of London, though, you start getting insight into a select few other characters' thoughts. It seemed that Donoghue needed to get these thoughts into story to develop the theme, but didn't know how else to do it, and so she took the easy way out and just threw in other characters' thoughts where it served her purpose (without developing the character fully). I'd recommend Slammerkin as a beach/vacation book that you leave behind when you're done.(I am reading Year of Wonders now and am enjoying it more than Slammerkin.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Eeeew! Good read, but prepare yourself","review":"The good news is, it's a quick and absorbing read. I came to it after \\"Year of Wonders,\\" and found it about as readable. But wow - the stuff that's colorful and picaresque and interesting in the early chapters sure starts to wear and get uglier as the book goes on. This is one brutish, nasty, and short novel. YoW I find myself thinking about still. This one I find myself wondering why I read it.Don't mean to trash the author - I think I'll check out another one of Donoghue's books - just not wild about this one - unlikeable protagonist meets ugly end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I had high hopes for this book. I did not bargain on the vulgarity expressed in this book. It is unnecessarily explicit. And on top of that, I hated the ending. I totally hate the \\"heroine\\". She is a lost cause. I wish I had never purchased this book. Just crude, crude, crude...and for no other reason but to be crude. There is sensuality that is enriching to a story. Not this story. You will be sorely disappointed with this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVED it","review":"This is definitely one of those stories that will keep coming back into your thoughts long after you're done reading. Emma has a way of invoking sympathy for each character, even as they do some questionable things. Definitely recommended!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gritty novel about prostitution","review":"This was a good historical novel. The parts of the novel that deal with Mary becoming a seamtress for the Jones' are tedious and that's the reason I give this four stars, not five. Mary is bored with her life there and it's almost as if the author is trying to get us just as bored as Mary is. That's an overstatement really. (It actually reads pretty fast but just isn't as interesting.) The novel is well written throughout though. The very genteel life at the Jones' is in sharp contrast to the \\"exciting\\" life of prostitution. I don't know what it says about me that I enjoyed all the raunchy stuff more than the everyday middle class living! It should be taken with a grain of salt that this was based on a living person. It says right on the book that not much is known about her. This is really good historical fiction but not for the faint of heart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing and no value","review":"This is short and sweet.... not be fooled by these reviews. I find it odd that one review, similar to what I feel was removed adn the positive ones still exist. Is that pressure on Amazon from the publisher who is promoting this book so much. The book has not ONE redemming character, has no real plot and the end, unlike was was said in one of these reviews.... was nothing. You know from page one she was going to die. No remorse, no lesson learned.

A great deal of money has been put into its promotion. My wife could not even finish it, she found it so graphicly disgusting and depressing. [....] There is really no redeeming parts of the book. This is not based on any details of history, so the author could have created any characters, reasons or background. She decided to only have one relationship the two [...] as friends. Sharing a bed, booze and clothes. The men - please we are not all the lowest lifeforms, as she would have you believe. There is no character development or even discription.... we never even find out how the main character looks. There is a reference to the size of her lips and height. As far as the locals and time period. Again, bare descriptions. Unlike my wife I finished it. Hoping to the last page there would be something redeeming.

I stayed with it for almost half and then skipped to the end. Even that didn't help. Don't waste your money. The depiction of having sex for money right on the street was sick, and not in the good way. The parts about collar day (hanging day) were extremely depressing and gross. The main character starts out stupid and never learns from her mistakes.

Leave this one on the shelf!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointing...C-","review":"What a disapointment. The book started out so good, dark and mysterious...but then became endlessly dull in the middle and the ending was anti-climatic and predictable.When I read this I was unaware that it was a fictionalized novel about a real person, but even knowing that did not help this book at all. I was amazingly unimpressed."},{"rating":"2","title":"''What was the tapeworm in her stomach that always made her hunger for more?'","review":"Absolutely compelling read set in 1760s London and Wales- so much so that I was looking up the places and the main character on the Internet.Based around a true story of one Mary Saunders who came to grief through her longing for 'fine clothes', Donoghue has crafted an unputdownable novel. Mary's inability to accept the life on offer - as a seamstress or servant - cause her to break away from any settled situation in which she finds herself, for the better paid work as a prostitute. Nonetheless, she finds a kind of happiness living in Monmouth with nice Mrs Jones. Who could ever have predicted what would happen next?...My third read by Emma Donoghue and they were all brilliant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did I read the same book?","review":"I think I must have read the same book as the other reviewers. I mean it clearly included the same subject matter, shared the title and author of the book that the others enjoyed. But I found it incredibly British-centric and, worse still, quite boring. I agree with many of the statements made by the reviewer David W. Nicholas but came to a compeletely different conclusion. This book is certainly condescending and politically incorrect. If I were more interested in the history of this region and period I'd pursue other sources to see how accurate its portrayal of the native Africans and Arabs is, but I'm not. Lest we judge these cultures too harshly, we ought to take a look into what shape the last 120 odd years of \\"progress\\" have left the Suddan."},{"rating":"1","title":"The White Nile (The Worst Book Ever Written)","review":"This book is terrible. It is very boring and way too detailed. He repeats everything for 10 pages and goes on and on about the slave traders.

For those of you searching for God, or want to know what He is like, even you who have been turned off by religion, this is the book to show you the way. Throughout my Christian life, I've heard many people use the phrase \\"Next to the Bible, this is the book for me...\\" and in my case, Confidence in God is that book. Written by a Catholic priest, this book is not just for Catholics, but for all Christians, and all other persons, even those who do not consider themselves to be Christians. Rev. Considine explains the attributes of God in a clear and accurate way. I am now almost 40 years old, and this is the book that lead me to Christ when I was just 16!

But I couldn't connect with the main character, Abby Stanfield, as she was written, to me, one-dimensionally ... ditto her love interest Sarah. I also don't care for the fell-in-love-at-first-sight gambit used by so many authors of lesbian fiction. Where is the depth of character like a Kate Delafield (Katherine Forrest), or Carol Aston (Claire McNab)?Just my opinion, folks, wish I'd kept my $13.59 in my wallet on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even close to the previous seasons","review":"Sorry folks, but this one drags on for no good reason. Having watched it once i would never do so again. I have been a big fan of the andromeda series and enjoyed many of the episodes. There are simply too few episodes of any worth in season 5 and so it came to an end. What a sad finish to what could have been a much greater series.

Take care."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unplayable as Shipped","review":"As others have mentioned, this ships without the bridge installed. This mandolin is presumably marketed to beginners, most of whom will have no idea how to correctly install a bridge. There are also no bridge installation instructions included.

If that isn't option, I've purchased other stringed instruments from another online retailer, and they have always arrived ready to play."},{"rating":"2","title":"LPs' playing time wasn't long enough for that","review":"...so Columbia had to do a lot of sometimes disturbing cuts to shorten down the original performances (lasting about 45 minutes). But nevertheless, Miles perfectly leads his band by his playing. Chick Corea and Herbie Hancock are the keyboard duelists - sometimes really dissonant sound clashes, sometimes rock-like groove. Jack DeJohnette's drumming drives the band forward in the faster parts or adds cymbal colours on \\"ballads\\". We can hear some intense soloing by 19-year old soprano saxist Steve Grossmann (I guess, Columbia unfortunately cut away a lot of his playing!). Dave Holland plays electric bass in a way that often reminds of \\"Bitches Brew\\", i. e. as if he were soloing, and Airto Moreira is working with percussion.

This album is awful. I bought it as the two-disk vinyl version and it sits, lonely and unplayed, in my record cabinet. This was my introduction to Miles; luckily, a good friend gave me his jazz collection a few years later and I was shocked to discover that Miles really was a genius, just like I'd been told. Compare this to Miles Ahead or 7 Steps to Heaven-I don't hear any beauty, any real music in any of this. Miles deserves credit for having the guts to perform this, but it just didn't work. It's hard to believe this is the same musician as the one who worked with Gil Evans or John Coltrane."},{"rating":"1","title":"On the Cutting Room Floor","review":"I've heard the full concerts that made up this two cd set and they are brilliant. However, the concerts have been butchered so much on this album you'll never really get to listen to a coherent song. If Columbia officially released a box set of these concerts, many jazz fans (including myself) would be more than willing to buy it. Unlike Live at the Fillmore East, Live-Evil also involved splicing but it makes sense but it was still great to have the full Cellar Door Sessions released. Fillmore could use the same treatment. All the players on the concerts are in peak form (I just wish Keith Jarrett would stop dissing Miles' electric bands when his electrified playing on them is far more creative than his solo career) and the concerts deserve to be heard the way they were supposed to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous!","review":"Aged 16, I was lucky enough to get acquainted with - and buy - this album (LP) in the early 70'es.What an eye-opener it was!

Later on I ran into the brother of Steve Grossman, Hal, who was teaching at Berklee. He told a funny story about this concert. It seems the concert was set up for Miles to open up for the Steve Miller Band. The first night Miles heard the Steve Miller Band and got pissed off he had to open for them. So . . . the second night Miles showed up real late and Steve Miller had to open for him. The next two nights had Crosby, Still & Nash on the ticket. They found themselves also opening for Miles. He did say he liked them better . . . \\"at least they can sing!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Challenging but worth it","review":"I agree with what others have said about the editing, but the playing makes up for it. There are a lot or weird sounds, between Keith Jarrett playing his organ at distortion level and whatever crazy Brazilian donkey jaw (a real instrument) Airto was shaking, but the rhythm section of Jack Dejohnette and Dave Holland are TIGHT.I also agree with others who have said they could use a little more bass in the mix, but, oh well. Dejohnette, wow. What can you say? Sometime just listen to nothing but the drums on this album. You'll love all the clever little things Jack does, the tasty fills, the unexpected splash of a cymbal, a crackling snare shot out of nowhere. Dejohnette is one of the real artists behind a kit, and he should be far more famous than he is. But musicians know. Just ask any drummer about Jack Dejohnette.This album deeply flawed masterpiece.

I use the T- Blade first then the face shaver. I stay away from the long hair cutter on the back of the face shaver (it is very rough). I use the T-Blade to shape up my hair line and my goatee. It comes with 3 guards so you can get an even beard trim."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice shave","review":"i am writing this for anyone who is undecided about buying this product hope this helps. first, i didn't have a face full of razor bumps but got a few from time to time but since i started using this shaver i have only got 1 or 2 on my neck. the wahl shaver works well the shave is not super close like using a razor or magic shave but after you're done it leaves your face feeling a whole lot better with fewer cuts and nicks. bottom line is it won't work miracles and leave you bump free but you will have fewer razor bumps. so go buy this it's well worth the money and with the trimmer you won't be sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed with Results","review":"Unfortunately this foil shaver from Wahl did not live up to it's claim.The shaver is harsh and it did not prevent bumps on my neck from appearing after I shaved with it. It is so harsh that it can leave your face irritated for awhile. I'm African American and this shaver does not seem to do a good job shaving short and curly facial hair. The only positive thing about this set is the T-Blade trimmer which is a decent trimmer, which is why I gave the product two stars instead of one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent story for young and young at heart","review":"Patricia Polaco is an insightful author and illustrator.

In doing that he attempts to discredit everything of importance to Sunni Muslims; afterall this is his journey.I have this book in its original form in Arabic and I have several other books by the same author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disheartening","review":"It is disheartening to read such a book which can only be classified as sectarian propopaganda at the same time when many enlightened religious authorities (Both Shiite & Sunni)are continuously emphasizing that history is history and God is the One who is going to judge. I am greatly discouraged by the tone of the book and the methodolgy which can be summarized as follows: \\"I know best; I am right; I know what really happened 1400 years ago(I was there!!); You all are wrong; I am right; Stop thinking; Follow me\\". At this time and age when we are facing such great challenges, we deserve a better book and a better guidance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Faulty Research","review":"The problem I find with this book that although it presents a personal exploration of the 'truth', it lacks proper research. I felt the author has faulty understanding of Islamic history. He builds ideology out of history (and sometimes 'history' which is not accurate -to say the least). He tries to convince the reader that his ideas are based on an analysis of new historic findings (to him). But what if, the assumptions he started with were (1) inaccurate; (2) false; (3) open to other (many times better) interpretations; or (4) a combination of the above. A better approach to understanding Islamic history comes from authors such as Karen Armstrong (Islam : A Short History). In addition, most writings of John Esposito are excellent and definitely more valuable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hate literature","review":"I was very disappointed in this book. It is hate in disguise. I would have preferred an objective discussion but the author is playing on emotions rather than depending on objective research. If he had been less emotional and more objective he would have written a better book. This book was neither well researched or well organized. I will definitely be looking for a more objective, tolerant, scholarly book on this subject next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another disappointing book","review":"What bothers me about this book is that the author glorifies and magnifies the differences between Shias and Sunnis at a time when such thing is not needed at all. Yes there are differences but they are not the way the author portrays. Sunnis love ahlu-Bait, love Imam Hussein, love Al-Zahra Fatemah, and the righteous descendants of Prophet Muhammad. To make the impression in the book that this is not the case is not fair, let alone objective or scientific. Sunnis, however, differ in their expression of this love. Sunnis do not injure themselves in Ashoura with knives and many modern enlightened Shia agree with this. They just think that such an expression of love is not permitted. Many modern Shia scholars agree with this.I am not against exploring the differences, actually I think this should be encouraged among the learned and people seeking knowledge. I don't think, however, that this book is a fair, objective, or factual one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read a better book","review":"As I read this book I cannot but wonder at whether the author really understands Ahlu-Bait. the real difference between Sunnis and Shias is not anything realted to what the author was trying to lead to. Sunni Muslims love Imam Hussein but love his grandfather more. They express their sorrow over his martyrdom in a way that is acceptable to Allah and not in a way that many Shias do nowadays. The author is trying to note that Shia have more profound love for Imam Hussein as if you cry your heart out this means that you are a true lover. Do Christians love Al-Maseeh more than Muslims just becasue they call him a son of God? I am astonished that many many Shias call for unity on the one hand, and on the other hand are involved in much propaganda about Sunni Muslims who \\"converted\\" to Shiism. People are free to read whatever they want but I believe that there are better sources to highlight the real differences."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book on the Shia-Sunni debate","review":"This was the best book I've read on the Shia/Sunni debate.

A lot of racistovertones, and it looks like Herbert really didn't research his sciencevery well, as the Arabs, who release the virus, are a Caucasian race aswell. Predictably the plague spreads to other racial groups until thewhole world is sterile. I can think of several work arounds the human racecould use to get free of this dilemma, but obviously Herbert couldn't. Hisstyle of writing, that works to well with classics such as Dune, does notcarry through on this one. Not recommended,"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Great Start that goes nowhere","review":"The white plague is a disappointing work by a great author. Like many of Herbert's short stories he had a great beginning but not much else.

The Master author of the famous Dune series tries his hand at Greg Bear / Michael Crichton's genre (the scientific thriller) and fails miserably. For a work which aspires to world-spanning edge of seat teeth-gnashing plague-thriller this one comes no where near even Twelve Monkeys. Avoid it like the plague (pardon der pun). Ohhh, come to think about it, the protagonist could be a closet homosexual woman-hater (the genetically engineered kills off all women).

So the overview, reviews, and book jacket sold me that this work from Herbert could be an interesting and entertaining romp. And indeed, it did start out that way with an engaging setup for the book involving the IRA, a scientist and his family, and the question of terrorism which unfortunately remains an important part of our lives. However, the book soon devolved into one part Crichton pseudo science, one part religious/moral debate, and one small part action and entertainment. Not that any of these ingredients are bad - it is just that they are poorly executed and the flow of the book is brutally challenging. I stuck with it hoping it would pick up and that my efforts would pay off. Unfortunately, my stubbornness would not allow me to give up and by the end I remained unrewarded."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great terrorism/futuristic novel!","review":"This is one book all high school students should read.

I love this album! The beats always make my head nod. Fresh and utterly original, this album is defined by its decidedly back-to-the-future hip hop approach. While running light on samples, Tim concentrates on pushing the artistic envelope through experimental beats that effectively craft an identity for American-made electronic music. Within that buoyant and fluid framework is an atmosphere perfectly suited to the freestyle rhyming of Magoo & company. Tim's early work as a DJ is perfectly reflected in the album's mix of moods, styles and personnel. They created in an atmosphere free of pre-conceived limits and stylistic boundaries.

Although it is difficult to choose a favorite selection, I particularly enjoyed \\"Nearer, My God, To Thee\\" and \\"God Be With You Till We Meet Again\\", partly because these songs were new to me.

I've contacted them but I doubt they'll listen.That said, I've just started a subscription for this because, inspite of the seal, it has replaced sugar in our house. It has virtually no taste (we use it in everything -- coffee, mixed drinks, dessert sauces, etc...), it dissolves instantly, and has a low glycemic index which means fewer hot flashes.

It doesn't burn your hair at all, you can control the temp. so it can be really hot for subborn hair like mine, it isn't heavy, it makes your hair look super shiny, and you can turn the ends to make them looked curled and have a \\"finished\\" look.

On a first reading it may seem a little confusing because the heuristics are organized alphabetically, rather than pedantically. This is not hard to overcome because Polya helpfully boldfaces related heuristics and by following the suggested threads you can get a fairly smooth read on the first reading. The way I dealt with it was I put sticky notes on the topics as I read them, so I could skim the ones I had already looked when threads hit a topic repeatedly.I read this book many years ago, but it is still by my work station. I consult it when I get stuck on a problem, the heuristics do work.For a first reading, the flipping around is annoying, but for reference purposes, the alphabetical order of the heuristics is quite convenience. I suspect that the first reading will not be your last, so the author's tradeoff was the right one."},{"rating":"2","title":"For math thinkers maybe","review":"There seems to be a cultish following for Polya's book, so I decided to pick it up even though I'm not a mathematician. I'm a philosophy PhD with an interest in \\"business strategy\\" (as they call it). The book's a little bit tough to move through, since he chose to write it as a glossary for the bulk of the text. That makes it boring. The more fundamental issue of course is that he's thinking about math when he gives his ideas for solving problems, and more specifically about TEACHING kids to solve math problems. Now, this is useful. And the general tenor is applicable to all kinds of problem solving. But I think it's not the holy grail it's meant to be -- there are other books on problem solving that make more practical sense if you are working on non-formal mathematical puzzles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful in many areas","review":"I used the techniques in How to Solve It to find my latest job.

Their supplied function leaves a blatant security hole that any average hacker can use to bomb the script and potentially your web server. All examples are oversimplified and remain poorly explained. The reason other people rate this book as GREAT is because they are not aware of the potential harmfulness that a few lines of insecure code can do. As a webmaster, I am qualified to bash this book. The book follows up by NOT mentioning anything about taint checking, warning flag, or the use of the \\"strict\\" pragma which should be used in ALL CGI scripts (if not all Perl scripts together).

Strict jazz traditionalists will beg to differ, but this album takes jazz to an artistic level never before reached. Miles Davis embodies what an artist is. The arrangement of the orchestra complement Davis' statements very well. The most powerful arrangement is \\"Saeta,\\" with its opening horns, almost introducing the listener to a world he or she has never been to, and may never return from. This album should be listened to from start to finish. I first listened to the album in eighth grade, and it hasn't ceased to amaze me. It is absolutely essential for any fan of Miles Davis, jazz, and/or art."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where is the Bass?","review":"This music is the best example of classical music meets jazz. The music is played with great subtle power. There is deep feeling in most every track. My biggest complaint however is the bass is extremly low in the mix, my 120 watt B&W subwoofer is the only thing that saves this terrible problem. Why do so many old jazz albums suffer from such problems. Some people believe that the bass is the most important part of the rhythmn section, why do such an injustice? The music is so good it should get 5 stars but with the reording being sub-par, I do not see it. If you have a subwoofer turn the bass up and discover the real way to hear this materpiece."},{"rating":"1","title":"For devoted Miles Davis fans only","review":"I think this is the only Miles Davis disk/record I've ever listened to that I honestly do not like. This is most definitely not the \\"cool jazz\\" of Kind of Blue - it's a very different, brassier, in some places atonal and in-your-face type of jazz. For me, it just didn't work."},{"rating":"1","title":"tone poems don't make it","review":"Davis plays some of the best trumpet of his career, the arrangements and orchestration are impressive, the sound is impeccable, but with the exception of Track 5 \\"Solea,\\" it just doesn't swing. The nod to Spanish classical music might have looked good on the charts, but of Davis's collaborations with Gil Evans, this one I can do without."},{"rating":"1","title":"Even if you love Miles, you may be disappointed","review":"I love Miles Davis, from his early days to most of his work towards the end of his career. But this album is really hard to like. The feel is orchestral; it doesn't swing. The compositions are forgettable and Miles' soloing is eclipsed by the weight of the accompanying orchestra. It's not that this type of effort couldn't succeed, but this one doesn't. Disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bleeding Ears","review":"My main problem is how unexpectedly LOUD it becomes at random, the trumpet being the usual culprit from what I remember. I turn it up to hear the beautiful, elegant light sounds in the background, then BAM the horns comes in and makes me feel like my head got sawed in half horizontally from ear to ear (I dont say that euphemistically, at all). I never thought the differences in volume among the parts would carry so much weight on an album, but it does at least on the recording I have. There are definitely great parts to the album, and I get it out every now and then b/c the cultural richness + Miles Davis is certainly attractive. The things I like about it, however, are more fully expressed in the electric/fusion era albums, which I listen to like there's no tomorrow. Agharta, Pangaea, Dark Magus, Bitches Brew."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spanish love song...","review":"Miles Davis working with arranger and composer Gil Evans put together an album that ranked 356 on Rolling Stones Top 500 albums of all time. It is probaly one of his most accessible albums and the tight compositions take you to the Spanish bullfight and quiet burning passion of a long, hot Spanish summer day. Not the the hardblowing, improvisational jazz that everyone associates with Miles but the arrangements and tight composition makes for a very relaxing, enjoyable listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential Miles Davis","review":"This album, another of Miles' collaborations with Gil Evans, is a breathtaking and beautiful piece of music from start to finish. The Spanish texture to the compositions give this disc a magical, mystical sound. First rate performances all around. This disc belongs in the collections of jazz and non-jazz fans alike."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pura Fama","review":"No es ni cerca la mejor interpretacion de Davis y es por lejos la peor colaboracion que tuvo con Evans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Muzak-y Miles","review":"This one doesn't fly for me; thanks to the torpid big band arrangements, it's the musical equivalent of an overstuffed sofa. Good \\"classy\\" bsckground music for a cocktail party perhaps, but to sit down and seriously listen to all the way through? Nope. Of course, I might not be really qualified to judge it, since I don't care for any of the Davis-Evans collaborations, and my favorite Miles album is \\"Dark Magus!\\" Hardcore Miles is the Miles for me, his \\"pretty\\" stuff I can do without."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow, sad and boring","review":"Don't get me wrong!. This is not bad music at all. In fact, one of the things I like of Miles Davis is his ability on always looking ahead and trying something different. And he tried many things. And mostly he succeed. But although many people like this record I just don't happen to understand it. But I can't deny the effect of this record on me: It bores me. Like most of classical music.

So you begin to fear the worst about listening to a \\"jazzy\\" Saeta or a Solea and prepare yourself for a shock, you close your eyes and all of a sudden you are in Seville. From that very moment I could not stop listening to it, It is not the quality of the Jazz played, it is the fact that Davis was able to understand all the strong feelings involved. I do recommend everyone who loves this album to get hold of a \\"flamenco cd\\" and you will really understand what it is so great about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must own","review":"Sketches of Spain is a masterpiece in the truest sense of the word.

His amount of innovation and work can be compared with Mozart's work in classical. This Sketches of Spain work is one of the five innovations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Add Me To Its List of Fans!","review":"I learned about this recording while watching the Ken Burns series on \\"Jazz\\" on DVD. I've got it now and have been listening to it continuously. It reminds me of many things. It is spare and Minimal like much of modern art (Miles Davis was also quite a good modern painter). Yet the Latin musical elements are definitely there as well with the modern art, right there making this album a very unique combination. The Burns' film said women are huge buyers of this album and I can see why. It is a very emotional recording, very romantic yet the potential for melancholy and sadness is there too. The cover image of Miles is of him being the matador to a charging bull but it is quite clear that he is the universal idealized lover as well. It is hard to believe this album was recorded over 30 years ago because it sounds so fresh and new. OTOH, have I been hearing music like this made recently? Of course not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Try it .

The work on the restoration and on the blu-ray edition is fabulous! It's like if it had been filmed last year! Picture and sound have been improved at their best. I've only given 4 stars because the special features section has no foreign subtitles. Warner haven't done a good job with the subtitles on the bonus features. The back cover says \\"French, Spanish, German, Italian and Portuguese\\" but NO, there are only English subtitles. It's a deceptive advertising, a big mistake and a total disappointment because the special features section contains many interesting documents. Unfortunately, foreign buyers can't appreciate that section! I've checked the French blu-ray edition and it is absolutely the same mistake.

This was, however, not a movie you could talk through. You really had to pay attention.

Grant is, well, Grant. Funny and serious at the same time. Still, this is a \\"wrong man\\" movie extraordinaire. I had not seen this in years, and I had forgotten most of the plot. But seeing it again I could not but wonder how well this story is told. Hitchcock is a master storyteller. Even my 8-year old understood and enjoyed the \\"plot\\" and the \\"mix-up\\". That aside, the blu-ray presents a 16:9 image (1.78:1) of great clarity, with a wonderful color palette, and clear sound. The \\"restoration\\" (it is a 50-year old movie) is of exceptional quality.

He gets the lion's share of the credit for this well-crafted classic but you also have to give credit to Ernest Lehman, the screenwriter. Anybody ever read what William Goldman said about this movie in \\"Which Lie Did I Tell?\\"? He was very complimentary of the screenplay, pointing out that about a dozen plot points are all tied up in the last minute or so of the film.And how can you go wrong with Cary Grant? The great thing about Grant was that unlike most freakishly beautiful movie stars, he always came across as self-deprecating & not especially impressed with his own good looks. I think that's what made him so endearing. Never more so than in this masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classics are classics for a reason","review":"I would not presume to add much to the reviews here, and indeed the reviews through the decades since this movie came out.

Thornhill (played by Carey Grant) must find out who Kaplan is, what the bad guys want with him and how to clear his own name in a murder he didn't commit.

McVay - Author"},{"rating":"2","title":"North By Northwest","review":"This movie is one of Hitchcock's masterpieces. When I watched it, I noticed that there were many differences between 1960s and today, which were about fashions, life styles, romances, technologies, and actions. While for the time the clothing, scene designs, and special effects must have seemed very modern, today the styles are hip and retro. Moreover, when you watch carefully, you can find un-changed scenes such as the pub which is in Plaza Hotel and Mt. Rushmore. If you watch this movie, you can find many things about 50s fashions. I like this movie and you should watch this great masterpiece!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Hitch Flick","review":"Although I think this is a very good film, I do not believe it is one of Hitchcock's best pictures. The main problems I have with the film are that the pace of is a little too slow and some of the action sequences are a bit dated. There is also no getting around some of the set shots, which are a bit trite. On location shooting would have been much more effective. As an aside, I think Welles is a slightly better director when comparing the best work of these two directors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who is George Kaplan?","review":"This has become a classic Alfred Hitchcock film, with film score by Bernard Herrmann.

I do not know why such a brief scene was deleted except the editor of the BluRay thought something was amiss and jarring. The New York Central 20th Century Limited had an agreement with the Santa Fe Super Chief to attach a Pullman first class sleeper car from the arriving Super Chief in Chicago and take it in to New York City. Thus the passengers on the Super Chief did not need to transfer with their luggage from Dearborn Station to LaSalle Street Station. The whole car was switched over to the 20th Century. The reverse was true for Super Chief through passengers from NYC to L.A.

When you first watch North By Northwest you may think, it's a very entertaining movie and nothing beyond that. Actually it is an extremely entertaining story and nothing beyond that. And it is one of the greatest examples of the genius of Hitchcock! He's the only director I know who could take a story as trivial and create such a mood of place and character, that every scene is successful in tone, mood and creative scene development. I feel like I've been put in a slight hypnotic state every time I see it. It is the bible of narrative for the action and spy genre.

Eva Marie Saint was a BABE."},{"rating":"2","title":"Returning the Magic","review":"Like most people that saw this movie in 1959, I loved and saw it several times over the years , placing it in my top 20. I saw it several years ago on VHS and thought, maybe this movie really wasn\`t the blockbuster I thought it to be. BUT THEN, I saw it on the new DVD version and the beautiful scenes were back and the splendid background music by Bernard Herrmann that Hitchcock used so perfectly in many of his best films was back in abundance. There are many films that are pretty much the same in VHS or DVD but North by Northwest is the winner by far in the DVD version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Once seen, who could ever forget it?","review":"Marvelous old film with Cary Grant, who really made very few truly bad movies. It's a romance, it's a comedy, it's a thriller - three genres that only someone of Alfred Hitchcock's myriad talents could pull off so well. Grant plays an ad exec who the enemy mistakes for an undercover agent; when he realizes the bad guys are after him with intent to do serious bodily harm, he of course takes off running, leaps onto a train, and meets Eva Marie Saint. Romance ensues amid continuing skullduggery. There are several unforgettable scary thriller scenes, including the chase by a plane in the middle of a cornfield and the final beauty on the face of Mt. Rushmore - and the final, final scent back on the train with EM Saint.Top notch entertainment that never gets old."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best intrigue movies ever","review":"I first saw North by Northwest about three years ago, and I immediately put it among my top 50 favorites of all time. I recently got to see it again on DVD, and this time I then watched it with the running screenwriter's commentary and watched also the separate features.I won't rehash the plot here, so I won't reveal anything to the newcomer to this film. The first time I saw it I wondered \\"What could possibly be going on here?\\" The extras on the DVD really explain how this all came about, and I am glad that director Alfred Hitchcock and screenwriter Ernest Lehman were able to brainstorm out this spellbinding thriller, based on a bunch of ideas they had thought up.I notice they call it a comedy. I still don't really get that feeling about it as a whole, but it doesn't really matter. If Fargo and Pulp Fiction are comedies, then I suppose this can be one too."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best movies ever","review":"Cary Grant was a master of subtle romantic comedy, but he was also an outstanding actor in other films as well -- including this classic thriller in which he costars with the great James Mason and the beautiful Eva Marie Saint. In addition to being a classic thriller, this movie has an outstanding music score. In every way it is one of the best movies ever made. If you haven't yet seen it, you should.At the end of his career Grant received an Academy Award for lifetime achievement, but it amazes me that he was nominated only once for a best actor Academy Award when year after year he gave outstanding performances of various kinds which merited recognition. In my opinion, Cary Grant was the best performer of the Golden age of Hollywood -- as he shows again in this all time classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor color quality","review":"I am extremely disappointed with this DVD. The color quality is very poor. The skin looks very green in most of the scenes. It really detracts from the story as I kept thinking they all looked like Frankenstein. The sound is also very low and I had to turn the volume on the TV up to 30 (when it is usually at 10). I would not recommend this version to anybody. The extra disk does not make up for the poor quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hitchcock at his best.","review":"North By Northwest is an essential film for anyone who appreciates 20th century films by the masters. A sparkling script and a perfect cast create a period piece that transcends its era with the device of mistaken identity coupled with a chance romance sparking a series of events that are at once believable and improbable. Only Hitch could do this and few, if any, today could hope to match this classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Classic","review":"Great thriller, Superb quality. Enjoyed every bit of the film.

One of the beat Hitchcock's movie"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hitchcock, Grant, and Herrmann....WUNDEBAR!","review":"Wedged between two exercises in the psychosexual (\\"Vertigo\\" and \\"Psycho\\"), Alfred Hitchcock made a truly entertaining chase flick. \\"North by Northwest\\" features a cross-country joy ride of familiar landmarks as Cary Grant's \\"Roger Thornhill\\" tries to elude both the henchmen of James Mason (SUPERB!) and our own government (headed by Hitchcock stalwart Leo G. Carroll). Eva Marie-Saint, though not as alluring as other Hitchcock \\"blonds\\" adds the right blend of mystery and sex appeal to her character. Martin Landau, in an early role, is featured as Leonard, Mason's right-hand man.The movie also sports a brilliantly exciting Bernard Herrmann score.So, set your travel plans to include a trip \\"North by Northwest.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting chase","review":"Cary Grant is Roger Thornhill, an advertising executive who gets mixed up in espionage when he is mistaken for a secret agent named George Kaplan. He meets up with the beautiful and mysterious Eva Marie Saint and the two embark on a dangerous game of cat and mouse that culminates in a chase across Mount Rushmore.This is a suave and intelligently scripted entertainment, although it is quite contrived at times. After all, could anyone really cradle a dying man and pluck the knife out of his body by accident the way Grant does at the UN? And, handsome though he may be, Grant seemed a little old for a hottie like Eva Marie Saint to be throwing herself at him without an ulterior motive. It seemed odd to me that he never appeared to question that her attraction to him was spontaneous and genuine. Maybe I'm nit-picking. James Mason and Martin Landau are fantastic as the villains!"},{"rating":"2","title":"STILL A RUSH","review":"It's hard to be cynical about this Alfred Hitchcock classic from 1959. The impeccable Cary Grant, looking dashing and fit as ever, carries the movie that is filled with deception, lies, murder, chases, you name it..it's there. He's joined by one of Hitchcock's ubiquitous blondes, the lovely Oscar-winner Eva Marie Saint, and the villain is the dashing James Mason. In an early role, Martin Landau projects cheesy villainry; Leo G. Carroll bounced back from \\"Tarantula\\" as the conniving intelligence director; and Jessie Royce Landis played a rather youthful looking mother to Mr. Grant.The plot should be known to all movie connosieurs by now, but how can one forget the unusual stabbing in the UN; the quiet terror of the biplane's attack; the breathtaking finale on Mount Rushmore. Ernest Lehman's intelligent script and the always dependable Bernard Hermann's musical score bring this classic to cinematic life for now and ever. They don't make romantic suspense movies like this anymore!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The gasping Mount Rushmore finale is unforgettable.","review":"This film may be a bit complicated to follow at first, but quite simply it's another classic Hitchcock cat-and-mouse story. This time it's Cary Grant on the run. The gasping Mount Rushmore finale is unforgettable. This DVD version is not the squeezy widescreen, but is almost a full-screen. There is a good documentary called \\"Destination Hitchcock: The Making of North By Northwest\\" hosted by Eva Marie Saint. Also on this DVD is the Hitchcock trailers and the tv spot. Alfred Hitchcock's traditional cameo appearance is at the start of this film, so you can sit back and totally relax and enjoy the picture."},{"rating":"2","title":"great intrigue, with comic relief","review":"I have seen this movie many time and it never gets old.

That annoys me. It's not that they sometimes don't put aspect ratios up or put the wrong aspect ratios up. That annoys me. What REALLY annoys me is that they take reviews from other previously released discs, in this instance old DVDs of North by Northwest, and link them to a new disc like this (which isn't even out as I type this), the WBs 50th anniversary North by Northwest DVD. I guess the braniacs at Amazon.com and Amazon.UK don't think that anyone cares about the disc itself. Anyway, this is why I am giving Amazon 1 star. I would give them a 0 if they allowed me to.

Unfortunately the DVD that I bought from Amazon marketplace is defective. I didn't try to watch this until after the return period (so money spent was lost). Midway through the film, when Cary Grant is at the auction house, the DVD starts showing just pixels, skips, and nothing further can be seen even when trying to advance to other scenes. The DVD disc itself was brand new, no scratches, so there must have been something wrong with this batch. I hope Warner re-releases this soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Deal","review":"When I tried to watch this DVD, once it got to about half way through, it began to skip badly. It never got past the skip and I was not able to watch the movie until the end. I took the DVD out of the player and saw that it had a big scratch in it. I knew it was used when I bought it, but I guess I had hoped I would be able to actually watch the movie. I'm going to try and run it through a scratch repair machine. If that doesn't fix it, I guess I'll have to send it back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Odd woman out","review":"While I agree that this is a very sleek looking film and there is something appealing about being mistaken for a spy-I really felt as if the plot is nothing more than a series on convenient incidences. I'm sure that this was cutting edge material for a film in 1959, it just strikes me as silly now. But from the silly idea of let's liquor him up and drive him off a cliff to a crop dusting plane plowing into gas truck, I honestly couldn't stop rolling my eyes to the back of my head.

To listen to this CD after listening to his work on Concord is a revelation.The singing is great, the songs are top-notch. But the musicians and arrangements are putrid. One can get diabetes from the sugar in them. It is as if Mersey (the arranger) had a quota to put every effect and every instrument into every song. The Nearness of You is just one example, so is Rankin's Haven't We Met.Compare this to Torme's work with Buddy Rich or with his quartet. This comes FAR behind those great CDs."},{"rating":"2","title":"CAN YOU SPOT THE SIMILARITY BETWEEN MEL TORME AND MICHAEL BUBLE?","review":"... compare the balladeering style between Buble and Torme and you'll see what I mean (heck, go ahead and pronounce their last names - coincidence?)... although Buble constantly refers to Sinatra and Bobby Darin as his musical heroes, I'll bet there's a lot of Mel Torme records tucked away in his collection that he's not admitting to - there's just no denying the similarity between the two singers, particularly their way with a slow song."},{"rating":"2","title":"mel torme-silky smooth","review":"this is the mel torme that his fans and all who hear him in the future, will remember. the smooooth voice and stick to the melody style with very little jazz variations. the selections on this cd should appeal to the purist standards listener. the selections are well grouped to flatter the performer and treat the listener to a sentimental journey. wonderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential music","review":"I first bought this because I wanted to know more about Powell and Monk. I have never been disappointed listening to this and loved it more with each listening. The Monk pieces convinced me to buy everything of his I could lay my hands on but I also reached back to Powell's early albums and one of his last, \\"Bud Powell in Paris\\" a few years after this one, produced by Duke Ellington, on Reprise. The best moment I had with this album was sharing it with a college music class. While one jerk kept wondering why people applauded after each tune (to classical purists you never applaud until the end of a concert, not after each piece) the rest discussed how Powell's style cut across classical lines and it encouraged more jazz listening. Not a year has gone by that I haven't played this album so if you don't know bebop or Monk or Powell, this is a great introduction to all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating","review":"During his years in Paris, Bud Powell continued to struggle with mental, health and substanc problems, emerging numerous times with recordings that occasionally matched his earlier (ridiculously high) standards, but more often, were merely solid. This is one of them. It is fascinating, however, to hear Powell play the music of his longtime friend Thelonious Monk. In his late years, Powell's playing became increasingly spare---and more Monk-like in approach. ON this recording, you can hear how what they had in common, even if their piano stylings were, on the surface, different."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish it was better","review":"I liked the first book and look forward to Book 3: however, this just didn't satisfy me as a reader or comic fan. There's been a lot said about the typos and missing words: it happens a lot through out the book. The story, however, was too drawn out in some areas and didn't explain enough in some. One thing that really bothered me was the author describing Malovio's ring being vulnerable to wood; it should only have been vulnerable to \\"yellow\\" if it was a Corp. ring. The book's jacket cover would have you believe that Hal Jordan is a significant part of the book, but he only appears for the briefest time. I hope there is more depth in the third installment."},{"rating":"1","title":"substandard research by college kids","review":"I've carried both Let's Go and Lonely Planet guides while visiting Thailand, and found LP much more usable and informative.The maps in Let's Go are relatively few and far between. The Lonely Planet has a lot more maps, and with a lot more detail than the LG maps.LG used college students to research and write the guide, and it felt to me as if they hadn't been to many of the places described in the guide. It seems as if the basic info might have been taken from other guides, then couched in pseudo-hip language. I don't think any of the student authors had ever been to Thailand before, much less written a travel guide."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my favorite","review":"After using Lonely Planet and Rough Guide I wanted to give Let's Go a chance. Although it did give most of the information needed, it's writing style was annoying and opinionated. It also did not have all the maps needed, nor were the existing maps very easy to find.

I found this one and it initially looked very promising. The book does contain some good information, but the authors attitude does put me off. There are more than several instances when the author makes judgements on the different breeds of travlers often lableing them as ignorant or somehow not worthy. An example is if a tourist enjoys shopping the local goods as much as the local culture. Somehow this is beneath the author who seems very self righteous.

I do not recommend this book for anyone looking to learn Access on their own, moreover anyone who is looking for an advanced book on Access programming & Features."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a bad book, but data files are unavailable","review":"The book is decent, but it's structured as a tutorial and the data files are no longer available. The book lists a web address for download of the files, but the link redirects to a different site. Acquisition of the original publisher, perhaps? Either way. a tutorial with no data is useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Behind every powerful woman should be a meticulous editor.","review":"As a journalist and enlisted soldier, I would have no qualms about handing this \\"manuscript\\" back to Ms. Kennedy and telling her to start over. She has an amazing story and is one of the great pillars of the military, but one has to wonder, who is her audience here?She lost her enlisted readers after remarking that she had to use \\"the enlisted latrine\\" as a captain in the middle of a freezing night near the demilitarized zone in Korea because the officer's latrine was to far away. It had nothing to do with the story and deepened the huge gap between officers and enlisted soldiers. Besides, in the field, a latrine is a latrine and I'd be rather happy to even have one available! I was very disappointed in this fact (as well as in the disorganized context, vague discriptions, and non-existent chronology). What sad messages to hear from one of the Army's pioneers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read on an Interesting Person","review":"This is a good read about a very interesting person. It has been my pleasure to know her and so reading it and serving in the early 70s brought back a bunch of memories. Thanks for putting this book on the Kindle!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"I looked forward to reading Gen Kennedy's memoirs with great anticipation, only to be very disappointed with its poor quality. Where do I begin? for starters, it seems like it was written by a 6th grader, with very short, truncated sentences that go nowhere. Second, it doesn't follow in a logical flow, bouncing from anecdotal stories about the Gen's life, to her own views on success and what it takes to make it in the world today. Very disjointed. Third, the story is just not there...nothing near what we've seen in Colin Powell's or Stormin' Norman's own memoirs...and I believe Gen Kennedy's story is just as important as their's. Very, very disappointed...hope her political ambitions are better thought out and executed."},{"rating":"1","title":"A noxious work","review":"Claudia Kennedy under wartime circumstances would be tried for treason for her emasculation of the U.S. Army.

Fabulous and georgous!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Isn't at all great","review":"It may be unfair to compare Deborah Voigt with the many great singers of the past. However, given that there are so many great performances available on record, one can only find this new recording to be not up to the challenge.In fact, Voigt is merely adequate for most of the time, and her voice is a bit too small for Wagner. Even her top notes aren't sufficiently powerful and free. Isn't really great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the real thing","review":"Listening to this cd, I can't help feeling that many singers nowadays are taking on roles that don't suit them. Voigt isn't a real Straussian or Wagnerian soprano. Her voice lacks thrust and the top notes are far too thin to do the music justice. She just skims through her music without pay much attention to the text, which is also important in that repertoire.Given that there're infinitely better versions of these pieces in the record catalogues, this recording simply isn't a viable competitor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the right voice","review":"Deborah Voigt does not have the right voice for this kind of repertoire. Her voice is too slim for that, and she doesn't yet have the right style of singing. Her renditions are very bland as a result, and there are moments of great strain. I think she should stick to the lighter repertoire which she excels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsatisfactory","review":"Deborah Voigt does have a beautiful voice. However, a beautiful voice alone cannot do justice to the demanding music here. Voigt simply does not have the voice and expression for the Wagner roles, and her performances in the Strauss's excerpts are unwieldy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacks weight","review":"This disc is not worth its artistic weight, which is on the side of minimum. It is devoid of that elusive quality known as magic, a quality endowed on very few, a quality that cannot be bought. In this release at least, Ms. Voigt looks and sounds like a workingclass gay man's idea of an opera singer. What a turnoff!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This disc is representative of everything that is wrong with the classical music recording industry (the little that is left of it). Simply said, it does not come close to the legacies of the veritable artists we know so well. D. Voigt is by no means a remotely good singer, let alone someone with a voice resembling distinction. She is dull, unimaginative and monotonal. Grey. Unintelligent. And down from there. Do not believe the ads."},{"rating":"1","title":"A poor substitute","review":"So the Wagner and Strauss repertoire is now in the hands of singers like Voigt. Oh dear! Voigt is a poor substitute for those truly great singers of yester-years. This recording shows how limited her vocal and emotional ranges are."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incompetent and inexpressive","review":"I do think that Deborah Voigt has a great personality. However, this isn't sufficient to make her a great singer. As can be patently heard from this new recording, her vocal quality is very so-so, and, more surprising, her top notes are very constricted and lacking in power, which is a lethal handicap for anyone who attempts this particular repertoire.Even more damaging is the inexpressive singing. Voigt seems to be using the same kind of emotion for all the tracks. One just can't discern from her singing alone what the characters are thinking and feeling. Such unimaginative, and even perfunctory, interpretation is just not enough.A disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't compare to Jane Eaglen","review":"I'm afraid Deborah Voigt has chosen the wrong repertoire, as she simply does not have the voice for these heavy Wagner and Strauss roles. Just listen to Jane Eaglen in the DVD of the Metropolitan Tristan and Isolde and you will realise that Eaglen is much better equipped for these type of roles.It is better for Voigt to be content with being the lady in waiting for Eaglen than to assume parts that are so obviously unsuitable for her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kabumpo is missing","review":"I have been wondering where this purches was.

If you like jazz or Miles you will definitely LOVE Porgy and Bess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too blue....","review":"I adore Miles Davis and also Gil Evans. They have played together very successfully, and the works featuring them together have become classics. However, I was disappointed with this CD. To play on Miles's \\"Kind of Blue,\\" I would like to say that this album is \\"way too blue\\". It is too slow, too dreamy, very rambling, and sometimes only the ghost of the melody can be heard. It put me to sleep. I was highly disappointed,"},{"rating":"2","title":"Exquisite, timeless, without artificial genre boundary...","review":"When Miles Davis teamed up with Gil Evans to create this masterpiece, music history was redefined.There is a feeling of the intricate arrangement by Evans with the raw and instinctual feel of a group that is feeding off each other, reading new music, and exploring new relationships.The solo work of Davis (and other orchestra members, really) is exquisite, and you hear him exploring the upper reaches of his range - all the while striking a balance between a beautifully piercing high-register and the familiar mellow, airy, and smooth tone of the Miles we all know and love.For the aspiring musician, this is a perfect album with which to single out one instrument or musician, and to learn how one horn player can be an essential part of a bigger team.Melancholy at times, goosebump inducingly dramatic at others, wrapped up with the peppy and 'happy' \\"There's a boat leaving soon for New York,\\" this album will have you listening over and over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Muy bueno","review":"Esta es una excelente grabación de Miles Davis.

His unorthodox views on such diverse topics as organized religion, the nature of God, international terrorism, growing old, and melted cheese will leave you either questioning long-held assumptions or violently disagreeing with the author.Personally, I found a subtle strain of humor between the covers of this slim volume that made the trip most enjoyable. I do not know whether comparisons with Andy Rooney and/or Bill Maher are apt, as I haven't read their books, but would place J. Danton Smith squarely in the tradition of such American humorists as Mark Twain, Will Rogers, and Jean Shepherd (with a nod to Steven Wright).My only complaint is that the book is too short. I eagerly await Volume 2."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I notice all the above reviews are from New Jersey, so they must be relatives of the author.

I am amazed such a foolish book got published."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best","review":"This is one of the most entertaining and fascinating books I have read in a long time. The characters that made the wild west are brought to life by many tie ins to the 101 Ranch. Who knew that this icon of western life had such a role in the formation of the movie industry and how the culture of the west became the beginnings of Hollywood. This is one of my most recommended books that I have read this year. Exciting, touching and informative. This is more than just non-fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"never again","review":"We will never again behold such a great trio in action. This three guitar gods going at it with fire and passion, playfully crafting a work of art for the ages.

Sit down and pay attention to all the little details in this great album, you'll see what im talking about."},{"rating":"2","title":"WoW","review":"Everytime I listen to this CD I come away with something new. I've been listening to this since the 80's and every time I get goosebumps. Three geniuses come together on a magical night and create this something that happens once in a lifetime. I've always thought it would be a great if the three could collaborate and write a book on their inspirations for doing this, how much did they *really* practice and such. It would an incredible read. Today my kids (8 and 10) were listening to this on my iPOD and were blown away!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"True Guitar Mastery.........!","review":"I have been a guitar fanatic for years! Most of the usual rock/blues/classical guitarists will come to the minds of most \\"in the know\\" music fans out there! (Satriani, EVH, VAI, Robben Ford, Holdsworth, Malsteem,...etc).Then, a friend gave me somewhat of a smug smile as I mentioned the above names and mentioned \\"Friday Night in San Francisco\\".I bought it for just 800yen(I live in Japan), and was absolutely floored.Period. I cannot imagine a more talented group of guitar players than this trio. From the first song to the last(all 5 of them), these men exhibit true guitar brilliance and technical mastery.With every listen, I constantly ask myself this: \\"How long have these men played the instrument?

In theory it sounds like it should make great listening but, in reality, without experiencing the excitement live by actually being there, this doesn't really work that well.The songs all sound too similar, the lightening fast riffs take a front seat to the actual melodies and you cannot discern who is playing (with the exception of Paco).If you get this because you want to hear virtuosos, then this is effective. If you want to hear good music, you should stick with the studio versions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gallico sold out!","review":"Schlocky sequel...author admittedly penned this just to satisfy Filmmaker's lust for a movie version (which was an ultimate bomb, too).

Reading her poems is a great way to start your day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overpriced...........","review":"I'm a big fan of Ms. Ely's book, Saving Dinner, so I was very excited to find her study guide for kids. However, I was disappointed to open the box and find only 32 one-sided pages, loose with no binding at all. Of these, only 21 pages are worksheets and parent guides--the rest are a food diary! It's cleverly designed and kid-friendly, but not worth $8.95! In addition, the information is heavily weighted toward identifying carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. Good info for kids, but I was hoping to steer my picky eater toward fruits and veggies and there was little information on the their benefits."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Fantastic!","review":"The Lost Van Gogh by A.J. Zerries is a book fueled by action and intrigue. Its many twists and turns keep the reader on the edge of his/her seat, and the themes that run through it promise to keep anyone interested. Whether readers want an inside look at the world of art dealing, the workings of the NYPD, the hunt for Nazis in the years since World War II, or the human condition in general, they will find themselves anxiously turning page after page.Readers can also count on being drawn in by the book's extremely well-developed characters, particularly those of Detective Clay Ryder and Dr. Rachel Meredith. A.J Zerries writes in such a way that readers get to know the characters from the very beginning and develop a strong attachment to them before they're even aware of it.The Zerries' book is artfully written, well-researched, and is not to be missed. Five stars!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Premise Overblown Writing","review":"This story has an incredible premise. The plot line is phenomenal. The problem with it is that the writing is verbose and overblown. If it had been well edited it would have been a page turner. As it is now after wading through the overdone verbiage to an unsatisfactory conclusion I wanted to fling the book when I finished it. In fact if the premise had not been so good I might very well not have finished reading it at all. Some of the situations seemed a bit far fetched as they do in Dan Brown novels but Dan Brown makes the suspense of belief more palatable."},{"rating":"1","title":"ghost book number 2","review":"Sorry, this is the same as THE STYX.

I have some of their albums but never bought a CD because I wanted one with all the songs I've enjoyed over the years. After reading the reviews about this CD I thought I'd give it a try and I'm so happy I did! It's a great 2-CD collection. The first CD has the usual songs that ABBA's known for but the second CD has been a real treat! This is a great collection! I know ABBA isn't for everyone but if you love the good music, easy lyrics and fantastic harmony this is a good CD to think about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Double-Album","review":"Both compact discs of Forever Gold contain great songs and although I had difficulty listening to CD 2 at first, all the songs are the best. Now for those of you who only know Dancing Queen, Waterloo and Gimme! Gimme! Gimme!, this CD is defenitely for you because there is so much more to discover about ABBA. While CD 1(Abba Gold) shows fresh and poppish cherished songs and their biggest hits, CD 2(More Abba Gold) gives us a bit of a more obscure approach. The best songs of Abba Gold are Knowing Me Knowing You, Lay All Your Love On me, Gimme Gimme Gimme, Fernando, Waterloo and The Winner Takes It All. On More Gold Summer Night City is definetely the best one along with Ring Ring and When I Kissed The Teacher. I Am The City, the never-before-released song is a diamond in the ruff, really good!!! The Visitors and Under Attack show the darker side of Abba and are really haunting.So buy this CD because you can't lose!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"ABBA Review","review":"I think this is a good CD.

I have enjoyed other period ensembles--not this one. I have no problem with the quick tempo, but to me the dynamics seemed arbitrary in their extreme contrasts. Perhaps I simply prefer a more lyrical approach. The principal singers have a nasal tone quality that greatly annoyed me. I have heard at least one of them live sounding quite different, so I assume it was the conductor's decision that the singers sound more like oboes than human beings. I did enjoy the comic ensemble numbers (for example, \\"sua madre..). However, I missed the sense of emotional characterization in the major arias and recitatives that the other reviewers have praised. To me, this is an artificial and lifeless presentation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great disappointment.","review":"I believe the phrase is: don't send a boy in to do a man's job.

From \\"Cherry\\", \\"Clipped\\", \\"Coast Is Clear\\", to (my favourite on the album) the extended version of \\"Fait Accompli\\", there isn't a weak track on it. It sounds more abrasive than anything Skinny Puppy could put out, but at the same time, more lush than a Brian Eno wet dream.Time might have passed Curve by, but a certain band loved them enough to revamp/dilute the formula a few years later to mainstream success (read the other reviews to figure it out); the difference in quality between the two is massive.Shirley Manson, eat your heart out..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A showcase of Curve's best work","review":"Back in the era of \\"shoegazing\\" (late 80's, early 90's), when Brit bands such as My Bloody Valentine and Ride ruled the alternative landscape, there was another band that kicked serious... Curve. Fronted by Toni Haliday, Curve showcased her dreamy, yet occasionally menacing vocal style. She was the sort of starlet who could carry the band - kind of a precursor to Shirley Manson, the face behind Garbage. But the early iterations of Curve were less about the vocals, and more about the smorgasbord of sounds permeating through each track. Swirling, howling guitars intersect with the drum machines and traces of electronica to create sounds that cannot be classified as being dance music or mood music or whatever. Ten Little Girls, Blindfold, Frozen, and Clipped are the stellar tracks.Public Fruit is a collection of Curve's first 3 EPs. Public Fruit stands out, along side My Bloody Valentine's Loveless and Isn't Anything, as being a seminal CD from a long-gone era."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best of Curve","review":"This is easily the best of all of Curves work. I loved the Frozen EP right from the start, unfortunatly the EP got scratched and I had spent years looking for another copy, then Curve brought this complilation out, FANTASTIC.

Unfortunately, between them, ten alternate takes have yet to be upgraded from either mastering of the \\"Complete\\" collection.I have not heard \\"King of the Delta Blues\\"--I am basing this information on the song sample Amazon has provided.

It's important to know the roots, it's import to stand at the crossroads, you need not make a pac with the devil, but no one says that you can't dance with him for a bit either. Which pretty much brings us full circle, making this a review of this disc, and this material alone: King Of The Delta Blues is a great singles collection that will slide in nicely, adding that historic edge no one's collection is complete without, not to mention that the songs presented here are just flat out wonderful.And hey, you just might dig dancing with the devil, and in that case you and Mr. Johnson will be on a first name basis for all eternity.

This is a much more practical approach.For anyone who has to do a lot of note-taking, or who just wants to pen a handwritten note or letter, this book provides plenty of exercises to help to make your handwriting legible. There's a sample alphabet to learn the sequence of strokes and to adapt to your own hand. What I also found most useful was an exercise specifically to help join letters together.

I remember liking the movie and looked forward to the day when it would come out on DVD because I assumed it would be released in widescreen format. Much to my dismay the DVD version is another pan and scan transfer. Here was an opportunity to release the title with it's original Panavision, 2.35:1 aspect ratio but for some odd reason the distributors bypassed this option in favor of the old VHS pan and scan format. The movie is fun but far from a great film. But if a widescreen version was available I would definitely buy it. But a new DVD version in pan and scan seems like a waste of time to me. So I'll just pass on this one and hold on to my old VHS copy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Red Alert!Red Alert!

Some awsome matte shots are surrounded by cheesy, cheap, and bad effects. The plot is dismal, depressing, and somewhat obvious, etc. The music is good, and the acting is generally good (Thats the only reason it got 2 stars), and there are a few points in the movie where you actually care about the people, but thats overshadowed by the crap that makes up the rest of the movie.

It's full of misleading and erroneous information about the disease process, about research conclusions, and how the disease is staged. Nearly every page of the first third of this book contains some sort of factual blunder or error in logic. (The \\"Endometriosis Sourcebook\\" by Mary Lou Ballweg is far more informative.) I was particularly put off by her exuberance for hysterectomy as an answer to endometroisis. In summary, I believe this author should have steered clear of attempting to explain the disease and its treatments. She fares far better when she writes about resources and self-help."},{"rating":"1","title":"Information is incorrect","review":"I read the book and found there to be information that was wrong. I could not use the links in the back that were offered as they did not reach anything. Also, I find it nauseating that the author would write, \\"Jennifer Lewis is available for individual personal support related to endometriosis. Fees are negotiable.\\" I was stunned to say the least!!! First of all, if the author is not a social worker, psychologist, etc., how can she charge for this type of service. Secondly, if she really wants to help someone, why would she charge for this????The book was bad enough that it did not have correct information, but to add that she will offer support and FEES ARE NEGOTIABLE???? That was the straw that broke the camel's back, so to speak!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Counting All the Mistakes in this Book Exhausted Me!","review":"If you want to learn about endometriosis, skip this book. It's devoid of factual information. Instead, the author has made up her own terminology, created her own theories, misinterpreted research findings, and added a brand new staging category for the bewilderment of her readers! Her experience is also extremely unique. She says she had a hard time convincing her physicians she needed a hysterectomy. However, as a woman with this disease, my experience has been quite the opposite -- most doctors are more than willing to suggest (and sometimes push)hysterectomy, even with young women. It has been a struggle for me to convince them I'd like to keep my organs, thank you very much. However, this book is overwhelmingly pro-hysterectomy. That, coupled with the blatant errors, really turned me off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Found the book to have some inconsistencies and misinformati","review":"I found there to be misinformation in that the author states there are FIVE stages of endometriosis, when in fact, to date, there are only FOUR, and there were only four at the time this book was published.

Some of the information is suspiciously familiar from other works, but without the credit being given, such as what happened on her website not terribly long ago.My advice? Get a book that is well known for TRUE INFORMATION about Endometriosis, and not a book that only wants to depict the author and \\"how wonderful I am.\\" Glenda Motta has a terrific book.

See the movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT","review":"A good action movie. There's some good nudity in this movie especially the topless women in the car. The women has nice boobies."},{"rating":"1","title":"80's buddy cop movie","review":"It's no Lethal Weapon; I bought this cause I thought it was cool when I was a kid, not so cool as an adult when you can understand all the dialogue, in fact, you can probably say it sucks(a technical movie review term). But if you are into the whole 80's action movie genre then this would suit your tastes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two stars of Tango & Cash","review":"Tango & Cash is a movie about two cops (Stallone,Russell) that get framed, and get sent to prision for something they did not do. The interesting thing about Tango & Cash is that it is a comedy/action movie. There is good action in this movie but the comedy is not very good. Sylvester Stallone and Kurt Russell do a great job together. Stallone looks weird with his big glasses and banker suit, (the years of trying to branch out from Rocky & Rambo)Jack Palance however, does a good job at playing the vilian role.Overally Tango & Cash is an average movie and if you like action movies, you will enjoy this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb Lethal Weapon Clone","review":"I found this film 2 be quite enjoyable.Its clear that the writers were influenced by the success of Lethal Weapon as it is clearly evident in this film.I am very suprised that no sequels were ever made as I thought they could have made at least 1 more.Stallone was good in this picture but I thought Kurt Russell stole the show as Cash.Also Teri Hatcher was Good in this film also."},{"rating":"2","title":"not fantastic but kurt russell and stallone are a great screen team","review":"i liked this movie what can i say. it's silly never even close to being believeable but kurt russell is always great to me and he even makes stallone a little more fun to watch. as cpos set up and sent to prison for crime they didn't do they break out and hunt the bad guys down. noyhing new just more hummor and a young terri hatcher as stallone's sister and russell's love intrest. not earth shattering but a nice way to spend 97 min. of your time if you like action movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stallone & Rusell - an explosive combination","review":"I must say I'm a big fan of detective movies, and '80 were great time for that kind of films (action comedies, adventures...). We already had LETHAL WEAPON in that time, but this film really pushed the limits. Critics often say that this is a B-movie, but that is what they think. For me, this is one of the best Stallone's movies and he and Rusell are really good together as two heavy cops alway aguing and having a lot of troubles with Jack Palance, leader of some terrorist organization who send them to prison where they will meet their doom. Of course, they will win and the rest is to you to be seen. Don't listen the others who didn't like it - give your own oppinion (possitive, I hope)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forgettable","review":"this film was typical over the top 80's with different Gadgets and whatnot.Stallone doesn't have a chance in a Comedy or even a Semi-Comedy.Russell is out of place playing second fiddle to Stallone."},{"rating":"1","title":"For the Braindead","review":"If you enjoy watching UNREALISTIC situationsand scenarios on a visual screen, you are tolove this moronic film.

You haven't known darkness until you hear Ogre scream: \\"God's Gift Maggot!

The texture of the music is jagged and lives on many levels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mind:best puppy album ever","review":"This is the album that introduced not only D.R. Goettel, but a much darker,sinister sound-very intricate-abstract and has amazing sound texturing and some of the coolest damn film/TV samples by any band...like a childs nightmare set to music.Brilliant work, unlike any other skinny puppy album-or any other album whatsoever by any band-stands out as a quiet masterpiece; truly sublime...the kind of album you don't want to tell your friends about cuz it's too damn cool! I love 'too dark park' best-[but imho] however this IS the quintessential skinny puppy recording, a must have if you think you dig puppy but have it not! buy it now!-you will be pleased unto fear and terror on lonely nights while contemplating this dark work in our dark world...;)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good and horribly dated","review":"Half of the chainsaw EP that's included as bonus tracks are probably the best thing about this cd, which saddens me. There's not a song on here I can really sit through because most of the tracks are repatative and abrasive without being very interesting. At times I expect them to break out into the Miami Vice Theme Song due to some of the samples and instruments used. The followup, Cleanse Fold and Manipulate, is much MUCH better than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dive into this fast.","review":"I just recently picked this up after hearing the name for many years, because I was craving something along the \\"shoegazer\\" sound. I'm really glad I did, and I find this to be nearly the epitome of that genre. To compare, \\"Souvlaki\\" reminds me somewhat of early \\"Lush\\", a less catchy \\"Cocteau Twins\\", a more peaceful \\"Ride\\", and even a spacey \\"Verve\\", without any of those comparisons being too obvious. I also enjoy the both male and female vocals, where there are vocals. Overall I find this to be a must for any fan of the genre, and only wish I had gotten this 10 years ago."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why did I not buy this earlier?!?","review":"As a fan of My Bloody Valentine, I always knew about Slowdive, but I never purchased anything they recorded. My mistake. Souvlaki isn't as agressive as \\"Loveless\\" or \\"Isn't Anything\\", but it does produce the same kind of sonic punch that My Bloody Valentine produced. The best..ok, my favorite songs are \\"Machine Gun\\", \\"When the Sun Hits\\", and \\"Altogether\\", but there isn't a bad track on the record."},{"rating":"2","title":"That's Good Shoegazing","review":"Indeed, Souvlaki by Slowdive is a shoegazing mainstay. Though not as highly acclaimed or as widely regarded as My Bloody Valentine's Loveless, Slowdive's second album is, in my humble opinion, the second best record the shoegazing subgenre has to offer. In fact, among the sub-subgenre of shoegazing, dream pop, Souvlaki is about as dreamy and ethereal as anything, MBV included. The album opener, \\"Alison,\\" is a highpoint. A truly beautiful song. In fact the first four songs are absolutely breathtaking. Throw into the mix \\"Altogether\\" and \\"Dagger\\" and you've got a mesmerizing record here. An aboslute must for shoegazing fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bottled Velvet","review":"The album's first track, \\"Alison\\" powerfully plunges the listener into a world beyond ours, it's whirling wall of guitars and strings a labyrinth of shimmering lights. I appreciate this album the same way I appreciate a hammock. It peacefully takes you to far off places in your mind while at the same time remaining utterly human. For those daring to see infinity, Slowdive offers us a glimpse. The best time I've ever spent cloud-gazing with a set of headphones ."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Definite Step Forward From Their First Album","review":"slowdive's second album fills out some of the missing holes in their great first album. it manages to stick to the shoegazer structure of \\"just for a day\\" with some neat tricks. some songs trail off, slowly fade, use harmonics. some songs are just tighther popish songs. i think the production is a bit better than the first album also. \\"40 days,\\" \\"alison\\" and \\"souvlaki\\" are amazing standout tracks. definitely worth checking out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliance embodied","review":"This album was released to much anticipation in 1993 (import version). Being an intranced Slowdive listener from \\"Just For A Day\\", I spent the extra dough to get an advance copy. I have never spent a better $25.00. The album is a little less accessible than \\"Day\\" on the first couple of listens, but it will quickly grow into you. Oh, and for my money, \\"When The Sun Hits\\" is one of the 20 best, most moving songs I've heard in my lifetime."},{"rating":"2","title":"Diversions of Desparity - beautiful music about sad times","review":"When I was a Disc Jockey in College I remember listening to \\"Alison\\", the opening track, for the first time. Neils vocals capture the thoughts of a man reaching out to a woman whose dysfunctional lifestyle fuels his desire to be near her. I was deeply moved to the point of near obsession as I searched high-and-low for this CD. Upon acquisition, many of the songs reflected a similar state of mind that many have felt but few are capable of leaving behind. Probably the most heartbreaking track, \\"Country Rain\\", finds Rachel Goswell singing about an estranged love now gone and the requisite pain of waking up in a bed alone. A superlative use of the slide guitar gives the song an almost SouthWestern kind-of- feel. Though sad at times, this CD is a wonderful mix of sounds for the mind. Anyone interested in the \\"shoegazing\\" and \\"dreampop\\" movement of the early 90's would benefit greatly from the songs presented herein."},{"rating":"2","title":"when they broke up, I wanted to die","review":"This record, and the band Slowdive, are so brilliant and beautiful and sublime; the sounds that come out of the guitars alone are absolutely stunning and beyond belief. The first three songs and \\"When the Sun Hits\\" are four stars fallen from heaven. Seeing them live on this tour at Maxwell's in Hoboken = one of the highlights of my life. Neil and Rachel, please reform this band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful and dreamy","review":"Slowdive have such an irresistible sound... I feel like I'm floating in space and watching stars pass by my eyes when I listen to their albums. My favorite tracks on Souvlaki are Alison, Machine Gun, Here She Comes, and Souvlaki Space Station. The only reason I didn't give this album 5 stars was that I think that Just for a Day is an even better album, but Souvlaki is definitely worth owning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Import of 1994--bar none","review":"I've already worn out a copy of this album, and it never ceases to entrall me. Just for a Day is equally good, and back to back, the two albums are unstoppable. It's unfortunate that the band decided to pack it in, but at least these will still be around. Throw out your copies of Loveless and buy this instead. Not a lofty statement, just the truth. Also great shag music, so it's functional as well as cosmetic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sort of interesting, somewhat boring...","review":"Let me preface my review by saying that this is the first record I'd heard from Slowdive, and I bought the disc solely because fans of My Bloody Valentine, Catherine Wheel, Ride and some of my other fave shoegazer bands seem to like it. What appeals to me about those acts is that every gorgeous melody is buried under a distorted wall of noise. Slowdive has a very lush, much less aggressive sound that's a lot closer to say Mazzy Star than any of the aforementioned bands. Which wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing, but I don't think the songs are particularly catchy so the overall effect sort of puts you to sleep. I'm also a big fan of Brian Eno's production work, but here everything has sort of a foggy sound that's so drenched in reverb that none of the vocals or instruments really stand out. I'm a big fan of shoegazer bands and dream pop, but in my opinion this is a pretty boring representative of the genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"This music makes you float","review":"I always listen to this album at night before I fall asleep. It lifts me up and makes me feel as if I'm floating. All the songs are soft and slow, and the lyrics blend into the music until they become just another instrument. Slowdive were part of the British \\"shoegazing\\" scene in the early 1990s and sound similar to the other bands like Lush, Ride and My Bloody Valentine that they were grouped together with during this time by the British music press. If you describe the music you like as \\"mellow\\", this CD is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Feel the ethereal goosebumps","review":"Plain and simple this is one of those CDs that you can set to Repeat All and listen to for hours... b/c each time through you will recognize something ever more beautiful. Exhilerating in parts, depressing in others.... Consider Cocteau Twins joining forces with Black Tape for a Blue Girl (and of course there's the noticeable Brian Eno influences :). Don't be frightened to shed a few tears along the way either. This one is very emotional... very personal.

However, it is not good. The projects shown are, almost without exception, out of scale and \\"clunky\\" looking, rather like a very young Brownie troop's efforts. I was very unhappy when I received it and found nothing in it of value. I suspect I am not alone in my estimation as copies of this book began appearing on Thrift Shop shelves soon after its release.

The project directions were very easy to follow (you could tell the authors are hands-on) and my grandaughters loved working alongside me with the fabrics etc.to furnish the various small rooms of their dollhouses. I found many of the projects they had no problem in completing themselves while others they only needed a little assistance. I feel furnishing dollhouses is a wonderful on-going project for generation after generation, and this book is one to refer to with confidence that the projects will turn out nice and they don't get discouraged by the friendly writing of the directions.

I must admit that, in general, I like Tarzan movies. I also like the original novels by Edgar Rice Burroughs (actually, I like the Pellucidar books the best, but I digress). Anyway, the great problem with Tarzan films is that since the days of silent cinema and Elmo Lincoln, a faithful adaptation of the Burroughs character has not existed. So what? By the mid-1930s, Burroughs himself was incorporating elements from the films into the Tarzan novels. Greystoke is about as close to the spirit of the Burroughs character as we can seriously expect to get. Yes, it slips to the silly side when Tarzan gets to England. Again, so what? The movie is good fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie","review":"My father had searched far and wide for this movie. It has been an all time favorite of his since it was first released.

For starters, it does not have adjustable mist control -- there is only one setting. Other problems include 1)this is the noisiest, most \\"gurgly\\" ultrasonic humidifier I have ever seen, 2) it does not last anywhere near 27 hours, and 3)it shoots the mist almost straight up, which causes some of the puddling problems. With other ultrasonics, the mist shoots out more, which means if you put it on the edge of a dresser, the mist disperses before it hits the floor. With this baby, the mist goes up and comes straight down. Finally, it does not come with a demineralization cartridge, unlike almost evey other similar model -- and the cartridges are hard to find and expensive.A crappy humidifier with an inaccurate description from Amazon -- AVOID!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good While It Lasted","review":"I bought this unit last winter after researching the various models available on Amazon. It worked pretty well, effectively humidifying my medium-sized bedroom, though sometimes it needed to be off-balance (aka not level) in order to produce mist. It also left white powder in the room, despite being filled with bottled water.I recently plugged it in again, and could not get it to produce mist. I cleaned it thoroughly, tried resting it at various angles, nothing. I finally gave up and bought the Air-O-Swiss AOS Ultrasonic Humidifier 7131, and I'm much happier. It has a demineralization cartridge, automatic shutoff, mist and humidity control, optional microbial inhibitor, and is significantly quieter.If you need a reliable humidifier with intermediate features for respiratory health, I recommend the Air-O-Swiss far ahead of the Sunbeam."},{"rating":"1","title":"it is a terrible experience!!!","review":"I reviewed all the infomation before I bought this one, half say it is wonderful, some say it stops working after a week.

I received the new one a week later, which to my disappointment, did not have the nightlight feature. I also noticed it was from a different brand company. I can't remember the name but it also began with the word \\"sun.\\" So far, the new humidifier is working fine (about 2 weeks now), but it has a lower water capacity so I have to refill it every night (vs. every 2 nights with the original one) and the lack of the nightlight is a big disappointment.

And none of them gives out visible water steam like this one. And this one really works! In one hour, it was able to raise the humidity of my average size bedroom (with door opened) from 31% to 40%. And when I left it on overnight at the smallest steam volume setting, the humidity in my room was raised to 61%! I have never seen something quite like this before. And it's very quiet except for the water dripping sound which i take it like it is raining outside. I don't have the problem of water spilling all over like some of the other reviewers did. I think they didn't screw the bottom cap on properly. There is only a little bit of moisture around the base but nothing serious. The only regret? Can't preset a humidity and stop the steam it reaches there. But then, with this price, what more can you expect? I rate it a 5-star!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Gee, it was great for 40 minutes !","review":"I was so excited to buy this humidifier as my own pharmacy had one running and I really need the nebulizer-type action for my sinuses. I dropped $50 on it, took it home, plugged it in and enjoyed the cooling mist action for all of 40 minutes. The unit then completely stopped working - no motor, no light, no mist. DOA. Now I have to go through the hassle of returning this thing...and at Christmas time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A little too noisy for me...","review":"Pros: Great water capacity, okay mist production, night light feature is nice, easy to setup and use.Cons: The water's reaction to the ultrasonic vibrations is quite noisy. I removed the tank while the unit was running to see what was causing the noise and was a bit surprised to see a small, intermittent water fountain appearing above the ultrasonic vibrator. The 'dripping' noise was the water falling back down on itself! In addition, you can hear the water drip from the tank into the base unit and the angle of the mist as it exists the humidifier seems to be mostly in an upwards direction (80 degrees) rather than in an upwards/outward direction (55 degrees).Summary: Given the price point, it's not a bad humidifier; the Vick's Ultrasonic Humidifier is a few dollars more and just a little bit less noisy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware!

If you use the demineralization cartridge you don't get the white dust.Strangely, if you run it on a lower humidity setting (opening closed more) you get more of a condensation problem on surrounding surfaces than you do when running it fully open.

This unit really does well humidifying a 10'x10' bedroom. Filling the tank lasts about nine hours.My wife likes the light on, as it provides kind of blue night light effect. The unit is very quiet and completely unobtrusive. It never bothered either of us once.The sinus problems we were experiencing really improved after using the humidifier- I guess the Doctor was right after all- sigh.The only minor complaint we had is that we found that you could not leave the opening partly open to restrict the misting effect. That would have extended the useful time per tank of water, but when we choked it back to half open, it left a large puddle on the dresser."},{"rating":"1","title":"nice light but not a very good product","review":"Can't adjust mist volume like every other humidifier out there on the market, oh sure... you can close off the opening where the mist comes out which results in water streaming down the front of humidifier...with a towel under unit its ok.....the night light feature is cool..glowing blue water ..but all and all not so hot...give it a big OK."},{"rating":"2","title":"Schumacher SC-6500A Automatic Battery Charger.","review":"Excellent product, and the Amazon deal (free shipping and a large price drop) made it a no brainer.

You have a dead battery. Right? This charger will not work if your battery is dead. There is a feature built in that will not allow it to recognize a battery with 0 charge.

I was looking for a book to explain the death of someone who wasn't old or sick for very long and who didn't get to say goodby to his friends. This book was not the right one for my purposes.I found it to be too abstract. Badger doesn't die, he goes down a \\"long tunnel.\\" Also, he appears to either have been sick for a while or simply coming to the end of a long full life.If you have older children, ages 8 to 10, and they already understand about death, then perhaps this book could be comforting. Then again, it might just make them afraid of long tunnels."},{"rating":"2","title":"My go-to gift, but beware!","review":"My son and I first stumbled across this story in a collection of children's stories when he was 5. I thought it was a beautiful tale of healing; he was disturbed by it. He's 9 now and still shies away from it. In the stiory, Badger accepts death happily, and his friends go from grief to celebrating his life and his giving nature.I have given this book to several friends' children when a grandparent has died (in one case, a great-grandparent). Every time, the parents have come back later to express a huge thank you and tell me how perfect the book was for talking with their child about their departed grandparent.So, great book for little kids struggling to come to terms with the death of a loved one, but not a simple story to casually pick up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful, apt description of the circle of life","review":"This book was given to my son long ago, perhaps 25 years? when his grandmother died. I've used it in teaching Death and Dying classes, given it to friends and refer to it frequently. The reality of 'gifts' that we leave for others is an admirable goal for all of us. This book gently addresses an unknown, it does not provide a clear explanation of what happens to Badger, allowing each reader to apply their personal religious or humanistic thoughts, but it does provide hope and a sense of connection for the living with the 'gift' they've received from the departed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everyone should know about this book","review":"My daughter discovered this book shortly after her father (my husband) died.

I received this for a Christmas and used it for about a month. I have a light beard and mustache with side burns. My last Wahl could clean up my beard quickly and neatly. The blades on this give an uneven cut, leaving stray hairs that you have to clean up with scissors. If my beard is damp it gets much worse and within a day or two it looks scraggly.

Like her first album, she shows her age. Which is good, a lot of young artists try to go above and beyond their age. This album has more of a soft Hip Hop/R&B feel to it (as oppose to the other way around). Entertaining, much like her debut album \\"Age Ain't Nothing But a Number\\" but more mature with her age.

She can be defined as the true leading lady of R'n'B and this album is a fine example of her unique and exceptional talent. The album serves the purpose of displaying the young Aaliyah's new more mature sound, which enabled her to dramatically develop as an artist. Her debut album introduced us to a fresh and exciting star with an urban touch. Her second album showed Aaliyah developing a new more confident approach to her career and this was due to the fact that Timbaland and Missy Elliot produced the masterpiece, which enabled Aaliyah to take her music to a higher level.A highlight of the album is the love ballad 'One in a Million' which is a stunning track that focuses on the emotions that overwhelm us when we are in love with the one we have dreamed of all our life. This song is a powerful and touching record that still sounds amazing to this day."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Aaliyah Album","review":"I got this CD back in the fall of 96' and I am sure that I played this disc more than any other disc in my collection in the months following my purchase. IMO, this was Aaliyah's best album and it was years ahead of it's time. Timbaland's production combined with Missy Elliott's songwriting brought innovation to new heights. I was listening to this album a few weeks ago and I must say that the songs sound even better than they did five years ago. The songs on this album set the standards for many of the R&B songs that are being released today. My personal favorites are Hot Like Fire, One In A Million(an undisputed classic), Choosey Lover, Girl Like Me, Never Comin' Back and Ladies In The House. If you are thinking of purchasing some of Aaliyah's work, this album would be a great choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS CD IS THE BEST!","review":"\\"One In A Million\\" is the best CD out there! All the songs are great and none of them are boring. Aaliyah has a great voice and some of the best songs in R&B today. My favorite songs on the CD are \\"4 Page Letter\\", \\"Hot Like Fire\\", \\"One In A Million\\", \\"Ladies In Da House\\", and especially \\"I Gotcha Back\\". But all the songs are great. This CD deserves more than 5 stars. Timbaland and Missy Elliot give some awesome beats to the songs and this CD is the best in the world! My CD has so many scratches from being played so much, I have to buy a new one! You HAVE to buy this CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Transcends the alphabet format to the heart of the Christmas","review":"This is a wonderful book for both children and adults.

It is one of the few intelligent books the aims to tell the who Christmas story without dumbing it down or putting in overly cutetsy or sentimental pictures. The pictures are lavish and brightly colored. It goes far beyond the standard alphabet format so that even adults will enjoy reading and re-reading it year after year.

Alfred Hitchcock does some cool camera angles and black and white shadow shots that haven't been done since. The first 3 minutes or so, all you see are shoes, then they bump into each other on a train......then it begins. It turns into a plot that you end up gripping a pillow or something, very scary.

Excitement, suspense, a little romance, great set pieces, this movie has it all. The only disappointing aspect about purchasing this movie is that it comes in one of those cheap snap cases!

My dad bought this album (trying to steer me back away from heavier rock like KISS) as soon as it came out. I loved it then, and I love it now.This is Morse Moose--- and I'm calling you! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Differences between Capitol and EMI version","review":"For some reason, most of the 1970-1990 McCartney/Wings catalogue is now available in two versions: the Capitol CDs and the British remastered \\"McCartney Collection\\".The British CD's offer, in many cases, more bonus tracks than the Capitol CD's, some of which are very welcome: London Town adds 'Mull of Kintyre' to its B-side 'Girls School'.The remastering of the British series is, to my ears, NOT a bonus. The signal has been compressed in such a way, that the average level is louder than on the Capitol CD's, although the peaks are not. Especially the low frequencies have been boosted, resulting in a somewhat muddy sound and a less focused midrange. This has also affected the stereo image. To me, the Capitol CDs are sonically superior and closer to the original LPs.This is very noticable on orchestral and acoustic songs in particular. The difference between 'Mull of Kintyre' on the London Town CD, and the track on 'All the best' is also striking!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An underrated classic","review":"London Town is probably Wings' last great album. With the exception of the unlistenable \\"Morse Moose and the Grey Goose,\\" which unfortunately ends the album, every song is a winner. Most songs fall together in theme and style to create a British folk rock sound. Paul is eager to create and experiment, hence the phasing on \\"Don't Let it Bring You Down\\" and the loopy sound effects on \\"Backward Traveller.\\" Paul seems to be at his best and his most confident when he tries to be playful and experimental, and you can find all of it on this album. Among the best songs on this album are \\"I'm Carrying,\\" which includes some of Paul's best vocals to date, the fun \\"Backwards Traveller,\\" \\"Deliver Your Children,\\" which should have ended up on Paul's best-of albums, and the trippy \\"Don't Let it Bring You Down.\\" One of Paul's best albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly underrated!","review":"Though this album is generally considered rather weak, it is actually an exceptional record with many catchy Paul songs included. \\"Cafe on the Left Bank\\" is an engaging rocker and \\"I'm Carrying\\" is one of Paul's better ballads. Beautiful acoustic guitar work here.This is a much superior album to \\"Ram,\\" \\"Venus and Mars\\" and some other McCartney albums which inexplicably are regarded as better products than this. As an extra treat, one of the bonus tracks here is one of Paul's greatest and catchiest rock songs from his Wings years, \\"Girls School.\\" A great song and a fine album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misplacing the muse","review":"Part of an underachieving four-album run (Speed of Sound, Back to the Egg, Mc Cartney II), London Town shows Mr. McCartney at loose ends. The song fragments don't work. I remember how frustrated I was the first time I heard Backwards Traveller- a short burst of infectious song followed by uninspiring synth junk.Earlier in McCartney's career, albums that received mixed reviews--Ram, Wild Life and Red Rose Speedway--all had enough gold in them to satisfy, nevertheless. By contrast, London Town--as well as Back to the Egg--very nearly miss completely.Fortunately, Tug of War was four years off.

The whole thing sounds like it was done in about two days, composition to finish. Drab songs, sloppy playing and lyrics(Morse Moose and the Gray Goose?), and very uninspired performances. Linda never sounded worse, and she was horrible all around, God rest her soul.Paul's problem was, and is, that nobody has the balls to tell him when his material stinks, a roll that all four of the Beatles filled with impunity."},{"rating":"2","title":"SWEEEEEET","review":"I just downloaded this album for my dad.

There's a few throw-away tracks but nothing too horrific that might cause severe stomach distress or anything. Favorite songs? Title track; Backwards Traveler; Deliver Your Children; Name & Address; and believe it or not: Morse Moose. I see no disco (or \\"Whatever\\") in the song. In fact it has a Band on the Run feel to it to me. Songs I could do without? Girlfriend; I'm Carrying; With A Little Luck. (Sorry Sir Paul).

In, fact it features three, the usual catchy ballad \\"With A Little Luck,\\" the rocker \\"I've Had Enough,\\" and the pleasent ditty \\"London Town.\\" It is a very pleasent album altogether, and is more acoustic than any other Wings album. Highlights include the Donovan-ish \\"Children, Children,\\" the Buddy Holly-ish \\"Name and Adress,\\" and probably the most progressive Wings song, \\"Morse Moose and the Grey Goose.\\" The album's highest point is probably the obscure but lovely ballad \\"I'm Carrying.\\" The b-side to \\"Mull of Kintyre\\", \\"Girl's School\\" is a nice addition as a bonus track.

To some, she may come across as slightly bitter, but I think she really did work for some of the most atrocious people, overworked, underpaid and never appreciated.

Every time it turned on/off it would rattle the plumbing--easy to tell when the sprinkler went on/off. After several months of use the valve started having worse water hammer problems getting progressively louder. After being off all winter this valve worked as its usual noisy self and then one morning started cycling on and off with severe water hammer that was impossible to turn off. It was so bad that my neighbor showed up wondering what was rattling his plumbing. Turning the timer off still didn't solve the problem-it still cycled on/off. The only solution that worked was to turn the water off to the sprinkler system and replace the valve. Replaced the Rain bird valve with a new Lawn Genie valve and was impressed with how quiet it turned on and off--zero water hammer. Replaced the other Rain Bird valves with new Lawn Genie valves and whole system now much quieter."},{"rating":"2","title":"very helpfull","review":"Ralph woodrow has done a great job with 90% of this book ,I found a coulpe of errors in his thinking . but this book is a must read as it explains the seventy weeks of daniel so well and in doing so you will see that the 7 year trib as false teaching"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"I needed a handle for my glass bifold door, and I thought it would be PERFECT.

It goes from speaker-bursting volumes to dialogue so faint you have to turn your TV all the way up. It is worse than any movie I have ever seen/heard. I'm sure my neighbors and the whole town's dogs hate me now. There are only a few times that you actually have just over a minute or two of actual dialogue without horribly loud music and sound effects.

Directed by Carl Reiner (that's Mel Brooks partner and director Rob's pop).We join Martin, as world famous neuro-surgeon Dr. Michael Hfuhruhurr (pronounced huff-ehrr, or something like that!), the inventor of the 'cranial screw-top' brain entry. He's recently lost his wife, who he idolizes, but soon enough he meets fortune hunter Dolores (Kathleen Turner), who's only after him for his money.The story has us following Dr. Hufrfrfrrrrr (see, no one can pronounce it correctly!) through ridiculous situations, typical of Martin's comedy. From a strike of elevator operators in Austria, to a castle inside an apartment, to that damn cat! Lots and lots of hysterical moments arise. Martin is great as a dumb, gullable man, while Turner is at her bitchy best.If you want to spend a couple of hours of brainless (regardless of the film's theme!) humor, then you won't miss with The man with two brains.

I went to buy the DVD for 5 dollars.I haven't seen any other Steve Martin films (Except the most recent one with Queen Latifah) but regardless of that, this film was great. I can't quite say it was the most funniest movie ever, but some jokes are just priceless. Especially the name-take-offs. Anyone knows that all great inventors have impossible to pronunce names!The sex jokes were also, funny. Regardless of the nature. And when Ann and Michael first meet? That was defienately priceless.I reccomend this movie to anyone who enjoys quite an original plot and jokes that will be remembered.

And the villain in this movie? A character who will profit from \\"Big Oil\\". The very first scene is hundreds of oil platforms with smoking flares. Give me a break!

I think the audience spoke for itself as half-way through all the kids under say 9 years of age were beginning to wine and talk from the sheer boredom of the movie's thin and unengaging plots. All the innocence from the original movie is lost to violence, mindless explosives and repetitive use of the word \\"kill.\\" Such scenes would be a thrill if your expecting the Bourne Identity, but the mix of genres is just a mess. I miss the character development from the first movie. Gone is the grand supporting cast of Red, Ramone, Sally, Sheriff, Philmore and Sarge who are relegated to short cameo appearances. It's obvious the writers tried to do too much with this movie and ended up with a sloppy amateurish mix of parts and pieces. Verdict: It's a heap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect!","review":"This Is an awesome movie! It does have multiple dark disturbing scenes in my opinion (I am 9). Two cars die and it really should not be rated G. Mild Violent scenes are current and only about 11 minutes of the entire movie takes place in Radiator Springs.

Skip it unless your kids are older and even then I think the older kids will get bored with the theme."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lighten up!","review":"I almost skipped this movie because of the reviews. That would have been my loss. No, it is not like the first \\"Cars\\". It doesn't develop the former Cars characters as well because it is a fast-paced spy movie with some new characters, who are developed well. But the humor is excellent, the graphics are amazing, and there is a strong emphasis on cherishing your true friends who really love you the most.Especially for kids ten and older, and adults who enjoy NASCAR, this movie is fun! Given all the junk that is out there for kids to watch, why be so hard on this movie?

Not a movie you can put on to have your two year old unwind.They made a 180 shift here and I can't understand why. They should have stuck to the toddler market.

It probably means more to me because I love car shows. I identified the European makes and the American models. There were many corollaries between the performance of those cars and the characters they represented. I felt like I was revisiting cities in Europe where the races took place. They were brilliantly drawn and the depth of field was excellent. The many references to the Bond movies helped. For me there was a lot of humor in the portrayal of the human emotions of the cars.I liked the storyline and the animation a lot more in Cars 2 over Cars 1.

Too much action, too much death, the storylines were too complex, not enough of the core characters, and it did not have the heart of Cars. BIG LETDOWN! If I let my son he would watch cars everyday. My daughter and son play cars all the time. My daughter told me that she did not really want to see cars 2 again. Maybe the movie is for 8-10 year olds?"},{"rating":"1","title":"How could this possibly be rated G???","review":"My family and 4 year old enjoyed the first CARS movie so it was natural that we would want to see CARS2. What a dissapointment. There was way too much violence for young children. I take my child to less than 5 movies per year and only G rated. I'm sorry I wasted our time and money on this one. I had to continually explain the storyline to my child (bad guys vs good guys) due to the shooting/violence. This movie should be rated PG. As far as adult enjoyment, weak storyline. there is so much they could have done to develop characters based on the good foundation from the original CARS movie. This one is an utter failure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why the violence?","review":"I just can't understand why Disney/Pixar would produce a movie that is designed for 2-5 year old boys that is overrun with violence. Explosions, shooting... they even torture and kill (kill off-screen) Rod Torque Redline. Cars 1 was filled with heart. It was about friendship and small-town living. This is a James Bond movie with cartoon cars in place of actors. My 3 year old son was so excited to see this movie. Mater's Tall Tales is better than this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cars 2 Made Me BOYCOTT Cars Toys","review":"This film was written to market new cars for the Pixar Cars line. If you could get past the spy and espionage theme of the film, could you get past the CLEAR merchandising strategy of manipulating the viewer into buying new versions of mater, and all the new Euro cars? I'm definitely not buying it. Pun intended.And it's not just about espionage and \\"secret agents\\" like you would find on an episode of the Backyardigans trying to solve a mystery, they actually have themes of torture in the film (i.e. stripping a car's tires to extract information from him). I was completely shocked. It was the first time ever taking my 2 year old daughter to the movies, and I wish she had never seen it. Cars is a sweet, character-driven film, Cars 2 has rare sweet moments and it's more of a plot-driven action film.I can see why many people might like this film, but I hope people can see why many people would find Cars 2 to be quite extreme for them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely inapproprite -","review":"I would love to understand and hear the reasoning behind the frivalous story line.. did they miss the mark completely on purpose. Let alone the fact that they just HAD to put some kind of gun fire in this useless movie..but to adopt a mission impoossible theme or James Bond theme - with english accent actors.. I love Kane but not in a cartoon..CARTOOOOOON people...this is for children not me, not teens, not walt disny adult babies, but kids, 1 2 3 years old.. how the **** are they suppose to remotely follow this story line. This movie sucked fropm beginning to end..The first one was so sweet and simple..to the point..here the've gone overboard on every element..even the music.. If you did not buy this movie..keep on doing it.. just keep watching cars 1..believe me..it's a waste of time and money.."},{"rating":"2","title":"not a lemon","review":"I am not sure why so many are giving this film a poor rating. Yes it is not like other Pixar films in a sense, but at the same time it still is. It is not driven towards tugging at your heart, but it still buts out a very good message, and that is to be happy with who you are and how others are, don't try to change them or yourselves just because the behavior is out of the norm.This movie is fun for all ages and has a \\"the man with one red sock\\" or \\"the man who knew to little\\" feel to it. pixar had to take cars 2 in a new direction to be a hit, you can't put out 2 movies that are the same and it seems that is exactly what some people were expecting.to sum things up, this movie is fun for all ages and has a great lesson, kids ask to watch it almost everyday."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as the original","review":"My granddaughter loved the original movie, but this version was a bit too complicated for her to follow. Don't bother to spend the money. Rent it first and see if it holds their interest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too preachy","review":"Too preachy. CARS 2 pushes the environmental \\"sustainable\\" agenda, BIG TIME. Returned it and will not allow kids to watch it because we do not believe environmental, nor any other agenda, should be pushed. Do not need movies telling us to buy and believe in alternative fuel, like CARS 2 does. It is one thing to choose on your own to buy alternative fuel. It is another to have Disney/other characters telling you to buy it. Not the place of media to tell us what to do, nor what choices to make."},{"rating":"1","title":"off the mark","review":"the original Cars film was amazing and my son loved it. We thought Cars 2 would be the perfect first theater experience for him and were sorely disappointed. Pixar has never been more off the mark. The first film was funny for kids and adults, with jokes appropriate for all age levels. Cars 2 was violent and offensive. My son asked to leave after 20 minutes and I wish we had. We stayed, thinking it was just the theater experience he had to adjust to, then they had cars beating up another car in the bathroom! The whole film was uncomfortable to watch with a 4 year old.I was happy that they made reference to losing Paul Newman and there were obviously a few funny things, but overall, this movie is not appropriate for the same age group as the first movie. Definitely screen this movie before family movie night or you could have some upset children."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate this, its actually Cars 3!","review":"I remember back in 2002 or so, there was Cars. Then 3 or 4 years later, Cars came back out, but remade. I thought it had another name and I went to see it and it was the same as the original, just with a few changes. Now the sequel is a kind of rip off. It makes you think that its the second movie when its really not. Oh, they also make you think that this is going to be the best movie ever. Its not as good as its made out to be. I didn't understand the plot, I was lost, and by around an hour, I dozed off. It was not appealing and my nephew hated it, also."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its not the item appears to be.","review":"Online for DVD sucks. Buy at your local video store, target or costco.

The story-line, plot, and principal characters were all terrific! Of course, the computer graphics were top-notch! I would recommend this movie. It was fun, warming, and attention-grabbing throughout the entirety of the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too old content for younger children.","review":"I was excited to get this movie for my son (4) who loves the 1st Cars movie and we got it for him for his birthday. It was a cute concept with the \\"spy\\" stuff but the movie in my opinion was WAY too violent for a 4 yr old. They shoot each other with guns and try to \\"KILL\\" each other. They say the word \\"kill\\" many times. Just not something I want my 4 year old to say or pretend to do. I will be putting the movie away until he gets older and undersatnds the concept that it is just a movie and isnt appropriate to do those things in real life.Oh and the DVD doesnt work in certain dvd players. It wouldnt work in my one dvd player but would in my other one. They were both brand new players.The one it wouldnt work in was a LG dvd player."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really???????","review":"First off let me say that I didn't think that Cars needed a sequel. It was by far not my favorite Pixar film but it had its charms and everything wrapped up well in the end and Mcqueen learned a lesson about friendship...or did he? Well apparently he didn't but that fact doesn't even take center stage in this film. Instead we get a James Bond spoof with Mater taking center stage with two spy cars and all of the charming characters from Radiator Springs get put in almost as an afterthought.Of course the visuals are stunning but it wasn't enough to keep my boys interested and my oldest even asked to watch something else about three times starting only 10 minutes into the movie. One of my younger ones disappeared and returned with the original movie asking to watch it instead.Not a terrible film but Pixar can certainly do better."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to Pixar?","review":"Cars, the first movie, was wonderful. Cars2 is loaded with violent acts, gasoline 'alcohol' consumption, cruel behavior, bad jokes and references to inappropriate adult material. All of this and visual splender is coupled with the cheesiest sound track I have heard in years. When it was over, I was left feeling like I had just watched a excessively long commercial for all the crap they hope to sell. I sincerely hope this sequel is not representative of what we will see from Pixar in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major disappointment","review":"Cars 2 was a major disappointment. I don't know if the writers for the movie changed from the first one to this one, but the first Cars movie was delightful and well written and targeted for children. The Cars 2 movie had a story line way too advanced for smaller children and couldn't even hold the interest of our older grandkids. Our younger grandkids had no real interest after we watched half the movie and the older grandkids were bored to no end and so were we, and we were huge fans of the first Cars movie. If we decide to \\"preserve\\" a copy of this Cars 2 movie, we'll just wait until it comes on Pay for View and record it, we sure won't be wasting money to buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for children","review":"I did not like it. It was VERY violent. Okay for me since I have seen it all but the look on my baby's face when they KILLED a car (while chanting, \\"Kill him!\\"). \\"Mama, what did they just do to that car?\\" Guns and shooting throughout the whole film. Cars 2 left me feeling disturbed and unsettled, \\"Did I just show my children a murder?\\". I really wish I had previewed this cartoon prior to watching it with my children. With Disney/Pixar I have not previously had to preview films; they were suitable for young children, Cars 2 is not. This film is a secret agent thriller with adult themes. I"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mator with a bomb strapped on him? Winnie the Pooh next?","review":"Awful movie and not geared for small children as the first was, but I don't know what age group they would be going for with cars that have eyeballs? (Tongue fully planted in cheek.) This was designed to attempt to indoctrinate the young and thick in political agenda. NOTHING like the original and that wonderful soundtrack. This is a violent propaganda film, done in cartoon, that degrades blue collar workers, as well as American oil companies (No, not middle eastern oil, just ours.) Like a bait and switch going on here, where they build your trust in a wonderful movie with beloved characters, then sneak this total MEAN garbage in the next round. Contains violent kill scenes, torture, death, and bombs strapped on Mator! Winnie the Pooh and Mickey Mouse next for this brand of hate? Be sure to borrow or rent this before buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Faulty blu ray discs","review":"I ordered this twice. Both times the blu ray discs wouldn't play on our blu ray player. We even tested other blu ray movies we owned. Our player works. Disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"If you've watched Cars, then the sequel will be a huge let down. The story is slow moving and just irritating to follow. My 5 yr old son will only watch it with the sound turned down. Enough said. Save your money, buy the cars 2 leapster explorer game instead. My son gets far more enjoyment out of that and he's learning to boot."},{"rating":"2","title":"...an improvement on the first Cars film.","review":"Cars 2 was an improvement on the first Cars film. The violence was true to the secret agent film genre that this movie was celebrating. It was not disturbing to see cars, with eyes and a mouth, getting finished off, any more than seeing droids getting wasted in Star Wars The Clone Wars. I'm a sucker for Mater's personality so, seeing him get more face-time in this film was good with me. This second Cars movie had a strong story compared to the first Cars, which hardly had a story at all. I thought the movie was strong and worthy of owning on DVD after I rented it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent.","review":"Just a quick review to say that I too liked Cars 2 better than the original, which was long on whining and maudlin Hudson backstory. Don't get me wrong: I liked the first one, but I loved the second, which introduced two great new characters (Finn and Holley), suggesting an indefinite franchise (yay!), and made Mater, who is more complex than Lightning, the star. The situations and what Mater says and does in response to them are hilarious! The plot twist at the end is a genuine surprise, hard to pull off these days. The genius social commentary disguised by car puns continues. The ONLY reason I didn't give it five stars is that I don't think a \\"G\\"-rated film should have a character (car or not) being tortured and murdered, even off screen. While it is true that youngsters might not pick up on that, many will, and I found it disturbing to watch with my four-year-old daughter (our first movie in the theaters together). Otherwise, I loved, loved, loved this movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Will NOT be getting a purchase from me","review":"I really can't understand how John Lasseter thought this was a worthy follow-up to a wonderful movie like the first Cars. I think that movie gets a lot of undeserved flack, but this one deserves every bit of it.The premise alone worried me quite a bit. A movie about simple life values given a sequel as a spy movie? It doesn't work as a James Bond parody. It doesn't work as a comedy. It just flat out doesn't work. Once in the theater was too much. No way will I be buying it on BR or DVD.Only thing that saves it from getting one star was the final chase sequence, which was fairly entertaining, but definitely not worth the first parts."},{"rating":"2","title":"A GIFT!","review":"I bought this as a gift for my nephew who is 7 years old.

He wants to go to England, Italy, and Japan and doesnt allow me to stop the film until he's listened to the songs at the end esp. Collision of Worlds. The reviews and low box office made me rent before buying but we own it now. My husband and I like it as much as he does."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Cars belongs in the junkyard!","review":"Pixar has once again created a marvelous looking film. Unfortunately, the animation and special effects is about all this movie has going for it. Aside from the fact that story drags and is nowhere near as interesting as Cars 1, Pixar/Disney thought it would be appropriate to make political propaganda a centerpiece of this film. It even goes as far as taking numerous jabs at \\"Big Oil\\" as referred to in the film - kind of ironic for a sequel spawned by an original movie starring a gas-powered racecar. I thought Pixar had a principal never to include politics in their films? They clearly violated that with this film. Not to mention that Mater - the annoying broken down tow-truck - is clearly the star of this movie, instead of Lightning McQueen - adding to the monotony.So, a combination of a boring plot plus heavy-handed political drivel makes Cars 2 a loser. Stick with the original, which has a far superior story and is far less preachy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Mater's Tall Tales\\" was better than this!","review":"\\"Cars 2\\" had too many new characters to keep track of, couldn't decide if it was a race movie or a spy movie, was too dark and serious for kids, and will never stand the test of time like the first classic \\"Cars\\" movie! \\"Mater's Tall Tales\\" (though a series of straight-to-video shorts) is a much better sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"guns, bombs, and torture scenes?","review":"I took my two granddaughters to see this movie, and was absolutely horrified. Every problem was dealt with a gun, bigger foe, bigger gun. Lots of bombs, blowing up continuously, one strapped to Mater, others set off with remote controls.

He was confused and lost interest quickly. McQueen is rarely present in the movie. Cars spend most of the movie shooting at it each other. Really? I thought cars were supposed to *race* one another.

An unnecessary sequel with little humor, cliched characters, poor voicework from Larry the Cable Guy and Owen, and lots and lots of \\"cheese\\".It's one of those mindless parodies of James Bond that has to come along once in a while.Having said that, kids love this movie, and I'm sure they don't care about plot holes, poor characters, and Duex et Machinas!In summary: Cars 2 is a lemon, but KID'S WON'T CARE at all!

My 2 1/2 year old grandson devours the original Cars and has watched it perhaps 30 times. He lost interest in Cars 2 in the first 15 minutes. I have to admit it didn't hold my interest either. This is such a radical departure from the original Cars. I think the producer went too far allowing this story line to depart so much from the strong character focus of Cars.

I had to explain to my 5 year old, that Doc Hudson died, cars were murdered (in one scene you see the reflection of the murder while it is taking place), and cars were continually hurt or shot by other cars. The graphics are of the Pixar superior standard, it is the violent content that gets my 1 star rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sick of updating Blu-Ray firmware","review":"I put the Blu-Ray disc (non-3D) into my standard Sony Blu-Ray player, and it said I needed to upgrade some encryption software or whatever... I tried to update it and was going to take too much time and my son was waiting... so ended up watching the included DVD disc, instead of Blu-Ray disc.... I guess they bundled DVD with this Blu-Ray combo for people (or situation) like me? Can't they put the update software inside the Blu-Ray disc itself & do it automatically without bugging the viewer?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Remember the Hindenberg?","review":"Pixar has been the Wonder Child of 21st Century animation with a huge string of hits and only a few mis-steps along the way. I own just about all of them. Cars 1 was brilliant in plot, character development, backstory, technology, and practically perfect in every way.After being teased for 2 years and waiting with baited breath for this must see, when this dog landed (no offense to dogs) it blew up and stunk like a wet one. How could anybody screw up a franchise this badly?No redeeming value at all and was a complete waste of celluloid--use 2 hours of your time watching paint peel and you'll get more out of it!

The whole movie included all the things I really didn't want my 2 1/2 year old watching. All the wholesome fun that I loved with Cars was gone with this move. Mater was this stupid goon who they all laughed at, not a good way to teach kids about friends. Lightning McQueen was a jerk! There was very little actual racing as the whole plot centered around some convoluted plot that was above the heads of most of their target audience (alternative fuel? are you kidding me?).

Other than this, the movie is a bomb. First off, I was shocked at the level of violence in the movie. It is, IMO, not appropriate for little kids. If your kids are a little bit older, then fine, but the older kids will probably be turned off by the weak and poorly-executed storyline. As far as the story goes, this is a really stupid movie; probably the worst Pixar movie ever (with the possible exception of Wall-E). Lightning McQueen is a minor character; the main focus is on Mader, who is amusing in small doses but who's bumpkin routine gets old very quickly.It's really disgraceful to see them put out such trash to ride on the coat-tails of such a wonderful initial movie.So not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"My son yawned halfway through the movie","review":"I watched this in the theatre with my four and half year old son. While we had enjoyed Cars at home, this time we were disappointed.

They were sadly disappointed and said they did not like it at all. It was hard for them to follow. There were cars killed off. They were trying to kill Mcqueen and Towmater, my kids favorite characters. Which saddened both my kids and induced anxiety in them. The main characters from the last movie had very brief parts this time. They could have done so much more here! I am not sure what they were thinking. They lost more fans here than gained.

That won't be the case here. My kids were even sorry we'd spent the money on the big screen, and they do not want the dvd at home - which says a lot!

I was delightfully surprised. Lightning McQueen is being challenged by a newer race car and takes his buddies from Radiator Springs along with him for the ride. He gets embarrassed by Mater and he sends him home. But poor Mater has gotten mixed up with the spies and finds himself in international trouble. He finds himself in a position to stop the bandits who are trying to sabotage the races and kill Lightning McQueen. It's a heartwarming story about friendship and it is funny for both children and adults alike. It was a big hit with my 9 yr old and almost 3 year old, and even my husband enjoyed it.

It never even crossed my mind that a movie from which his favorite toys were created and from the makers of Toy Story and Cars 1 would create a movie that I would have to turn off after 30 minutes, but after watching for a half house, my son told us, \\"I scared. I scared\\" and we had to turn the movie off.I, on the other hand loved the movie. I could do without the political message about alternative energy, but overall, I was satisfied. I'd give the movie 4 stars, but not getting to enjoy it with my son cuts the rating in half.

This film is the latest entry in the Pixar franchise, and follows up a little while after where the first film left off. This time set in multiple locations around the world, Cars 2 moves at a faster pace than its predecessor, with more action, comedy and a more intricate plot. Whereas the first film followed the traditional Pixar line of a movie about a character's emotional growth, this film is more like standard Hollywood fare of a big budget action-comedy, except tailored for all ages. As to this package, the Blu-Ray and DVD both come with the famous Pixar short, along with a small extra featuring Mater. There is also a preview of Pixar's next release, Planes, which seems to be an offshoot from the Cars' franchise. All told, a great buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"love this movie","review":"i am a HUGE cars fan and i was really excited when i found at that there was a second cars. i would recommend this to anyone who is a big disney/pixar fan. there are things for young and old alike in this movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Kids or anyone for that matter.","review":"The first Cars movie may be the best kids movie ever. It was fun loving and taught kids about relationship building, respect for others and how to learn from your mistakes. Cars 2 might of tried to teach something but, it was overshadowed by guns, hate, drug use and the intent to kill. There were fights, many cars were shot and several were destroyed using a laser. The scene that disgusted me the most was when a character was visually tortured on screen and at the end of the torturing he was put to death. Now I am a man that owns guns, hunts for food and have taught my children to respect the dangers of guns. I would not suggest this movie to anyone it has no values. I am not sure how this was rated G, had the same scenes done with people it would of been rated R. All of our children are smart enough to make the correlation between these characters and people. I am disappointed in Disney/Pixar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pixar's First Miss.","review":"If you are an adult and like James Bond movies with a touch of Transformers action, you'll like Cars 2. For everybody else, this movie was just wrong. As has been said by other reviewers, this movie drops everything good about the original one: the characters, the setting, the mood, the pace, the soul. My five- and three-year old daughters -- great fans of the first installment -- got up and walked away 20 minutes into the movie. Looks good, but no soul."},{"rating":"1","title":"good graphics, good cast, epic failure of a storyline","review":"In cars I Mater provided comic relief against the backdrop of the melancholy abandoned/dying town, grumpy Doc, worried Sally. In Mater's tall tales it was a \\"let's be silly with Mater!\\" -- there was no pretense of substance. So this was like a story from Mater's Tall Tales stretched into a feature length film. The story line was silly at best, and incoherent at worst. But what's terrible is it's like someone said \\"wait...there's no substance...ok let's make something up and just throw it in even though it is a discordant note in the story line\\"It was obnoxious, uninspired, and I'm very disappointed. Pixar -- if you're having trouble writing stories go ahead and call me. I'll help you gratis to prevent another tragically missed opportunity. Very simple changes could have improved entertainment value by 1000%The final nail: my toddler finds it boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's no Cars 1","review":"Compared to the first Cars this movie falls flat on its face.

All the James Bond-like references to the \\"spy plot\\" are well over the heads of most 1st/2nd graders, but what can I say. It is true however that my children enjoy this film with all the racing (and the two bonus shorts) immensely. And the studios will undoubtedly make a ton or two of money with all the merchandising...all these new, pretty, shiny, colorful, race cars, not to mention all the \\"lemons\\". I have already gotten a new Santa list with prof Z in it... I for one found the \\"story\\" uninteresting, as it is sooo predictable. I must admit though, the visuals (especially in the bluray) can be seen with amazing clarity. The artwork and the soundstage/sonic performances are unmistakeably Pixar grade A, it is the story which is lacking here.

My son (age 5) loves it however I thought it was just ok. There isn't any discussion as to where Doc went or why, that is left up to the viewer to notice and figure out. I thought the amount of car on car violence was a bit high for Pixar movie as well.

I was never a NASCAR fan or even a fan of cars (I actually dislike motor vehicles!!!), but I grew to love the original Cars as a kids' movie, and after seeing Cars 2 three times in the theater, I can say I liked this sequel much more than the original. Honestly. Pixar promised something bigger and more intense, and they kept that promise.Now, I could pick apart the movie with a critic's eye, but what would be the point? Watching a kids' movie as a family is an experience, and if my kid loves this movie and can see the good in the characters and in the story at such a young age, then there is no point in my faulting Pixar or my listening to the dozens of critics who hated this sequel and who weren't really judging this movie from a car-loving kid's point of view anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as the first.","review":"I saw this with my boyfriend and his son.I loved the first car movie. It was more realize down home charm that reminded me of those old Disney car/house/hat cartoons. But this movie was painful. Far to much high tech fantasy for me and it lost its basic roots. The 7 yr we saw it was liked it but thought the first one was much better as well. And my guy hated it! Very cheesy. The only good point is that the animation was amazing and it kept the main voice actors. Out of all the pixar movies this was my least favorite."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the HD version","review":"They charge you 14.99 for the movie to download on your TV but when you go to watch it, you'll find out it is not the HD version and they never give you a choice between the two.If you want the HD version you have to rent it for 4.99.Kinda stupid they bilk their customers like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"SUBJECTIVELY DISAPPOINTING...","review":"This is, of course, a subjective review. I am only writing it so that a buyer like myself might be able to avoid the disappointment which I experienced when I listened to this recording. This is Ms. jackson singing to some significantly pompous arrangements and orchestrations of mainly white Christianity anthems. Think of a football game halftime in Christian Texas with a very good marching band with some strings added. Perhaps in the 1950's this made perfect sense. Sorry, just not what I was hoping for. Why is it that the only Mahalia Jackson recording which I really, really want is the one that has never, to my knowledge, been released on cd. This would be the Columbia recording titled \\"Bless This House.\\" If Columbia is willing to let us have \\"The Power And the Glory,\\" Why can't we have \\"Bless This House?\\" Which as far as I am concerned is so much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes to Arginine","review":"Women's perspective: All I have to say is YES...I ran across some reviews on the net about arginine and how healthy it was supposed to be for you.

However, this movie is very slow, dull, and doesn't feel like a typical \\"Hitch\\" movie. It plays more like a mediocre episode from the Alfred Hitchcock hour tv show. Fonda's performance is very mundane, and there's little power in the dialogue he's provided. Great Hitchcock editing, pacing and camera angles are almost entirely absent. The story is not compelling. One can see that the wife's psychological trauma is designed to be the whole emotional hook for the movie, yet it comes out flat with a feeling of little credibility. The sentimental moral tone is more aligned with a Little House on the Prairie episode than a gripping suspense movie. Thumbs firmly down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hitchcock should have stuck to fiction not biopics","review":"This is by far the worst Hitchcock movie I have seen. Bad, wooden screenplay. Incredible plot. Later I learned that it was based on a true crime story.That's why it's terrible - not enough artistic license was taken. Too much loyalty to the \\"facts\\" however dull real life can be.The only redeeming feature is that there is a scene where Henry Fonda is going into an apartment building at West 179th Street, with a view of the George Washington Bridge. I just liked that scene for sentimental reasons."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Hitchcock's Very Best","review":"This is one of the finest films of Hitchcock's long career.

Predictablly, those who dislike screaming may not enjoy Idiot Pilot- yes, there are some backround screaming vocals, but they only enhance the music, not degrade it. (of course, if you cannot tolerate screaming in general you won't enjoy all the songs on this album.) One of the great things about Idiot Pilot is the way they weave the vocals, which is very refreshing. The singer does sound like Thom Yorke- but who doesn't these days? They mix post-hardcore with electronica and alternative and create something that sounds unique. And there is little unique music out there right now.Tracks Open Register, To Buy A Gun, Strange We Should Meet Here, and A Light At the End of the Tunnel are my favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD, great harmonies!","review":"This is a great CD!!

I first heard Cymande watching the Spike Lee movie 25th Hour on cable. I can't remember the plot but I do remember hearing just a piece of Cymande's song Bra being played in a club scene. From that bit alone I was hooked.Cymande is a unique mixture of funk, reggae, African pop and American soul. At times they sound like Santana at other times it's Curtis Mayfield. But the combination of influences and the musicians' skill makes them unique. Bassist Steve Scipio deserves much credit for his targeted playing but an awesome horn section doesn't hurt either.Since this collection has all three albums Cymande made, it is essential.[DW]"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"This is an amazing book.

After reading about the old haunted house, with perhaps more ghosts and creaks and ectoplasmic light shows per square foot than any house in America, I was reminded of the movie Gothic. So much can go so wrong in the middle of the night, so much fear can be created ... but by the light of day, it doesn't seem so bad. The cat standing on its hind legs is a super creepy image - and one I've seen before, just once. Multiple times would have really freaked me out. One thing is clear to me, I would have moved out by the second night. Annie is either very brave, very understanding -- and accommodating -- of the spirit world or very stubborn. Perhaps a little of all three. If you're looking for something to give you goosebumps this Halloween, check out this fun book.

I'm not saying the author is a bad writer, she is very good at telling stories and sounds like a nice person. However, this book has very few accounts of real haunts. She considers dreams as real accounts or out-of-body experiences, which in my opinion are still just dreams. From the beginning it felt like she was expecting to find ghosts from day one and most of her perception seem like she truly wants to see something happen, like she's trying too hard. Also, she just assumes, also from day one, that the house is haunted by the last owner who just died. It seems like wishful thinking to me, I mean, it's an old house, it's bound be have many deaths in its history, and one can get really imaginative living in it.I believe and like to read about the supernatural, but this book didn't convince me one bit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looses steam, forced","review":"This book starts off well enough, with the author buying a house that has some oddities about it. But then, the book fails to gel, and becomes progressively disjointed. After several chapters of recounted dreams presented as occurances, I gave up and didn't finish it.My impression is that the author really wanted to write a book, and she was also into ghosts, so she decided to start with a true life ghost story. The only problem: her material is thin. She starts off well enough, moving into a house with some creepy atmosphere. But what follows is mostly dreams, anecdotes about noisy pipes and other settling noises and accounts of people who 'felt something'. I never became convinced that the house was really haunted, or just that she really wanted it to be haunted.Borrow this, if you have a lot of patience for amateur writing and efforts, and want to explore every possible ghost story. It's too insubstantial an effort for me to recommend as a purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best of it's kind.","review":"I have read and collect several books on the paranormal and haunting. I must say that to date this is my favorite. It isn't told by a so called professional, nor is it blabbering on about someone elses experience. It was very believable and I felt the author was also very real and relatable. The occurances that happened in this home were from my own personal knowledge very much a typical haunting without all of the extra dramatization in so many books of this kind. I absolutely loved the description of the house as well. I only wish there could have been some pictures of that beautiful old house included."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this book","review":"If you want to read it, borrow it from someone. I own a massive library of books about the paranormal and metaphysical and I have read somebad books and I couldn't even get past page 10 of this one. It is very difficult to tell what is real and what is the author's imagination, it reads like the demented ramblings of someone's acid trip.This book has absolutely no value whatsoever as a reference for or record of paranormal phenomena or hauntings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland as white rice","review":"I heard the author on a podcast and immediately bought the book. Mistake. It's so boring it just about put me to sleep. There were two fatal flaws.First, there was no suspense, no creepiness, no fear. La la la, a ghost tried to get in my bed, la la la, whispers from the radiators, la la la, pounding in the walls. Ho hum. The second major problem was that we know so little about the house's inhabitants. Everyone besides the author is a mere prop, a cardboard cutout. It's hard to care about what happens when there's no one to care about it happening to.All in all, it's a poorly done treatment of what could have been a fascinating story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just plain silly","review":"The author is obviously a \\"woowoo\\" as my mother would say. Her obsession with the occult,angels, and other things make this story seem as though it is something she created in her head. I just read it most of the time rolling my eyes. There is really not a single thing scary about this book except perhaps the writing style, and the authors flighty personality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well-written, but not scary. . . . .","review":"The word \\"haunted\\" always makes a ghost story sound terrifying. . . but in this case, the story wasn't really very scary at all. The author writes a first-person story of her haunted house experience, and also discusses what was happening in her family and personal life to give more interest to the characters. While I feel it was an interesting tale, with some \\"paranormal\\" experiences, most of the time, I was not at all frightened. The author is very open to para-psychology and she herself was not really frightened most of the time, and seemed to harbor a belief that the spirits were benign in her home. It was an interesting story, but if you don't share the author's openness to other beliefs systems, she may come off as somewhat hokey. Some suspense, but little terror. It was, however, extremely well-written. If you are looking for a terrifying ghost experience, this is not your story. If you want a reasonably factual account of paranormal activity, this is it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yikes! (Not in a Good Way)","review":"I couldn't get through this one.

The house was old and spooky to begin with but she fell in love with it - even though it needed a lot of work. The previous owner had been an older man who lived there alone except he rented out some of the rooms. At first I was scared of him but you will soon realize he is not threatening to Annie and her family but some of the other ghosts are. I'm not even sure I believe in ghosts but at night after reading and laying down to sleep I know I had some strange and sometimes disturbing dreams.Wilder has a nice writing style - very conversational - as though she is telling you all this over a cup of tea. I found the book delightful and was sorry for it to end.

In all fairness, it stinks! I've had to bypass the thermostat since it simply is of no use. The mechanism is so rudimentary as to be completely useless in regulating the temperature. Worse still, the internal thermal shutoff cuts the unit off well before it has any chance to do anything and it never recovers unless you unplug the unit and leave it be for variable and unpredictable periods of time. The solution to that not so little inconvenience was to replace the thermal switch with one rated to recover after a 15 degree dip in temp.

I thought perhaps I just had a defective part and ordered another replacement panel. I didn't have the receipt to try to return under warranty, and the shipping cost would eat into the cost for just replacing the whole thing. Well, the second panel is on its second winter and the toggle switch is getting stuck again. It seems to do this when the panel is running for several hours. Even if I turn off the panel and try again the next day, I can tell the toggle switch is sticking and will eventually fail as well.I decided to find another type of electric floor heater that is fanless, a Lasko.

It is a good read to get an idea of what lawyers have to consider when cross-examining a defendant,but not as instructive as one would expect from Ehrlich. Providing a greater array of actual cases and their dialogue would have been of benefit. For a general reader, it presents interesting information and some amusing anecdotes on what can be a tedious subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for jazz snobs, but I like it","review":"As an earlier review points out, this is not traditional jazz. I, for one, like this. Jazz is a medium for expression and I can appreciate it in all of it's extended forms. This album is smooth jazz and a bit 80's pop-ish, but it has some real gems on it. Some of Stanley's most beautiful guitar work is on this album in my opinion. Tracks 3, and 7, and 8 in particular I enjoy quite a bit (\\"When Julia Smiles\\", \\"Music's Gonna Change\\", \\"Time is Now\\")."},{"rating":"2","title":"Polar Bears----- great doc. in it's time and even more so now","review":"Watching the polar bears in Churchill on PBSwas memorable for me.

Much like Remarque's other works, it is told from a first person point of view, adding a powerful realism and humanity to the story. Three Comrades follows the story of three World War I veterans and how they survive in Weimar Germany. Robert, Otto, and Gottfried, own an auto repair shop and constantly have to scrape about for funds to stay in business. When Robert meets a mysterious young woman the story catapults into a love story as only Remarque can tell one--with great sympathy and insight into the tragic side of human existence. Using parts of his own life as a template, Remarque masterfully tells the story of Robert and Pat causing the reader to laugh and to cry with the rise and fall of the characters' dreams. Written in 1937, this book is not only a wonderful story, but an insight into the conditions that spawned the rise of the Third Reich. If you like this novel, then definitly read the Black Obelisk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vary Satisfied","review":"First of all I received my order in 2 days, gotta love that.

The vampire\\"Mr Barlow\\" is a Nosferatu wanna-be telling a absurdly rude James Mason what to do like set out teen-age boys on slabs for dinner.I've seen this film several times on VHS, and I really belive that I've seen more detail and recieved more satisfaction out of this disk than I could have hoped for.

It started off well, but the Vampire itself was poor. Also, in the book, the pace really picks up as time goes on to where you really feel urgency at the end.

It even has bad make-up. This is bad all the way around. Not even campy fun. It is just boring. When the vampire jumps up and they play a very loud minor chord, you know that you are supposed to be frightened... but you just aren't. You just sigh. Amazingly, they managed to write out ALL of the really horrifying and creepy moments from Steven Kings book. Try any other movie. If you want something scary, this ain't it. If you want something entertaining, this ain't it either. It is difficult to describe how bad this movie is. Steven King fans, try the Shining.

Although this version deviates frequently from the source material (notably in the characterization/appearance of Mr. Barlow), it still captures the magic of the novel. The escalating vampire threat flows from the natural to the supernatural with smoothly controlled suspense, punctuated by a nice jolt of a terror here and there. Certainly there are signs of a low made-for-TV budget, but the attempts to hide them work most of the time and Tobe Hooper's direction is genre competent. The only real short coming is David Soul, a fine actor who was sadly miscast as Ben Mears (he just lacked that haunted intensity the role called for). Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the scariest vampire movies","review":"Unlike some \\"modern\\" vampire movies that uses gothics an style, no-one can scare the pants off you like steven king who seldom uses these techniques.Salems lot is truly a \\"SCARY-POPCORN-FLYING-SCREAMING-NIGHTMARE-HAVING-AFRAID-TO-WALK-IN-THE-DARK\\" flick. You gotta see and own this great and classic horror flick.The video quality isnt the best (c'mon its over 10 years old) but its worth it.

Salem's Lot is the best Stephen King book based movie! It is also the scariest King Film!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite boring but it keeps you off the streets for awhile.","review":"I have to admit I didn't quite like this movie. The idea in itself is not a bad one, I haven't read the book so I can't say much about that but the movie is somewhat boring. It runs for about 3 hours when I get the idea that the plot would be better for a movie one hour shorter.I bought this movie knowing that it's director, Tobe Hooper, was the big man behind \\"The texas chainsaw massacre\\" which I loved. Salem's lot didn't live up to my expectations. It's plot develops real slow and it is quite predictable, the fact that it is an old movie doesn't justify that in any way. The movie desperately tries to create a chilling atmosphere yet never quite reaches it, which has nothing to do with the year the movie was made in.I can't say I found the watching of this movie a total waste of time, and it isn't expensive either. But if you like Tobe Hoopers work i'd skip this one and go straight to Poltergeist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Attempt","review":"When Steven King first started having best sellers there were a few attempt to bring them to light in the movies. The trouble was that they often got watered down to a point that they only resembled the original story line, but was often a different story. After watching The Shining (Original version) I decided to read the book to see what scary parts didn't make it to the movie. I found that most of the book didn't make it to the movie. I did basically the same thing with Salems Lot and once again found a huge disappointment. I understand the remake is supposed to be a lot closer to the book, but I haven't seen it to compare to this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best vampire films ever!","review":"This film takes me back to my 13 year old-self in 1979 when it originally aired, it still holds up, the film was atmospheric and downright creepy, the story departs some from the novel, but the underlying sense of dread is still there. Excellent!!! 4 Stars!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"2 Hour SnoozeFest, 1 Hour Horror","review":"I am a huge fan of horror films. I do enjoy a low budget take and I'm not overly critical so long as I'm entertained. I rented Salem's Lot b/c I'd heard it has some very scary moments but I was disappointed. The film is 3 hours long and the first two are insanely boring. I kept watching only b/c of the promise of the vampire (had seen it in photos) and b/c my husband seemed entertained. If you hate overly long build up do yourself a favor and fast forward the first two hours. The movie does not get scary until hour 3, and then yes, there are some very scary moments."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrid and Lame","review":"I have only seen the movie once and that was when it was originally shown on T.V. It was so bad that I have never wanted to see it again. I am a huge Stephen King fan and, as a matter of fact, the first book that I read by Stephen King was \\"Salem's Lot\\". The hairs on the back of my neck stood on end. And did likewise when I read it the second time. Which is one of the reasons, if not the main reason, I was looking forward to the film adaptation. I can't tell you how disappointed I was. As mentioned in other reviews, from the old saying - books don't translate well to film. But, maybe one should try to judge o film on its own merit....BUT NOT THIS ONE."},{"rating":"2","title":"purchase of salem's lot","review":"DVD arrived as planned. No visible problems.

The makeup was clearly a take-off of the 1922 classic vampire film Nosferatu---but it did not matter...the Count vampires makeup is among some of the scariest ever done. In one scene, where a dead child comes scratching at a window to come after his brother, oh boy, you know Stephen King was right on the mark when he wrote one of his first and best novels....If you rent this--rent the full 4-hour version. This is a gem of a film.....Only some lapses in the characterizations and some slow moving segments keeps this otherwise dandy film from the five-star mark."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lance Kerwin where are you?","review":"When i saw this movie on TV as a teenager i was floored.

The album's centerpieces are \\"Flirtin' With Disaster\\", which celebrates life on the edge while warning of its consequences, and \\"Fall Of The Peacemakers\\", which asks how long bad things will continue to happen to good people, proving that this band has brains as well as brawn. This CD is a must-own for anyone who enjoys pop and rock music."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST read for ALL parents and teens","review":"I'm a nurse with five children, three of them teens. I stay informed. I am involved in many teens lives. I thought I knew what was going on, until I read this book and heard Dr. Meeker speak. I was shocked.Dr. Meeker is blunt without being rude. She is angry that no one seems to be talking about the epidemic of STDs in our teenagers. She is angry that even though we now KNOW differently, the lie of \\"safe sex\\" is still perpetuated--it is even taught by government sponsored sex education programs. NO ONE seems to be telling our children what they need to know. So, Dr. Meeker is trying to do so, and we should all be listening.Even those who chose to practice abstinense will be affected by the current epidemic, because it is so wide-spread that even one encounter is likely to infect a teen with incurable diseases that might then infect a future spouse.This book is a MUST read for anyone who cares about teenagers."},{"rating":"1","title":"More conservative drivel!!!!","review":"While the author makes some valid points about sexual health and the importance of taking STIs seriously, deep down this is just repackaged Dobson.It is published by the \\"leading conservative publisher on policy issues\\" and should be read more as a tract on conservative sexual values than a medical guide.

On the good side they shipped amazingly fast and look good if you are not looking for a tablet protector."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easily scratched","review":"I don't often write reviews but after ordering the Fellowes WriteRight universal screen protectors I felt it necessary to warn people that these are not the protectors you seek.While they are easy to cut and not too difficult to install they are extremely fragile. After I installed the first one I noticed it had scratches from me using my fingernail to work out a few bubbles. \\"My fault\\", I thought, \\"I shouldn't have used a fingernail.\\" But after installing my next protector using only the surface of my clean finger to work out the bubbles that will form - same thing, many scratches. I was getting tired of cutting and installing so I left the protector on for one day. It hasn't been a full day yet but already the screen looks like a frosted window. My phone has been in and out of my pocket 3 or 4 times by itself, but these protectors just scratch with the least provocation. I'll try a different product and chalk this up to experience :("},{"rating":"1","title":"GARBAGE","review":"This stuff is horrible. The squeege card they give you ruins the protector as you are putting it on. The protectors scratch easily and look like hell after 2 minutes. Save the headaches and get Zagg.

The squeegee gouges the plastic, making very visible scratches. No matter how carefully the material is applied, large bubbles remain under the plastic and cannot be removed with the squeegee.Shop around. I've gotten better results with thick saran wrap.Made in China."},{"rating":"1","title":"You should not have to settle for bubbles in the film","review":"No matter how hard I try, I cannot apply this product without getting bubbles under the film. The bubbles are easily visible on several of the darker screens on my phone, and I cannot push them out with the piece of cardboard that was supplied. This is not a problem that is inherent in products of this type. I previously applied a screen protector to my Zune. That protector film came with an after-market case; unfortunately I do not know the identity of the manufacturer. It went on easily, leaving one or bubbles that were quickly pushed out of the film using the supplied plastic applicator. Two years later, you still can't even tell that it is there, even when the device screen is black. I will be returning this item and demanding a full refund. My guess is that most people don't think that it is worth the trouble to do so. Consequently, Fellowes continues to market an inferior product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not perfect, but..","review":"I've been using these for many years on PDA's cameras, phones, etc.I like the numbering system which makes it really easy to cut the correct size. Even when the tab is not on the piece you need to use, it's easy to separate the screen. Putting it on is another matter. It takes a steady hand, but it's not difficult if you \\"roll\\" it on the screen. I, too, get bubbles, but am not bothered by them when the equipment is turned on.My only complaint is having to change them so often. On my Blackberry, I change it ever couple of months even though it gets no rougher treatment than sliding into and out of the supplied case. But much better a scratched protector than a scratched screen!!There are quite a few protectors in a package and each one, for me, will cover 2 pieces of equipment. That's why I recommend the universal size."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keep your screens like new","review":"I use this on my treo, mp3 player and even wide screen nuvi 650 nav system. These screen protectors are even better than the old ones, because the backing has measured grid lines that help you cut out the precsise size that you need for your screen. I've had no trouble removing these from any screens. The screens are also nice and clear to see through. I has saved me many times when I stick my keys into the same pocket as one of my electronics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not made Right","review":"Like others have said, the product has some major flaws for a screen protector. Its near impossible to get all the bubbles out and when you use THEIR squeegee, expect scratches galore. I have the Hero and when the phone is on, you can't notice the scratches \\"too\\" bad but why even include the squeegee if it scratches up YOUR product? I've only had the protector for a day so I can only imagine it will get worse."},{"rating":"2","title":"love it","review":"I bought a case for my ipod and the clear cover will scratch the screen if i dont put anything on it. i bought this protector and put it under the ipod case, its completely secure since the case cover the corners that way, the protector won't come out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating junk! (less than 1 star would be more accurate)","review":"Like one of the other reviewers I want the hour of my life back that I spent trying to install this product on my G1.

I'm on my third one and about ready to dig through the trash for the original one that came with the phone. Save yourself some frustration and find a different product."},{"rating":"1","title":"find anouther solution","review":"These scratch easy, I scratched one up bad enough trying to get bubbles out with the included squeege-card that I had to replace it after just installing it.Bubbles are hard to get out but that is understandable.They have tiny scratches to begin with whats the point.Make the device harder to read, especially in well lit/sunny areas.It does peal off cleanly.I am using it on a Ipod Touch, and the touch screen does still work great though the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"scotch tape would work better","review":"seriouslythese things are absolutely terrible. I got a pack of 5, which given the size of my blackberry screen gives me ten tries. I used almost all of them and still have not been successful once at even a just ok look. they are foggy, scratch way to easy, and as no matter how careful you are, bubbles and the corners peel. I would seriously think a piece of clear plastic bag taped over it would look better. i have applied other screen protectors before with no problems and great results. {those ones usually had backing on BOTH sides btw.} not only are these things trash, i want the hour of my life that i spent messing with them back!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Virtually Useless","review":"I purchased a pack of WriteRight yesteday upon a sales representative's recommendation. The intended use was to protect the LCD screens of a GPS and cell phone. Unfortunately, the product was very disappointing in two respects. One, the surface was very reflective and did not reduce glare as described on the product envelope. Secondly, even with careful application, many bubbles remained under the film, which in combination with the film glare, makes the product virtually useless. Good idea, bad implementation."},{"rating":"1","title":"More trouble than its worth","review":"The picture on the box shows what appears to be rather flexible sheets. They are in fact quite rigid. I bought these for my iPod screen, and while they have kept it scratch free, it's probably impossible to apply one of these without trapping at least some dust or small debris underneath. They have lines on them to help in cutting them straight, but none of the lines are in the right place for my iPod. The screen on the new iPods are slightly recessed, in fact the exact amount these are thick. If you cut it to fit just right, there's no way of getting them off without picking at it with an exacto knife which of course has the potential to do extreme damage. These were good for a \\"quick fix\\" while I looked for a more practical screen protector, but I would never buy them twice, or even recommend them for that matter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super book about a super composer.","review":"Isaac Pitman did a brilliant job in inventing his shorthand.

I recently purchased the Commemorative Edition DVD. Times haven't changed, I wept again. The movie reflects the beautiful innocence of the time as compared to the standards of today's films. The Fighting Sullivans represents the incredible sacrifice made by a family during World War II. However, it goes beyond the story of the Sullivans and encompasses the fighting spirit demonstrated in all men and women who defend our country. As a daughter of a World War II sailor who served in the South Pacific alongside the Sullivans, I highly recommend this film to families throughout the country. In fact, it should be required viewing in all American history classes. Iowa is currently in a building campaign for the Sullivan Brothers Iowa Veterans Museum. After you watch the movie, you may feel inspired to support this museum or any of the hundreds of veteran's organization throughout this wonderful country."},{"rating":"2","title":"Always been a favorite","review":"I saw this movie years ago with my grandmother, and I hadn't seen it in years. Naturally, I wanted to see it again. It begins as the story of a close-knit family growing up. It follows them right into WWII into their untimely demise. A true tear-jerker...and a classic that ranks up there with \\"It's a Wonderful Life.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"A PROFOUND HEARTBREAKER","review":"The freedoms so many of us take for granted were assured by the sacrifice of so many like the Sullivan brothers. The film is an excellent tribute to this wonderful family who belong to all Americans. It also points out that war is not the rousing adventure of a John Wayne or Rambo movie. It is a deadly serious undertaking."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 brothers growing up and fighting during WWII","review":"This is an excellent movie that you mst see! I watched it with my family and all were moved to tears. It is based on a true story and is the reason that family members cannot serve together in the armed forces. There s also a song by Caroline's Spine that is the story of these five Sullivan boys so if you like the song the next logical step is to watch the movie. It is an older film done in black and white but that in no way detracts from the film. The characters are superbly portrayed and you become connected to each one. Make sure you grab the tissues cuz this one may need a whole box but it has enough comedy and action that it can hook even the \\"strongest\\" man. Even he may need the tissues at the end!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD for The Fighting Sullivans","review":"Hello, I purchased this movie a few months back, and we finally watched it last night, and I have to say I was so disappointed with this copy of this DVD.

For $25.00 this copy should of been crystal clear.I truly should of sent this movie back, but I purchased it two months ago. I saw this movie again on Television and the picture was crystal clear.

The first 1 hour and 35 minutes were about the family (from marriage through birth of 6 kids and the kids growing-up to their 20s). The first hour was like the \\"little rascals\\" (it was about the kids growing up). The next 35 minutes were about the life of the kids when they were aged in their 20s. The last 17 minutes had to do with WWII (12 minutes of war footage, 5 minutes back home dealing with the death of the 5 men).

The story of the five Sullivan brothers from their young years, till they entered the Navy following the bombing of Pearl Harbor. They did everything as one unit, they played, they fought and they protected each other at all costs.

When trials and hard times came their way, they always had support for one another. Even going to war, the five boys were inseparable.Their Love, Respect, and Committment for one another is simply astonishing and unbelievable. I couldn't believe that this was actually a true story, and not a hollywood drama. Maybe that is why it has touched so many. Because it is a story of real people who encountered real hardship during WWII. This is a \\"classic\\" to add to my collection of great movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst films of all time.","review":"Amazing that people like this terrible, badly acted, incredibly stupid film. But you can't argue with someone who laughs at something, I guess. The four people in our house couldn't take much of this film -- I stuck with it and watched it all the way through, just to see Clint Eastwood. The dialogue and acting are so bad that you have to take a break now and then for fear of losing too many brain cells all at once. I'm glad I recorded it from TV. It's now erased, and is just a memory."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't like snakes!","review":"The movie was OK until the scene with the rattle snake killing the otter.

They was only refunded the shipping (Expedited Shipping of $5.19) I am very sad and unhappy since I had never had a problem with Amazon before and always raved about how great I thought they were.

He falls in love with a country and western singer who leaves him, causing a lengthy chase episode in which Clint is trying to find his girl friend while angry bikers and cops are pursuing him.The humor is supplied mostly by Clint's constant sidekick, an orangutan named Clyde, and his agent's outrageous mother played by Ruth Gordon.The cast also includes Sondra Locke, Geoffrey Lewis, Beverly D'Angelo and Walter Barnes. The director is James Fargo. The movie is definitely not a work of art but it is a very funny farce which is quite enjoyable if you don't take it too seriously."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timepass","review":"If you like Eastwood style, this is a good one, not of much of the heart touching action as with his oterh recent ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glad to see this one out on DVD !!!","review":"I've been waiting a long time for this movie to be released on DVD....It still hasn't been released on DVD in Britain, so I bought it from the USA.

Pairing him with a hairy orangutan buddy Clyde, as his co-star,while he supplements his income as a bare-knuckle fighter is unlikely to say the least, but it works well in this enjoyable movie. Chasing his paramour Sondra Locke, who jilted him for some nerdy wimp, through some of the prettiest country in the Rocky Mountain west makes for some great viewing in the Blu ray format.Complications in the form of an over the hill motorcycle gang, and bumbling sherriff's deputies are all handled deftly by Clint's punches and even in one case by Clyde's straight right jab.Ruth Gordon, who plays \\"Ma\\" is priceless as a \\"defenseless old woman\\" left on her own when Clint and his buddies leave to hunt for Locke. She turns out to be as defenseless as a swat team when harrassed by the inept biker gang.Good Movie, lots of fun and just super in Blu Ray."},{"rating":"2","title":"why can't I add half-stars?","review":"because this is an amazing three-and-a-half star album, but i'mnot sure it's a four-star. there are a few cuts- \\"Yankee, GoHome\\" (which i love musically and find humorous as hell but which has potential to alienate more than a few listeners), \\"Jerusalem on the Jukebox\\", which i still get stuck in my head occasionally but which might not have the same stamina four years down the road, \\"Pharaoh\\" which is just midtempo drudgery, for the most part... but, having said that, \\"Turning of the Tide\\" and \\"Waltzing's\\" are worth the price of this disc threefold, especially \\"Waltzing's\\". i defy you to find me a finer lost love song written in the last forty years. perhaps \\"nightswimming\\". but \\"waltzing's\\" in the same closet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"Largely downer music and rough and somewhat crude biker sort of basic music with little redeeming factors - If you want a decent album by him get the capital years"},{"rating":"2","title":"just amazing","review":"I got this on vinyl years ago and the price was great so I got it on CD(don'thave a turntable anymore).Any one familiar with the Gary Davis catalog will beinto this one!A number of the tunes are on other releases under other names,but the performances are smokin'.Great takes on theMaple Leaf Rag,Cincinnatti Flow RagWalkin' Dog Blues and a whole host of others.I guess this was the last release he did on Prestige/Bluesville label and they are all great CD's!Harlem Street SingerA Little more Faith and Say No tothe Devil are all great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worth reading if you can afford it","review":"Not a five star book in my opinion unlike the friends of Mcnulty who seem to have given it so, here, who also seem to have scolded those who did not have same thoughs sadly!

Thank goodness this book reaches into history and tells us the true story as it really happened!The book has all of the famous stories about Errol Flynn and a few stories I never heard before.

Honestly, he wasn't far off the mark! Although I'm not the world's biggest SP fan, I do enjoy some of their music. So how do I describe their music? Creepy, chaotic, scary, and horrific (as some would describe) are some adjectives that come to mind. For those of you not familiar with SP, consider this album (and all others) to be the soundtrack to your worst fears and nightmares come true! No, there are aren't any loud metallic guitars or fast banging drums (like Ministry and NIN use). Melodramatic synth melodies accompanied by Nivek Ogre's unique somber and emotional narration are all that's needed!

It is in my opinion the most gothic-industrial type album they have done, with the rest of their works being more industrial and noise. Of all the industrial bands around to this day none of them can rival or come close to SP quality without directly copying their style. Skinny Puppy was a groundbreaking band, and if you like industrial or goth my highest reccomendations go out for this particular recording.

This collection includes live versions (from Muddy \\"Mississippi\\" Waters) of Nineteen Years Old, Nine Below Zero, Howling Wolf, and more. All of those are great, as well as Mannish Boy, The Blues Had A Baby..., and Hoochie Coochie Man.Some great harp and burning slide guitar! Running time is 64 minutes. One complaint: the liner notes don't name the musicians."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Italian Recipe Book EVER!","review":"You cannot go wrong if you purchase this book. The recipes are authentic Italian. I have had mine since the late 1970's and use it often. It was first published as the \\"Little Italian Cookbook\\". Ferrara's is a bakery in Little Italy, NYC. You may also know it as a company that imports and produces Italian foods in cans and bottles. You'll find them at Walmart, QFC, Pathmark, and a variety of other large supermarket chains."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would have been great if there was accomodation information","review":"I have the 1987 edition of this book so the newer edition may include hut and hotel information. However, for a book where part of the title is \\"From Vacation Apartments, Hotels, Mountain Inns, and Huts\\" there is NO hotel information or any information on how to book a stay at a hut.Also, the hikes are limited to very small areas. Val d'Herens is not listed on any of my maps and there are no hikes listed for Verbier which is right over the mountain.If you want to model your vacation after theirs this book is nice. This book won't fit into your vacation though. I'd recommend \\"100 Hut Walks in the Alps\\" which lists hut information across France, Switzerland, Italy, Austria and Slovenia."},{"rating":"2","title":"...large pneumatic ladies exploding...","review":"I acquired this book when I was in high school, having just discovered Monty Python. I was fascinated by the strange cutout animations that joined the skits, and that's what drew me to the book originally. Now, it is a rare, classic treasure. Mainly, it is a book overviewing cutout animation. The fun part is the documenting of a body of work that Gilliam has now moved away from as a film director. There are a few political cartoons, not used for Python, and some pages of raw sketches that show the darker side of animation. Plus, as a bonus, you get a running gag about a black spot and a badger that keep trying to hijack the actual book as you read it.... Technically beneficial to animators, a Holy Grail of acquisitions to Gilliam fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"My husband likes Gospel Rap so this CD was perfect for him.

Any writer who is constantly ending chapters with variations on, \\"But what would happen next would change her life forever.\\", or, \\"He thought he knew horror but what would come next would make him cringe in terror.\\" is a lousy writer. There are scant chills in the book, the characters are interchangeable, and the plot is incredibly derivative(sp?)We've all read this story before, in hundreds of books.

I frequently skipped pages, and by the end, found myself skipping entire chapters just to finish the book. The characters are flat and impossible to identify with and their dialogue and actions are described with nauseating detail. This book also leaves a number of seemingly important details unexplained, including the bloodstone(assuming I didn't accidently miss the details while skipping pages).I bought this book based on the positive recommendations of other Amazon readers, and fortunately, this is the first time I've been disappointed with the reviews."},{"rating":"2","title":"Riverwatch Delivers!","review":"\\"Riverwatch is a stunning debut novel, intricately plotted and beautifully written.

It is ideal for looking up passages about a particular topic or term, and having all the verses in one place, stated in context for easy reference. A good example is that you can look a a term like \\"repentance\\" and it will show you all the verses that not only contain the term repentance, but it will also show you verses that explain or define repentance even if the actual word is not used. This book is a great reference tool for bringing just the scripture you are looking for into an organized topical format. It's much nicer than a concordance (although it will not replace one) because instead of just listing were a term is or part of a verse you are looking for, it brings you the entire verse in context. I highly recommend this resource and the NIV version for all NIV readers, as I believe the other Nave's Topical Bible versions are in the King James translation."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK","review":"I did not use this text for reference material as much as I had anticipated.

It is so stiff that you actually have to push every single bit of waste down its throat with your hand or a utensil! When you push against one of the six triangles, the other 5 remain rigid so you have a very small opening! They wear out in a few months because they are all chewed up from the way you have to push the food down! Even the cheapest InSinkerator models have a better splash guard design! You push against one side and they all open up! If the food is heavy enough, you don't even need to push...it just slides down the opening by itself! How convenient!! While the extra horsepower might be great if you're in a commercial kitchen, for every day use the Waste King is way too frustrating. Next time I'm buying an InSinkerator!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing information","review":"Why oh WHY don't they list the actual product dimensions or the actual models of disposals that take this part?

I don't want to have to return such a small item, especially since so many have reported never getting their money back for a return. And why can't I purchase just the splash guard?

Seriously - why would you want a smaller opening for the drain for a disposal?Additionally I gave it one star because the quality is junk. I can not imagine it lasting more than a several months given how thin the rubber is and it would certainly not stop silverware or other items from falling into the disposal. Shop for another part.

However the hole for the food to go down from the sink is too small. You have to use some tool to push food through. You also can't look to see of all the food has been ground down and sent through to the disposal unit. In addition it is nearly imposible to retrieve items that have accidently gone down into the sink.

Sanford\\" for years. \\"G\\" stands for GREAT as far as I'm concern. This was the first time I saw his live act ever!I was so engaged withhis commentary about life, sex, politics and racial differences. And seeing him RAW and live was...I was just stuck to the screen. I never realized how much of a chain smoker he was. But he was charming, witty and clever. Very entertaing stand-up. He was in Las Vegas when he did his bit and you almost got the feeling that the people were not ready for him. As if they were expecting him to be Fred sanford or something. But what impressed me the most about Redd Foxx was that he never let anything or anyone stop him from being him. He cursed and was vulgar as he could be but in his own loveable charming way that made him irresistable to watch.I'll just write, if you love anything about Redd Foxx and interested in knowing and seeing another side of him than get this DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"A \\"Keeper\\"!","review":"Serena Clerenbold died in 1350, the same day she had married the evil man named Le Gayne.

There are some things that the reader should be aware of.First, the author is correct. Saladin was a great man. That is a point too little stressed in traditional teachings of the Crusade.Second. There are other issues that helped \\"spark\\" the Crusade. For example, while the takeover of Jerusalem was without bloodshed in 638, it occurred as a result of military force, or what used to called in Arab Conquest. But the city still contained one of the holiest shrines for Christendom, the Church of the Holy Sepulchre.Finally, after many years of Muslem tolerance representing the high point of medieval rule, a new ruler's actions showed a \\"lack of sensitivity.\\" Caliph Hakim ordered the Church's destruction in 1009. In an age of religious ideology, this certainly was not the smartest of actions.In sum, a good book but one needs to remember that both sides showed the complete range of human emotions, both good and bad...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoughly Engrossing","review":"Reston weaves a spectacular tapestry of the Third Crusade by following the heroics (and frailties) of Richard Lionheart and the great Muslim Sultan Saladin. While describing the campaign and his protagonists in detail so realistic that the reader almost feels like he is a participant, the suthor also provides the background of the politics and intrigue of 12th century Europe with its heroes and villains. The storis of Eleanor of Aquitaine would have made this a fascinating book by themselves, but intermingled with the other characters and adventures, the story reads almost like fiction. Reston is a formidable researcher and writes in a clear and flowing style that brings both the period and the individuals to life. I didn't learn a lot of new facts, but the texture provided gave ne a much clearer picture and greater appreciation of this epic period."},{"rating":"1","title":"The movie version of the Third Crusade","review":"This is essentially not history; it is a melodrama based, more or less loosely, on the Third Crusade. Its Saladin and Richard are the characters a novelist would have them be -- tailored to fit his plot line, thinking the thoughts he wants them to think, driven by the desires and emotions he wants them to have. Any relationship between these shallow, crudely-drawn characters and the real thing is not only accidental but unimportant. The point of the book is to teach the reader that there were good guys and bad guys and that we (the West) were the bad guys, while throwing in sex and violence in the bargain. And so it presents a simplified, technicolor version that leaves out the historical doubts, factual uncertainties, and other shades of grey that make for good history but bad B movies.Who were the good guys and who the bad? Read Runciman's books (his Volume 3 covers the Third Crusade) -- they present history and let you decide for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"It could have been much better","review":"Whilst factually sound and historically accurate (for the most of it), the author is biased against both the European Crusaders and Richard. This is not good history. This is not even a good novel. This is simply dull and dry one-sided drivel. Want another self-effacing book as the West continually buries itself deeper in the ground? Buy this. Want real History? Buy better books, such as Lionhearts or Chronicles of the Crusades. This book is a waste of time. It only gets 2 stars for its accuracy, in some areas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short on Facts","review":"Warriors of God is written in the easy-to-read style of a novel, which makes the non-history student like me excited to read history. But this isn't history. It is mostly the author's attempt to create a visceral backlash against the European crusaders and glorify the muslim world of that age. He fails to put these few centuries in the greater historical context, which I consider a disservice to the student of history. I see no heroes in the crusades, and certainly no Christians. If you really want to know what Christianity is, try Mere Christianity by C.S. Lewis."},{"rating":"2","title":"Utterly fascinating","review":"Terrific reading and a must-read to get a handle on current Mid-East conflicts and feelings.Full of interesting facts but presented in a very entertaining way."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLY BORING","review":"This book should be a high school textbook it is so boring.

I want to keep this simple and short. So Reston doesn't put footnotes he discredits Christians for everything, and gets his stuff wrong. Such as execution of Muslims at acre...to get the truth of the crusades read gods battalion's. By Rodney stark it dissproves. A lot of things in the crusades that book is 5 of 5"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fact or Fiction?","review":"This is an interesting story, one which provides a tremendous opportunity for study. I was immediately caught off guard, however, by the lack of substantiation and obvious fabrication of material for the sake of story movement. Footnotes are not provided and Reston utilizes dialog as if writing a novel.If your expectation is to study an historical thesis, you will be sorely disappointed. This book should be viewed as historical fiction. I did give a second star because, as fiction, the book reads fairly well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book review.","review":"Enjoying this read thoroughly.

The author relays unproven gossip as fact(There is no historical evidence Richard was a homosexual. The author seems to have taken his intepretation of Richard from \\"The Lion in Winter\\"). He also puts words and thoughts into the minds of people with no basis for them ever saying anything like it. It is an interpretation of Saladin and Richard as he sees them in the context of literary characters. If you are a student looking to write about them and need a source, avoid this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"History Repeats Itself","review":"As I write this review, the dust is still settling after the terrorist attacks in New York and here in Washington. This book gives tremendous insight into the minds of those who would wreck havoc in the name of faith. This book reminds us that the struggle between faiths in the Holy Land has been going on for millenia -- since well before Saladin and Richard the Lionheart. Mr. Reston presents these leaders in an illuminating light, and provides a context for today's events. His writing style is clear, concise and informative. I enjoyed this book tremendously and learned a great deal from it."},{"rating":"2","title":"History .....More like a great novel!","review":"This is one of many books I have read on this subject.

If you like the history of the crusades, you will enjoy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost perfect","review":"Except for the ill-advised portions covering Richard's fictious homosexual romance, this is a wonderful book. It beautifully shows the complexities of the struggle in which the King and the Sultan were engaged, as well as the age in general. The overall effect the book projects is to show that while piety and penitence may have brought the \\"pilgrims\\" to this distant land, the promises of gold, gore, and glory were what kept them there for the duration. The possible exception would seem to be Philip Augustus, who always seemed to have one eye on his kingdom at home. Add to this the various side characters, such as the treacherous Reginald of Chatillion, the maniacal Old Man of the Mountain Sinan, or the oppurtunistic \\"King of Jerusalem\\" Guy of Lusignan, and you have a richly descriptive chronicle of the period. Just disregard the unfounded \\"manly romance\\", soak in the rest, and you will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"When the facts become questionable.","review":"I got a hold of this book to do some research for a story on Robin Hood that I am going to be writing to get some background information on the Third Crusades and on Richard himself. I thought this book was good until I got to the paragraph that concerned Robin Hood. If you've done your homework about Robin Hood, you would know that Robin Hood was described as a yeoman, not a disposed nobleman, and if you do your homework, most researchers on Robin Hood like to point out that the king mentioned in the Robin Hood tales is \\"our comely King Edward\\" with no defining number. That alone put the rest of the information in the book in question, if you ask me. There are some other things about the book I found questionable, but I will leave my review at that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reston hates the Crusaders","review":"After reading most of this book I was surprised by how anti-west and pro-east Reston's observations are. He fails to miss an opportunity to point out everything negative and barbaric about the crusaders and everything positive and cultured about the Muslims.Reston's skewed approach became obvious when at one point he was harshly critical of the garish nature of a Christian church because of its use of marble. On the very same page, not 3 paragraphs later he praises the builders of a mosque for their elegant use of...marble.That's one example, but the book is filled with comparisons and they all go poorly for the Christians. I have read many other books about the 3rd crusade and this is the worst, for it offers the skewed opinion of a writer who obviously seethes with contempt with his own culture...because of its success."},{"rating":"1","title":"Historically Inaccurate","review":"More a cheap novel than a balanced assessment of historical fact; it should be understood that this book is purely entertainment. And conjecture when it's not outright falsification."},{"rating":"2","title":"Warriors of God","review":"While this is a historical analysis of activity surrounding the Third Crusade, it is very relevant to today. All readers will readily relate to the \\"War\\" in Iraq and other militant happenings in the Middle East.

With her help, he learns to care about more than money, and a thrilling, touching novel is the result.

This Young Bond story turns out quite sinister including lots of killings of more or less innocent people (which to my knowledge is the tendency of the adult James Bond stories,too). The plot is altogether clever, compelling and surprising to the very end. The story starts with an idyllic scene in the Greek archipelago and gets soon to Eton College from where some boys and teachers James Bond including travel for the summer holiday to the island of Sardinia and get involved with art thieves, pirates and bandits. The course of events is directed by the local rich lunatic who naturally wants even more power over other people and helds as a prisoner the compulsory young beautiful English girl for James Bond to rescue.Nathaniel Parker as the reader makes this story even more live and exciting by his marvelous characterizations and strong empathizing with the interpretation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Higgins hits another home-run","review":"Charlie Higgins has produced another winner in this second installment of his \\"Young James Bond\\" series.

This record was way ahead of its time: Temporary Secretary, Secret Friend, Check My Machine, and instrumentals like Frozen Jap are all astonishing. There are some gorgeous ballads here like One of these Days and Summer's Day Song. And of course there's Coming Up. What other artist but Paul could pull off such an unusual record -- played and sung and recorded pretty much by himself. Some Macca fans hate, and will never get it. Their loss.

If he was going for Bowie-esque reinvention/trend-setting, he failed far worse than Bowie did during the same decade.Actually starts out pretty well with the funky stomp of \\"Coming Up,\\" the amusing \\"Temporary Secretary,\\" and the fun but empty blues ballad, \\"On the Way,\\" but the rest is about as spotty as it gets. If Paul wanted to try a new wave flavor, why not go all the way? Instead, he forces boring and schmaltzy ballads like \\"Waterfalls\\" and \\"One of These Days\\" upon us, and we're forced to cringe and wonder just what the hell happened.

Macca finally clips his Wings and returns to the do-it-yourself approach that served him well on his first solo recording. Released in 1980, \\"McCartney II\\" is a more polished production than the 1970 effort - highlighted by the hit single \\"Coming Up,\\" a memorable rocker titled \\"Nobody Knows,\\" the ballad \\"One of These Days\\" and a surprising amount of experimentation. There are relatively few misfires (such as the irritating \\"Temporary Secretary\\") while the instrumentals hold up quite well. \\"Check My Machine\\" and \\"Secret Friend\\" - the B-side bonus tracks - display an atmospheric, improvisational quality rarely heard in McCartney's work. The overall album surpasses the mediocrity that plagued McCartney during the 1980s."},{"rating":"1","title":"When the novelty wears off...","review":"What a strange, eccentric album this is. One gets the feeling that Paul was laying low, and after the half baked mess of his previous album (\\"Back To The Egg\\"), who could blame him. This album is similar to \\"McCartney\\" in that it's low fi, off the cuff, but is less \\"real\\" than that, his first solo album. Once again, one wonders who, if anyone, is home. Any resemblance to the man who wrote all those great Beatles tunes is purely coincidental. \\"Coming Up\\" is the one transcendant moment where it all comes together...and as such, the album peaks on it's opening cut. The only other \\"highlights\\" are \\"Nobody Knows\\" (a wacky rockabilly-type tune that is a lot of fun), \\"One Of These Days\\" ( a depressing little acoustic demo), and \\"Waterfalls\\", the only \\"real\\" song in the bunch...and a lovely one at that. Re-record this one, Paul, with a string quartet. Forget the rest."},{"rating":"1","title":"A weak, weak album","review":"This album starts out weak and gets weaker as it goes. Paul's second attempt at a true \\"solo\\" album (where he plays all the instruments) falls flat. Some people think it was his attempt to do punk but it's more like his experimental stuff he does as \\"The Fireman\\". But when Paul experiments stuff like melody and structure go out the window. He'd have been better off saving these songs, and interspersing the stronger ones in future albums and as B-sides rather than release them all together. AND it doesn't have the superior live version of \\"Coming Up\\" which came as a single with the original vinyl album."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Paul McCartney album.Even Yoko could do better","review":"Paul McCartney is one of my favorite artist,and he deseves to have a bad record,and this is the one.I have to give it 2 stars because Paul did everything himself on this album. The number 1 single,\\"Coming up,\\" was even different from the way its in here.Paul tried to go New Wave,and it didn't work.I think this was the reason Paul was arrested in Japan in 1980."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give Me A Break!","review":"This is by far the worst album by Paul McCartney and one of the worst by any major artist! What has often been defended as \\"raw\\" comes across as more like half-baked. No other artist than an ex-Beatle could get away with releasing such Junk (and I'm not talking about the halfway-decent ballad from the first McCartney solo disk!) Almost all of the tunes are irritating and amateurish in both their composition and execution. Paul explained that he made these tracks for a tape to play in his car - maybe he should have left it at that. Perhaps we should give him some credit, as he has managed to sound both dissonant and bubblegummish at the same time! The only saving grace at all is the acoustic \\"One Of These Days\\", which compared to time-tested McCartney ballads is an OK throwaway, but next to these attrocities sounds like a near-masterpiece!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Is Bad","review":"Huey Lewis once did a little tune called \\"Bad Is Bad\\". Turns out that tune sums up McCartney II very well. I am amused by all the fans who try to justify this album. When Paul is good, he is not only good, he's absolutely the best. But when he's bad, well, he's bad. I listen to this and it is hard for me to believe this is the same guy who wrote all those great Beatle songs.So, let's be honest and call it like it is. There are good Paul Mccartney albums. And then, there is this collection of rubbish.Bad is bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"heh heh...","review":"Just think... this was the same guy who did \\"Penny Lane\\" + \\"Eleanor Rigby\\".

Boy oh boy, what a piece of garbage. Thank God \\"Coming Up\\" was thrown in as a bonus single with the album, or I'd flung this like a frisbee. Speaking of \\"Coming Up\\", the LIVE version, it is probably one of my all time favorite McCartney/Wings songs - but who played on that with him? Wings? Dunno. But man, I was at the peak of my Beatle fan-dom when this came out, I don't believe I ever bought another McCartney CD again until \\"All The Best\\" came out, and now \\"Back In The US\\", which are great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paul What were You Thinking/Smoking?","review":"Simply put the worst piece of s**t ever put out by a major artist.

McCartney carried on after they broke upin 1969 with some of the best post-Beatles music, but \\"the good stuff\\" onlycame out of Paul for about five more years. \\"McCartney\\", \\"Ram\\", \\"Wings WildLife\\", \\"Red Rose Speedway\\", \\"Venus and Mars\\", \\"Band on the Run\\", and a fewgreat singles like \\"Give Ireland Back to the Irish\\" (banned in England) and\\"Hi Hi Hi\\" (banned in England) were the only good stuff Paul has ever donesince the Beatles.Too much money, too much fame, he paid his post-Beatles bandmatespeanuts and raked it all in for himself.

Except for Waterfalls this album should never have been recorded. But there was worse to come. Try to listen to Macca's Firemen album.

While some call this album good and some call it great, the music fan from St. Paul, MN wrote how attrocous this CD is. The music fan obviously can see what most others fail to see or say...that this album is horrible.If it were not Paul Mac, this CD would not have sold 10,000 copies and would be lucky to find it's way to the cut-out bins.Save your money for a Ginsu knife before spending it on this, easily the worst album by any former Beatle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Robert Crosbie is an Idiot","review":"How could you possibly say this is better than Tug of War? I know opinions are like spleens (everybody's got 'em), but where Tug of War had polish and soul, this album is devoid of even the essential Macca charm. It's unholy horrible. It makes The Beach Boys Love You (which hit on the synth craze three years before this tripe) look like Pet Sounds (whereas I've always called Tug of War McCartney's Pet Sounds.) Even the song Waterfalls, which everyone seems to praise here, is way too long. I listened to this one day while driving a long stretch of highway. Thank God it only gave me a headache instead of putting me to sleep.NO STARS for Robert Crosbie."},{"rating":"1","title":"This album gives me a wah-wah","review":"The worst of Paul McCartney--not much more to say.

There are many bonus tracks, though, so the price is right for you if you don't have it. Packaging is very similar to Band on the Run from last year.

I was in the Marines and did not know if I was going to war so I lived for the moment. This album reflected the times and I identified with it. I nearly worn the groove of this album.

How wonderfully it was written, how incredibly unusual and complex the characters were, and how much i understood them. Next, I sit down in front of my tv and watch the movie. To put it nicely, I am appalled at how horrible the movie is. The whole plot is distorted, major characters aren't even mentioned (Harrison and Alice), and the main characters (besides John Lithgow who was excellent as Roberta) aren't portrayed very well by the actors. I do acknowledge though, that the parts are extremely difficult to play and that the actors probably did the best they could. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this movie, ESPECIALLY to people you have read the book, which is absolutely fantastic. Now all of you, go read the book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this one","review":"Garp is often mis-portrayed as a wonderful dark comedy.

If you want to enjoy your time watching a film - avoid this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie does the book no justice","review":"After watching the video for The World According to Garp I went and bought the novel by John Irving. After reading about twenty pages I wondered if I picked up the worng book because the movie is so much different. I then finished reading the book and realized what a beuatiful story it is about love, death, and change in which the movie truly did no justice. I think that all copies of the movie should be burned and everyone required to read the book. The only thing that saved this book from a one star review was the oustanding performance from Robin Williams, who truly made the movie watchable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good & Strange","review":"This is a strange movie but really good, it's hard to explain but I think Forrest Gump was inspired by this movie. It has a surreal yet familiar feel, like some of these things have happened to you."},{"rating":"1","title":"The World According to Garp","review":"Iwas somewhat disappointed when I recieved the dvd. It was in a plastic type envelope with no packing material. Somewhere between NC and SC it came loose from the spindle holding the dvd in the case. Most likely from like of no packing material. Anyways when I opened it ,it was scratched pretty bad on the recorded side and when I play it, it misses parts of the movie due to the scratches, this is after I had it cleanded, seems the scratches were to deep. Also they gave about a 20day span to deliver this dvd, being in the next state I figured it would get here pretty fast, boy was I wrong.It took almost the full time period to get here from NC. Needless to say I won't purchase anything else from them. I will just need to find someplace local to get a good copy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can be funny if you watch it with a certain perspective","review":"I don't think the filmmakers or the author of the book intended to ridicule feminism but this story actually does that quite well. Jennifer (Glenn Close) is clearly a nut case and it is quite amusing to see idiotic women worship her as an icon. She is basically a self-absorbed, man hating b*tch of the worst kind. In fact there is nobody in the entire movie that you are really rooting for, so all that is left is laugh when this bunch of morons finally get their comeuppance or are killed off."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Very Disturbing Film","review":"This movie disturbed me. This will not be a popular opinion here but it is an honest one. When I saw it in theatres years ago I left feeling defiled. A woman who hates men has sex with a dead man so she can give birth, a child killed and a child maimed for life because their father coasted into the driveway and hit an unexpected car that was in the driveway that contained his wife performing oral sex on one of her students, women cutting their tongues out in protest over another womans violent rape. My friends have told me that I just wasnt looking at the humorous side of it. Kind of a weird opinion on their behalf. I think whoever conceived this stuff is a very sick person with a very sick view of the world."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of my all-time hated movies","review":"This is a review of the theatrical version. Not the DVD. I would never buy it. I saw this movie when it was in first run and hated it ever since. It was one of the first of the new generation of anti-male movies that continues to this day. The more bad or embarrassing things that happen to men, the better. I'm sure it's a man-hating feminist favorite."},{"rating":"1","title":"IS AMAZON RUNNING SOME KIND OF A CON?","review":"This film ORIGINALLY FEATURED Roblin Williams, Mary Beth Hurt, John Lithgow, and Glen Close. The jacket, as shown in Amazon's Advertisement shows Robin Williams, the house Garp and, his wife and sons lived in and the airplane that crashed into their house one of the scenes in the flims. However, only one of the actors in the original DVD film I have is listed in the actor's credits for the film being sold by amazon (Glen Glose).The original cast did an excellent job with the film, but who the devil are the actors--(Nathon Babcock, Warren Berlinger, and Susan Browning)--listed above the product Amazon is the trying to dump on unsuspecting public.

What a sad waste of cinematic effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very well-done adaptation of the fabulous book.","review":"Definitely read the book first. Without that background, the viewer will miss many of the movie's references. However, the movie version impressed me. The actors were very well selected for their roles, and the film adaptation was about as good as it could possible be, although I still have to express the book's superiority. John Lithgow gave an especially surprising performance as the transsexual ex-Philadelphia Eagle, Roberta Muldoon, and Robin Williams uses his comic abilities to play a great Garp."},{"rating":"1","title":"John Irving, where are you?","review":"Mr. Irving in response to this rendering of this novel, said they only got about 1/8th of the story he wrote.

There's something about its characters, pacing, and plot(s) that are somehow unpretentious, to the point that you almost forget that you're reading a piece of fiction, and not just peeking in on some very peculiar friends.

While not as good as his triumphant third album, it still has it's moments. It pretty much follows the \\"formula\\" of his third album, by including some songs Ringo wrote, some songs his friends wrote for him and some cover versions of other people's songs. The big hits were \\"No No Song\\" and \\"Only You\\". The CD version features three bonus tracks. \\"Back Off Boogaloo\\" was a Top Ten hit. The strange \\"Blindman\\" was the b-side of \\"Back Off Boogaloo\\" and was also the title song to a western Ringo starred in. \\"Six O'Clock\\" was originally featured on Ringo's third album. This is the extended version that previously only appeared on promo copies of the third album. It runs over a minute longer than the normal version and you can hear Paul McCartney's backing vocals more clearly on it. Recommended to Ringo's fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of musical horsepower from a damn good band.","review":"Ringo will go down in musical history as \\"The least annoying Beatle\\". We all sort of thought when the fab four quit that Ringo would end up in one of those \\"Where are they now?\\" columes in Rolling Stone magazine. No such deal. He proved to be a hell of a musician, a top rate drummer and knows how to always surround himself with the best in the biz. Paul should take some notes. Such was the case with Goodnight Vienna. I love this album!! A first class turn-it-up-loud and blow the f**kin speaker cones out on the floor recording. Ringo had to work a bit trying to find himself a band after the Beatle split but it didnt take long. Goodnight Vienna is a hot 70's post Beatle rocker that plays well in the 21st century. The title cut is a John Lennon contribution that could only have been a Ringo tune. You'll never hear a rock vocalist with no vibrato, projection and range crank it out like Ringo did on this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"doesn't fit","review":"the amazon program determined this cabin air filter fit my 2006 grand vitara, but after i received it i realized this filter doesn't fit my car. this filter is 2 pieces but my car only use one piece cabin air filter and the size is totally different.

It is set out poorly. Each chapter starts with a picture of two 19th century gentlemen sweep rowing in what, no doubt, are thick, woollen tights. This is commendable honesty, because you are about to be enveloped in thick woolly text and diagrams.I found little new in the book. Some of the information in it was so obtuse as to be useless. For example, the discussion of aerobic training categories is long-winded and the workout examples so vague that it would require extra reading to work out what to do. McCarthur's High Performance Rowing does it so much better.Sorry Ed, your book is uninspiring, but I am glad you got your masters degree allright!

Robert's enunciation and voice are superb. Other songs I like on this CD are O Holy Night, Christmas Day, The Christmas Waltz and Home For The Holidays.I have Mr. Goulet's two Christmas albums on cassette. He did other songs not included in this collection like Ave Maria and Hurry Home For Christmas. If those songs were here, I would've given this CD five stars.

This is one of the few albums that I can sit down and listen to the whole thing without wanting to skip a song (and one of those other few is Rick's solo debut, The Great Adventures of Slick Rick). Most of Slick's songs are funny, have a message, and above all else are phat. Everyone I've played this LP for agree: it's dope, period.

Especially notable and similar to his \\"adventures\\" success, is the \\"street talkin\\" single, (featuring the quick rapping outkast) with his trademark sing-song melodies inserted cleverly into a swinging phat beat laced with bass.(For the 4x4) Yo, the way I see it, Slick Rick has done it again!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Lost Art of Storytelling...it's like 1989 all over again","review":"The Art of Storytelling is the oasis in the hip hop desert that fans have been thirsting for since the \\"Golden Age of Hip Hop\\" ended in 1991. Free from the mandatory gun-shot skits or money, cash, hoes recipe that seemingly is the recipe for every other new release, Ricky D gets back to the visual MC painting portraits. Songs like \\"Two Way Street\\" show how he has matured in his views of women. He still shows that old \\"I'll crush anybody on the mic attitude\\" in \\"Frozen\\" and \\"Me and Nas Bring It To Your Hardest\\", back when it was fun to brag and talk about other mc's without fearing for your safety. The beats on this album are all tight for the most part, and compliment Rick's still strong storytelling skills.

The padded sections also have a non slip material which makes a back strap almost unnecessary. Ths straps have a stretchiness to them which also helps the instrument feel very secure. And for the price, they are a great value. How they wear and last remains to be seen but worth a try for any player I think."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fire the publisher!!","review":"\\"John Keitz\\" and \\"Ivy avid reader\\" reviews are DEAD ON!!!PLease take the time to read both reviews. I recommend not reading Night Embrace at all, but if you have to...Do yourselves a favor and get this from a friend or library. This book started our very well and had so much potential only to intoduce a female lead that hit on every raw nerve I could stand.It was like the chalkboad and fingernail torture. What ever thoughts (I use that term loosely) that our good heroine, Sunshine, might have rattles around in her empty head until I went NUTS!!!Not only was she an idiot, but she had no shame at all. Sunshine followed the vampire around like a FEMALE DOG in heat! I couldn't even get past the first couple of chapters. My best advise for this poor vampire and any other male in her vacinity is to quickly get away or castrate themselves and jam ice picks in their ears. As a reader my eyes have been assaulted by this crap and I shall try and quickly put this behind me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good follow-up to book 2, the real \\"start\\" of the DH series","review":"This is a funny, sexy, entertaining read. Since I use reader numbers and ratings to help me determine which books to read and/or purchase, I wanted to add my vote even though everyone before me as \\"said it all.\\" A good follow-up to Kyrian's story, (book#2) which was really the \\"start\\" of the DH series.

And no disapointment here, I will gladly read her next book. Sure it's cheesey is some places and some cheap sex, but some great plot situations and also some great actions scenes. She can go far with this series if she can keep working at it. Talon is a great hero and Sunshine can keep sure keep up with him and to me really put this guy to shame.

So give this series a try you will be glad that you did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intricate, Yet Motives Don't Match Characters","review":"No one will get bored with this book, that's for sure. It's the first for me by this author, so I'm anxious to read the others, especially Kyrian's story.But....There wasn't an ugly or even average-looking person in ALL of New Orleans, it seemed. EVERYone wore leather, too.Mostly, it made no sense that these Dark-Hunter's would kill to protect humans when they seemed to want to kill each other instead. There was a real and ugly hatred between these guys. They could viciously kill anyone and feel no guilt, so it just wasn't believable that they would care one way or the other about the safety of complete strangers."},{"rating":"2","title":"I wish there were 4.5 stars to give","review":"I give this book 4.5 stars, just because Dance with the Devil was so much better. I really loved this book though. The love story is so beautiful, and I love the concept of the dark hunters. The characters are awesome, although I think that the heroine keeps on being two dimensional until the ending of the book. She is not as fleshed out as Talon, the hero.I read somewhere that you can see that when the writer falls in love with a character, that character sparks off the page. Well, for this novel that is certainly true. Talon is too big for the pages of this book.All in all a very good read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book- Love the series!","review":"It's rare to find something truly new in PNR these days, however these books keep bringing fresh ideas into the stories!

These are not the highest form of literature, but they are entertaining-- that's why they get 4 rather than 5 stars. Night Embrace, as you may easily guess, is a bit of a bodice ripper --- but that element is kind of fun and doesn't take away from the plot. The stories are fast paced and well threaded, yet a bit over the top. Kenyon brings in a bit of legend, ancient history and Greek mythology -- a great premise to begin with. The characters are interesting and compelling, yet a little corny. I especially like all of the \\"side characters\\" - those that appear for a few short chapters-- often they will reappear in future books of the series. I admire Kenyon's attempt to hit every New Orleans landmark (again, as she does in previous books)."},{"rating":"2","title":"KENYON ROCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I read this book in one day.

I have owned the VHS version since the 70s when it came out, and saw the theatrical release at least 4 times. I was so excited to hear that it was being released on DVD that I pre-ordered it immediately from Amazon last year, with great expectations. The DVD finally arrived earlier this month. To my horror, the sound quality is AWFUL (muted, garbled), there are big green streaks/lines in the \\"But the World Goes Round\\" scene (where Liza is singing against a darkened studio with only a spotlight on her face). The title song scene is muted and of poor quality. C'mon, MGM!!! You need to re-release this. AND PLEASE RELEASE IT IN WIDESCREEN, NOT LETTERBOX!!!!! (To Amazon.com's credit, however, I have to say that with no questions asked, they have offered to send me a replacement immediately, without even having to return the original due to high cost of shipping from Canada to the US.

It is an excellent film, but because MGM decided to pussyfoot around giving the actual film a better transfer and enhancement, I cannot justify anyone purchasing this piece of repackaged junk. If you love special features, this would be the only reason to double dip. I prefer the pristine transfer over anything else, and was deeply disappointed. As a huge Scorsese fan, this film by far gets the worst treatment of any he has directed. Even bare-bones editions of \\"The Color of Money\\" and \\"The Age of Innocence\\" are treated with more respect."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible!","review":"In any movie you have to have someone to root for. In this movie DeNiro's character is an absolute scum-bag and Minneli's character is an absolute idiot. After 30 minutes we pushed the eject button. What a terrible movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply awful","review":"A terrible movie whose only interest today is that it premiered the song \\"New York, New York\\". Liza Minnelli was already on her downward spiral when she was cast in this-and it shows. There is no chemistry between Deniro and Minnelli here and the opening scenes when Deniro spots Minnelli with her awkward, homely looks in a crowd and immediately falls for her is absurd. There is no reason for these two to be together but the movie waddles on disastrously. This movie bombd in the theatres and it is easy to see why. The supposedly show stopping finale is on of the weakest performances of the title song you will ever see. Scorcese seems to be coasting on this one. He probably knew that he had a turkey on his hand but tried to make the best of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"OBNOXIOUS DENIRO","review":"This is a 70s movie, so, it would be years later for Deniro's character to be regarded as...a stalker!!! The first 30 minutes is all about Deniro stalking Liza Minneli, with him sometimes lowering the tone of his voice to what you would expect from some would-be rapist.Almost 2 and a half hours of such psychopathic nonsense, with one great tune, and lots of cocaine-fueled (?) direction from Martin Score Sleazy (at least one tell all has noted Score Sleazy being on coke in the 70s).This movie was a major flop when first released---and for good reason. A lot of Score Sleazy movies have been box office flops, partly due to Deniro being so annoying in some of them. Deniro only got a mass audience when he played second fiddle to some less annoying actor in comedies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor image quality","review":"Had already the dvd and got the blue ray thinking that it be much better than the dvd.

He's an absolutely horrendous human being in every single scene. (Honestly, Hannibal Lechter is more likeable than this guy...at least Hannibal had some charm and an occasional sense of humor.:)Liza Minnelli is wonderful, however, as is the set design, cinematography and music.

It seems obvious to me where the original idea ended and the extra stuff was added to make this novel length. It's this extra atuff that makes this book so bad though. The premise is great- a mysterious Apollo rocket launches itself monthly from Florida soon after Neil Armostrong dies. The main characters of the story investigate this and I am finding myself enjoying this book very much. I am thinking, \\"Heh-heh, I have found myself a new author!\\" But then the sci-fi ends and we are treated to 200 pages of crap about psychic phenomenon. I should have seen it coming- the first 100 pages were too good; I wondered \\"What will happen now, all the good stuff happened?\\". Because of those great early pages, I forced myself to finish the book and was very unimpressed with the results.

Dont get me wrong, it serves its purpose but my major complaint is that it won't work well with the silicone cases that most people use. If you use a silicone case you either have to take it out of the case everytime you want to use the armband or try to jam it in the tiny opening that was obviously only designed to be used with a \\"naked\\" ipod. The realy laughable thing is that with all the scratching complaints with the nano apple recommends using a case, do they expect users to take the unit out of the case everytime they want to use an armband. Let me tell you this is a major pain!! I got this item as a gift otherwise I probably would have bought a silicone case that doubles as an armband (ie. has a slot in the back for a strap).

I work out quite a bit with the nano and the band comes off multiple times during my workout.

The Nano is small so almost anything will hold it, including a rubber band and an envelope which is about as good as this unit.This looks more like the freebie armband that should come free with the unit. Certainly not a [...] accessory. It just cheapens the Apple image.If OEM Apple products are your thing, then go ahead and try this.

I'm glad to see that it finally came out on DVD, but since we've waited so long for this DVD to come out, you would think this delay was caused because they wanted to put together some kind of documentary before releasing it. But there are no special features whatsoever on this DVD.I was hoping that we would, at least, get to see the Vic Morrow story since he died while filming this movie back in 1983. Plus maybe a good documentary on Rod Serling and all that inspired the making of this film. All us classic Twilight Zone fans would have expected that.

A high budget remake of stories from the original Twilight Zone does not get better simply because they are done with newer equipment and effects - sorry.Three of the four tales are, as I mentioned, remakes from the original television show (\\"Kick the Can\\", \\"It's a Good Life\\" and \\"Nightmare at 20,000 Feet\\"). While the 1959/60/61 shows were good, these suffer in comparison. The fourth was an original (thank the stars for at least some originality!) featuring Vic Morrow as a bigot who is hurled into the lives of those he hates most.This movie could and should have been a monument to a series which has weathered more than 40 years and is still fresh (and popular) today. Instead, it just falls flat.Recommend you bypass this movie and simply buy the original television series by Rod Serling on DVD. You'll be much happier with them.~P~"},{"rating":"1","title":"These filmmakers just don't understand The Twilight Zone!","review":"What a waste. All those talented filmmakers and the end result is a poor excuse for hommage. The remakes show a remarkable lack of understanding what Rod Serling did with his grand series. The Twilight Zone did not use cloying sentimentality to tell more whimsical fantasies (the \\"Kick the Can\\" remake) and it did not use bug-eyed monsters and outlandish visuals to tell a story. On the Twilight Zone incredible things happened to ordinary people in ordinary surroundings: that was what sold the drama and made it effective. The Ackroyd/Brooks teaser is amusing, particularly the comparison of the Twilight Zone with that other classic anthology, The Outer Limits, but it is definitely not a Twilight Zone moment. A pity Spielberg, Dante, Landis and Miller didn't actually review the series in order to understand what Rod Serling was saying. Even the mediocre episodes of Serling's other anthology series, Night Gallery, are more entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unimaginative . . .","review":"This movie is a dismal attempt to recapture the classic tv series.

There are several cameos in each story and a big leading star in each tale. The first story is of a man tired of the racial diversity in the US, where he then finds himself leading the life of a Jewish man in Nazi Germany, a black man caught in the KKK tribe and another. The second is a good story of a retirement home that finds youth in its heart after becoming children again and finding that it is not worth staying young. The third is a twist on the original tale of a boy who's wishes come true as an unknowing women looking for adventure was lured in by the child. The final story is of the Gremlin on the wing of a plane as John Lithgow plays the sole man who sees the monster ripping up the plane. With this performance you can put John Lithgow in an empty room with a window and it would still be just as terrifying from the way he conveys what is out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Second Time Around","review":"I saw this movie long ago and it was just as good the second time as it was the first.

I had watched the beginning before, but soon abandoned it. I thoroughly dislike Italian westerns made in Spain, especially by Sergio Leone. Spain is not the American west, which is an interest in itself. The trains are European design and are badly phonied-up in a paltry attempt to make them look like 19th century American ttrains, as though no one would notice. Any substantrial buildings are nothing like what would be found in the U.S.A. Those westerns fall short because they fall apart."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Fly scene is priceless","review":"Great Movie, Classic western, The Fly scene with Jack Elam is priceless , one of the best scenes in movie making history.

I would rate it the #2 best Western of all time, right behind Unforgiven.

Incredibly shot, with the atmospheric Morricone score. The opening shot is still the longest single tracking shot in movie history. When Leone was filming it he had the actual score played on loud speakers as it was filmed.Detailed characters, weathered faces and a finale which leaves you breathless... Bring it out on dvd with digital sound PLEASE!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mythical; good almost beyond belief","review":"Once Upon a Time in the West is a mythical masterwork by one of the greatest and most creative film technicians ever, Leone. The film is good almost beyond belief. The characters, the scenery, the music, even the dialogue is mythical - everyday people just don't talk like the main characters talk in this story - it is more like poetry. Early in the film, Harmonica says \\"I saw three dusters (overcoats) like that earlier today. Inside the dusters were three men. Inside the men were three bullets.\\" Or, toward the end of the film, Harmonica says \\"So, Frank, you found out that you're not a businessman after all.\\" Frank shakes his head, \\"Just a man,\\" he replies.\\"An ancient race,\\" says Harmonica, nodding. Similar to one of my favorite books, the Lord of the Rings, I am drawn back to this film every few years for another visit."},{"rating":"2","title":"ultra cool","review":"This is a fantastic film. Perhaps the best western ever made. The acting is superb all around. The cinematrography is beautiful, and Charles Bronson is super cool. The opening sequence is incredible. This film is a must for any film buff. The special collector's edition is superb. My only complaint is the audio. Sergio Leone dubbed all his audio; as a result, some scenes are not synchronozied. Hence the four stars. Still, this is a minor flaw considering how well directed this film is."},{"rating":"2","title":"A settler's story","review":"I usually check the reviews of people who have seen the film. This one however, was familliar to me because of the cast names. I like Henry Fonda in this one especially. His character he played was mean and dirty. Guns a blaze every where right from the start. All the other actors were it seemed in cameo roles. The story was interesting in that it told of a fictisious town built in the middle of no where. A good film to see and own."},{"rating":"2","title":"A \\"Once Upon a Time in the West\\" review","review":"I am a 61 year old avid horror movie fan, and the harder to find ones the better, however, I greatly enjoyed this classic western!

It will never get any better than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Sergio Leone Western Classic","review":"This is arguably the best sphagetti western out there behind the The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly. All of the four main characters all have their own agenda or goals. The story mainly focuses on Jill after her family is brutally slain by Frank (Henry Fonda), while Harmonica (Charles Bronson) has a personal vendetta against him. Then there's Cheyenne who is initially blamed for killing Jill's family, eventually all these characters bump heads with one another, leading to confrontations with one another. Thank You Sergio Leone for leaving us yet another western classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Epic Americana Al Dente","review":"The music makes up for any flaws in the picture. My oh my, how I love that opening, with the fly, the dripping water, and the wind. Bronson's harmonica is a treat, too, as are all the sounds effects. Fonda ia cold-hearted and wonderful; I hadn't remembered him as having been so slim. He walks very gracefully, with that marvelous cross-cutting. Leone must have noticed, too, because he is filmed from below to great effect. Robards is quirky, though not persuasively tough (he's too much the rogue), Claudia Cardinale is operatic and great, if not quite earthy, but Leone has this set up so that the land is the real star as it was for John Ford. I especially love the pacing which is excruciatingly slow for modern minds but just right for an old coot like me. Oddly enough, as good a movie as it is, it doesn't really have a good story. It is slow, predictable, and lacks real suspense, but it is epic, grand, operatic and memorable. Bravo."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best Westerns Ever Made.","review":"Cast, story, locations, can't ask for anything more! Had one problem with my DVD package in that the spoken dialogue was at one sound level but ALL music performed was WAY louder. I had to ride the volume control to watch this great movie, and that is not right. I can't understand how/why they could have screwed things up so much with the audio and still released it for sale. Too bad that they are not forced to have recalls for product problems that are this bad.

Once Upon A Time In The West was incredibly disappointing for me. I wondered why I'd never seen it on TV. After I saw it I knew why. It's too slow too long the motive is weak, the characters have no chemistry and unlike the TGTB&TU the dialog is unmemorable.

However, I need to know what the actual ratio of this new DVD is--2.35:1 or (blech) 1.77:1.I once attended a screening of this which turned out to be 16 mm 1.33:1 and I and almost all the audience demanded and got our money back.Amazon would do well to clarify this. They are going to lose a lot of potential customers or have tons of returns if this DVD is 1.77:1.

You could achieve the same effect laying on your back on a windy cloudy day telling a story from the shapes you see in the clouds. The only difference is that you wouldn't feel like your time was justified. The main failure occurred at the script stage. The characters' behavior often contradicts their own motivations.

And I love westerns, pretty much anything with John Wayne or Clint Eastwood is gold. Hell, I even love most of the cheap spaghetti westerns but this film SUCKED!!! Every damn scene is drawn out till it's completely dead and dried up. It's ten minutes of silence and camera panning then two minutes of talking then ten minutes of silence and panning again.

Its unfortunate that many movie buffs have no idea about this movie. Reason: Its not from your Hollywood director, but from a guy in Italy who I think is the best when it came to the westerns. Sergio Leone may have been labeled making 'Spagetti Westerns', but in my opinion he made the 'real westerns'.

Evoking wonderful imagery of period Japan, the author also has a masterful sense of tension, action and purpose with his characters.

I have never found a bra that supports & keeps the girls in their proper place like this bra does! I have been converted for life! According to Le Mystere's size chart I ordered a 40G & it fits perfectly. My shirts fit better & it really does make you look longer & leaner because your chest is where it's suppose to be. I ordered the Nude color and will be ordering more...Even if they're not on sale! It's worth it for the best bra!

The bras that arrived were not the same. The cup came up way too high on the outside and dug into my armpit and the straps were about about 1 12\\" further out the shoulder so they kept falling off. I ended up sending the rest back. I assume that le Mystere changed the design but I don't know which design was older and which was newer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Redesigned style not the original Dream Tisha","review":"For some strange reason Le Mystere decided to redesign the Dream Tisha. This is the redesigned version which has flimsy cups with no shape. So, if you are looking for the original Dream Tisha with the molded cups that keep their distinctive shape, this is not it. Shame on Le Mystere for ruining a great product. Very disappointed.Also, Amazon needs to take more care in how they ship bras. These bras arrived crushed and indented, there was nothing in there to keep the bra's shape and prevent them from getting damaged."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bra is too thick and weirdly shaped","review":"I ordered this bra because I needed a t-shirt bra. However, I ordered the smallest band size they had available and it was still too large. I have a small band size of 28 so I will have to continue ordering bras from the UK as they carry beautiful bras with small band sizes for slender women who have D+ cups sizes. I just found a t-shirt bra on Figleaves.com and ordered a couple. I am waiting to receive them and hope they fit well.Besides being too large, this bra was very thick and oddly shaped. It also pushed my breasts up way to high and my breast tissue didn't fill the cup. This bra looks like a piece of sculpture as it is so moulded that the bra looks like breasts are already inside it. The bra cups stand erect on their own. :) If you like that type of shape then go for it.However, if you are slender with a small band size this bra is probably not the one for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"difficult to find a proper fit","review":"I really wanted to love this bra. Finding bras that are supportive when your full figured is difficult, not to mention expensive. I was fitted for this bra before I bought it, but the store didn't have my size so I started looking for the bra online. I ordered exactly the size that I was fitted for, received my two bras, and the fit was terrible. The bra is too tight, and the cups don't fit. I'm not spilling out over the sides of the bra, usually the first indicator that the bra doesn't fit, there's all this extra material in the center of the cup.Aside from my fitting problems there are two other problems with this bra I'd like to point out. Being full figured there are two things necessary to support bigger chests. First, a bra band that is wide and has four hooks on it, this bra does not have that. Second, you need wide, supportive straps, again this bra does not have wide enough straps. There are better bras out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good service and product","review":"It is a great bra and Nordstrom did not currently have my size - I ordered and got it in the mail within days."},{"rating":"1","title":"New updated style does not fit as well as original style.","review":"Purchased the dream tisha 9955 two years ago.....havent found another to match the fit and comfort. Looked to purchase additional bras and found that the new style DOES NOT fit as well. The bra specialist informed me that the company changed the style to fit better. I DISAGREE. The specialist admitted also that this improved bra has not worked for many of their customers. I wish I would have purchased more than the one bra at the time - no matter what the cost. I have not found a bra that fit as well as this one has. I'm sorry the new and improved hasnt worked for me....."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't fix what wasn't broken","review":"I bought the dream tisha several years ago and fell in love, rushed to buy three more. Since my original purchase, they have changed the fit. I'm a natural 34D, with narrow/small shoulders...the straps are now too long on this bra and even at the smallest adjustment, there is no lift, \\"the girls\\" merely rest in the cups. I even went to be resized, to make sure I had not changed, it was not me, it's the bra. I'm very disappointed as this was a fantastic bra that gave lift and minimized at the same time, now I have to search for another brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"big disappointment","review":"I bought this bra because of Oprah's nod to the product. However, this bra is a minimizing bra. It mushes you until you look like you have a small overly padded chest. The worst part is the quality. I bought this bra less than a year ago and on both sides, under the arms the fabric has \\"split\\". On both sides the seams tear out. Now I have to admit, I do not always wash my bra's as recommended, sometimes they get thrown in with the wash however I do not wash them daily. I really was looking for a high quality bra for a full figure. This may be for a full figured person but it does not flatter. A plain old wonderbra in a large size works better. At least you look pretty and not like you are wearing armor under your shirt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Shape","review":"I've always been on the thin side (size 4) with a larger chest (34D). I'm not the type of girl who likes to showcase her bust, so I used to only wear minimizers, that is until I met Le Mystere's Dream Tisha bra. This bra is wonderful. It lifts, locks, and loads the girls. My chest looks good in almost any outfit I wear. Now I never have to worry about looking too heavy or busty because the bra does the work for me. On the down side, you have to hand wash the bra and if you perspire as much as I do, the bra does stain easily. But that still does not lessen my love for this bra. If you want great shape and great fit, then definitely buy this bra!"},{"rating":"2","title":"works for me","review":"I have been wearing this bra for over 10 years. construction has changed somewhat, not as finely finished.

I thought it was just a rare occurence, but I bought a couple more of these bras and the same thing happened everytime. They cost way too much money to only get two or three wears out of them. I am so disappointed in the quality of the underwire."},{"rating":"2","title":"An awesome bra!","review":"I am busty woman and have always struggled with good fitting bras. The straps were always either slipping off my shoulders, or digging in. One of my friends talked me into splurging for what I thought was a very over priced bra at Nordstroms. As soon as I was properly fitted and put it on, I found myself in bra heaven! In 50 years, I never knew wearing a bra could feel so good. I purchased three without batting an eye at the price and after about 18 mos., I'm purchasing three more. I doubt I will ever wear another bra.A word on band size, it's true what the other reviews are saying, you'll want to go up a band size on this one. Also the larger cups have wider straps (about 1\\") than the smaller cups. I wear an F... I believe the narrower straps (about 1/2\\") are on the E cups and smaller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deception","review":"I have been buying this Mystère 9955 for at least 3 years now. This last purchase was low quality. Same model but material changed and the width of the straps is a lot thinner. I bought two in the same purchase and both bras were not exactly the same. VERY deciving when we think we are paying for quality!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unflattering shape, bad fit","review":"I wear a 32F (same as 32DDD) in the Le Mystere Isabella:Le Mystere Women's Isabella Memory Foam Bra - 2535I'm generally a small DDD, so I ordered two sizes, 32E and 32F, to be sure I go the right fit. Unfortunately, I did not.The 32E was too small on my breasts, and though my breasts filled the cups, they also bulged out the top when I lifted my arms.The 32F fully encased my breasts, but the cups had a bit of extra material in the bottom when I \\"scooped and swooped\\" my breasts into the tip of the cup.Also, even when the straps were properly adjusted, the shape of the bra pointed DOWNWARD! I don't mind having some classic pointy sweater kittens, but when they point downward, it's very unflattering. It could be because I'm only 19 and rather perky for my size, so my breasts are less malleable than some breasts. Still, I'm very disappointed with this bra, and I don't think it's a good style for many people."},{"rating":"1","title":"no thanks","review":"I really really wanted to love this bra because of all of the great reviews. Although it is true that it is best to try on bras before you buy them, and get a professional fitting, I wear a 36DD in every brand that I have tried on at a store, and I own dozens of bras from various makers, but this bra is the first one that is too small for me around the band. So, I bought a bra \\"extender\\" but then had a second problem --I am 5'3\\" and a little short-waisted and the hard sides of the bra poke me under my arms and distract me all day. It does \\"lift\\" tremendously well, but I don't understand why this brand doesn't size their bands accurately."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this bra!!","review":"I purchased this bra in the store and loved it so much I had to buy more.

My go-to bra is all worn out and it needed replaced. I'm currently wearing a bra a size smaller than I should, because I cannot find one that fits. I've been fitted for a 36DDD and a 36F/G in the past. So, I thought that a 36F would be my best bet here. This is not the case. It fits so poorly, the underwire dug into my armpit and I had a severe case of \\"double boob\\". I guess this one will be sent back and I'll have to find another one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't fit right","review":"I ordered this in a 36G and a 36H. (I know I'm a 36H; I've been professionally fitted). The fitting on this bra is all wrong. The 36G was too small (\\"quad boob\\") but the 36H was too big and gaps at the top and sides. I am short waisted and have more of the \\"tear drop\\" shape so I think it's just not the best style if you're shaped like that. It rides high so the wires are right there on the underarms and you can't lower the straps too much. Too bad it got lots of good reviews so I was hoping it would work.One thing about Amazon is they are wonderful and easy at returns and shipping so I highly recommend ordering thru them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Durable, but too bulky, Runs Large","review":"It seemed to be made to last, very durable. Yet this makes for a very large bulky bra. It was hard to move in and was not very appealing to the eyes. It is practical and not pretty at all. The cup sizes run large, so I returned it and got another style from the same company that fit a bit better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good fit","review":"I've worn these bras for years - pretty much the only ones that give me the support I need.

The sizing has definitely changed resulting in the band being way too snug and the cups too small.(In the spring I ordered one of the same size worn for many years. It was way too small..in all aspects. I then ordered a size up, and it too, is too small.) The straps also do not adjust as much as my previous bras.I don't know that I will repeat this purchase which is VERY disappointing after having been such a loyal consumer for so many years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful for E cup!","review":"This bra is so great it is supportive and hold you in all the right places. I also bought the Tech fit one and that one is great too. I usually wear VS bras and was measured as a 34dd very hard to find in stores, it was great to find it on here. The only issue I have had was washing it, it says by hand which can be hard to do, mine went through the wash once and it did seem to stretch it out a bit. Still worth it!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Boulders Beware","review":"The manufacturer shouldn't make this bra in larger sizes. The straps are too flimsy for someone with my size (42H).

I agree w/ other comments re: sizing - One does not order whatever might be your regular size. It's good that shipping is free because of the questionable fitting. However, I can see how this bra would be comfortable once a gal has correct size. I am thinking of reordering to try different size. But in the meantime, they've lost a sale. When trying to exchange for different size, it was indicated that these HAD to be returned for REFUND ONLY, not exchange. I don't understand that reasoning since the company has lost out on an order. Seems to me they'd want to keep customer(s) by allowing exchange. That's the first time I've ever encountered the total return practice within a business."},{"rating":"1","title":"Runs small","review":"I purchased a size 44, the bra extended on reached 32 inches, either it was sized in error or these run extremely small.

These bras are in the range of 50+$ and are not worth the money. I was measured at Macy's just before ordering and they were of course the wrong size. I reordered and the smaller bra is still the incorrect size! They are incorrectly sized, painful in the armpits, the cups look crinkled and not smooth and the straps slide off constantly, no matter what the tension setting is.

The fabric and construction were nice, hence the two stars; however, I had to return it because it was not true to size, and the straps were enormous! Not only were they almost as wide as my shoulders, they are padded and puffy! I tried it on under a sweater, not even a T-shirt, and they popped through the fabric. If you order up in size, and don't need to wear tailored clothes, I can see the appeal of this bra. But... if you don't have the shoulder-span of a Chicago football team half-back, and actually like your clothes to fit, and your over-the-shoulder-boulder-holder to not show through, this is NOT the bra for you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't Fit","review":"Due to my breast shape this bra didn't fit well.

It's as easy as pie to know the difference...this year's model does not have a fabric sizing tag attached.

(yes, puns intentional!) Read it, learn, and grow healthy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Poetic mix of styles","review":"Cade does weave a good spell here. He's got a nice emotional baritone and the songs are mystical, spiritual, brooding. The melodies are haunting, for the most part and lyrics very intelligent (refreshing for a change). Trip-hop bits here and there, some folkish overtones, hip-hop back beats, and even some Celtic. It's great night music. very thoughtful and rich. The Bluehawk story-song is a classic -- not wuite sure what it's about, other than Native American indians and oppression, all set to a stark hip hop groove. Nice mix. Aquero is another standout, as is the first track and heaven Blue. All My Heart is a hymn, or a love song, but very laid-back and gentle. A striking first album. I'd like to see what he does with a future project. This record made me very emotional for som reason."},{"rating":"1","title":"clamps","review":"These replacement clamps are poor quality and difficult to set up.

I should have read the other negative reviews before picking this book up. It is not humorous, not informative, and is a complete bore.

If you're looking for a basic text on lathe operations, this is probably as good as any from the mid 1900s. It is certainly better than Audel's, for example, and on par with the 1950s texts that I inherited.If you're looking for a book that discusses current machine shop practice, I'd look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best reference books I have...","review":"These two volumes tell me more than the other 7 or 8 books on machine shop that I have.

The engineering, materials, and physics information applicable to running common machining operations is covered. Formulas which explain how to choose what speed to run a tool at are covered.

Be sure to buy both volumes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but dated","review":"Overall this is a very good book. This moderately experienced home shop machinist definitely learned from it. I have only read volume 1. The only gripe I have is that despite the copyright date the text and especially the photos are very dated. More 50's and 60's than the 1981 copyright date. That's OK for the most part, but there is no discussion any modern machinery, I think DROs got about two paragraphs.

Especially insightful are the chapters that deal with the regular folk: Understanding the Non-Creative Mind, Chicken Public vs. the Avant-Garde, and True Happiness: The Flawed System That Destroys Weaker Minds.

It is the struggle between the evil and good of a dark witch and a white witch in old England. These witches are really almost ordinary women caught in the times they live in where the dark witch is old and filled with the dark thoughts that life can bring while the white witch looks towards the light. There is a struggle between their forces which one can see as how life is without understanding and reaching out between people. Elizabeth Goudge wrote with that wonderful sense that gives you the taste, touch, feel, and vision of how things must have been. I would love to read this book again as well as others she wrote. I hope her books will be rediscoverd as Edith Whartons were and republished for future generations to enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Froniga Rocks!","review":"I've loved this book since I first read it, ca. 1980. I was 17 at the time; and yet, at 47, I find I still glean new insights from Goudge's writing. I particularly enjoy Froniga's use of herbs, and the respect for the healing power of plants that comes through in many, if not all, of Goudge's novels. This is also a portrait of a woman who chose to live unconventionally (and successfully did so) in a time when independent women were discouraged, to put it mildly.

I did not think that a book on business could be so entertaining, but this WAS and will definitely help me in my future endeavors. Steiner's stories are entertaining and really help to get his valuable points across.

Having the stories about the sports stars interwoven into the text made it a lot of fun and is a great way to illustrate the principal being discussed.

I've even taken some of the of bullets from the chapter reviews and put them on a bulletin board at work to motivate the group of employees I manage at Boeing.

Some may complain it is lurid. It is lurid. The facts are lurid and disgusting, in terms not only of sexual behavior but also in terms of the heretical inclinations of too many seminaries. Michael Rose has told the truth. He deserves our thanks. I llok forward to his next book and intend to catch up on his previous works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shocking, but is it true? And why is it so repetitive?","review":"I knew seminaries were in trouble, but are they this bad?I am pondering the priesthood, and a friend of mine handed me this to warn me about what I might encounter. He wants me prepared to survive it. However, the vocations director of my diocese says things aren't nearly as bad as Rose portrays them, and Rose rarely uses the names of seminarians who gave him this information.Also, the book repeats a lot of stuff he mentioned earlier.Rose talks about how the vocation shortage is contrived, orthodox diocese like Atlanta and Lincoln do not have this problem, and how those in charge do little to stop the rampent heresy and homosexuality in the seminaries."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing new","review":"Corruption in the Catholic church is nothing new.

To those who know the Catholic Church has seen massive infiltration by Judeo Masonic forces from the top down, this book will only surprise at how far down the rot is now extending.His conclusions seem to rely on the \\"New Springtime\\" and \\"Civilization of Love\\" offered by Vatican II. This is faulty if we are to believe our own senses which indicate that we are in the dead of winter, not a \\"new springtime.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Vatican II a Liberal Disaster","review":"Michael Rose exposes the last years 37 years since the close of Vatican II as a liberal disaster for the Roman Church. One example of the disaster is the homosexual scandal now being exposed. The bishops of the U.S. have allowed and encouraged this behavior. Those found guilty should all resign in mass. The National Conference of Catholic Bishops is a forum to undermine the Catholic faith by it's silence on these issues and establishing the liberal agenda that has supposedly passed as Catholicism for the last several decades."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anecdotes","review":"I am not a Catholic, and I had no ax to grind when I took up Rose's book, simply a curiosity spurred by the latest, well-publicized Church scandals. But how disappointing a book this is. Someone once said that the plural of anecdotes is not statistics, i.e., selected anecdotes don't make a case, and this book is, from beginning to end, entirely anecdotal, consisting of the recounting of unhappy experiences of disgruntled former seminarians. What they say may very well be true; I would bet that it is, but it should be clear to any reader that, depending on the seminarians Rose, or anyone else, chose, any case at all could be made. In my view, he has produced very weak evidence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Read.","review":"If you are Catholic and wonder what in the world is happening in your Church you MUST read this book. You will begin to understand why you have Parish Priests who do not believe the faith, preach a protestant version of the faith, push for Homosexual marriage, female priests, married priests, and every other heresy you can imagine. You will understand why the mass was destroyed, children at Catholic schools are not learning the faith and people have left the Catholic Church in droves. Reading this book was so disturbing I was having nightmares about the evil that permeates the Church walls. We must fight this evil in the Church, stand up for the One True Faith and push out the evil.This book is great Investigative journalism something which we sorely lack in our media today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish Fulfillment","review":"In reading this book, I was never able to escape the intellectual impression that Rose had started with a preselected premise he wished to support and then sought out 'evidence' to prove his theory. As a hard-line conservative, he appears to long for the 'old days' when the RCC was the only game in town and wielded absolute power.The descriptions and personal accounts are so blatantly sensationalize as to be comical. The overwhelming power of the 'homosexual agenda' is laughable in so many ways, as it is magnified to biblical proportions as to offer a fitting adversary to the Church. All in all, the book is a propaganda piece meant to absolve Church Leadership from any responsibility for its failings.In the past the RCC burned its scapegoats at the stake. Now, they write books about them."},{"rating":"1","title":"What about intellectual curiosity?","review":"I am a Catholic who does not share Rose's views. I find today's new priests to be as conservative as ever; it is usually the middle-aged and older priests who are a bit more liberal.Also, what if the point of the psychological exams and other questions posed to prospective seminarians is not to determine whether they are liberal or conservative, or whether they are \\"orthodox\\" or not. Maybe the seminaries seek out \\"progressive\\" students who will be challenged by the Church's traditionally conservative positions on such issues as abortion, women priests, birth control and homsexuality? Couldn't the point of the questions be to pick out intellectually curious students who are capable of critical thinkging rather than to fill the seminary with students who already agree with 100% of the Magisterium before having even entered the seminary?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Author's agenda is clearly un-Christian","review":"For an author who is so convinced that the Catholic church has abandoned Christian principles, Mr. Rose evidently has not read the Bible. He attacks the church for practicing love.Mr. Rose's agenda is clear. He wants to dehumanize gay persons, simple as that, and he wants to promote his own political agenda, making it appear unreligious to not share his ideas. His obsession with trying to convince people that all gays are \\"evil\\" is downright ludicrous and pathetic.We can do without such poorly-supported, obviously biased and hate-based books. Where is the Christianity??"},{"rating":"1","title":"Crazy People","review":"I am not a Catholic or a Christian. I read this book, among others, to try to understand why the Catholic Church is self-desructing. Now I can understand why. Everyone in the book is crazy. The liberal theologians who the author claims now run the seminaries are crazy. The orthodox priests the author is defending are crazy. No one, especially the author, seems to realize that the weird activity in which these various groups of people are engaged is masking the fact that they have completely forgotten what the search for the Divine is all about. Their only interest seems to be in form, not substance. They go through the motions, say the magic words, turn the crank, and out pops God! They have made it so easy! And so completely empty and meaningless. I hope God isn't as rigid, uninspired, and brain dead as these people seem to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Controversial at best","review":"One wonders at the accuracy of this portrayal.

Rose is a lunatic who wrote a crappy book. It doesn't make sense. How can you blame liberals for all the problems in the Catholic Church. The Catholic Church has no one else to blame but themselves. It's not the liberal's fault if a priest molests a child. The Catholic Church has no one to point to but themselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where were the editors?","review":"Michael Rose's editors need to call him in for a little exercise in accountability. The \\"facts\\" here are about as dependable as an Arthur Andersen audit. Even the conservative Catholic press has noticed the lack of journalistic integrity. Not that they disagree with his viewpoint or his conclusions, just that they are not based in the \\"reality\\" presented in this book. The truth will set us free, so let's have some truth, not grinding of axes or belaboring of agendas."},{"rating":"1","title":"No depth, no substance","review":"This book does a great disservice to any real dialogue or discussion about the crisis in leadership the Catholic church is facing. It is ultimately a hateful book more interested in creating bogeymen then facing painful issues of hierocracy and faith.For a well balanced examination of this subject and others facing the Catholic church please read Garry Wills \\"Papal Sin\\". Rather than blaming liberals and gays let us look deeply at a church and a leadership that has often been steadfastly unwilling to be honest about much of its history and its doctrine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Goodbye Good Men Author","review":"The research Micheal S. Rose has done on this subject appears to be quite thorough. I am not too shocked about what is going on today in the seminaries. Vatican II has initiated a new church, which is certainly not Catholic. I cannot believe that with all the research Mr. Rose has done, that he is so blind as to what is really going on. He states that one day JPII will be a saint. JPII is resposible for the crisis in the Church today. Does Mr. Rose recall JPII making the public statement as to what a great man Matin Luther was. Luther was one of the greatest heretics that ever lived. Did he forget when JPII was in India and put cow dung on his forehead? The poor men who were ordained after Vatican II, don't realize that they are NOT priests, because of the changes to the ordination rites which are not valid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunately not the whole truth","review":"Someone described this book as lurid - it is. In fact it is quite disgusting in parts to read about so many strange relationships that priests get involved in. However, Rose is not addressing the whole issue here. There are as many heterosexual priests who engage in relationships with women, and some even have children with them. Is this a better situation? I don't think so, but Rose does not mention this. These heterosexual relationships are also 'secret' and frequently abusive. The problem for the Catholic Church is celibacy, not liberals. Rose wants to put across his own agenda, and he does, but he does not want to address the whole truth. No mention is made of the damage to the priesthood by the abuse of women by many priests who cut and run when the going gets tough. Rose and others like him who still want to contain the entire truth will ultimately do more damage than good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Roseneedsto go to confession","review":"This book contains lies. One of the students that claims to have been thrown out of the American college at Louvain due to his orthodoxy simply could not handle the course work. He flunked out, and then came up with this slander to cover his failure. Rose is such a poor scholar that he never checked it out. The publisher refuses to defend the author, and has formally apologizd to the university.Isn't it odd that academically challenging universities are accused of being liberal (or some other supposed sin) by those who are to stupid to actually attend?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book","review":"I would recommend this book to those who want to know why the Catholic Church is in the state that it is. The communist infiltration has worked it's way into the seminaries to destroy the Church from within. It looks like most of the seminaries have either homosexuals or masonic 33rd degree masters running these places and allowing every sin in the book to be committed by the seminarians, who are not really interested in becoming true priests. Those that have morals and do want to become true priests are either not allowed to join or are given a hard time and are forced to adhere to some of the unethical practices encouraged there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting insight into the Catholic church of today","review":"Sad, but very possibly true, how the seminaries go from one extreme to the other in terms of philosophy. Talks about why the new wave of priest is coming out more conservative, as in contrast to the more liberal priest of a few years ago. How some good men can't fit into the mold and leave the seminary. Eye opening. Interesting reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"the Firekeeper","review":"An excellent, well writtten and informative book.Could not put it down untill finished"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"If you think the natural world is boring, buy this book! It can serve as either a reference or a source of countless hours of enjoyable reading. The phenomena described are eerie, fantastic, or simply weird, and all of them are interesting. The book illustrates beyond doubt how far we have to go before we completely understand what happens on this planet.. An example, ball lightning has been observed for many centuries, even photos exist, but only recently has a complete scientific explanation been forwarded. Mainstream science has indeed overlooked many of these phenomena, whether because of their rarity and the consequent lack of data, their sheer multitude, or fear that they might be associated with fringe paranormal groups (this book clearly isn't).

This shoe has worked wonderfully, providing excellent support and accommodating my custom orthotic insole. I no longer have any foot pain and walk several miles every day.This is my second pair of Propet Stability Walkers, and I've found that the second pair had really LOUD squeaking when I walked (due to the orthotics rubbing against the inside of the shoe).

Essentially, this album gets better as you listen to it. Aside from \\"Shame On You ... To Keep My Love From Me,\\" I like \\"Ideal World.\\" Andrea has a flare for making the mundane seem tragic - and that mirrors reality. The mundane IS tragic because a thing that never changes never grows or becomes more than it is. The song is deceptive; it sounds upbeat when it discusses subjects that are not pretty.But, this review is not an analysis of the songs, so I apologize. If you give this album a chance, the tunes are catchy and infectious. Her voice is so pleasant that it's hard not to love her."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Wrong Direction","review":"Andrea, I'll follow wherever you go. Always. However painful. And this is painful.

So when I heard that Andrea was releasing a solo lp....I couldn't wait.THEN I HEARD THE LP and was totally ruined on her. THIS IS THE REASON WHY A BAND (and her brothers direction) ARE MUCH NEEDED.

It is true that she possesses a very fine voice that can lend itself to all genres but she made some big mistakes on this album. Firstly, she should have introduced a good songwriter to collaborate with on this album instead of more or less going it alone. She seems fine as part of a 'team' but her songwriting abilities are greatly exposed on this album. Lyrically juvenile and the music seems to be propped-up with techo-beats and over-production. This young lady thrives in an acoustic setting and this is where I believe she should have went with this album.

Andrea neither developed the music of her band any further nor did she create anything that could be decribed as her style. The album has a few \\"nice\\" songs, but none of them is outstanding, touching, or really exciting, and overall the album sounds just mediocre.

If you are someone who was a Corrs fan and am considering to experience a small piece of essence of that work from this release, you will be very disappointed. Gone are the beautiful melodies of the group, the passionate solo vocal work of Andrea. Perhaps it is the new direction/genre she has taken, electro pop/whatever, but in the Corrs work it seemed as Andrea was required to stretch her vocals, or maybe the subject matter of Ireland's struggles assisted to provide a better vocal platform.

I guess it's a testament to Price when I say that the Rocco Klein of his novel felt more lifelike, more deeply conflicted, and more rounded than Keitel's Klein seemed on screen.I found it irritating that there were certain surreal elements added to the script which seemed to compromise the grittiness of the story. The additions didn't make the movie funnier, they just made it strange.As a side note, less than ten years old, the soundtrack already seems incredibly dated.Don't even rent this one, go read it.

Strike is a young dealer living in a dangerous and claustrophobic neighborhood, and as he becomes more involved with some bad influences his problems start to increase and leaving him in a difficult situation.Director Spike Lee uses a typical murder mystery to offer some insight into this NY community, showcasing their connections and relations. There are some stylish and edgy camera angles, the acting is generally convincent and the characters complex enough (even if a bit stereotyped), but the movie is ultimately too long, the pacing slow, the plot unsurprising, the score melodramatic and the ending a bit weak and forced.So, despite some good moments, \\"Clockers\\" could have been more developed and edgier, since most of the picture offers nothing that hasn\`t been shown in some TV series out there.

They grow up together and then eventually go separate ways, both living rather messed up lives, but through it all they are searching for something to set them free. With intriguing characters like a beautiful girl with a pet crocodile and an action-packed plot depicting men's desire to destroy and men's will to live all at once, this book will keep you thinking and entertained even if you get grossed out from time to time."},{"rating":"1","title":"welllll","review":"Nobody likes a bad review but I just want to prepare you. This is the bleakest of the bleak postmodern Japanese novels (that I've read at least). It is full of senseless and predictable violence and self-destruction that all basically happens to prove a point -- people's bleak futures are determined by their haunting pasts. I give it 2 stars because the existence of this book balances out a lot of novels that ignore the illnesses in society -- poverty, violence, etc -- in modern Japan or even the world. The book is shocking, and to an extent this is good medicine. But I think it's overkill.I prefer, and recommend, Murakami Ryu's In the Miso Soup. It is shocking and violent as well, to be sure, but I feel more thought provoking, interesting, and a quicker read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ugly yet Beautiful","review":"A work of fiction that is at once lovely and harsh at times, Coin Locker Babies was the first novel at the conclusion of which i immediately returned to page 1 to read it again. The story line is pretty unpredictable, a quality I tend to enjoy about foreign novels, but the imagery is what really made me fall in love with the book. Murakami's ability to describe a scene (aided by the top-notch translation) is such that they actually appear before my eyes without effort or intention on my part. His descriptions of the thoughts and feelings of the characters is accurate to the point of being scary. His knack of drawing my mind into this world can be related to Hashi's vocal skills as he describes them. A truly stunning work. I am anticipating the release of the film version in 2008 with almost as much zeal as i have for this, my third reading of the novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"haunting","review":"it must be 7 years already since i picked this book up at kinokuniya, shinjuku. it still haunts me. that if anything is the sign of a truly great work of art."},{"rating":"2","title":"Into the Swirling Pool","review":"Murakami tells a coming of age story of two brothers in Japan, only it is not your typical coming of age, because, well, this is Japan. Radioactive and perverse, this tale of two brothers is both crazy and beautiful. Murakami's description is vivid in detail, like looking into a swirling pool of colors, though the novel does not seem to have a point. It just builds upon one stunning description after another, until all of a sudden, the swirling pool of colors comes to a halt. Perhaps this is what people are always talking about when they refer to post-modern literature. Despite the fact that Coin Locker Babies seems to operate by stream of consciousness, it is an astonishing read and I could not put it down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dismal","review":"I join others who did not care for this book.

Their last album, as great as itwas, was their least successful in many years, and the rocklandscape was far less hospitable to the band than ever before.So Mogg, Simpson, Gray and Atomic Tommy shrugged and got downto business with this mini-album. This cd is a scorcher. UFOhadn't rocked this hard in years, and the performances areevery bit as amazing as anything the band would ever do.Sadly, \\"Ain't Misbehavin\\" was even less popular than\\"Misdemeanor\\", selling to the hardcore fans and not even beingnoticed by anyone else. It proved to be the final releasefrom this lineup, as when the next UFO slab finallyappeared four years later Mogg had again reorganised the band.UFO never put out substandard work, and \\"Ain't Misbehavin\\" canproudly stand alongside the rest of their amazing catalog."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm feelin' tragic...","review":"Man talk about if at first you don't succeed....After the vinyl debacle that was \`Misdemeanor', Phil Mogg waited about two years or so and once again dragged UFO's name through the mud with a minor atrocity called \`Ain't Misbehavin''. Even the record company must have thought this was a mistake because it was only a six-song EP that was barfed out in early '88. No Pete Way or Andy Parker; not even Paul Raymond, Paul Chapman or Neil Carter could have saved Phil from this dreck. The music on the EP is \`80's hair metal at its most keyboard driven, radio friendly and totally devoid of soul, class or cajones. I hate this period of UFO, talk about dark times man.

This is OK if you like AOR with \\"Between a Rock and a Hard Place\\" being the best track on offer. For a trademark UFO album Schenker on guitar is a bonus but you must have the song writing combo and performance crunching backbone of Phil Mogg and Pete Way. Thank goodness these two got back together to create the trademark sound again on \\"High Stakes\\" and the other later UFO and Mogg/Way albums which are all significantly better.

Upon reflection, the content of the book isn't bad, but it just is not a book of games, for the most part.The book is a list of snippets of advice, recipes, activities, and yes, some games. The items are organized by the age range being targeted, so presumably you can use it as a reference for ideas as your child grows.Because of this organization, the early pages are completely devoid of anything like games (because newborns are generally too young to play, I guess).The book would rate 3 stars if it was titled something like \\"Random Ideas For Parents of Smart Babies\\", although honestly, I would lose the whole \\"Smart\\" thing altogether, because most of the book has little to do with mental exercise, as far as I can tell."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont bother...","review":"The stuff in this book is not worth keeping on your shelf.

The blu ray transfer is beautiful, and I got it here on amazon for a great price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Underrated showcase of scary-zany Burtonland","review":"This is definitely a guilty pleasure. As often as I think I'm not supposed to be liking this film, I can't help it. The cast is what does makes this a solid and rewatchable vehicle. It also has the steady feel of a Burton film, with great production values and a great sense of its own ability to frighten and delight all at the same time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice!","review":"I love this movie! It is probably one of the best movies ever made, written, acted, and filmed.Tim Burton, is literally, a genius. To create such a dark, gothic world in this film, with great dark humor, and great charactets must have been funDanny Elfman even brings more spirit to this movie as the composer. Some of his most famous composed songs are in here (The Beetlejuice theme).Winona Ryder does a terrific job as the sad, gothic daughter Lydia, who has to move with her parents to the country. Her parents don't understand her, no one does, until she sees ghosts in the house. THe previous owners, by the way, want these people OUT! So they find a bio-excorcist named Beetlejuice to help them.10 out of 10! A perfect movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"This movie is amazing! I remember dressing up like Beetlejuice when i was 6, simply because I was (and am still) so fond of the movie. Despite what some may think or say, everyone fit their role perfectly. I highly doubt you could find anyone better to play the main role of \\"Beetlejuice\\" or Lydia. Tim Burton's my favourite producer, and I think his creative, dark, and twisted characters are awesome! (like the ones in nightmare before christmas - my other fav movie) Anyway, my point is I give \\"Beetlejuice\\" 5 out of 5 stars!!!!!!-Anne"},{"rating":"1","title":"CUT!!!","review":"I was very dissappointed to receive this video and find that several scenes were cut!

Recently I bought the regular PG version on DVD at my mom's store. The first thing i noteced was that the disc was double sided! about halfway thru I had to flip the disc over to watch the rest of the movie. and another thing: It was censored. I don't mean just the \\"violence\\" i mean language. Then I bought the PG-13 version hoping for a better verson. Instead I found out it was the same thing, just with a different cover. So i reccomend you buy the VHS.Trust me, it sucks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wierd,Hilarious,the best movie ive ever seen!","review":"Beetlejuice is the best movie ive ever seen because i love wierd movies like also:\\"The Shining\\",\\"Hellraiser\\",\\"IT\\",and also \\"House on Haunted Hill.But \\"Beetlejuice\\" is wierd and hilarious and strange.I hope Tim Burton does not make a sequel because they usually ruin the movie.If i ever see \\"Edward Sizzor Hands\\" I just know it wont be better than this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disappointing soundtrack","review":"I bought this DVD with the idea that since the soundtrack was redone, it was just going to blow me away, especially the Day-O scene. I agree with the Widescreen review of this DVD on the sound quality. I didn't find the soundtrack that impressive unlike some others done in 5.1 format. The picture quality, however, did make up for some of the soundtrack disappointments."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forgot how funny this was.","review":"Being a child of the 70\\"s / 80\\"s I am now collecting movies from that era.

This movie is so hilariously cheesy it's irresistable. The soundtrack is great, and the kids always jump up to dance along with the characters at the dinner scene. While some of the lines border on awful, the actors are (usually) believable... and who wouldn't mind watching a young Alec Baldwin (remember? back when he was a hottie?). This movie is a classic and a great addition to any movie library (if for nothing else than historical value)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious the the end... of time LOL!","review":"Bravo Bravo!

Tim Burtin is a guinis if you ask me. If there was any stars above 5, I'd give him that many. It starts out where this couple go to the store and they crash into the side of a bridge and fall in the water and dround to death.They die but there spirts still remain in the house. Then Beetlejuice tries to help them get ride of the people who have move into there house.There is only one girl who can see them and she tries to help them too.Everybody in my family loves it and I recomend it to anybody who want's to evan think about buying it."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT MOVIE!!!","review":"this is a great movie! baldwin and keaton shine in this one! the bluray version of this looks cripsy clear!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny great movie for kids adults anyone with a sense of humor!","review":"It's Tim Burton's Beetlejuice!

This DVD is simply a disgrace, especially considering what a great movie this is. I give the movie itself 5 stars; it's a wonderful example of Tim Burton's energy and style.This DVD has no extras worth mentioning. No deleted scenes, no featurettes, not even a lousy commentary track! To make it even worse, the film has been CUT DOWN from the theatrical release! I have never seen a DVD release before where you get LESS than was originally presented in theaters.My advice is to save your money until somebody figures out that when a movie is released on DVD, it needs to live up to the capabilities of the medium, and should always provide more material than was originally released, not less."},{"rating":"2","title":"What Amazon ships is not what's pictured. BEWARE","review":"Beetlejuice has always been a family favorite. I was very glad to order this from Amazon. Unfortunately I thought I was ordering the 20th Anniversary edition shown in the picture with the special cover. NOPE.....I received just the standard Blu of the movie.

What happened to false advertisement ????"},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING: CLAMSHELL EDITION IS EDITED TV VERSION","review":"I, myself always enjoyed this movie, it's very funny and entertaining, so I didn't hesitate to pick up the clamshell edition.

This book captures the spirit of a nation during that incredible series. It is told through the eyes of a young hockey player who looked up to and admired Paul Henderson. It recounts the events of those amazing 8 games and especially Paul Henderson's winning goal. Wonderfully illustrated and written, this will be treasured by hockey fans both old and young."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Damn Good Album","review":"I found the album of this short lived band because 3/4 of them make up my new favorite band, Louis XIV. (So amazing. They're the saviors of rock and roll.) This is a really amazing album. I love Caught Up In You and Eleventeen which are great songs and my two favorite tracks on the album. Convoy put out something really original, which is no surprise considering the ever-brilliant Jason Hill is behind the project. The only reason this gets 4 stars instead of 5 is because I'm not crazy about Wet Cement and So Much You Can Do, which I find a little bit on the saccharine side."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost Perfect","review":"I may not have driven the Convoy truck but I got on board early.I think I have played Black Licorice more than any album I have ever owned. This is Bad Finger with balls or the Beach Boys withmuscle. Supersonic harmonies and crunchy Rolling-Stones-like guitars are the trade marks of this hookfest salute to classic rock. If you don't buy this album you are missing out on one the best records to come out in the last two years."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Children's Ears Only (but children deserve better)","review":"Simson's settings of Milne's Pooh poems are delightful.

For most of the episodes I found myself checking the time to see how much time was left. Most of the story line is not at all compelling, though there are some episodes that are quite good. The acting leaves a lot to be desired; however, Lexa Doig is well worth watching. That cannot be said for most of the special effects, which appear to be vintage 1970 and used repetitively. As for the DVD set itself, I like the compact package. I really liked the price; I got my set for $80.00. The deleted scenes are okay and the \\"tours\\" with the cast are very interesting. The bloopers are lame; surely there were more and funnier mess ups. One big NEGATIVE is the lack of close captioning. Overall, I am not unhappy that I bought the set, but I will not put Andromeda in my \\"will watch again\\" pile as I did with Firefly and B5.

I expected to have to pay $50 for each individual season and was really surprised to find this which has every episode in one set, including all of the extras.Clearly this is a repackage of each individual season. Season one had no advertisements, while some DVD's in season two include them. The menus are also different for each season.If I had any complain it would be the anime ads included at the beginning of some DVD's. Thankfully these can be quickly jumped over with the menu button."},{"rating":"1","title":"mostly for a younger audience","review":"the content was good, but i didn't really like the format of this book; it seemed geared toward middle school students rather than adults. the short chapters, the \\"storytelling\\" tone, and the jokey drawings were distracting to me. w/ that said, i did enjoy the content (although it never went into much depth) and have a new appreciation for the sex life of bugs."},{"rating":"1","title":"snuggle fabric softener","review":"I received this product and it was leaking everywhere so didn't get the full use of it or money worth. very dissappointed"},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific","review":"Wow, this is really cool stuff.

It's based on the fasinating idea that certain artifacts were made to preserve instructions on how to enter a trance.

There are different postures that cover divination, shapeshifting, spirit journeys,and more. It's everything I've wanted to practice as an occult student and without religion attached to it.

She makes her point clearly, without excessively convoluted text. In addition to being thought-inspiring, it is genuinely well-written and often a pleasure to read.Sobchack divides the books into chapters that address issues of definition, image, dialogue and sound in the science fiction film. It is the definitive book on the subject, and students of the genre should definitely begin here.Note: I read the second edition of the book, rather than the third that is for sale at the time of writing this review.

He even lampoons his own melodramatic stint from \\"Love Story\\" near the end of the film. For fun, see if you can count the references to the Cary Grant/Katherine Hepburn classic \\"Bringing up Baby,\\" which serves as Bogdanavich's main inspiration for the plot.

It contains good, clean and fun humor."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a super funny movie that is full of great \\"one-liners\\" We can watch it over and over!","review":"I would suggest that everyone see's this movie! I got it as a gift for my sister-in-law because she saw mine and wanted one. I was so glad that I could get it from Amazon.com for so cheep, and in such a short amount of time. If your looking for a \\"classic\\" to add to your library, try this movie out. It's worth the money! Even if you aren't a big Barbra fan, this movie just keeps you laughing, no matter how many times you've seen it. We love this movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Screwball Comedy at Its Funniest!","review":"You will never love Barbra Streisand more in any other film than \\"What's Up, Doc.\\" This \\"Love Story\\" is a treasure chest of pop-cultural referencesand classic comedians who should never be forgotten. Screwball comedy has never been more believable or entertaining than in this Streisand classic. Let the carrots for Bugs and Babs, butter the popcorn and laugh your way through an afternoon of comedic history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sight comedy at its very best!","review":"For the first time in about 30 years I have seen this movie on DVD. I am glad I own a copy of this. Ryan O'Neil and Barbra Streisand are in simply hilarious in this 1972 comedy. Madeline Kahn was also a joy to watch in this film. Barbra can sing but she can really make you laugh with this! Enjoy!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It just came out of the faucet that way!","review":"I highly agree that this is the funniest movie of all time. If you've never seen it, you have missed the all time great comedy. I agree with the reviewer who wrote about their family having whole conversations with the gag lines in this movie. My family has to watch it every so often and renew our sense of humor. I showed this to my radio/TV class and they couldn't believe such an \\"old\\" movie could be so good. Even today's teenagers can appreciate the timeless comedy. Wish there were more like it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great family film for parents tired of kiddie fare","review":"At last, a grownup movie I can watch with my three-year-old son! I first saw this with my family when it aired on TV in the 70s, and loved it. Years later I watched it again and was happy to see I still enjoyed it. But best of all, it appeals to my child too. I rented it so he could see the fabulous and hysterical car chase scene at the end, but he actually paid attention to the whole thing -- a first! He was riveted by all the intrigue too, and found the suitcase switching scenario quite fascinating. Of course, the chase scene is a classic, something all ages can get a kick out of. (I love the exchange, \\"What's happening? I can't see!\\" \\"There's not much to see, actually, we're inside a Chinese dragon.\\") If you're tired of watching the kiddie films over and over, try this one and give yourself a treat as well as the little one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Madcap at its finest","review":"I first saw \\"What's Up Doc?\\" in the movie theater with my cousins when I was ten. We were over cartoon \\"Peanuts\\" movies, and this was a great transition. All these years later, it holds up! The patter is lightning fast, Barbra Joan and Madeline Kahn are terrific, and the ancillary characters are a hoot. I bought this for myself, but my 8-year old daughter ended up watching it and loving it,too. This is one you'll come back to over and over, just to make sure you get all the laughs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Family Film","review":"It's too bad Hollywood does not make screwball comedies like this one anymore--enjoyable for kids, \\"tweens\\", and parents without containing scenes/language that make parents squirm.

Has lots of familiar faces from the 70's."},{"rating":"2","title":"My #1 most favorite movie!!","review":"What's Up Dock, I think, is the most hillarious movie of all time. What I don't understand is why in the world so many people haven't seen it. I am 18 yrs old and 90% of the people I talk to who are in my age group haven't heard of it. I've shown this film to several of my friends and they enjoyed it as much as I did. If you haven't seen it...Go Rent It!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If Streisand is your cup of tea..your cup will runneth over!","review":"This is Barbra's movie all the way. Too bad she feels it is one of the most embarrassing moments of her career. Those of us who love Streisand....know better. This movie is laugh-out-loud damned funny. I first saw it when I was 10 and it was the first time in my life that I truly belly-laughed. 26 years later...I am STILL laughing at it. THEY DON'T MAKE THEM LIKE THIS ANYMORE. The rest of the cast, including an incredibly funny performance from the dear late-great Madeline Kahn, a completely horrid, but hilarious Kenneth Mars (and his wretched 70's \\"wig\\"), and a fantastically funny scene at the end with Liam Dunn playing a judge, are perfectly assembled. The movie truly is a 5 star treat, however, because it is not on widescreen video OR DVD, I held back a star. But, if you don't laugh at this movie, then you must be dead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Such a funny movie","review":"This movie has always been a favorite of mine--in my opinion, one of the few truly great modern-day comedies. A definite family movie. Glad is it finally out in Blu-ray."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely hilarious!","review":"This movie is a great comedy. Full of pratfalls, physical and situational humor.

The color of the film, the setting in San Francisco, the pure escapism is unmatched...\\"Don't you know the meaning of propriety?\\", \\"What wine are you serving at table six?\\", and the immortal, \\"Snakes live in mortal fear of...tile!\\" make me laugh outloud at sometimes inappropriate times. But there's always a place for humor and \\"What's Up Doc\\" sure knows its place."},{"rating":"2","title":"An old fashioned good time","review":"Silly it you may think it, slapstick it may be, but it still made my worldly modern teenagers laugh as hard as I did. It is a real romp, and while it may make old timers think of the Keystone cops sometimes, it is still very funny. Madelyn Kahn turned in a stellar performance and we were all breathless with laughter during the chase through the streets of San Francisco. I never thought my teenagers would laugh so hard at something that I thought of as wholesome good clean fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Howard! Howard Bannister!\\"","review":"While Barbra Streisand and Ryan O'Neal are marvelous as Judy the walking disaster area and Howard the rock-absorbed professor of music, respectively, the movie is stolen by Madeline Kahn as Eunice Burns, Howard's overbearing fiance (but then Howard does need a keeper). This tale of four plaid carpetbags, a musicologists' grant competition, spies, jewel thieves and other assorted loonies will keep you laughing. Watch for Kenneth Mars in a zany performance as O'Neal's rival for the grant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Barbra Streisand in \\"What's Up Doc\\"","review":"If you are a Barbra Streisand fan, then you know what a great comedic actress she is and there is no better comedy that she made than \\"What's Up Doc\\". Barbra and Ryan O'Neal (her co-star) had great chemistry and with the crazy script and super supporting cast including Madeline Kahn, you will laugh every time you watch this movie. Wonderful movie to add to your Barbra Streisand collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Fun","review":"This comedy is a classic. Fast moving and very funny. Ryan O'Neal is great as the straight man to Barbara Streisand's wackyness. Watch for Madelyn Kahn as the girlfriend. Just see if you can keep up with the plaid satchels. Very clever and very funny."},{"rating":"2","title":"this is my favorite movie of all time","review":"This is the one I watch when I'm down in the dumps and need a lift. I know every line by heart, and drive my family crazy by laughing in anticipation of the next hilarious line. \\"I know I'm different, but from now on I'm going to try to be the same.\\" \\"The same as what?\\" \\"The same as people who aren't different.\\" If you've never seen this movie, by all means, give yourself a treat. It's the silliest, funniest escape from daily stress, and I guarantee you'll laugh out loud."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic goofball comedy","review":"This movie is a laugh a minute all the way through. It gets crazier as it goes along. My kids ages 6 and 9 were laughing out loud."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not charmed","review":"There is clearly a market for this type of screwball comedy it just doesn't do anything for me. Nothing is supposed to be believable and I frankly thought that O'Neal was horrible. I do like that they address that ridicuous line from Love Story though. I'm usually a Barbra Streisand fan, but I feel this was totally beneath her. I'm sure this type of comedy appeals to other and really you're just going to have a take a chance and see if this tickles your fancy. I still love Barbra."},{"rating":"1","title":"How was this film ever successfull?","review":"I saw this film because it has great reviews everywhere one looks. However, with exception of only a few funny moments, the film was a terrible bore. It starts as something that could work out as a comedy, but as the \\"story\\" progresses, it becomes worse and worse. Whether it should be respected due to its tip of the hat to older screwball comedies or not, makes no difference because it lacks some of the most essential ingredients of a decent story. Characters are largely unmotivated for what they do; there are too many unbelievable plot devices which make it impossible to hold one's suspension of disbelief. Compared to real screwball comedies, such as \\"It's a mad mad mad mad world\\" this film falls flat on its face.The only reason I gave it two stars is because the film did have two or three moments when I chuckled."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow and Slower","review":"I ordered 2 movie DVDs on 7/27/05.

Good, clean old fashioned screwball comedy which is delightful from beginning to end. A classic and highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice blu-ray","review":"I'm going to assume that most people interested in buying this movie are already familiar with it, so I'm not going to try to critique the movie itself. I will say however that it's a fun comedy and people in our house who hadn't seen it before enjoyed it.This was (and still is) a very inexpensive release on blu-ray, at least on Amazon. I was afraid that that meant that it would be ultra-low budget, but we're very happy with it. The picture is surprisingly good for a 1972 film. I don't know that this movie had any grand restoration, but it is far clearer and more detailed that I would have expected! I haven't seen this movie in years, probably since it was on a 13\\" tube TV at my parent's house, so seeing it in it's original ratio looking as good as it does on a 55\\" LCD is really impressive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite movie","review":"This movie is classic and hilarious. My husband and I have both wanted our own copy for so long (rather than renting it over and over). For Christmas this year, we BOTH bought each other a copy.

Gone is the big hair, the spandex pants, the stupid songs like She's My Cherry Pie. In it's place is a toughness, a street wise sound that Poison and Warrant and Ratt didn't have but GnR and AC/DC and Aerosmith did. Couple that with a very modern guitar tone - thick and fat - rather than the overly chorused and processed tones that dominated 80s hard rock. The singer can sing, the guitar player can shred - THANK GOD FOR GUITAR SOLOS! - and the rhythym section is tight.Probably the best album of its type since Appetite for Destruction. If you like this, also check out D Generation. They're a little punkier, a little more glam, but still have that same street attitude, tough sound, and tunefulness.A great debut."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another 80's band","review":"I can't believe there's still an 80's dinosaur band still roaming the club circuit, much less signed to Warner Brothers!

Ms. Farrell, as a woman and artist, unveils the sensitive Mr. B. A man revered by all, becomes obsessed with Farrell, causing him to lose the respect of some of his dancers for a period of time. The novel is both witty and introspective. Of all dancer biography's this is one of the finest. Balanchine ballerinas clearly have writing abilities because they open up the world of ballet to all people and delve into realms unthinkable. Suzanne Farrell with her vivid memory, creates an atmosphere in her breathtaking novel that truly leaves you needing to hold onto air.I strongly suggest Jacque D'Amboise's memoir I Was A Dancer as well"},{"rating":"2","title":"very good","review":"i really enjoyed Villette! No it doesnt beat Jane Eyre but still it is an excellent story. As some reviewers mentioned, it does take a while to get to the point of the story, some of it is a little slow and possibly even boring, but keep reading!! It is so worth it.

It is a classic that should be read at least once in a lifetime. For me, a few times will do. Excellent book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"This is a masterpiece of a novel. Why hasn't this one been turned into a film yet? I would love to see an adaptation! Only prerequisite before reading this novel is that you might want to get a French Dictionary, as important dialougue is at oft times expressed through the French tongue. But don't let this be a deterrent! Although 'Jane Eyre' tops my list as being one of the most romantic and intriguing novels of classic literature, \\"Villette\\" is only a slim margin behind! It's a longer read and more introspective, with some slow parts, but believe me, all else makes up for it! READ THIS NOVEL!"},{"rating":"2","title":"French translations not included","review":"This is a very good story with compelling characters. However it is difficult to get the full effect of the story if you aren't familiar with French and your edition doesn't have translations provided in the footnotes."},{"rating":"2","title":"More questions than answers","review":"Villette - astonishing! Difficult to decide whether this is a book to love or loathe; no middle ground seems possible. Lucy Snowe is a compelling, engaging narrator; her sharp sarcasm pricks holes in the most inflated personalities and makes us laugh at life's absurdities. But at the same time, Bronte's level-headed narrator is caught in a morass of despair and loneliness from which she never completely escapes. The storyline becomes enmeshed in a dark, surreal web, unsettling and discouraging; this reviewer almost gave up on the book halfway through. Lucy Snowe, like Jane Eyre, can find beauty in unlikely places; but unlike her earlier counterpart, it seems that happiness, for Lucy at least, is too good to be real.Engaging, poetic, thought-provoking, skilfully created, deeply unsettling and profoundly dark. A mysterious, tragic narrative."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as Jane Eyre, but then again...","review":"Who can compare to that masterpiece of a novel? Villette was a literary masterpiece as well, but in its own way. Villette was more a tale of one woman's finding of herself than a love story. The heroine, Lucy Snowe, lived her entire life under the stereotypes of each of the people who knew her. (i.e. John Graham Bretton, Mrs. Bretton, Ginevra Fanshawe, Paulina Home/de Bassompierre) She had to realize who she truly was and not who she appeared to her friends. Perhaps it took a while for the plot to develop, but when she discovered who she was and who knew her best (can't tell you who that is), the genius of the novel came to life. It won't be as breathtaking as Jane Eyre, but nor will it be a disappointment. Villette is an opportunity to take off the mask and be who we really are."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you loved Jane Eyre, you'll love this novel.","review":"After reading Jane Eyre, I wanted to read everything Charlotte Bronte. An English professor recommended Villette, and I'm really thankful because the writing, the story, and the characters are beyond brilliant. Highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best!","review":"I don't know why people are complaining about the ending--though it doesn't spell it out, it's a happy one, and doesn't seem controversial at all if you read it carefully a few times. I've read Villette about four times--once in college (ok, but I didn't really get it then) and more recently after going through a Bronte/Austen marathon. If you love the character of Jane Eyre, you will love Lucy Snowe. If the idea of making your way successfully in the world through challenges, finding love after experiencing a past unrequited love, and plot twists all over--then read on. I used to think that the Austen books and maybe Jane Eyre were the books I enjoyed rereading. Villette has easily made it to that winning list."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Story--Wrong Country","review":"Although I agree with the two previous reviewers, I feel I must point out that the novel is set in Brussels, Belgium (Villette, Labassecouer), not France. French is spoken in Belgium, but it is not a part of France. This book is based on the life of Charlotte Bronte, and she spent several years in Belgium.This is a wonderful novel.

There is nowhere near the empathy for her as some of Bronte's other heroines. The French drove me crazy and I think was only self-serving for Bronte's obvious intellect.

The script is horrible, the acting is worse and I thought it was very offensive to both Baptists and Mormons and for that matter anyone with a brain cell.Just a quick thrown together movie that they'd hope to make a quick buck on expecting every Mormon to watch it/buy it because the subject is about Mormons (and Baptists).This movie is so bad that it made my top ten list for movies I have ever had the displeasure of enduring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oeps did I just rent that?","review":"OK, I am not a Mormon.

The wandering, dreamy-eyed young teacher, the pouting, rap music-blasting village Lolita sucking whole oranges, the white panties on the clothes line -- could you be any more clichéd? But then the story grew on me, with its many parallels to the Greeks, so much so that I think I'll go back to the source and reread the original. Some of the sea and water images reminded me of \\"Sex and Lucia\\" which I still prefer. Also, in the R-Rated version I rented from Blockbuster, the sex scenes must have been cut. Nothing spectacular, by far. So Bigas Luna likes breasts, but then again, we knew that already."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good cast makes this gritty western a winner","review":"This fine western spins a tale of a band of mercenaries who come to the aid of Mexican villagers who live in fear under the rule of an oppressive military led by a cruel general. The rebels are desperate to rescue their imprisoned leader and turn to a hired gunman with a reputation. The film is very much like the original movie in plot but with a different cast and an appealing hero, played by George Kennedy. The six men are recruited and fashioned into a crack fighting unit that gets help in the nick of time from an outlaw band of patriots who are also under the thumb of the despotic military ruler, in a good turn by Michael Ansara. James Whitmore, Fernando Rey, Paul Casey and Joe Don Baker are the other well-known names in this enjoyable western."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Magnificent At All!","review":"Academy award winner George Kennedy sleepwalks thru this one!

Mr. Marsalis captures a moment and creates an atmosphere for any student interested in music to actively engage in music fundamentals that is practical and makes sense to them.

The song selections are OK run of the mill holiday fare, but there is nothing to set these tracks apart.

To put it bluntly, they all sound like a 6th grader playing at a recital.

First make a skeleton from clay, then apply muscles, then skin/subcutaneous tissue and voila! a perfect figure. This is really the extent of instruction provided here.

But this book is not for the weak of wrist or the Tudor history rookie; the biggest audience will probably be those who have already devoured the lives of the wives by Alison Weir and Antonia Fraiser and know their Tudor history. Starkey hasn't uncovered any new, long-lost documents(although a reidentified portrait of probably a young Catherine of Aragon and one of Catherine Parr, formerly id'ed as Lady Jane Grey grace the book's cover and give us a look at both queens as Henry might have first saw them), but goes back to the surviving original and contemporary sources to attempt to strip off as much of the varnish of previous historical interpretations to get as close as possible to the real women who were Henry VIII's consorts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Biography","review":"David Starkey has done an incredible job of biographing the six wifes of Henry VIII. This is a huge book loaded with politics, religion, and detailed information on all of his wives. His first two wives, (Catherine of Aragon and Anne Boleyn) take up about half of the book with respective chapters to his 4 other wives. Henry VIII's character is put to the question in each of his marriages and the fault he lies with his wives (with the exception of Jane Seymour) to produce a male heir. Most of these women were intelligent, spoke other languages fluently and Catherine of Aragon and Katherine Parr were left as Regents to the throne when the King was off on campaign. These were not weak and feeble women.If you like history you will love this book.

Almost everyone in the professional theatre under forty knows of it, and it is the underground book of choice for instructors of verse acting throughout American Universities and conservatories.

For example: the book talks about what the Etruscans did, but doesn't tell you where they are from or even who they are. The movement of people from the Po Valley is discussed, but you're not told where the Po Valley is. Don't check the index, Po Valley isn't there. There's a map on page 14 on the expansion of Italy, but the territories referenced aren't in the text or the index.

Were it not for the excellent, dynaminte cast and Spielberg's visual flair, Catch Me If You Can could have been disasterous, but the performances from DiCaprio, Hanks, and Christopher Walken in an Oscar nominated role as Frank's father (he is undoubtadly the highlight of the film) make the film much better than it should be.

A great mayority thinks that this movie doesn't deserve to be seen as an \\"Spielberg's movie\\" and that the actors weren't as good as they always are.I think completly different. My impression is that this movie is great because of its simplicity. It doesn't want to give an example, it doesn't discuss a political, religious or social issue, it just entretains; and that's the beauty of it. It only tells a story, a real (and sometimes unbelievable) story, and leaves you thinking about Abagnale's great capacity and intelligence and Hanratty's great determination to not only catch this kid, but to use his abilities to turn him in the right path.This movie has it all: a good story, a great director, marvelous actors......Why ask for more?"},{"rating":"1","title":"FLAT","review":"This movie is flat - there is nothing to it...boring and barely entertaining.

The story is simple- After his parent's divorce, DiCaprio decides to leave the household and set up on his own. With no money, he soon resorts to scams, most notably using counterfeit cheques. This story is a game of cat and mouse between Hanks and DiCaprio. DiCaprio poses as many different faces including policemen and pilots. However, the tension that builds up in where Hanks is getting closer to DiCaprio soon fades.What we are left with in the end is a film which proves to be long and, in the end, begins to get tedious. Had Catch Me If You Can been shorter, perhaps it could have proved more enjoyable. Though it may have an excellent plot and a good supporting cast, sadly, these criteria are not enough to make the film appealing to the average viewer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow and Boring","review":"High schooler Frank Abagnale Jr. (Leonardo DiCaprio) idolizes his father, who's in trouble with the IRS. When his parents separate, he runs away to Manhattan with $25 in his checking account, and he vows to regain dad's losses and get his parents back together. Just a few years later, the FBI tracks him down in France; he's extradited, tried, and jailed for passing more than $2,000,000 in bad checks. Along the way, he's posed as a Pan Am pilot, a pediatrician, and an attorney. And, from nearly the beginning of this life of crime, he's been pursued by a dour FBI agent, Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks). What starts as cat and mouse becomes something akin to father and son.This was such an awful movie. It really could have been good, but the story was so slow. The acting by Tom Hanks was surprisingly bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Story - if you can last till the end","review":"I didn't know what to expect when I ventured to this movie other than I'm not normally a big DiCaprio fan. I can say now that this stellar cast and producers have put forth a strong showing, that is, if you can last through the nearly three hours.Pay attention so you don't get lost with the foreshadowing. I believe it is necessary to help set up the ending of the film but I think it was also longer than necessary. Without getting into details to spoil the story, I was impressed that it was based upon a real story and that the time period seemed to be somewhat authentic and not overly played, particularly with Southern locales.I recommend the movie if you have around 3 hours to ... and enjoy a story about the ability to turn a sour life into one that is redeeming. There's a lot of psychology and sociology in the film that begs to be used as examples for discussion at the collegiate level.

Also some of the action hadreminded me of those orginal James Bond movies of that time period. (What Memories.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Zzzz","review":"Very disappointing. First problem: casting. DiCaprio does an adequate job as the precocious criminal, but simply doesn't possess the cunning or bluster to be a credible high-stakes con man. Tom Hanks gives (for once) a highly inconsistent performance, one minute confused and discombobulated and the next minute cool and calculating. Christopher Walken tries hard as DiCaprio's hard-luck father, but is too chilly to evoke the sympathy Spielberg apparently wants us to have for him. Second problem: direction. The story could have been told better. Starting at the end takes away much of the suspense. A little suspense might have kept the audience interested; as it is, the movie does not seem to know when to end, but you already know what happens, and that adds up to boredom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow!","review":"The DVD set arrived on time and in mint condition, still enclosed in wrapper. The fascinating true story about a highly intelligent and gifted teenager, who re-invents himself as an airplane pilot, a doctor, and assumes many high level personas. His adventures, despite their illegal nature, appear as that of a delinquent teenager more than a crook. A surprise ending portrays how a prisoner becomes a hugely valuable and productive member of society. The second disc is fascinating as interviews with the mature con man letting you in on the secrets of his history of assumed identity. Not to be missed! Leonardo Decaprio at his outstanding best."},{"rating":"1","title":"2, 1, 0.","review":"It's a two-disc product. It says in the product details that it is one disc.

Walken was nothing like Abagnale's real father. If you have high expectations, DO NOT READ THE BOOK BEFORE YOU SEE THE FILM!!! So many cool tricks were left out that he really pulled in exchange for the lame ones done in the movie. \\"To the moon\\" and the awful \\"mouse in whipped cream\\" analogy drove me ape-youknowwhat!

Tom Hanks did a fine job too. Everybody can expect that! The best role of the whole film though went to Christopher Walken, playing as DiCaprio's Father who became a total loser. Chris Walken was amazing. It truly was his best role since his oscar-winning performance in \\"The Deer Hunter\\" in 1978. Stephen Spielberg is an impressive director who always comes through. \\"Catch Me if you Can\\" is among the finest con artist movies I've seen. I can't wait until May 6th to buy the dvd.

It alluded that they changed things to fit the screen play, but very little info about what really went down to what was made up. No expert info about his capers and if his biography was authentic.

The only great things about this movie are Walken and Hanks. Good to see Walken back in a normal, rather happy role, eh?

He is an alternative version of the Tony Curtis ( \\"The Great Impostor\\" ) theme.Most people are propagandized to believe that great impostors only perform criminal misdeeds or impersonate a multitude of occupations they are illegitmately qualified to perform. However there are alternate variations of great impostors: (1) individuals with multiple personalities who may not be criminals and (2) individuals with highly ambiguous behavior, appearances and language usage. The English poetical playwright William Shakespeare aptly described humans in his phrase: \\"all the world's a stage\\" and he uttered that we (all human beings) are \\"actors\\". The great impostor psychopathological syndrome is a catch-as-catch-can \\"catch me if you can\\" extreme application of this justly famous insightful Shakespearean quotation; for we are all truly impostors in our individualistically distinctive ways."},{"rating":"1","title":"Entertaining UNLESS you've read the book!","review":"I read this book before the movie came out, and Spielberg butchered the great story. The movie omits many of the best stories in the book, or twists and abuses them into inoffensive fluff, wrenching away their original intrigue. Spielberg confabulated a relationship between the lead and the FBI agent to make a better story, but it made both characters seem like woebegone fools.HOWEVER, my friends who didn't read the book tended to like it.I recommend you read the book instead--it's the first book in years that I couldn't put down until I had finished it.

So, the son Frank Abignale,Jr., poses as a pilot,doctor and lawyer,writing up to over 1.5 million dollars in checks. Tom Hanks plays the wily yet persistent Federal agent who stays on the case, and in turn rehabilitates him. This movie will keep definitely keep you on your toes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"I love this movie from the beginning to the end. It shows how Frank Abignale learned how to con people from the first day in class to witnessing his father smooth-talk people and how he made use of his activity before he was twenty-one. Although he was a criminal, he was a smart one at that. He made sure that he kept his tracks covered giving Hanratty the chase of his life. However, it was Hanratty who would prevail in changing Abignale and his behavior. This movie was good from the beginning. The scenery for the decade was on target and not out of place. The fashions were eclectic, stylish, and colorful. Both Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hanks were great in their roles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Catch me if you can","review":"Based on the life of Frank Abagnale, Hollywood decided to do what it usually does - change the 'little details' of the story to make it more 'dramatic'. In this case, instead of going into Abagnale's actual reasons & motivations for what he did (which I'm sure many viewers were interested in), the movie 'explains' his action by some psychobabble about the trauma of his parents' divorce and wanting to please his father.Luckily, what remains of the story is fascinating enough, and is presented by a wonderful cast, giving their best performances. I'm sure I wouldn't be able to see Christopher Walken as 'Creepy Guy' ever again after his against type - performance in this movie..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Did Anyone Read The Book of this true story??????","review":"This movie is based on a true story!!!!!

It is a very entertaining movie anyhow. I highly recommend reading the book and then watching the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Catch Me If You Can (2002)","review":"This movie was extremely entertaining, in fact I laughed at times. Leo brought charisma to Frank Abagnale, that engaged you. Tom Hanks has had better days, though he provides a certain comfort for a variety of viewers who have faith in him.

Don't get me wrong, I like that movie, but I had high hopes for him as an actor, and I thought he was horrible in Titanic, and I don't even want to talk about \\"The Beach\\". Plus the way he acted in public turned me off even more. One thing I can't stand is spoiled brat celebrities. The ONLY reasons I wanted to see this was for Tom Hanks (I've been a fan of him since Bosom Buddies), and the story itself intrigued me. What I realized as I was watching this, is that Leo seems to have grown up, and that he can act again!!! As for the movie itself, it's wonderful. It's funny, but you don't get the sense that they are glorifying Mr. Abagnale's life of crime either, which is good. Even my husband enjoyed this movie, and he hates Leo DiCaprio even worse than I do (or did). He also doesn't normally like \\"true story\\" movies.

This was hyped up a little too much when it came out so I expected more than what the film delivered. However, it was still a decent yarn about a kid who impersonated people in different professions and forged checks along the way. He did all of this in his teenage years.Leonardo DiCaprio plays his normal cocky role while Tom Hanks is the straight- and-narrow looking FBI man on his trail. Although not a tense thriller, the movie holds the viewer's interest throughout the 2 hours and 20 minutes with the last half hour being the most interesting, capped off by a satisfying ending.The only thing I didn't enjoy watching was DiCaprio (as \\"Frank Abagnale\\") taking advantage of genuinely-nice girls.

Also appealing were Tom Hanks and the actors portraying diCaprio's parents, Christopher Walken and Nathalie Baye.A couple of things annoyed me though (because something inevitably does): 1. Jennifer Garner. I don't care how popular she becomes. I find her miserably annoying. 2. The strange and too long intro to the movie with stick figure drawings.

The only thing keeping it from getting 5 Stars is that there are not that many style numbers. For instance, there are so many Spain & Mexico dolls, I can't really tell which I have, by looking at this book. Maybe the next book, he'll list style numbers. Otherwise, I think it's great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very limited uses","review":"For removing dog hair this broom works only on very low height carpet or industrial carpet even with the small strokes you are supposed to use. I was under the impression that it would work on all my carpets and it does not. It is not better on hard surfaces than a broom on both liquids and solids.

Three of us are females with long hair, and this causes no end of clogs to the vacuum cleaner hose. At least, it used to, until I got the One Sweep. I love this thing! I use it before vacuuming to get the hairs out of the carpet, and it works like a dream since the rubber bristles grab on and gather it all up so I can throw it out. The first time I tried it, I was astonished at how much hair had been on the carpet (and a little amazed that we're not all bald!).I have also used this on the vinyl flooring in the kitchen with equally great results. It's especially useful for when you pull out appliances and clean under them; I wring out a rag with Mr. Clean solution onto the floor and scrub with the One Sweep, then use the squeegee side to pull the solution into one area so I can mop it up. No touching the icky things that end up under the stove. :)For the price, you can't go wrong with it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for almost nothing","review":"So far, haven't found much use for this on any application.

John Wayne comes into town, meets Gabby Hayes, gets into some shenanigans and then kisses some annoying girl.I appreciate all the stunt riding and gun slinging that went into these 1930's Lone Star Productions films, but unfortunately they're so poorly produced it's hard to notice the good stuff. And Digiview piles some extra crap onto the last film on the disc by adding some unnecessary, hackey background synth music. If you're a huge John Wayne fan then this budget disc is a good way to see some of his early budget movies, but I can't think of another reason to reccommend this.Here are the four movies on the disc:The Dawn Rider (1935)Blue Steel (1934)The Lucky Texan (1934)The Man from Utah (1934)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Top pick!","review":"Excellent shovel!

They had a reasonably nice sound and we even enjoyed using the program a bit on my old computer, but I notice now (Oct.2010) the company listed on my box no longer exists, or they have totally changed and sell a different product and don't seem to support Singing Coach.

I've tried a few other items (Singing for Dummies, Idiot's Guide to Singing, CD packages, pitch match software, etc.). All were helpful in different ways. Singing Coach is fun in offering the chance to sing pop songs (using MIDI files) while receiving visual feedback on your abilities with pitch and timing. Singing Coach is also helpful in offering singing exercises with visual feedback. I'd give Singing Coach 5 stars, but am annoyed with the difficulty in loading and using free MIDI files with the software, as well as annoyed with the developer's attempt to steer the user to over-priced MIDI files.

Secondly, when Jancy finally reveals her true identity and that she's been lying to Simon this whole time, he doesn't even get mad. He just shrugs it off and acts as if it's not that big of a deal. How can lying about who you really are not be that big of a deal? Furthermore, when it becomes known who was trying to, more or less, sabatoge them, one page is dedicated to fighting and threatning this person to never show their face again. One of the plots in the story is about the \\"papers\\" and to just end it like that is disappointing.

Many of his gossipy tidbits are suspect, others merely juvenile and/or taken out of context. When the star complains, \\"No one really cares\\", she's saying this on the set of a movie, on-location in sweltering Arizona, trying to get an indifferent director to see her vision and contend with a stadium full of screaming fans.

There is no hackneyed, watered-down GD-OTO-Wiccan ephemera to be had here - those accustomed to that kind of spiritual spoon-feeding may find themselves a bit flabbergasted after ingesting this information, but may also find themselves a bit wiser in the process.

The construction video is pretty good but the fire engine video is terrible. It is basically a couple of firefighters from the East Coast giving an overview of their equipment; almost a new firefighter orientation video. BORING! My 9-month old was over it in about 3 minutes. Who wants to sit and listen to some guy in turn-outs drone on about the different sizes of fire hose? Kids want to see the big impressive engines and equipment. What a dud."},{"rating":"1","title":"JUNK--most of them are--","review":"We have trains and planes and my three year old and one year old love it. So I bough airplanes and helicopters, fire engines and construction, and cars and motorcycles. THESE ARE TOTAL JUNK!!! The picture shows race cars and action scenes. None of that happens. It's some stupid actor with a few kids talking the entire time about magic and all the parts of an engine while they hang out in a service station. OH THAT'S FUN FOR KIDS!!!Or have a fireman stand by a truck in the station and pull out and point at every fixture and piece of equipment with the most monotone drone that goes on and on. What are they thinking?My three year old said, \\"There's just talking. Where are the cars?\\" He thought it was a preview to the actual dvd. Then he said, \\"It's just too boring Mama. Watch something else.\\"Luckily they only cost a few dollars each but I am trying to contact gtmediausa.com to get my money back."},{"rating":"2","title":"all about fire engines/ all about construction","review":"My 2 year old loves this dvd.

My husband said he even learned a few things about construction equipment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie for kids","review":"I bought this for my 2 year-old son who loves anything with lights and sirens. It was an immediate hit. The production isn't great, but he doesn't seem to mind. Unlike some movies about firefighting, this one actually shows a LOT of firetrucks, lights and sirens and all. They also show the equipment firefighters use, and there's some footage of real firemen putting out real fires. The construction part isn't as good, but he loves watching all of those big trucks working. If you have a little one who is into firetrucks and/or construction trucks, this is definitely a good pick. I doubt it would entertain any kid, though, that didn't already have that interest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spend your money on something better","review":"This DVD has about 5 minutes of previews that you can't fast forward or bypass in any way. Very frustrating for something that is purchased. It's creepy, slow, and doesn't immediately get to what the kids want to see: fire trucks on the go. I didn't even bother with the construction site area. My kids hate it. It's educational if you're an adult. If you're looking for something for toddlers on up, skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so hot","review":"This arrived in the mail today.

They are \\"hosted\\" by the very creepy Hard Hat Harry; a very strange genie who pops up in the middle of kids playing, and takes them on adventures. I certainly don't want my kids to wander off with some weird guy who invites them to look at trains/cars/etc. Honestly, he strikes my wife and me as a potential molester. Finally, the quality of the videos is lousy: many of them look to be filmed - poorly - in the early 1980's.

Unfortunately, the book appears to have had a prior life. The goo from the price tag obviously scratched off having left noticeable indentations on the cover. The back, also, reveals the books age. This is not what I had hoped for, and will not give it to Evan, Given that it cost 3.95 to ship thirs 5.95 book to me, it seems foolish to go to the expense of returning it,I am quite disappointed.Had I purchased this as a used novel to read myself, it would have been fine.

I have been bumpin these guys for years and always get excited when I show them to my friends. Sadly, this album was not what i expected. What I hoped for was something similar to 2000 fold, amazing flows and original beats. There are 4 songs on this album that are listenable but not even worthy to the worst song on 2000 fold. Many of you are hating what im saying right now, but this is just my opinion. They brought on the start for my fantastic underground hip hop voyage to begin with and i owe it all to 2000 fold.

And yes, to those who feel they're too gangster.....do you know them? what they're really like? maybe they were more soft on 2000 fold than you think. The lyrical content is still great, but more playful this time around. Not everyone can be Mos Def or Talib Kweli. Not everyone can have that perfect sound and you know what?

Did they sell out to some record producer who said they have to use profanity? I'm a Christian and the first album is far different from this new one.

A fully qualified medical researcher, Herbert Benson had an unexpected encounter with practitioners of Transcendental Meditation who confronted him with a bold challenge to \\"test us with your equipment.\\" He did so. He did so over an extended period and discovered to his amazement that meditation produced a measurable PHYSIOLOGICAL relaxation response, equivalent to deep sleep. In hypnosis, by contrast, subjects REPORTED deep relaxation which the physiological evidence did not confirm. Over time, meditation also lowered blood pressure. Benson's book grounds his research firmly in the established medical and physiological knowledge of the time.I notice from the book description that the marketers hope to divorce it from unsavory associations with \\"meditation\\" and (God forbid!) \\"religion.\\" It won't work.Reviewed by Jeremiah Cox, author of REDESIGNING GOD"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Understanding Of Relaxation Response","review":"The author does an excellent job of analyzing and explaining the relaxation response.

A much better buy for your money for a medically proven product."},{"rating":"1","title":"This should have been a Pamphlet","review":"I slogged through the volume looking for the \\"How to do it\\", yet most of the book was all about the history of meditation, various forms of meditation and so on.

I would recommend this as a Pamphlet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stress Relief and Indigo Dreams","review":"This is an excellent book for anyone that wants to understand how stress works and how it hurts the body. Based on fact and research it is presented in an easy to read format. You can turn to any page and get something out of it that will make sense to you. I particularly liked the way Dr. Benson takes the mysticism out of meditation and shows scientifically how breathing, visualizing, muscular relaxation and positive statements will help your nervous system, circulatory system, respiratory system and immune system. This book has been around for 30 years and it's information is still powerful.I also implemented Indigo Dreams:Adult Relaxation into my stress management routine. The Relaxation Response offered me the facts I needed to get me started and Indigo Dreams taught me how to do all four of the techniques Dr. Benson recommends. Both are highly recommended if you are looking for relaxation."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Works","review":"This book was a bestseller when it came out and continues to be ranked high today simply because it works and can be done easily by anyone. In a nutshell, the relaxation response is the opposite of the \\"fight or flight\\" response- it is a state where your whole body relaxes and you can get measurable changes such as decreased heart rate, blood pressure, etc.This book will show you how to elicit the relaxation response so you can reap all the health benefits of being in a relaxed state. Also know that there is a good deal of research showing that the relaxation response is helpful in decreasing pain. A very worthwhile tool to learn."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Relaxation Response","review":"An excellent book.

I intend to correct that now that I have again read this classic book. The Relaxation Response probably offers the most medical benefit for the least effort that almost anything I know of. It's not necessary to read the book -- all you have to know is the four basics of the RR --but the book provides a lot of background which attests to the procedure's validity. This is truly a classic medical self-help book that is even more important in today's stress filled world, with its attendant high blood pressure, reflux, anxiety, depression, anger, etc. etc. If you haven't read this book, do yourself a favor and do so."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Relaxation Response","review":"I suffer from high blood pressure, and I attribute most of this maledy to stress.

Because...","review":"... it presents a practical, scientific basis for the benefits of meditation. No spirituality, no religion, no crystals, no \\"woo-woo\\". Now, I happen to like all those things. But Benson's point is that meditation works without them.When I discovered this book in the 80's, I tried his techniques and found them very relaxing and enjoyable. As I was a scientist back then, I appreciated that his procedure was all backed by research.But even though the field of mind-body research, which Benson pioneered, has greatly expanded upon his original insights, this book still contains the core, stripped-down truths about the mental and physical benefits of meditation. That's why I still love it, and why it's a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Many good stories","review":"These tales are engaging and amazing.

It is extremely helpful to understanding government in Cuba today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Laughably Incompetent","review":"The author reports with a straight face virtually unanimous election results, contests with only one candidate, and the incredible specter of middle school children guarding ballot boxes. He does not interview a single dissident or independent human rights advocate working on the island at great personal risk. He seems not to be bothered that there is no free press, independent civil society, or freedom of association outside of officially sanctioned government mobilizations. How democracy is possibly compatible with a complete lack of pluralism is something only someone either this incompetent or this cynical could avoid asking. If you believe this book I have a bridge I want to sell you."},{"rating":"2","title":"To Kill a King Crowning Achievement","review":"To Kill a King is mesmerizing. It is an epic tale, brilliantly captured cinematographically and presented in a way that all sides of the issue, from Oliver Cromwell to Thomas Fairfax and King Charles, are understood without any of the major players being demonized. What really makes this such an engrossing movie, however, are the performances of Tim Roth (Cromwell), Charles 1 (Rupert Everett) and Fairfax (Dougray Scott). Told from Fairfax's narrative, the movie shows the strengths and weaknesses of each person without condemnation. Scott is especially effective as the man torn in three by his best friend, his wife, and his king but who yields in the end to no one but his own moral code."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful scenes and costumes.

I personally really enjoy this era of English history and would like to see more movies made in this time period."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute rubbish; a waste of money","review":"I agree with the critical reviews below.This is a travesty of history; even \\"Cromwell\\" was better than this. If this is the best the British film industry can do, I shall never make fun of Hollywood again.There are so many factual errors it is not worth listing them.This is not a criticism of the actors, however - only the script. If you know nothing about the Civil War, then you might enjoy the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"English history drama has good cast but feels short & incomplete","review":"This film is the story (and some side story) about Oliver Cromwell's overthrow of King Charles in England. The cast does a solid job with the weak screenplay they are given, as the character development is limited in this overly short historical drama. This works more as a TV movie, and could have been made into a miniseries to provide for more context and greater connection with the characters. This solid cast deserves more room to show their craft... good historical dramas are usually long films because you need more time to help viewers gain an emotional engagement with the main characters and an understanding of the times in which the story occurs. The one historical lesson from this film that I found was that those who overthrow tyrants will often display the same tyrannical tendencies that they fought against. Historical themes do repeat!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Had the casting of Cromwell been better?","review":"The costumes are great, the acting is first class and the plotis well done. I only see the failure to cast Cromwell asthe giant he obviously was. He was nearly a century ahead of his timeand his eventual failure led to bloody King George against who we fought the American Revolutionary war. One man can make a great difference,but it takes more than one to make it stick.It seems from my history that there was degeneratecorruption on both sides. Here Fairfax takes that symbol,but royalty has ever degenerated. In the face of cultural decay,as the Romans, Republics have often gone to kings.Education, backbone and courage are not found in most men of the mob.At least Cromwell made the effort to be better than the past.The Stuarts were mostly weak and bad rulers...But a Stalin isn't an answer either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gadzooks!","review":"This film lacks an essential ingredient: a statement that \\"any resemblance between characters and events shown and actual historical events is purely accidental.\\" It is of negative value as a history film, in that the viewer is left more ignorant of what happened in 1645-1649+ than he was before he saw the film even if he originally knew nothing at all. The film \\"Cromwell,\\" for all its own faults, is much better. Try comparing the trial scenes of the two films. It's a pity that so much money and talent were wasted to make this embarrassment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Item received quickly","review":"Wow, I waited so long to see this movie, even looked around the UK for it while on vacation there and now it's finally available here in the US and man, what a bad movie.

My reaction to this disc, however, has a quibble or two attached to it. By and large, the performances of the Water Music suites come off well, but the rendition of the Royal Fireworks Music is perhaps less successful. Here the sound is not optimal: The group seems distant and muffled. Moreover, the music is taken just a tad lethargic to my tastes. The Overture, for example, does sounds stately throughout, but when things pick up early in the movement it all seems hobbled. The section La Rejouissance also suffers a bit from the same case of the slows. Overall, I do like this album, but the rendition of Fireworks is, in my mind, rather sub-optimal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the way it looks in the picture","review":"I was very disappointed when I received this.

It was very confusing. It jumped around a lot between characters and time periods. It was sad to see how the Jamacans were treated but not much different than the United States during the 60's. I had to make myself finish reading it and that is not what I am looking for in a book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent read","review":"I loved this book. Great characters and story line.

Sometimes I hate award-winning novels. This was an exception. It's a good read. It's funny at times and thought-provoking. The book has a nice ending. I thought Hortense would know about Queenie's baby, but she never finds out. I like the irony of it. One small complaint though. I hate the pages! They hurt my fingers and were at times, difficult to turn since they stuck together. Cha! Nevertheless, I recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Special","review":"Having never heard of the book nor the author I picked up Small Island because the cover looked good and the story sounded appealing. Having now read the book I was somewhat disappointed. The story was nothing new... the life of an immigrant in a new country, the trials and tribulations and the attempts to fit in to a culture that doesn't necessarily accept those who are different. The writing was not that exceptional. None of the characters really tugged at my heart strings because I didn't feel any attachment to them. If you're looking for a book to read, this one isn't bad, but there's just nothing that special about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another award winner?","review":"Why are these sorts of \\"post-colonial\\" book becoming the new divine mead which critics are so greedily slurping up? This is far from revolutionary writing and tries to mask its shallowness with a fragmented narrative. Her writing presents nothing more than an almost reflexive litany on race. The author assumes the presentation of these ideas with graphic candor shall make us acquiesce to the shocking depravity of history (whilst at the same time allowing the subconscious pat on the back for our liberalism and moral advancement). The book itself lacks any true insight and gives way to the most rancid sort of exhibitionism, which I personally have come to expect from this new breed of post-colonial author. For readers, try \\"Lonely Londoners\\" by Sam Selvon if you're interested."},{"rating":"2","title":"interesting read","review":"I enjoyed reading it she does a great job in writing it so when you read it you are sure you are listening to a Jamaican talk.

Very interesting how race was of little interest to the Brits, until the American's came (with money, men and supplies). With a new customer, the Brits accomodated the American values of race separation. Heartbreaking at times that those growing up in the British empire were considered second class citizens.Regarding the plot, it takes a while to get going and soem of the characters are at times too one dimensional, but I have to say, I didn't expect the plot twist and overall, found the book an enjoyable read."},{"rating":"1","title":"I might be the only one in the UK but I did not enjoy this book","review":"Although the storyline was good in principle - Jamaicans coming to 1940' England expecting to find the promised land but crashing instead against a wall of prejudice and racism - I believe the huge potential that this theme carried was not fully exploited. Levy's style of writing is very neat and with peaks of originality, not to mention her dry humor which infuses the pages but, I am afraid, that is as far as this book went for me. I found it long-winded and boring, especially the 'before' parts, and I found myself rushing throught them to find out what would happen in the present days. Truth to be told, nothing much happens and my perseverance in getting to the end of the book was not even rewarded by a great finale. Sorry to go against such a strong current of support, but this book did not do it for me, and I was relieved to turn the last page."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"This book has been a great success here in the UK and been showered with prizes. I put off reading it because, since it is 'about' racism, I was afraid it would be depressing and preachy. And it's true that racism is the main theme of the book, but it's such a great read, with such warm, sympathetic (yet flawed) characters, that it's a delight to read and, ultimately, rather uplifting. I have to admit I had tears in my eyes at the end and hope in my heart for Hortense and Gilbert, as well as Queenie. I loved it and would recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful storyteller, engrossing book once you give it a chance!","review":"Although I read the reviews, this is the first time I have written one. I am an avid reader and went back to this site to see if there is a sequel to this book, I enjoyed it so much. When I read some of the negative reviews, I felt compelled to give my positive opinion. This book began slowly but quickly became engrossing. In retrospect the slow beginning added to the build up of the flavor of Jamaican life in contrast with that of life in 1948 England. Each of the characters was human to me. They each had unique perceptions (common in youth) that were shattered over the course of the book, each in different ways. I ended the book with a warm feeling for all of the characters and a strong sense of wondering what will happen next. It amazed me that someone could feel confident enough to write a review not even reading the entire book! I read it all and I'm looking for more of the same! Great job!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Hard To Follow","review":"I have a rule; if I'm not into a book after the first100 pages, I give up and pick up something else.Ms.Levy isn't a bad writer, there are really some paragraphs in \\" Small Island\\" that are quite good. The characters however just didn't move me. I didn't love or hate them and therefore, didn't feel an attachment.The plot is about Jamaicans in Jamaica and how they're treated after they moved to England. While Ms. Levy should be applauded for writing about this, she should also know that her story falls flat. At times the narrative was very hard to follow. Serious literature should be readable.

My summation of Small Island, \\"Andrea Levy believes all of Britain is in 1948 is obtuse and racist\\". One act of kindness by a white woman has Gilbert crying. Oh give it up. The Jamaicans and Indians are inherently better than any white character in this entire book. BORING. Ms. Levy's voice as a Jamaican rings true.

Small Island recipient of numerous awards and literary praise just got me so annoyed I have to complain. The themes of racism and class are important but if they are not supported by great writing what is the point? The writing is not good or great, not captivating just blah. The characters who are immigrants from Jamaica to England leave one brand of racism only to find another in the mother country. These characters have few redeeming qualities and wear thin very quickly, again blah. The motivation behind their actions is not apparent and often nonsensical.

Manfredi has made a wonderful work in bringing to life a journey through history in the rise and fall of the Greek civilization in Athens. The book is a journey through history, as well as a personal journey described by Manfredi, as he sends the chapters to a greek friend and then asks him what he thinks.The narrative includes description of some of the greatest naval battles, like that of Temistocles against Jerjes of the Persian empire.

It is so packed with meat and metaphor that it would require 100 viewings to catch them all. This is the story of a train bound for the afterlife, basically, with all of humanity packed in its compartments, represented by the existential battle between Marvin and Borgnine (the ultimate hand to hand combat, with the fate of mankind held in the balance). Definitely the apex of both their careers, and Carradine's as well. This is such a superb piece of cinema that it was destined, precisely because of its depth, to go sailing over the heads of American audiences. Storytelling in its most elemental and purest form. A myth worthy of Homer or Hesiod. Art, in other words, in the truest sense.

The staff sneaking a smoke in the back, knowing how bad it is for them, the nurse who goes against the rules to push two beds together for the sake of love, and the flashbacks to the wife who comes back as a ghost, or voice, to inspire, help to make this a movie to remember. As the patient who has endured two mastectomies, Adrienne Barbeau's character stands proudly to show that, yes, she is altered, but no less a woman because of her scars.
