I definitely think that it is a classic, but the quality of this DVD is very bad. There are scraches thoughout the movie.

It does, however, make it more worthwhile than the waste of time with Will Smith, \\"I Am Legend\\" from 2007. That movie basically trashed everything good about Matheson's original story in favor of 'been there/done that' zombie nonsense.\\"The Last Man On Earth\\" features a poorly cast Vincent Price (in a downright woeful performance) as the only survivor of a plague that has either killed everyone or turned them into vampires. Price is terrible in this film. He portrays Robert Morgan (Neville in the book) in the most one-dimensional way possible.In case you are wondering which adaptation is the best, it is \\"The Omega Man\\" starring the late great Charlton Heston."},{"rating":"1","title":"When it's too good to be true","review":"This is a review of the German Blu-ray. Perhaps its a good thing that during the birthday sequence, this goes, and stays, a word out of sync. It will take your mind off the video, which is just enough out of focus to drive you out of your mind if you dwell on it. A 1080, DTS-HD piece of dreck. Throw the distributor in the pit with the rest of the zombies. Ah, the joys of modern technology!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The post apocalyptic world is not a pretty place","review":"I bought this(these) movies basically because I enjoy the MGM Midnite series(bringing you b-movies gems of the past at a decent price).Panic in the Year Zero is a good movie-it's the first movie that Ray Milland directed, and it was written by Jay Simms,who also wrote the cult favorite \\"Creation Of The Humanoids\\".The real reason I bought this was to get a decent print of \\"The Last Man On Earth\\"-written by Richard Matheson(under a pen name of Logan Swanson).There are other print on dvd around (and probably a lot cheaper too)but this is a great print, and as a extra BONUS there's an video interview with Richard Matheson as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Available Version-Restored maginficently","review":"This review is not on the film itself, because other reviews clearly tell you the synopsis of the film. This review is on the quality of the film itself, The Last man on Earth, starring horror legend Vincent Price. The version I have is a DVD with the title Last Man on Earth at the top in white capitals and Price carrying a body at the bottom, coloured light brown and the top an odd blue. The picture is as good as new, the audio is listenable and very sharp and in all my years of seeing different versions of this film, this is by far the best. It could as well be a collector's edition. Every copy I'vce seen, Price mouths something and half a second later words start being projected, not with this one though.So, in quality and value for money, get this version of the last man on earth, no other cheap, unrestored or value double or triple pack. This is the one to have. Released by MGM Video/DVD entertainment."},{"rating":"2","title":"One good, one OK","review":"\\"Panic in the Year Zero\\" is an outstanding movie. It is as timely today as it was when made. \\"The Last Man on Earth\\" is OK and Vincent Price carries the day. It did show its European production style with a lot of fits and starts and no smoothness in continuity.Buy the set for \\"Panic in the Year Zero\\" which is thought-provoking and a good survival primer. Watch \\"The Last Man on Earth\\" on a rainy day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another good album","review":"If you are already a fan or new to this couple, you will enjoy this CD. They keep getting better with time. The music is real and the lyrics are well formed. Each of them have great voices in their own right and they sound wonderful together. Truly a blessing."},{"rating":"2","title":"wine rack","review":"I was concerned about the red color when I ordered it. I was worried it would be too orange red. But it wasn't. The color in the picture is accurate. I love the style as it isn't something you see everyday. It looks great in my dining room."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Cool","review":"This is a very neat way to store 12 bottles of wine. It keeps them a a good angle to keep the corks wet and is a conversation piece as well. It is substantially made from heavy wood and good sized bolts so should last \\"forever\\". All in all, a good purchase despite the somewhat high price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice but Pricey!","review":"This is very nice. I use it to hold all my liquor and wine! It is fairly compact but it is heavy and high quality. I think it could still be a little cheaper however, afterall it is just wood and metal. It was pre-assembled and doesn't require any work. It doesn't scratch from use and won't move around when stocking or removing bottles because it is hefty! No disappointments. I'd buy it again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"an artistic option for the modest wine enthusiast","review":"This wine rack is a great decor piece for any kitchen. When the rack arrived I did find a loose screw, however, no defects or poor construction were apparent. The rack is heavier than I expected, which is a good thing. All in all, a great looking wine rack with good heft and a good price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looks great in the kitchen","review":"Comes pre assembled and is very well made.

I highly recommend this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Showed up damaged and Customer service is a joke.","review":"I gave this to the wife for Christmas and when she opened the box and removed the cabinet we discovered 2 out of the 3 hinges were ripped out of the cheap wood that looks like compressed cardboard.I emailed the company and had to go back and forth with them. Send pic's etc..They said they would contact their insurance company and get back to me.It's been 30 days and nothing, not a word.The cabinet is very large and heavy.In time something tells me the hinges would rip out anyway from normal use of opening and closing the door."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"I love love love this mirror! Great quality and looks so nice on the wall. Best of all it holds all my jewelry and keeps it well organized. It is very heavy so we took the advice of some of the previous reviews and used additional anchors when hanging so there is no chance of it falling off the wall. I can't believe how great it looks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good choice for your goldfish.","review":"This food has a good formulation for goldfish. I have a black moor that has been sick for over a year. His water is good, a couple of local fish experts and stores have been helping me, and we can't figure it out. He goes back and forth. I keep his water as healthy as possible and these really help. He looks a lot better when he's eating high quality food. Goldfish are scavengers and they need the mix of protein and veggies that are in this. I like the hard pellets because they are easy for my fish to eat and the keep the water clean. I think this is one of the best balanced foods for my fish. I also give him frozen peas (thawed, without the skins) and those are good for him too. The only reason it does not get 5 stars is that this stuff is expensive for gold-fish food. However, it's much better priced online and it does last a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Goldfish food ROCKS!","review":"Our goldfish was having issues swimming and was floating around the tank so I did search to figure out what was going on. I was feeding him a typical flake food and I guess this was not a good choice. This New Life Spectrum food was suggested so I figured I'd give it a try. I also started feeding him a couple frozen peas every week. Within one day he was swimming normal. Now a couple weeks later his color is so rich and dark and he's growing! I will never feed fish anything else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Uplifting","review":"The artists are at their peak in this recording.

However, it took Amazon and their carrier 2 seperate shipments to get the order here and month worth of waiting. Once it got here for the 2nd time - it was still missing a part. I have yet to receive that other part. think twice and spend the few extra $ and buy locally, perhaps."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy this item locally if you can - Amazon can't get order out complete!","review":"I chose this luggage box because it swings out of the way, but I couldn't order it locally and receive it in time for our upcoming vacation. Amazon said they could get it to me in just a few days. Perfect, I thought! It actually arrived a day earlier than expected - better yet, I thought! NOT SO FAST - I only received box 2 of 2! Called Amazon - after hours (really!) on the phone they said they'd get a replacement order out to me, hoping it would make it in time. The day before we're to leave, the 2nd order arrives - AGAIN BOX 2 of 2! I was furious! Now I have 2 charges on my CC, nothing to put my luggage in, and am waiting for my refund. Amazon has lost me as a customer. Save time - buy or order it locally, even if you have to spend more, it'll be worth it in the long run."},{"rating":"2","title":"Saved me from buying a Minivan!","review":"With two dogs a wife and Child my 2003 Nissan Xterra was getting way too crowded on our road trips and it was either sell the most reliable vehicle I have ever owned and buy a Minivan or come up with another option. Thank God I found the THULE 684 it was like adding an additional trunk to my vehicle. I was fairly simple to put together and came with all the tools you need to put it together with the exception of the license plate holder. Once it's on you do not even notice that it's on the vehicle while driving and had no affect on my gas mileage since it's behind you and not dragging air on the roof.The only two cons are it can be hard to take off and on by yourself and it takes up a bit of space to store when not in use. Other than that I couldn't be happier with my purchase! I would also recommend buying from Amazon they had the lowest price and I also didn't have to pay tax or shipping."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great box!","review":"I bought this box from somewhere other than Amazon as they wouldn't price match ($100 less). Just took delivery today and had it all hooked up and installed in about half an hour. Drove through a hard rain on my way home and the inside of the box was dry when I got home. Cargo box is larger than pictures make it look, but I can't wait to try it out in the near future -- looks like it will hold a lot!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great","review":"I've had this tool for over year, works great.

Regina bought the back of my head with 11:11. Since then, I put the atic in Regina fan.This 7\\" European import single features \\"On the Radio\\" on side A and on side B \\"Ain't No Cover\\" recorded live at Bull Moose Records in Portland Maine.There is a second version of this single. It is also a 7\\" European import of the same title, \\"On the Radio\\". The cover art differs slightly in that Regina looks directly at the camera instead of down and to the right. Also, the B side isn't \\"Ain't No Cover\\" but \\"20 Years of Snow\\" recorded live at Shepherd's Bush Empire. So, Reginaphiles may want to be sure to get both versions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"This was a gift comic book for a huge comic book fan.

I'd tell you more about the story but I'm not done HOWEVER, if you're planning to purchase this book , note that the first sentence is NOT \\"I always hear the flapping of wings.\\" There is a prologue of sorts - a one-page drawing of a half-naked girl with big text saying: \\"AFTER SEX, A BOY'S SWEAT SMELLS LIKE HONEY.\\" There are many more suggestive drawings throughout the book. And a hint of incest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke right away","review":"My wife tried to attach the two pieces together to form the sandwich mold, and the leverage broke the hinge.

They are the best. Do not go with aluminum pie irons - I have seen them melt during use. We use the round, square, and panini style of pie irons, and have mostly positive comments. The only negative comment is that the latch that holds the handles together while cooking could be better designed. It slides down toward the hot end, making it difficult to unlatch. This is common to Rome pie irons. I do not know of a better design, but would buy one if it was available."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Camping Companion","review":"We bought two of the Rome pie irons and will be purchasing atleast two more plus the carrying case before next camping season. Although the irons take some time to prepare when adding the food you will be cooking in them but it's a nice change from hot dogs & burgers. The kids enjoyed using them as well but needed help as they are nice and heavy. These irons will keep for a lifetime if taken care of properly. Good quality & Great buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love my pie iron","review":"I couldn't find a pie iron to save my life in Germany. Amazon thankfully shipped to APOs.I seasoned the iron by slathering it in bacon grease. It readily took a good coating. Once seasoned, off to the fire.It cooks fine. The ridges within the iron gives your sandwich nice grill lines.My only knock is how the irons are secured to the handles. They don't screw in, so they are loose. They are secured by a pin with one end captured, so they are tough to get out. Why would you want to disconnect them in the first place, you ask? It's much easier to take the irons off the handles and season them in the oven, rather than in a fire. A small detail, but annoying nonetheless.Overall, I've really enjoyed this item."},{"rating":"2","title":"I was a hero","review":"So I grew up with a pie iron and I wanted to introduce my kids and wife to this marvel. Other reviewers complained of wasted bread but I felt that the bread we used and how we placed it worked well. We have been making sandwiches all week including a pizza puff. One thing that I forgot is that we need to season it so after my wife washed it, there was some rust on it.My kids love it and so does my wife who is a big grilled cheese fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"As Described","review":"Rome's Square Pie Iron is just as described. You will need two hands to hold it as the iron is plenty heavy. Make sure you season it as instructed to keep the iron in good shape."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"We love this camping tool! We have so far only used a 3 times but so far we are satisfied. We mostly make mountian pies in it.

How can anyone make any kind of sandwich pie? If you want a nice grilled cheese or grilled PB&J or a grilled \\"insert sandwich name here\\" then you have to TRIM the sandwich first. You'll get little snackers, which are not worth the time, energy or wasted bread. As for using this to warm up pie, forget it. The inner cavity is not very deep. I only give this item one star because of the solid construction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tracy Kidder does it again","review":"Ever since reading Tracy Kidder's \\"Soul of a new Machine\\" years ago, I've admired his ability to get you inside the lives, minds and hearts of the people he chronicles.

Please save yourself the headache and pass on this crappy creeper.The FIRST time I used it, the handle to adjust the backrest snapped like a twig, making it completely unusable.I don't think I will ever buy a Torin product again after this incident.I also noticed a lot of the supporting structure was poorly made and loose fitting. There is no way this creeper could stand up to any real use.I would recommend either making due with a conventional creeper, or pony up and buy an expensive one with this adjustable backrest feature."},{"rating":"2","title":"This western is something else","review":"Keep in mind that this work of fiction was written in 1927 so the language is not pc at all.

I wish that hospitals everywhere would buy millions of copies of this book and have them laminated and secured with metal cable to the chairs in the ER waiting area. The authors really \\"hit the nail on the head\\" with this piece. It pays omage to the millions of men and women who work their fingers to the bone in the ER's around the world.

Each one has captured a vital, engaged Todd at the top of his form, in a very different incarnation each time. For this one, he is big-band, large-scale arrangement Todd, pushing the very overlooked and underappreciated Second Wind album of 1991, and treating the fans and diehards to fresh arrangements of classics and some unique remakes. The Marvin Gaye medley folded within a slow, sultry version of \\"Lost Horizon\\" makes this one a must-have, proving that Todd really did invent Philly white-boy soul long before Darryl Hall and John Oates moved to the City of Brotherly Love."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fall apart","review":"These are cheaply made and fall apart.

They are almost completely worthless.Third: Before you order here, do be sure you check out the S&H; very, very carefully.Forth: There are quite a number of like products out there that are so very much better and only cost a wee bit more.It is truly a pity a product such as this ever saw the light of day.

Whenever I wear it, people always ask what I'm wearing. It is one of those fragrances that gently sents the air as you walk by or that begs for a lingering embrace so that your sense of smell can remember it. The first time I tried it I found it on the shelf of a discount store that buys end of the season items. When I returned for more, there was none to be had. I was relieved to find it on Amazon. It is pricey when you consider that you can buy lotion from Target but if you adore a fragrance that not everybody is wearing, this is one for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Words on Revelation","review":"This is one of those books that I did not enjoy reading but I still feel the book is important.

Instead I've found about the history of VC and about FFF sources of money. Cover to cover: less than 15 minutes.

Those songs are just beautiful. \\"Breakin Away\\", \\"Until My Change\\", and \\"No Weapon\\" were good also. Commissionned vocals were nice on this project and Marvin Sapp sounded awesome.All I can say that this is a must have for any Commissioned fan. I remember they used to play the majority of these songs on the radio in the late 90s and their still hits in my opinion. I haven't listened to this CD in awhile, now I can't stop listening to it.

He also wrote the very compelling noir masterpiece entitled The Hot Spot. The Wrong Venus therefore represents a 180 degree departure from William's usual literary fare. It's an over-the-top comedy about Americans in Paris.This very funny book is populated with a number of interesting characters. A spinsterish authoress of best selling sex drenched novels, some thoroughly inept kidnappers, a ruthless French gangster and a six foot tall blond beauty of a ghostwriter who's pretty good at judo... to name only a few. There's also plenty of slapstick action and an abundance of very clever dialogue.The Wrong Venus is a wonderfully entertaining showcase for a surprisingly different side to Charles William's substantial talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"You want wacky?

One zippered chest pocket is perfect for my iPhone. We travel extensively, sometimes for several months at a time through a variety of countries, so flexible pocketing is a must for me. This baby has it in multiple ways.Since we are leaving April 6 for a long cruise, then continuing to Sicily and N. Africa ending up in Rome for May, I am delighted with the zip off sleeves. I can stay warm shipboard, zip off the sleeves in Africa and put them back on if it's warm in Rome early May.I would highly recommend this jacket for anyone spending lots of time traveling and outdoors in a variety of temperatures."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst disc ever","review":"Don't be tempted by the low price.

But there are times that I wish I wasn't a Lugosi fans, and one of those times ws when watching \\"Murder by Television\\". Apart from Lugosi, this movie has nothing going for it. It is dull, even at less than one hour, and the plot is completely uninteresting. And even Lugosi's performance isn't that interesting, since he's given no opportunity to show what he's capable of.Save your time and money. Re-watch one of his other movies instead.

We discover him to be just another red herring as he is killed later on in the film. However, all is not lost. Bela's twin brother (?), a federal inspector, shows up and in only five minutes, unmasks the killer. Why couldn't he have shown up thirty minutes before and saved us all this dull talk? Look for Hattie McDaniel in an early role as the stereotypical servant.

This story also tempting the people who wants to travel to the USA. She didn't need to go through a life threatening journey to write this book. Non fiction story is not just a story, we need to think about artifacts. Of-course this book is useful for students who study English as a second language for vocabulary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enriques Journey","review":"In our opinion, Enrique's Journey is the best book you can read about immigrants. We have never heard of a son risking his life just to find out if his mother still loves him. This book makes us want to thank are mothers for not abandoning us like Lourdes did to Enrique. The way Sonia Nazario writes the book is clear. We could easily understand what the characters went through however, the way it ended wasn't as powerful as it began. Without this book, we may have not known what immigrants go through to come to the United States to have a better life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Important reading","review":"Too much extraneous detail about daily personal interactions within the family will dissuade some from reading the book cover-to-cover.

Almost everyone, including fellow students as well as my professors, found this novel to be extremely repetitive and not a very engaging read. The author does a poor job of creating a linear narrative for the story, and the myriad of places and people Enrique encounters are not really explored at depth. His relationships with the people he meets along the way are essentially ignored, and I came away with the impression that Enrique literally did not have a personality whatsoever. I realize that this is a (mostly) non-fiction account of a difficult journey, but the best journalists make their subjects interesting and human; Ms. Nazario fails in both respects."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gripping","review":"Enrique's Journey was a real eye opener! I was totally unaware of the fact that Latin American mothers would leave their childred to come to the US to work illegally until they could make enough to go back and settle down, only to be caught up in low paying jobs and rarely making enough to go back to children who feel totally abandonded by them! Should she stay in poverty or risk losing her children in lowpaying dead end jobs and have emotionally damaged children in teh long run. Terrible choice to make. Enrique (16) takes a 21,000 mile journey on the tops or freight trains and suffers starvation, beatings, theft as he makes his way to find his mother who left him at age 5. Moving, enlightening and heartbreaking. Highly recommend it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best non-fiction book of the year","review":"I read this story when it was in the LA Times and couldn't wait for the book.I read the story cover to cover in a weekend and thought it was the best non-fiction work I have read in years.

Thank you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Enrique's LONG LONG LONG Journey","review":"I had to give up on this book as I felt like the author was just never able to advance the story beyond Enrique's multiple attempts at trying to enter the United States. Definitely compelling material but Ms. Nazario's inability to move the story along, in my opinion, left me feeling like the book was a really awful Groundhog Day that just kept playing over and over and over again. Maybe I'll try it again in a few months but definitely left feeling letdown that the book could not live up to what I thought would be a great piece of literature."},{"rating":"2","title":"gripping reading","review":"I'm about halfway through this book, and despite a hectic work schedule I'm looking forward to finishing it up soon.

Given the front page news about immigration recently, the books feels very relevant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Writing style for Journey-","review":"What the people do to overcome their poverty and separation from their mothers was truly amazing. The story was very inspirational but depressing. As a journalist, Ms. Nazario is very talented and courageous. However, we read this in my book club and we all felt we were reading a long article out of the newspaper. In order to transfer a journalist writing style in book format we believe she needed some assistance. Half of the people in our book club did not finish it due to that.

Additionally, the complicated familial relationships are woven beautifully into the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Puts Mexican border patrol in perspective","review":"(Bought from belltowerbooks) This book was so fascinating. I had to read this for a class and I'm glad I did! This is the story of Enrique and his incredible journey from Mexico to the USA. It puts into perspective that though we may be in hard economic times, some people would risk their lives just for the freedom we have, to be able to make enough money to care for their families that they may never see again. I recommend giving yourself time to read this book, it's tough to put down if the subject interests you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"enrique's Journey","review":"Have you ever wondered what drives thousands of people to enter the US illegally along our southern border? Enrique's Journey is the true story of an impoverished Honduran family and the risks its members take to find the resources to keep themselves alive. I had no idea of the huge numbers of children who flee to our country, looking for the parents who had immigrated to find work in order to support their families back in Mexico and the Central American countries. Difficult to read, but impossible to put down, Enrique's Journey advances the dialogue we need to have in this country over immigration.

I took a CPR course at a local hospital, but felt it would be good to keep my skills fresh, just in case! This DVD is just the ticket. The instructor is clear and precise in her explanations, and she even covers the newest guidelines soon to be released by the major CPR instruction agencies. As an extra bonus, there is excellent material covering infant and child safety measures you should take around your house to prevent sudden and unexpected tragedies. It's all supported by a board certified pediatrician, so you know you are getting great information.

I suggest every family with infants/children watch a DVD or tape like this yearly or take a class.

It starts with anatomy, then physiology, normal then abnormal, and has entire chapters dedicated to different classes of drugs. It explains everything starting at the basics, so even those that have very little cardio knowledge will understand the text.

To prevent a scandal, Noelle and Jared marry. Life gets complicated...This is one of the best Diana Palmer stories. Both Noelle and Jared are believable characters, with flaws and qualities. Their reactions ring true and their emotions are well drawn. Noelle, green as she is, soon gets a backbone and holds her own. The law practice and its cases are a nice sub-plot.It's a pretty clean romance, with heavy petting before marriage and only two sex scene (not really graphic) after."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same old story from Diana Palmer","review":"I gave up on Diana Palmer a few years ago but picked up this book at a thrift shop just to see if her style had changed a bit.

But you have been warned. How would I describe these guys...The grit of James Brown and Curtis Mayfield (without the funk), the lyrics of Jim Morrison (maybe without the poetry but all the alcohol), maybe not even the lyrics of Jim Morrsion, the showmanship of Elvis Presley (with the hip gyrations), the raw and raunch of Prince (without the soul), aw..its just Greg Dulli at his best.

My power supply shut down my system. My system is ok and I am using my old ATI 9800 card again.

The interface isn't very professional looking either.Sorry if these comments seem a bit negative, but given the cost and hassels, I strongly suggest considering other options.

The last response from ATI was \\"When Gemstar fixes the issue they will fix it and you will update successfully\\". I have been polite with them up to this point but this really fried me.

The protagonist is supposed to turn into a werewolf after receiving eyes transplanted from a wolf. You see, in the beginning of the movie our stalwart hero is blinded rescuing a co-worker. However, the werewolf never materializes.For a horror movie, it makes a great comedy. The plot and action are ridiculous. For about 20 minutes of the movie we see our hero running through the woods bare chested with a pack of wolves. I would rather have watched the incredibly talented and beautiful heroine in the movie, Tinsel Korey, running through the woods bare chested.Please do not waste your time and money on this absolute bore. It is almost as exciting as a speech by Barack Obama."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hybrid","review":"Surprisingly well made despite never even being heard of by me or my sci-fi friends. There is no actual werewolf or wolfman in it but it is more like a combination of Dark Angel with Jessica Alba and any werewolf movie. Genetic experimentation gone wrong(or very right?).

My interest was stimulated by a trip to Spain and the realization of my ignorance of Spanish history. This led me to Marks' Cortes, which is not as long as some other treatments of the conquest of Mexico. I literally could not put this book down. After reading it, it is difficult not to admire Cortes, who was incredibly persistent in face of incredible risks. The fact that the Aztecs were even more brutal than the Spanish cuts against the common assessment of Cortes as one of history's villains."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fuze installation.","review":"Am very satisfied with this item it fitted into the carrier as expected and the quality of the item indicates it will operate as intended.

I put it in my tape player and almost had an accident driving. This CD is full of God's sprit from the beginning until the end. It opens up with the Jazzy but churchy song Christ Did It All. Min. Kirvy Brown then takes the mike and makes everyone wants to make it to that city. Calling My name is a very emotional ballad led by Timothy Figruoe. It shows that even though we may fall millions of times, God is still calling and welcoming us back home. Sis. Monique Walker did no waste no time letting the anoiting fall on her on the song Let the Glory which she led previously on the Focus on Glory album. Even though the song is 13 minutes long, she does note bore you but when she is through singing that song, it will make you want to get up and shout.

I'll admit that MOST of his good stuff is here, but close doesn't count. Rhino usually does a fairly good job on their greatest hits packages, and Zevon would seem to be an easy candidate. But where is \\"Sentimental Hygeine\\"? That song received plenty of airplay when released, and it even had a video on MTV. Forgotten? Ignored? Not by me! I'm certainly not saying this as a disgruntled fan whose particular odd favorite was not included - S.H. is one of his greatest and definitely should be here. Thumbs down for its omission, which makes the title of this CD misleading.Thumbs up on the sound, however - very clear and rich. And the booklet and liner notes are very entertaining. So there's two stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"What about the missing pieces?","review":"As with many 'greatest hits' recordings, they have forgotten to include some of the artist's best work. DOH!Where is 'Mohammed's Radio' or 'Desperadoes Under The Eaves' and some other REAL greatest hits.. Why must the selection be based on accessability, radio favorites and some frankly lesser works?Another beef with this recording - the cover. We know Warren has a sense of humour (bless him!) but did he have artistic approval for this 'epitaph'?A little sensitivity in song selection and in cover art would do the record company some credit.Some well-informed Zevon 'nerds' should be brought in to put together a suitable tribute to the most talented 'nerd' of our times.May I be the first nerd in the queue to volunteer my services."},{"rating":"1","title":"warren who","review":"zevon sucks man. i don't see what all the rave is about. maybe he's intelligent, i could see that, but his lyrics are poorly crafted and his word choices are angular and rough and defeat any spirit his ideas may have had. although i do like werewolves of london, that song is good, but that's it, that i've heard anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"From a Zevon novice's perspective","review":"Unlike most of you, I knew Zevon had a reputation as a great singer/songwriter but prior to hearing this CD, I wasn't familiar with most of his work. I can't say how close this comes to capturing his finest work in a single volume, but it's very good and I can't imagine there could be much fine-tuning that would make for a better single CD compilation.Granted, for a guy who's best known as a writer I'd probably axe \\"A Certain Girl\\" and Prince cover \\"Raspberry Beret\\", but many artists go entire careers without writing a song as witty as \\"Werewolves\\" let alone the other gems to be found here like \\"Carmelita\\",\\"Roland the Headless Thompson Gunner\\",\\"Looking for the Next Best Thing\\", \\"Reconsider Me\\", and \\"Mr. Bad Example\\".BOTTOM LINE:This convinced me I need to hear full albums by Zevon. Since \\"greatest hits\\" collections aren't usually compiled for die-hard fans, I'd say that means the CD does its job."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for Warren Z fans","review":"Has some Warren Z tunes that will make you leave it in the player just one more time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alan D .

For anyone who is a Zevon fan I can recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine Look At Great Singer/Songwriters Career","review":"This 22 track collection covers all of Zevon's albums (save for 2 live albums and 2 previous compilations). It even includes his one-off project with R.E.M. minus Michael Stipe on the Prince cover \\"Raspberry Beret.\\" There are brief (but not great) liner notes. The notes fail to tell the story of Zevon's career. Lyrics to each song are included, as are album/song/musician info for each song. The CD was co-compiled by Zevon. If you're new to Zevon this makes a better choice than the excellent 2CD I'll Sleep When I'm Dead from 1996. But long-time fans will find it a handy sampler of some of Zevon's best moments. Let me also recommend these studio albums: Warren Zevon (76), Excitable Boy (78), Sentimental Hygiene (87), Life'll Kill Ya (2000) and My Ride's Here (2002).

While I was disappointed at the lack of practical applications of the book, it did help to open my eyes to the idea of White Dominance. There are factors of a white-dominated culture that are invisible to us whites, and Howard does a good job of bringing those to light.Much of the book is comprised of personal narratives, about Howard living in an economically-recessed area while attending Yale. It was then that he began to question his assumptions about racism, and the rest is history.I do, however, believe that he is using this book as a way of marketing his REACH center, which is an organization that trains teachers in cultural awareness, and also designs curricula for schools.Overall, this book is a good place to start when considering the implications and hazards of teaching other cultures, but just the book by itself does little to enlighten."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for discussing a difficult topic","review":"Simple illustrations, like a child's colorful drawings, fill the pages of this book. The book asks questions as a child might - what is death, what happens to the body when we die, why does everyone want to know about death, what happens to the inside of a person (their funny stories, feelings, thoughts, ideas, love) when they dies?The answsers are sensible. Boritzer talks about what different cultures do with the body, different beliefs of the soul and afterlife (including people who belief nothing happens), what death might be as seen by different people, and how making life meaningful now can help a person's memory live on.Not a book about grieving, with no definite answers, this is a good book to keep on the bookshelf for the time when the questions will be raised by your child."},{"rating":"1","title":"Contemplating","review":"This is not for ages 4-8 .

And I like the references to God seen as someone who takes care of us no matter what (even if this does not mean not to take any action in our life because whatever happens is God's will and this seems to be the author's message, instead). However, I was disappointed to learn that the author sees as solution to the problem a lifetime abstinence. This is totally out of order and I think it's unhealthy, too. I once saw a very good nutrionist who told me that in this life we can eat anything, even a burger and chips from McDonald. What matter is self-control and a lifelong eating balance, not a lifelong eating abstinence. That's so wrong that I wonder how she managed to have her book published!!

It all seemed to be a preachy, Christian approach to a complex problem. Debi herself was forced to admit that she had had an abortion to her father. Why? Why was she forced to discuss this with her father? How did the counselors know that Debi would be physically and emotionally safe after this disclosure?

The nature and extent of these attacks are gruesome and I dount any country faced with this on a daily basis would do anything less than build a wall (and probably do a lot more).Israel, just like any other sovereign country, has a right to defend itself and the wall is completely justified. There has never been a state of palestine and so the claims that this is a land grab are complete fabrications."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book.","review":"This was one of the first books I read dealing with hauntings, witchcraft and, of course, Id never heard of minniwickies before.When I first started getting heavily into reading horror books, after breaking away from the big names like Stephen King and Dean Koontz, I started reading all kinds of authors, but this one stuck with me and I've read it several times since then. From the first pages it draws you in, has suspense, humor and edge of your seat, page turning moments of action. I won't say anymore since there are plenty of well written reviews. But it's definitely worth the extra cash to check it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Counseling","review":"This book has been helpful in that it gives a good perspective on the various challenges that african americans may face with issues that confront them.

This leads to attempts on your life, and then suspicion by the local law. Is somebody in the sherriff department working for the wrong side of the law? Travis must find out as he sorts his way through a cast of mysterious women in this highly entertaining tale. Our hero is stuck in Cypress County, by order of the sherriff. Somebody in the department almost beats the life out of Meyer, putting Travis into early revenge mode, and motivating him to get involved in a mystery where nobody requested his services. In the end, I was pleased and stunned by several facets of the solved mystery, and Travis weaves his way through many harrowing experiences to stay alive. This is clearly one of the best 3 McGee books (along with Amber and Green)."},{"rating":"2","title":"MacDonald's Travis McGee has a knack for finding trouble.","review":"In this early Travis McGee novel, brought to audio by the smooth-talking Darrin McGavin, the sense of the Deep South is portrayed vividly. One can almost smell the musky cypress swamps and feel the heat and humidity that are integral to this story.

Absolutely nothing. It's an OK setup and Scudder goes about his business in the usual way and sometimes that can be a little tiring, what with his eating, talking, thinking about drinking and other trivia, but most of the time those things are surrounded by a story. I really don't see how anyone would enjoy this unless they are so caught up in the Matt Scudder saga they just have to know every trivial thing about him. It was agony finishing this book. I only did because I expected better from Mr. Block."},{"rating":"1","title":"a Scudder disappointment","review":"Not all of the Matthew Scudder crime novels are equal.

As we move through the pages we lose respectfor our detective friend. Block seems to lose the thread of thisstory, as we wander through Scudder's relationships with hisarray of offbeat characters. They are interesting in themselves,but lend little to the storyline. Block decides he must finish thisbook somehow and gives us such a lame ending. I wanted tohave a deeper understanding of Holtzmann's nefarious dealings. After trailingthis man for so many pages only to have him shot as a mistakenidentity. Oh please.

The murder happens on page 17 of 316 and there is absolutely zero progress on solving the crime until about 231 pages into it. The intervening pages are mired in musings about alcoholism, transexuals, the morality of suicide, yada, yada, yada. B-o-r-i-n-g.

Most have smart, rocking arrangements that on first impression sound like Sam Coomes is dabbling, which sound better and better with repeated listening.The third cut, Black Cat Moan, takes the best of what made Led Zepplin great and squeezes it into three minutes of pure pleasure. It's my favorite new song in about a year.The album is kind of a new generation of white-boy blues but purer and with more emotion than you'll find with Jon Spencer (where it's a joke) or the White Stripes (where it's a pose). Plus the sax solo at the end of the disk is terrific."},{"rating":"1","title":"GREAT Artwork--Less than stellar music","review":"There were two reasons I purchased this CD: 1) The artwork and, 2) the song selection (Especially \\"Drunken Spree\\").

I make a lot of home made greeting cards and use tons of address labels and they print out perfectly, too. I don't think I've ever had a paper jam. Just recently, I was able to install this printer into my Gateway laptop (Windows Vista) that I bought in 2007. It not only installed very easily (I'm NOT a computer wiz) but it prints very well. I did, of course, have to buy a new (parallel) cable and it works! If I still want to print from the desktop, all I have to do is unhook the new cable and plug in the old one.

The text is boring to read, and difficult to work with. I found it very difficult to integrate into my course.

To make waffle cuts you have to rotate the food you are cutting 1/4 turn for each cut. Because of this, the slices come out a bit thinner than you think they will. My first try at this, the potatoes were more like chips than fries. So for waffle cuts, you need to set the blade for a thicker cut.

Phillips on the issue of Indian Removal and is a must read for those interested in a more detailed academic understanding of the issue. The problem with this edition is a very annoying one and it has to do with the printing and layout. The edition has been created using optical scanning of an original book that translates the original text into its current format. The problem here is that they clearly did not do any editing or try to correct layout issues. The result is a book where the original footnotes have become incorporated into the body of the text, which makes it extremely difficult to read. It also results in other layout and typographical errors that are glaring and problematic. My advice is to spend the extra cash to get a better original edition of some sort because this book is tough enough to read without trying to decipher the screwed up layout."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Entertaining Movie!!!!","review":"I first viewed this movie when it first came out and loved it.I had forgotten all about it untill 2 weeks ago, when while looking on amazon, saw its listing.

We're now 4 for 4 in our family!This movie sets up a great situation and then does a good job playing out all the threads with its major themes, particularly the preconceptions of the supposedly 'liberal' neighbors.

The whole situation with Samuel Jackson being mistaken for a thief while moving into his house due to the prejudices of the community starts out the film with some decent humor, but once the addition of real crook Nicolas Cage comes in to do cleanup for the chief the story just feels sloppy. Cage and Jackson are A+ as always, really good acting and tremendous fun watching them interact, but it's just not that well written.

An ex con captures a boy as hostage, the police force is aware of that, but meanwhile a warm and tender relationship is built among this smart boy and this outlaw, until the fate makes its definitive judgment.Clint Eastwood directed this uneven film, spattered of interesting vignettes here and there, but unprovided of dramatic consistency; however I would like to remark this is the best performance of Costner in his lifetime; extremely convincing in this hard role, due the multiple psychological turns inside this tormented and hopeless human being.Laura Dern gives too a remarkable performance in that secondary role, the film is overlong, specially toward the end and that weakens the climax sequence; on the other hand the boy's character looks pretty stereotyped, but it's Costner's performance that leads this movie to safe waters and avoids it strands in the middle of the road."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very, very touching movie","review":"This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. It tells us so much about the world, about what is good and evil. The world is a better place when you have someone like Butch, Red and Sally. Their warm hearts give us hope. On the other hand, many are selfish, indifferent and even cold-blooded, like the guy who works for the government. I do not understand how can anyone be so cold-blooded. I wish the end could be different. I really do. A warm ending would be less dramatic and probably would not make sense. But it does make you feel a hell lot better and no need to work hard to hold back your tears. I hope everyone who watches this movie has someone like Butch in your life.

He manages to make an escaped convict both realistic and sympathetic. The child actor playing Phillip/Buzz is also wonderful. Clint Eastwood is Clint Eastwood and though I have never been a Laura Dern fan she does well in her role as a criminologist. The script is not perfect and the movie is over long but still compelling and very watchable. The movie is set on Halloween and the couple of days following in 1963 Texas. JFK's upcoming Dallas trip plays a small part in the film and helps anchor the setting firmly in the viewer's mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Costner Film","review":"This one of Costner's best. It has great supporting actors (including Eastwood) and really keeps you involved. In some ways it's like the typical police action seen in TV shows, but it goes much deeper, exploring the extreme sides of Butch (the main character) and the search for guidance of a little boy.

It was unbelievable that the film-makers included several instances of child abuse and neglect near the end of the movie (the kid, Cleveland didn't seem to do anything wrong to deserve to be bashed like that by his father). The man played by Costner cared for his kidnapee, but had to be negligant at times to people to avoid being detained by the cops (i.e. stealing a Stationwagon from a family, allowing the kid to steal a costume from a store, being tyrannical enough to duct tape a family that gave them one day of \\"kind hospitality\\").

The author's research might be impressive -- he implies that much of the material in the book was never publicly stated before -- but he has no ability to present it in an interesting way.The chapters are short, and most of them cover one assassination. They all start to sound alike after a while. And there's little context to them. If you already know a lot about Israeli politics and history, perhaps the book is more meaningful.

It gives clear definitions of what we need to look for in a mate. What areas we can not compromise on. What areas are less vital.It offers suggestions for how to be in the right relationship and it also talks about making ourself into the person we would want to marry. A person who is looking to give is the person most ready for marriage. So many of us look at marriage as a give and take and this can hurt marriages a lot.It offers some very traditional advice that include not touching before marriage which may be going a bit far for most.

The fact that Jill herself had a lot of influence in what went into the book makes it defy you to pity her. Her down to earth approach to life and all it has thrown at her is truly inspirational, and the book takes the same tone.Anyone who likes biographies, anyone who is interested in Jill's amazing story, anyone who just wants a rattling good non-fiction read that is more dramatic than much fiction, should get a copy of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgusted!","review":"I saw this book on a website advertised as some sort of book exposeing ID Schemes.

If you're a long-time fan, you'll enjoy hearing again what it was that made him a unique voice, what it was that grabbed your attention at a time when so many intriguing artists were calling out to us. If you're new to his music, you'll first be amazed at how much of his stuff you actually know or have heard, but that feeling will give way to a sense of discovery: this guy was gifted in ways he didn't live long enough to fully understand himself, and yet he left us so much first rate material as he caromed from one artistic adventure to another.And if you can get a more-or-less clean copy on old vinyl, put it on a good turntable with a decently balanced turntable and a gentle stylus - and you'll understand what all the gibbering about vinyl is all about.

I'd paid big bucks for the import in the late 90s, and that was such a disappointment, sonically.Well, despite reviews to the contrary, the sonics on this release are not much better, and do not hold a candle to the original LP. My old LP may have a few pops, but it blows this CD release away, sonically.

You can also catch Bobby Carcasses in another RMM release of Chucho Valdes titled LIVE, from 1998, also by Ralph Mercado. If it were not for Ralph Mercado's efforts with this and the Forbidden Cuba CD series, Carcasses would be even less known. The FORBIDDEN CUBA series is a collection of some 10 CDS that feature top Cuban musical acts of all kinds of styles. All of them are very good.

If this book was written when 1.2 gig drives were \\"newer and higher capacity\\", some serious revision is in order.

The message says to retrieve his staff of strength. It was a trap though. The Ice Wizard really wanted them to find his eye which he traded to the Norns for wisdom. The norns gave his eye to the Frost Giant, who lives in the Hollow Hill. The Frost Giant put the eye in a hailstone, in a hole, in the Hollow Hill. The climax of the story happens when Jack and Annie go in the Hollow Hill to find the eye of the Ice Wizard. With a little magic, they just might find everything they are looking for.

This is a book written from the heart of a child, not a Therapist, removing the techical terminology. If the memories are repressed, this book will bring them out of the dark and into conciousness, at least in glimpses. It is at this point, though not easy, the memories will start to heal.

It's not for the faint-of-heart, to be sure. It's not for those who get nervous at the thought of something outside their own experience. But it *is* for anyone who ever wondered what it must be like to be a part of a Multiple... Well written, poignantly described. Make sure to keep a tissue handy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Triumph over tragedy","review":"I found this book an incredible read. Once I picked up the book, I could not put it down, except when the graphic details got to be too much.

It's important to remember that each multiple is different, and each multiple's experience is different. In that way, I find the idea that this is an \\"insight into the world of MPD\\" to be laughable.I am of the view that one can be multiple, and one can be disordered; the two are very different things. However, if you are multiple, and have been disordered, you might well end up like this.Nonetheless, I found it a fascinating read - and just incidentally, a direct documentation of the sorts of sickening abuse that many children are subject to.In that light, I find the infestation of \\"denial\\" reviews to be fascinating.

It is a gripping story, at times difficult to follow so reading the Introduction, Authors' Note and Epilogue is very enlightening. It is amazing the author was able to create the story from the journal kept, recounting the flashes of memory that gradually lead to the discovery of the 92 different personalities within Truddi Chase. The accounts of traumatic events are shocking. One can understand how healing this effort must be. I can see why this was a NY Times #1 bestseller. A good read to expand your range of books. This book presents some nice thought challenges as you try to figure out what the author is referring to in the writing. Certainly a nice change of pace if you're in a boring reading rut."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book.","review":"This book is so wonderful - a great look into the mind of someone with Multiple Personalities.

And I really did give it a try. I read over 100 pages into the book, which I think gives a book more than a fair chance to grip the reader, but it didn't do it for me. The writing is confusing, albeit I tried to be patient with that because of the different Troop members talking. But the narrator kept alluding to something huge that never happened. It was always, \\"she would learn about this in time.\\" A few times of building up suspense like that is fine, but it kept happening over and over again with little to no information revealed to the reader. I just got tired of it. Maybe someone with more patience with information being VERY slowly revealed will enjoy it, but it's not for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"books for research","review":"Doing research for my writing can get expensive so I am grateful that I can get used books for reading material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Written As Though It Were Untrue","review":"This book was written in a dull style, with a lack of detail about her day-to-day existence that caused me to consider it fiction. I don't mean to offend, but knowing MPD sufferers, I just didn't believe Ms Chase. Some of her claims, such as burning out all the lightbulbs in her house with her intense psychic scramble, are just preposterous and more indicative of schizophrenic delusion."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Very Dull Howl","review":"The writing in Truddi Chase's book is almost unreadable. You would have to be awfully interested in how she perceives herself in order to follow the ins and outs of 92 alters, all reminiscent of made-for-television scripts. The book opens with a screen-play like reportage of a deeply significant conversation at which the author was not present - several such occur in the book. The author also mentions that her mother said she \\"lies a lot.\\" It ends with her stuffing homegrown maggots up her putative abuser's nose and feeding him tapeworms (provenance not mentioned). In this environment, even though we are told that 20% of children are abused, her accusations of incest take on the character of those in the Salem witch trials. Also annoying is the author's insistent self praise -always in the third person - \\"the woman\\" -this tall, willowy blonde has achieved insights given to few mystics, is exceedingly articulate, etc., etc. Ugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Howling for the truth","review":"I found it hard to believe that this woman was not completely overtaken by the desires of the therapist, which came through clearly in the influence shown throughout the tale, to have a MPD patient he could brag about and show off. Abuse, in my and the experience of all the abused women I know, is never forgotten; it is burned--every excruciating detail--into the mind. This book is completely unbelievable and defies reality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrifying harrowing and ultimately inspiring","review":"This is definately one of the most powerful books I've ever read. True story of a woman who developed 92 distinct personalities as a result of the horrific incest and physical torture she suffered throughout her childhood since the age of 2. Written by the woman herself in the voices of her various \\"troops\\". As, with the help of her therapist, she slowly uncovers the nightmare of her childhood. A very harrowing book, not for the timid, but also inspiring because of the woman's incredible courage and the fascinating coping mechanism she developed to cope with unimaginable horror."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incomparable","review":"I never read a book like this one that I can compare with When Rabbit Howls. THis is the most intriguing, fascinating, and extraordinary book I have ever read. I am studying counseling/ psychology right now and D.I.D.,formerly M.P.D. is such a fascinating topic for me. It just amazes me to see the extraordinary capabilities of our minds. THis is not a pleasant read by any means. THis books get in your heart and sets you on a journey searching for answers about the cruelty of humanity. How could one human being do these things to another? And how does the victim survive? It's all in defense mechanism of the mind shielding the soul from complete shutdown. IF you are not easily disturbed, or overly doubtful read this book with an open mind. Read this book. It will change the way you see the hidden world. THe world that is reality now, that we all ignore so easily, acting like this is normal.

LC phoned this one in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick to Composing","review":"The material on this CD, while not quite as good as some of Cohen's work,is still of very high quality. Cohen's voice, while never good, is absolutely frightful on this album. It is almost impossible to listen to the CD in one sitting-the strain on the ears is too great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as bad as Ten New Songs but close","review":"That's about all I can say about it. I've managed to listen through to the end (which I couldn't with TNS despite trying twice) but it left me cold. There are real instruments this time; but it's still essentially a poetry reading to a background accompaniment.I read with astonishment a reviewer of TNS, who suggested that the new stuff is as good as the old and that the first few albums were not LC's golden age. (S)he is so wrong. Admittedly, as a 17 year old when The Songs Of LC was released, my recollections of the album are inextricably bound up with Saturday evening parties and the mysteries that I discovered there. But anyone, who grew up with the early Cohen albums (up to and including New Skin I would suggest), will remember the impact they had and the feelings they aroused. I defy any teenager to make out to Dear Heather."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flat","review":"I treasure Leonard Cohen and always look forward to his new albums with glad anticipation. This is despite the fact that seldom does he have an album that does not have at least one song that is irritating. But these songs are usually overshadowed by songs of brilliant aching beauty and wry wit.Not so here.This album sounds like discards that might have been dusted off to make an album after the artist has died. The production values that made 10 New Songs so enjoyable seem stale and flat here.Nowhere is there a good tale. These abbreviated haiku-like snippets seem like rough drafts rather than finished works. Leonard's voice, never his strong suit, sounds worse than ever.This is most peculiar, because on a couple tracks, he shows that he can still carry a tune.His powerful imagery and enlightening poetry is almost completely absent. The title track is inane.I like to introduce Cohen to new listeners. I will not be using this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"He's too old for this stuff...","review":"Frankly, the guy sounds like a stalker following a Junior High School girl home from school.

This is some truly occultic, truly dark, and ultra surreal music that will evoke powerful emotion and enchant the listener into a forbidden realm that only Sopor Aeternus is able to capture. About %50 of this record is in german, and those tracks are all verry good. The absolute best tracks on the record are \\"Hades Pluton\\" and \\"The Sleeper\\".

Looks like a low budget college project. Scenes drawn out too long (problems with pacing). Irritating shaking of the camera, jumping about to create a disorienting effect in scenes where it had no purpose. (Seriously, Blair Witch has alot to answer for.)Protagonists make all the cliche'd mistakes to the point that you want to slap them.

The girls came up with some more 'updated' dvds and this is one of them. Not bad, for a belly-workout dvd. Pretty visuals, easy to follow, but compared to their older more traditional dancing that worked on EVERYTHING as you danced, this is more of a repetitive 'target zone' workout. I'd rather learn how to do those isolations, hip drops, chest lifts, and put it into dance THEN practice, than having the movements broken down into 'up and down' without the flow of movement that the old dvds had. (If you've seen the old ones, you know what I mean). I hate to see what the indi-hop one looks like. It seems the girls are trying to keep up and have their share of new stuff. Go back to the previous dvds to get the goods. At least you'll find the basics broken down so you can learn them, then put them into a routine at the end. May as well go to the gym and count out sit ups if you get this dvd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many breaks, not a continuous workout","review":"I don't like this video. I thought it would be a good cardio and strength conditioning workout, but it isn't. My heartrate hardly increased, there were too many breaks, it wasn't a continuous workout...between each segment, they stop and pose and then move on to the next segment. They strength conditioning, and ab work is between two cardio segments...it's just not a good structured workout. I like the Bellydance Fitness for Beginners: Slim Down by the Belly Twins better...it's a continuous cardio workout that will increases my heartrate and has me breaking a sweat...although, I did buy this a while back on VHS; however, the DVD should be the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Workout!","review":"This is definitely a great workout. It has everything from toning your arms, abs, hips, buns, and thighs. They incorporate belly dance as well, like snake arms, and shimmies. Since I've been bellydancing for a while I feel it's great practice for me. If you have never bellydanced it will be fun to shimmy the first time. Don't expect it to be a ALL bellydance routine, it has several exercises that are meant to workout different muscle groups. The whole DVD is about 70 minutes long, so if you don't have time to do the whole workout, skip to the abs or cardio. They have stretching in the end as well. I think its a great overall workout and I do recommend it to anyone who wants to get results overall."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coot Club","review":"Pure nostalgia for me.

Once again, we're given the idea that it is perfectly acceptable to judge girls (and women) by their appearance. One page even mentions having a \\"bad hair day.\\" The last page is the kicker, though, because it has a large, shiny mirror that the reader can use to decide for herself whether or not she looks like a princess.

It has to do with ethics. All of the material in the original series was relevant to an understanding of the many perspectives of a very complex situation.

You know, win the hearts and minds of the people. The Army is doing this to 'teach' the people to bath not knowing that Vietnamese people bath twice a day.

I would have given it 1 star, but it does technically work. I hate the way that it feels. I know that this is personal preference, but my husband and my daughter do also. It is hesitant to move around the screen, but the worst part is the scroll function. Maybe I should rephrase that and call it the scroll malfunction. It takes forever to get from the top to the bottom of the page and you have to keep clicking it. That is the most irritating part of using it. Mine had to be directly in front of the receiver in order to work right and for that you might as well get one with a cord. Basically this thing had to go.

Then it started quiting after looking up some information on the net i came to the conclustion your money is better spent on a more expensive mouse since this mouse will not last you out. Evenually i figured to remove the cover from the reciver. Doing this offered me the ablitiy to atleast temporatly use the mouse, but considering what i know form electronices a small thin piece of plastic should not make that much of a differance.

I could depress the scroll wheel to engage the up-down screen wipe but couldn't train myself to substitute this action for good scroll wheel accuracy in moving up and down a web page.After numerous attempts to reconnect the mouse for better response, no luck, back in the box it goes.The mouse does respond on 1 AA battery.

Let's look at a few things: \\"Let Me In\\" original version contains the lyric \\"Don't tell me you want money\\" instead of 'it's so funny'. This version of \\"Runnin' Round This World\\" is NOT the album version but rather one that has no relation [on the LP Signe Anderson sings lead] to the album, and humorously censored by RCA [probably 'just for authenticity to this disc...]. Plus, the lyrics to \\"Run Around\\" were different on the original LP as well. So you have 3 songs that have no relation to the original LP. However, we can't afford these $... pressings to hear these things [RCA obviously doesn't care, and still frowns on the lyrics,most likely] , so you should find a tape trader who can get you a tape of the original record.

They required multiple rolled blankets, pillows, mats, chairs, wall surfaces etc... and even once I had the set-up complete, the exercise only lasted 3 minutes before another, completely different set-up, using different props, was required. Because I am new to yoga, perhaps my expectations were off - but every yoga class I've been to required minimal equipment, which is one of the reasons I liked it.

If you are looking for a quirky, good spirited, odd kind of movie, this will work for you. I like it probably more than the average person just cause how much I watched it when I was a little kid.

I watched this movie growing up and still loving it. The chemistry of the characters are just perfect. Dennis Quaid and Martin Short are meant for this movie. Sure, the plot is hard to believe..How can a person be shrink into size of a cell? But what about all other movies out there? So for those of you who complain that this movie is not plausible, Go ahead and try to make a plausible movie that is close to realism for your self. Sick of people like you. Duh.Anyway, the DVD itself is not a big deal. The case itself is flimsy. The DVD has commentary of director and few of the actors from the movie and has the original trailer of the movie. The commentary is fun to listen to if you are the fan of this movie. It tells you lots of trivia information, but it's funny. So if you like this movie, get it for yourself.

What I got was an incomplete guide, ambiguous attribute descriptions, an organization that requires one to constantly look in the index to find anything, and an index that gives multiple page references with no indication on which page an element is defined.

HTML: The Definitive Guide is the best html reference I've ever laid eyes on - extreemly well organised, it has concise chapters covering important topics, such as Tables and Forms.Each chapter describes the functionality of the topic, then details each property. For example, the tables chapter describes the basic structure of forms, then goes on to detail all the possible properties that can be placed inside each tag and what they do.It assumes only basic knowledge and comes with an excellent introduction to html for the novice, but the best features are the excellent layout which make it easy to look things up quickly and the well devised tear-out quick reference card detailing the complete set of tags and elements.This is one of four books I always keep with me at work! The three others are \\"ASP In a Nutshell\\", \\"JavaScript: The Difinitive Guide\\" and an SQL reference."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for the beginner....","review":"I thought this book was very complete. I will disagree with quite a few reviews. I don't think this is for the beginner. Sometimes if we are experienced then we take something's for granted thinking everybody already knows them. This book that would be values for the attributes.Each chapter is filled with valuable technical content. The chapter information provides very simple, understandable samples but I think you need to know HTML to understand them. If you do this is a GREAT reference book and certainly up to O'Reilly standard."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-have for those who want to learn and perfect HTML!","review":"With no knowledge of HTML prior to reading this book; I found it extremely easy to understand. Almost immediately the book showed how to design a beginning page that included easy to understand source code. This book covers all of the basics of HTML including proper syntax and layout. Musciano and Kennedy deserve high marks for their clear descriptions and witty comments.There is no better book for beginners; and for experts, it will serve as a constant reference when you are working on your pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"As the title says, this is the DEFINITIVE guide to HTML.","review":"There are plenty of web-links and books on HTML but none isas \\"definitive\\" as this book. It's highly readable cover-to-cover and just as valuable as a reference -- read a chapter here and a page there. Plenty of examples, plenty of illustrations: the book covers every aspect of the current HMTL 2.0 specification (and explains why there is not a 3.0 standard, no matter what others say). I especially was appreciative of the authors' reminders to set up web pages readable by any browser (not only Netscape and MS' I.E.) including Lynx, a text-only browser I still like to use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for people just starting out!","review":"This book is an excellent source for just starting out! It cannot be considered a tutorial, but it is an excellent explanatory reference that not only tells you what it does, but how it does it! I reccomend it highly!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Learning and Reference Book","review":"I knew almost zero about HTML when I picked up this book. It helped me quickly dive into HTML and start creating my own pages. It is also a great reference book now that I am fluent with HTML. It is well organized and well-written. The notations of what tags work with which browsers (IE vs Navigator) are extremely useful. The book is very precise and complete.Now the one downside. The book is boring. I could only get through the first three chapters before putting it down. The remaining chapters (most of which I have gone through completely later) are very useful as a reference and you may want to skip them until you feel like jumping into more advanced topics.After you are fluent in HTML, keep it around as a good reference."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is all you need.","review":"This is all you need to write HTML WITHOUT a designer. I use Active Server Pages and COM objects to generate dynamic HTML, so I rarely have the luxury of a designer like DreamWeaver or NetObjects Fusion.

I would highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book makes me start to doubt the O'Reilly series","review":"Too bad there is no zero start rating.I own about 10 O'Reilly books and this one is by far the worst. The book is so unorganized, full of replicates and useless comments. For example, HTML tags have many common attributes and the authors managed to replicate the meaningless explanation for each single one of them - this alone would consumer 50 worthless pages.Normally I would understand there are good and bad parts in a book, but it's just so hard to find any good ones in this book.I have no idea how this book gets high marks from other readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great source for learning HTML, time for revised edition","review":"For learning HTML this book is GREAT!! It was about the third or fourth book I had purchased, in a search for a book with clear explanations. This book resulted in quickly learning forms, tables, frames, etc.. There is lot's more which I have not explored yet. If you are a beginner this is a great book, and it's not 10,000 pages like so many other HTML books out there"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Coverage, but less example","review":"The book shows a good, complete coverage on HTML 4, and its implementation on IE and Netscape. A very comphrensive guide which should go better if more example (especially color) are available.Good for intermediate which would like to learn further. This book is bit tough for beginner which need to scan at least 488 page to learn html."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best book for a Novice HTML Author.","review":"I bought this book as a text book for a class on Web Page Design. I found this book to be somewhat confusing, and the examples unclear. The book does contain all of the important HTML Topics: CSS, Forms, Frames, along with the basic HTML codes; and explains them in detail. It is also well organized. But, as a novice, I would have liked to have seen the book cater more towards the inexperienced HTML Author. I think it would have been better to give the reader a more \\"user friendly\\" text."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as I thought it would be...","review":"With tons of books covering HTML it is difficult to find the right one. Because I was building a web site for the company I work at I wanted to ensure I had all the angles covered, so I bought several web publishing books. One was HTML: The definitive guide. As a programmer who was really familiar with the O'Reilley UNIX books, I figured this book would be just as good. Unfortunately the Nutshell approach just doesn't work for Web technologies like it does for UNIX books. The droning dictionary style and subdued tone put me to sleep. The book is also overpriced compared to other books of similar length"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good desk reference","review":"Since my mind is cluttered with 40 years-worth of programming languages, and I'm going between Java, JavaScript, XML, XSL, HTML, and CSS constantly, I need something to grab and lookup those things I may be unsure of. This book does the trick nicely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could Not Put It Down","review":"I found this book very interesting because I've seen and written a limited amount of html code and I was getting very confused about the latest versions, standards, browser differences, etc. This book should clear up those types of questions. They need to keep coming out with new editions though to keep up with the changes. Besides that you pick up a lot of good information about recipes using the Kumquat fruit in the sample html pages. These include pickled Kumquats, 'Quats And Kraut', and the always popular 'Quatshakes'. Rather than a koala bear on the cover this book should have a Kumquat tree showing the noble fruit glistening in the sun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book to learn HTML","review":"This book is written for any one interested in learning and using HTML, from the most casual user to the full design professional. As a novice, I found this book extremely useful to me and infact it had built me from nothing to advanced level. I would recommend to any one who wants to learn HTML in a proper way instead of short cut methods of those tutorials of \\"learn HTML\\" in 10 minutes,etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent reference, but just a good tutorial","review":"I read the book from cover to cover with the intention of learning HTML this way, but what I found was that the reference qualities of the book made doing it this way painful. Because it is a reference, I found myself slogging through a lot of repetitiveness in various tag explanations. I could cite from memory now the section on every tag explaing the lang and dir attributes. This is critical for a reference that needs to be thorough and consistent and not assume that you've read through the entire book as I have, but makes using it as a tutorial inefficient. I read Elizabeth Castro's HTML book afterwards and found it a much better tutorial (and still a fine reference although not as thorough). Bottom line: if you want a tutorial, get Castro's book - it's a bit simplistic at times, but you'll learn what you need to know a lot faster. If you need an excellent reference, then get this book as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you don't have it, get it.","review":"This book is an excellent reference for novices and experts alike. The thoroughness of examples and ease of use makes it a mandatory item in the web builders' bag of tricks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get Web Publishing Unleashed Professional instead","review":"For the money I found Web Publishing Unleashed Professional to be a better value. The book is thorough and enjoyable. Out of all the web books I have purchased in the last few years that book is the only one that I use regularly.As for HTML: The Definitive Guide, you definitely cannot say it is thorough and enjoyable. It is a reference book that is not entirely thorough and certainly not enjoyable to read. It is not a tutorial either. I bought the book but I never use it.

It does what very few composition texts or readers have ever done: the editors recognize that writing (and reading, of course) does not occur in isolation, but within the context of our own and our students' lives. Particularly, it aids students to think about their own writing in light of the cultural, psychological, and political issues of language, literacy, argumentation, and mass media. They include much about minority and non-Western cultures, plus articles and essays from both the present and the past.

Q are your typical self-conscious Indie-type band who frustratingly attack their instruments and compositions before even realizing a direction in which to seek, and the best I can say about Different Damages is that it might make you bob your head in certain spots with it's immature but enticing rhythmic convictions. As annoying as much of it can be, at least they attempt to bait listeners every which way in their limited eclecticism's, and for younger experimental hipsters some of it will definitely work."},{"rating":"2","title":"New Direction","review":"Another review states that this album isn't very different from \\"No Kill No Beep Beep\\". I contend that it's an entirely new approach from the same band. Q and Not U has evolved to a usually softer sound, less emo-core than before. While the first album was incredible, this album is a pleasant evolution of the older sound, with less distortion, less speed, and a lot more melody. The sound now includes aspects of ska, bossanova, reggae and all sorts that have been melded into an even more unique Q sound. Musicianship is just as high as before, but now you can dance to it.

I threw it away as a result. Do not buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after 2 months of use","review":"The blender itself works pretty well with juice and powder supplements. The lid is a problem as no matter how hard I hold the opening closed liquid always seeps out.

Both of the carafes broke after one year. I did put them in the dishwasher but our dishwasher does not have a heating element and uses steam to dry the dishes and most times I did put the carafes on the top rack. It is a shame they broke as they worked great. I used them to make smoothies for my two boys."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for One!","review":"I love this blender. I use it mostly for making a smoothie after working out, and there's virtually no clean-up. So quick and easy. Blends good, I only use a few ice cubes at a time though, and it seems to break up the ice easier that way. Very light and compact, I would highly recommend this for someone who wants a quick mixed drink/smoothie without all the bulkiness and hassle of clean-up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tiny and rather powerful","review":"This is pretty good for a mini blender. Start off putting in liquids first before adding solids like fruit or powders. I don't know how it would deal with ice, it really doesn't look powerful enough for that.

I recently moved out & since magic bullets are a little pricey I settled for this cheap product...I got what I paid for! My first time using it, I made my boyfriend a protein shake with chocolate whey protein, milk, peanut butter and crushed ice. You'd think a simple mix like that would easily blend, nope. I had to use a spoon to finish mixing it because it doesn't funnel the mix towards the blade so it was left with chunks of powder. On top of chunks of powder, I had chunks of ice because the blade doesn't catch the ice to blend it. I trashed it after I tried to make several smoothies & continued to have chunks of ice & fruit. Now I'm waiting to receive the magic bullet I ordered that I just can't live without! :p"},{"rating":"1","title":"You'd be better off spending a little more money","review":"I had this blender a couple months, and I ended up replacing it.

Have used it many times since then & love it! I make protein shakes with frozen fruit & it is so convenient to use. No bulky blender. I only pulse for about 3 seconds at a time & that seems to work good. And for the price, you can't go wrong! I definitely recommend this to others!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Small but powerful","review":"TYPE AND FREQUENCY OF USE:I bought this 2-3 months ago and have been using it to make smoothies, typically with a generous amount of ice. It gets used at least twice a week.PROS AND CONS:+It easily eats the ice, and only has trouble when I let the thickness get too much.-My primary complaint, concern, is that I can smell the motor (over?)heating very quickly. This is definitely not meant to be used for long continuous runs, just pulsing. Though to be fair, I never got the impression that I should be using it like a regular blender.-The lid can leak, but in my experience this meant I overloaded the blender.+The size is wonderful.FINAL THOUGHTS:For $20 I think I got a good deal. I am concerned about longevity, but it has worked fine every time I used it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little blender!","review":"I absolutely love this blender. I was considering the Magic Bullet when I decided I wanted to start making green smoothies for breakfast. I have a huge blender, but it is such a hassle to pull out and to clean, especially when I'm only making enough smoothie to fill up 1/3 of it. When I saw the price of the Magic Bullet, I was astounded. While I have seen the Magic Bullet in action and like it, it's not worth the expensive tag. When I saw this blender, for a fraction of the price and with great reviews I snatched it up. I've now been making smoothies every morning for the past 2 weeks and it works perfectly. It blends up my frozen fruit just fine, though I have not tried ice yet. I love that it comes with the travel lid as I just take it with me and rinse it out it at work. It just makes everything so easy and convenient. I would highly recommend this blender to anyone and would purchase again if I had to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very convenient -- only if it were a little more powerful","review":"I have used this blender every day for about 2 weeks now. Really love the convenience of the single-serve and the fact that you can stop the blender and add more ingredients easily.The blender will blend frozen fruit though I cut up the fruit first before I freeze it (I also add some water and protein powder to my smoothie). I get the same smoothie consistency as the one from the smoothie bar. No problem. The machine is not particularly powerful so do not force it -- just add a little more liquid and it will blend.I looked into the other single-serve models with more power but decided to get this one after all because I cannot be bothered to flip the jar and remove the blades every time I want to adjust the flavor or add more frozen fruit, etc. to my smoothie.Very happy with the purchase. I would have given it 5 stars if it were just a tad more powerful but the machine pays for itself after maybe 5 smoothies, so no complaints here!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Money spent","review":"I never write reviews for a product, but this one made me. I have had this product for about 3 months and use it twice a day. It makes the best protein shakes you have ever had. If you are looking for a great shake maker, look no further. Its small but still can make a double shake no problem. Add some chocolate protein and a frozen bananna and its better than frosty from wendys, I kid you not.

The power of the motor is amazing. In fact, that is the problem. You can't fill it up half way unless you hold the lid on, or you will blow it off. The motor is so strong it torqued the cup, and snapped the retaining rings off on both sides of the bottom of the blending cup. They are rather cheesy, flimsy pieces of plastic. This would be a wonderful blender if it had better securing to the base, and a top that didn't have to be held down. I took mine back and got a standard blender. I had hoped to use something smaller than my vitamix for small jobs, but this isn't it. Back to the vitamix, which, of course, is the best. Vitamix wants 80 dollars for a smaller blending cup. I would rather spend the money on a complete blender. 80 bucks for a blending cup is a ripoff."},{"rating":"2","title":"small blender works quite well","review":"i bought this for my girlfriend in an effort to get her to make more shakes or healthy stuff.the thing is quite small.

For the price, it is a bargain."},{"rating":"1","title":"blender blade froze solid, can't use after maybe 30-50 uses","review":"I bought this based on the previous good reviews. However, the blade shaft in the detachable jar froze solid for some reason, rendering the entire unit useless. The base unit continues to spin, but without the blade is useless. I'm contacting Hamilton Beach to see how their warranty section holds up. I did note in the warranty that they may not cover this situation, and that a replacement jar is $11.99. Probably, with shipping, that is the price I'd pay for the entire unit at Walmart. Not too happy of a camper right now, but we'll see if they send me a replacement for free. Of course, I doubt I have the receipt anywhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"broke after one month of daily use","review":"I used this blender for my son on a biomedical treatment.

I ordered another from Hamilton Beach (worst customer service, sounds like they answer from there own house). I had to pay for shipping that was half of the original $12 I paid at Walmart. I got the second one in and the first night of use it starts leaking. I am return all to Walmart and I am going to get my shipping cost back. Horrible product. Dont have time for crap like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Deal!","review":"I love this little blender! I've had it for a while now, and I can say it's been quite durable. It has been strong enough to crush ice for smoothies and shakes. I love how I can unlock the 'cup' from the base and just take it with me on the go. It's perfect for my single serving drinks and wonderful that it takes up so little counter space, and is so easy to run through the dishwasher, so unlike my heavy blender that takes up so much counter space and adds much more cleaning time. I would definintely purchase again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"easy smoothie maker!","review":"Great little blender. I use it mostly for smoothies.

I use fresh fruit, juice, yogurt, and full sized ice cubes. As long as you be sure to put the liquids in before the fruit and yogurt, it blends quickly and smoothly. The travel lid on mine works well and does not leak in the slightest. I would highly recommend this for anyone looking for a space saving, powerful blender."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great and Great Smoothie Tip","review":"I agree with most of the reviews that say this is great for simple smoothie recipes. It DOES work better than my full size blender for this type of job and I have been very happy with it.One other thing I've learned is to just leave your serving of frozen fruit (or ice cubes) out at room temperature for 3-5 mins. FIRST, then make your drink. You could always microwave the fruit for 10-15 secs. if you're in a big hurry. This simple step will make the job that much easier for this or any blender to do."},{"rating":"2","title":"the little blender that could","review":"Wow, an inexpensive blender that works! I use this blender to mix protein shakes at home and work. It's compact enough to tote around, and takes up minimal space on the kitchen counter. It blazes through frozen yogurt and crushes ice with ease. It seems to run a little hot sometimes, so you definitely won't want to make anything too heavy, but for smoothies and single serving mixed drinks, it's perfect. Definitely recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wouldn't buy again...","review":"Had the black model that I think came after this one. Liked it, but was replacing about every three months. Got this one and thought it was broken. You have to REALLLLY push in the pulse button REALLY hard. IF someone had arthritis in their hands, doubt they could use this. Granted, it doesn't take long to blend a smoothie, but it's like the button doesn't connect unless you push in as far as you possibly can. Love the idea of a mini blender, but after having problems with last two of Hamilton Beach's mini's, not too happy. Too much of a pain to return for this amount of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fitness Fanatics Dream Blender","review":"If you're an athlete, you know how often you have to drink meal replacements or protein shakes throughout the day.

You can even portion out your powder in a Glad 1/2cup (4oz) Mini Round and stick it in the blender.

Here's hoping the same process will update Lou Reed Live."},{"rating":"2","title":"The only album worthy of the title \\"Rock and Roll\\"","review":"A good friend turned me on to this disc in about 1981. It changed my life forever. Having listened to it about a thousand times now, I'm surprized how it still sounds as good and powerful as the first time that I heard it. This is a timeless piece of work. I read somewhere that the entire punk rock movement could be blamed on two people, Lou Reed's parents. Listen to this disc and you will know why."},{"rating":"2","title":"There's a Party Saturday night, ...","review":"and chances are you'll hear this album. Unless of course your host is a complete idiot and their idea of rock n roll is Hootie and the Blowfish. I laughed when I read the Lou Reed \\"fans\\" who said they didn't like this album. They whined that it was unlike his other stuff. Well, put it in perspective. This is a GREAT album - and it doesn't need the extra tracks. It's one of those one-off classics that just came from nowhere. Loved it then, love it now. You can't say that about any VU album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure salvation","review":"This album is so good it's not hard to see why even someone as egotistical as Lou used to be, after years of dismissing it finally conceded that it is pretty good after allJust turn the music up loud and let it take you away and don't be alarmed if you get a drug-free high.(If you're not familiar with the Velvet Underground try \\"Sister Ray\\" from the White Light/White Heat album, a masterpiece from an earlier era of Lou)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lou Reed at the Top","review":"This is by far the best effort by an underrated artist. If you have ever felt distance from life and a certain amount of disdain, depression and downright get to the point fatalism. You will love this dive. Having been a heroin addict for seven years of my life, this musical dissertation on the lower end of human behaviour really strikes home. I love the song Heroin, almost as much as I love the drug. It takes you through the highs and lows in a seductive sort of way. From the time the spike goes in and all the misery goes out, you are there. A completely honest musical fiasco. Raw and untamed. Just like most who are addicted. An honest effort. God bless Lou Reed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Music, Disappointing Mastering","review":"This is a classic album, and the music is what everyone else has said it is. My gripe is with the remastering. I have the original LP of this, and I bought this CD mostly so I wouldn't wear out \\"Sweet Jane\\". Unfortunately, when they remastered this album, they changed the tonal balance, in a not so subtle way. They took all of the heft and body out of it, to the point where the guitars were almost tinny sounding. I was shocked, so much so, that I pulled the LP out and played it to see if my memory was faulty. It wasn't. I am deeply disappointed with this disc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazon's Editorial Review could not be more wrong...","review":"How could Amazon place such a wrong-headed review on this record? Like the record or not, a passionless snoozefest it's not! Far from phoned-in, contemptuous vocals, \\"Heroin\\" and \\"Sweet Jane\\" are classic versions. I like the original VU recordings better myself, but wouldn't be without this record. Some clever classic album company should put out an album of the original concert in full, in original playing order (That is, both the \\"Rock & Roll Animal\\" remaster and \\"Lou Reed Live\\"). What a concert that must have been, and what a record it would make. It sure wouldn't be hard to like."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who says music in the seventies was a drag.","review":"There was a popular radio DJ in the seventies in New Haven that ended every show at midnight playing Intro/Sweet Jane. It was before Clear Channel and guidance dictated what one heard on the radio. DJs played what they wanted. The jock's name was Stoneman and it being the seventies I usually did hear it stoned. It was a great album then and it holds up well. This CD version doesn't compare well to the original LP's warmth, or maybe I should go smoke a doobie for old times sake. It's really good music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lou Reed Rock & Roll Animal","review":"I used to own this album in an eight-track format many years ago.

It did not work. Double and triple checked connections and voltages to no avail. LEDs lit up for the remotes, but the master was blinking.

The Turkish-English part has some very good explanations about pronunciation and grammar, a list of food and drinks, Turkish abbreviations, numerals and time. It also has some basic phrases. All these - in English. The English-Turkish part has the same explanations about the English language - written in Turkish. The vocabulary, on the other hand, is quite limited.When I bought the dictionary, I knew only a few words in Turkish, and no grammar at all, and at that stage this dictionary was quite adequate. Later on, however, I needed a much more detailed dictionary, with a larger vocabulary. In praise of this dictionary, I have to say that I haven't found in any other dictionary such good grammatical explanations like in this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute but too small should be called saucer not plate","review":"I purchased this plate and the original you are special today plate.

It's pretty much everything that I expected for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"A real bargain","review":"I am using this with my iMac since I am listening to a lot of music and making movies. Given this price point, the clarity of the bass is truly amazing, and the highs are surprisingly clear too. The mids and lower mids could sound a bit more full, but playing with the EQ on the computer helps reduce the slightly \\"thin\\" quality. The features are excellent (volume and bass control on seperate accesible switch), and it's easy to set up. Looks like it's made for the Mac stylistically, very nice. Again, I can't imagine that there is better sound available near this price point. Seems well made, solid. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Logitech z-4I 2.1 speaker rocks","review":"I bought this speaker system to play games like age of empires series.

I would watch how much you boost the bass, because the sub sounds very muddy at high levels. I really like the remote that's included; it's very easy to adjust sound levels by adjusting the knobs. I would recommend these computer speakers, and am pleased with all purchases I have made at [...]."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it at all.","review":"I'm serious. I'm not being a jerk or anything.Logitech's a great company. However, I think they really screwed up on the Z4I's. If you have them set up with acoustic perfection, isolation stands, and an external EQ control, you MIGHT be able to make them work.DON'T GO CHEAP IF YOU'RE GOING TO DISH OUT 100 BUCKS.For 50 more dollars, you can buy the z2300's. I've had both, and I immediately returned the Z4I's. the 2300's are worth it. TRUST ME."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent buy at a very good price","review":"Bach's \\"Toccata and Fugue in D minor\\" sounded glorious on these speakers. The woofer has a rich quality and doesn't buzz out at higher decibels, keeping a clean sounding Fugue. The mid-range and high still keep a clear sound during the Toccata and didn't miss a note, but still abstained from getting tinny.Kodo Drummer's \\"Monochrome\\" managed to get through the quiet parts without any hiss and, again, deep bass notes really resonate here without the irritating buzz found in cheaper speakers.The impression of movement allowed by a 2.1 system was consistent and for basic PC use, there's enough immersion for the single user. First-person shooters come alive with proper speaker placement.The only word of warning I can think of is to not push these speakers past 3/4 full volume. If it makes the windows rattle, that's loud enough and anything over that is simply ridiculous. These speakers can push enough air at less than 50%."},{"rating":"2","title":"These speakers are awesome","review":"The sound is really amazing, especially for the price.

I personally think that most of this CD is better than a lot on the previous albums stated. \\"Good Sheperd\\", \\"Wooden Ships\\", \\"We Can Be Together\\", and the first half of \\"Hey Fredrick\\" are personal favorites. \\"Volunteers\\" has dated badly and grates my nerves. \\"Turn My Life Down\\" has strained M.

Up to this record it was mostly about the music. I wasn't asleep--I got gathered up in the sense of the time. Suddenly, I wasn't hardcore enough for those who fancied themselves revolutionaries and Volunteers. I thought many of them were pretentious and just a little disingenuous--considering most of them came from Long Island and had more money than I. So in the ridiculousness of it all I missed the Music. Which is why I was there. With the passage of the decades I can finally appreciate the songs without all the political baggage.

It's a nice introducer to Miss Anderson and has a lot of nice one-on-one interviews. It has limited footage of her on-screen appearances but features a lot of rehearsal footage. As for the talent of Miss Anderson, just amazing! She hits difficult notes with perfect pitch and round fullness, not stringy or light, but with a big and healthy sound. What one will find surprising is how seriously she says to take the acting and theatrical standpoints in her performances. She strives for her own artistic interpretation and personal connection with her roles.

Just like the capital letters, these are an excellent educational tool to help kids learn their letters and sounds, plus they are a rare toy that uses lowercase letters. On top of the obvious educational and entertainment values, our kids also enjoy toting these letters around the house. They have used them to learn which of their dump trucks magnets will stick to, which appliances will hold them, which buckets they won't dump out of because they're stuck to them, etc. Overall, a great toy!

I am not a \\"licenced\\" councelor of any kind; but I have counceled many people with problems that this book describes. Critics who try (pathetically) to descredit a book because they disagree theologically; (using arguments from silence and partially quoting scripture) are not a valid citicisms. The real questions are:How many people are being helped?How many lives are being changed?These are the valid questions; not does this agree with my view of God!Finally, if the question of Christianity is brought in; the question is: Is Jesus ChristGlorified and given ALL the credit for the work done.By the way the answers are Many, Many and Yes! So what is the problem?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Healing through False Doctrine","review":"I am concerned about this book, which was just recommended from a Christian counselor for someone I know. This Theophostic approach is contrary to Scripture, as neither Jesus nor God literally make a \\"personal appearance\\" in our lives. God dwells in us through His word, but Jesus nor God appear to us and tell us anything apart from God's word. This approach to healing is based purely on emotions. In this approach, a person waits to \\"feel\\" something different rather than work through the problem(s) and feel better through a genuine resolution of the pain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"Also a MUST for fans.

I bought it after reading the reviews, many of which stated that this album was one they enjoyed listening to as much as their kids. In my opinion, it sounds very canned and synthy.

Unfortunately, I stumbled and learned much of what's in this book through reading countless sources and documentation. Some of the outstanding features of this book are its thorough yet concise coverage of XSL syntax. The first three chapters could easily replace most thick XSL books on the market today. It also goes into quite a bit of detail into the use of JAXP, which I've found very useful in a couple of projects. Also, there are some extremely useful techniques for using XSL with Servlets (such as Stylesheet caching). All in all a very worthwhile read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incomplete and poor reference","review":"This book is not what I hope for. Although it has been out for a couple of years the author has not even aknowledged some of the major typos in the book (see O'Reilly web site).Although nicely written in a style that can be fairly easily followed, it is missing a substantial amount of needed reference material. For example in the section on conditional statements it refers to boolean expressions. Nowhere does he provide a list of operators or build-in functions available. You either have to build your own incomplete list gleaned from his examples or go find a good reference book.O'Reilly authors generally do a better job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware! front wheel may rear up causing fall.","review":"My mother purchased this walker (from in town store). She loved it as it would get around in smaller apartment doors, etc. After a while, she got very comfortable with this walker and pushed down on the handles too much, the front wheel reared up causing her to fall and break her hip. I believe that this is a great walker, but extra caution MUST be used when using it. My brother was using it to get it from one place to another in the hospital. Not thinking, he put too much weight on it and the front wheel reared up with him. When she went into rehab, they would not allow her to use this walker and we had to get her another.

It's haunting, intriguing and a thoroughly enjoyable story. I liked the story within a story format and the character development was superb. Highly recommend this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not seduced","review":"This novel has a lot of possibilities-a heroine with lots of conflicts and a number of confusing romantic options, a setting and characters that could be colorful, an economic resurrection component, and a literary mystery. So why doesn't any of it work? \\"The Seduction of Water\\" is flat and lacking spark. The characters do unconvincing things, and there are far too many coincidences. There's a layer of gloss so thick that it sticks everything, motionless, to the page.So why bother to review Carol Goodman's second novel? Because of those possibilities. There are so many elements that are almost there, that almost add up to a charming, funny tale with enough depth to describe it as literary. I'm looking forward to Carol Goodman's breakthrough."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very interesting read","review":"I enjoyed this book a great deal, with a few reservations.Overall, it was fast-paced enough to hold my interest. I found the characters were realistic, although Iris was sometimes a bit of a whiner.Loved the convict, Aidan. He was charming, but also burdened with his past as an inmate. I liked the fact they met while she was teaching a class.The mystery was involving, but at times (especially towards the end), I felt that I missed a turn and had to re-read portions."},{"rating":"2","title":"In a time before rivers were drowned by the sea, in a land between the sun and the moon....","review":"Carol Goodman is gifted with a smooth, hypnotic story teller's voice and she uses it to advantage in 'The Seduction of Water.'Briefly, it's the story of Iris, unpublished want-to-be author, who ekes out a living teaching English to immigrants, prisoners, and ex-cons. The orphaned daughter of a hotel manager and a fantasy writer, her life is rather bland on the surface, until Iris decides to write an article about her mother and the missing final book in her trilogy. Then Iris's life begins to change in ways that mirror the Irish folk tales that formed the basis of her mother's stories.Goodman's story teller's voice is true; her prose runs smoothly, her plotting is deft, and her characters - even her bit players - are intriguing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seduced by the title","review":"My family thoroughly enjoyed this book. The fairy tale of the Selkie within the book is spellbinding. My intention was not to read a fairy tale but Goodman captivates and makes me want to simply continue on with this terrific fairy tale.And then, the story switches to Iris Greenfeder and her life as an aspiring author and teacher of writing and how she comes to be attached to two men at the same time, an ex-convict and a struggling artist.Iris is in search of her deceased mother's manuscript, the third in a trilogy which Iris hopes will help her to understand her mother's life and untimely death. The weaving of the Selkie tale and Iris's mother's life begin to seem like they are one and the same.I enjoyed the characters and thought they had depth and interest enough to want to read to the end to know how it all ends."},{"rating":"2","title":"great story","review":"perhaps it's because i didn't read her first book, but i totally loved this book. it took me a couple of days to get into it, but once i did, i was hooked. i found the characters to be engaging and three-dimensional. now i'm going to read her first book with great anticipation!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Made-For-TV Movie","review":"OK I read the entire book to see if Iris ever found her mother's third book, but midway through I became disappointed with the writing. The language was cliched and much of the plot was predictable--as soon as the dry summer and water system was discussed I knew there would be a fire at the hotel. And what was that to-do about the 7-year age difference?But most of all, I could never warm up to Iris. What she (and the author) seem to be lacking is a good sense of humor!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Still looking for a thrill","review":"The review quote on the book's cover called this an atmospheric thriller. Hardly. The book certainly had atmosphere as most well written novels do, but it was more of a mystery novel than a thriller. Much of the novel's length was spent in character development. The last hundred pages or so presented the mystery. I don't like being mislead by review blurbs that don't present a true depiction of the novel. A thriller is a book that you can't put down. This novel was easy to put down and hard to pick up again."},{"rating":"1","title":"slopped together rehash of her first book","review":"It seemed to me that Carol Goodman, heady from the success of her extremely gripping first book, decided to write another one with practically the same plot twists, protagonist and supporting characters. Maybe if she was doing a standard mystery series this would be okay with me but I expected better from her. The pacing is extremely slow, the characters' actions often don't make a lot of sense and the convenient coincidences pile on thick, making a lot of the novel's outcome easy to see from a mile away.With hope Ms. Goodman, who obviously can write very movingingly and convincingly (just see her first book), will take some time to make her next book much more original and less contrived than her second effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review of Kindle format, not Book Content","review":"This is a comment specifically on the kindle edition of this book, not reflecting on the actual content of the book itself. For a paid kindle book (as opposed to the free offers which often have rougher format) this has very poor formatting. The text changes from light to dark throughout the book and the table of contents is poorly formatted. Also, if you make notes or highlights on the book and attempt to return to that spot from the note menu, it does not return you to the correct page. Overall, this is the most poorly formatted paid kindle book I have seen, and others should be aware before paying $10 for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea, but not much on the 1978 Yankees","review":"The Yankees are my all-time favorite team so when this book came out, I was excited to see some new take on that incredible comeback Yankee team of '78. Boy, was I disappointed. Not only does Kahn barely look at the 78 Yankees until well into the book, he spends most of the time promoting his connections to other famous people, bad-mouthing favorites like Billy Martin and Thurman Munson, and rattling on about rehashed stuff. Save your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Wrath of Kahn","review":"Appears to have been written merely to vent spleen and fulfill contractual obligations with the publisher. An entirely unnecessary chancre of a book, mean-spirited and low-intentioned. Sadly, Kahn succeeds only in bullying precious publishing resources away from more deserving younger writers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth 15 minutes","review":"This book is a huge disappointment. There is nothing new in it. The narrative is disjointed and starts with Yankee history, wanders over to President Carter, then back to Mayor Lindsay, adds a couple of cheap shots at other sportswriter (who Kahn objectively tells us are poor writers), knocks the Times, describes some mid-season games in excessive detail and continues on and on with bloated text, self-importance, self-righteousness without the semblance of structure, wit or storyline.The 1978 Yankees were a mess, but they were winners. This book, unfortunately, is just a mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Average (so disappointing)","review":"When the focus is on baseball and not religion, ethnicity, the author himself, and/or other politically correct issues - this book is at best average. Considering the title - you might expect a detailed look at the 78 season. It's not. So be prepared to be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"It had potential.","review":"This book is good when the author sticks to the Yankees and his characters. Kahn comes off throughout as a petty, bitter, insecure man who has to constantly put himself in the story.Then there are bizarre and gratuitous cheapshots directed at other writers (his competitors),Kenneth Starr (whatever he had to do with the 78 Yanks), and others. In my opinion, the good parts of this book were somewhat tainted by the unnecessary cheapshots thatdidn't have anything to do with the storylines. It would have been a much better book if he took the high road and stuck to baseball and kept his personal vendettas against the Starr's and Schapp's (and others) out of the book. There is also a bit of revisionist history- he clearly has an agenda."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sloppy and Disappointing","review":"I wanted to like this book and expected to like this book, but there are just too many flaws. When the focus is on Billy Martin and Reggie Jackson and the turmoil of the 78 Yankees, it's insightful and interesting. But relatively little of the book actually is about the 1978 season. Far too much space is given to sloppy, meandering passages about baseball history and odd, mean-spirited, and entirely unnecessary swipes at other sportswriters. This seems to have slapped together with little thought, research, or editing."},{"rating":"1","title":"A seriously over-rated piece of junk","review":"I am ashamed to have brought this album last year but now I have come to my senses and see it for what it really is. It has no talent whatsoever, they sing about jack all and boring things, and one more low point about this is that it is so commercial and trendy and over-rated. One of the worst albums ever I'd say. Trust me do avoid this album, but I admit I did like their earlier stuff when it first came out which was exceptional back then, but to be honest I couldn't give one f*** about them these days. I hate meteora so much so, that I wish and plan to sell it. You want decent metal try Rage Against The Machine and Papa Roach, they are the only bands who wrote decent and talented stuff and they were barely commercial at all.

Not only is there music unoriginal and unchanging, but also lacks vocal strength from the singer.

They did nothing to perfect their sound. They simply just took the beats from the last album and the cd is only 36 minutes long.

In my own words they didn't grow at all"},{"rating":"2","title":"The perfect hybrid","review":"When you listen to the album you realize a few things1) It is consistenly good2) All the songs are different but similar(sounds stupid but you will know what I mean once you go through them all, it is like they have found the perfect song creation algorithm and can churn out millions of songs with minor differences but the sam intrinsic value)3) It is too good to be trueMore on point 3) - This album appears to be engineered to perfection. It seems that the music industry has found a way to create a hybrid that appeals to all. Here the full spectrum of musicl genres meet to creat an amalgamation that will produce instant and sure hits. Congratulations on the producers for creating the perfect hybrid. This said, too good sometimes is not good - it is not realistic, its smells like there is something rotten inside of the polished and shiny surface.

It is, in my opinion, one of the greatest albums of all time. It would have been near impossible to come out with an album better than Hybrid Theory, but they got damn close. This is a great album, with a lot of dope beats. My favorite songs are \\"Somewhere I Belong\\" (the one they play on the radio),\\"Faint, and \\"Easier To Run\\", although the whole album is tight. Buy it as soon as you can! It is probably the best $...you can spend."},{"rating":"2","title":"New Theory","review":"This album actually didn't disappoint for a follow-up album to hybrid theory [which went platinum and was on the radio for 2 years]. Reassuring Linkin Park didn't turn away from their sound. The whole cd is based on rap/rock/tables type music. There are some serious head turners on the cd as well, Somewhere I Belong, Easier to Run, and Faint are the songs that really grab me as the highlights of the CD. For those of you thinking about buying this album, its not far from hybrid theory but there are some seriously intriquing beats. A definite must have for a rock fans cd collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste ur money","review":"Okay, don't get me wrong, linkin park is my favorite group. But this CD is just bad, terrible even, it has a few good songs, but the majority is Annoying, either the beat is annoying, the beat and the words don't go together, or the words are annoying. I recommend borrowing the cd ..., and then either burning it, or writing down the few good songs to download it, but the...bucks that everybody's charging for the cd by itself and the...cd/dvd pack is about...overpriced. Sorry Fellow linkin park fans, but it's the truth. Hopefully a fourth CD will come out with more than just 3 or 4 good songs. Oh yeah, I forgot, the cd says it has 13 songs, but it really has 12. The first one is a 13 second intro of somebody breaking a glass."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overcreation on a genre that is still new to most of us!!","review":"Linkin Parks second effort will meet the expectations for a large portion of their fan base. It is not as strong as their first album. I may attract more new fans but the difference between the two albums is that Linkin Park tried to overcreate their music trying to take it the next level on a genre that is still new to most music lovers. It is worth the [money]with all the extra's you get. The forty page book you get and the dvd extras is a pretty cool add-on."},{"rating":"2","title":"LP, Continues to rock ...","review":"To start with, Meteora is not as good as Hybrid Theory, but never the less a 'Great' album to own.

I'm a long time LP fan and they have it totally backwards. Hybrid Theory (HT) had great lyrics, great videos, and a lot of anger. Now with meteora its too pop. The numb and faint videos [are terrible] and all the lyrics on the album are shallow and far to easy to interprept on only the first listen. It's also a worse copy of HT. Along with being poppish they are now becoming sell outs (having own shoes) if you want the real and better LP get hybrid theory or wait for next CD, hopefully it'll be better. If the next Cd isnt good i have to give up becuase then they are hopless. so as a closing thought remember HT is anything but pop and meteora is all pop. so for you teenies out there. this is for you. but you rock fans who listen to lyrics. i wouldnt recommend this... :p"},{"rating":"1","title":"Generic Hybrid","review":"A carbon-copy of their first album, and not even a good one.

Needless to say that ground is the radius of a dime. The music plays the same format over and over, from a distance it sounds like Hybrid Theory.Who can blame Linkin Park for sticking with what works? As long as it keeps them on top, musical development can take a back seat to musical progression. For those that liked the previous effort Meteora makes a good companion. For those hoping the band would become other than a highly popular flash in the pan, the jury is out."},{"rating":"2","title":"IT ROCKS!!!","review":"this is a really great cd it has good song good lyrics, good music, good computer specials, the works! it's really really great! if anyone likes thiskind of music its great"},{"rating":"2","title":"blew me away!","review":"this cd is incredible. i had never listened to linkin park before, and bought the disc on a whim after i heard and loved the \\"somewhere i belong\\" track on the radio. i am into more punk, like sum41, and also a little dave matthews, but this cd quickly rose to my favorite in my whole collection. it's the only thing i play in my car. that one where chester or whoever sings is the best ever. you just kid of fall into the music. and all the lyrics rock!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Calling all TRUE L.P. fans...","review":"There isnt a whole lot a guy can say about this album, besides how much of a dissapointment it is.

I had high expectations for Meteora after Hybrid Theory was released, and I'm happy to report that Meteora matches, and even exceeds my expectations. Linkin Park is one of those groups that appeal to so many people. If you are a fan of, rap, rock, or techno, you'll probably like Linkin Park. They mix all three genres into one new, kick [rear-end] genre! Like all great artists, Linkin Park has it's critics. But despite their criticism, they have a huge fan base, and for a good reason. My only problem with the album is that it's a short one. However, I go by the \\"quality not quantity\\" theory on this one. And quality is delivered and thus the album is easily worth purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont bother Buying This","review":"I USED to be a very big fan of Linkin Park, but I have to say that LP has gone down the gutter...The only track I enjoyed was Hit the floor, but even that wasnt all goodMy advice to Linkin Park would be to stop trying to be like Korn and trying to rap...Hybrid Theory was much better then this"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tacky Nu-Metal pap milked again!","review":"Their mix of Lunatic Calm keeps that track sounding fresh again, it'll be interesting if that makes it to Spider-Man 2 trailers.

I'm rather disappointed in LINKIN PARKS new cd. The sound is still there but nothing really new or exciting. REANIMATION was better than METEORA and that was just a remix. The most disappointing attribute to METEORA is the length, 36 min and 43 sec long. LINKIN PARK is a great new band, different, but almost 2 years after their debut all they could muster is 13 songs, one was a 10 second intro and another was an instrumental. I guess it shows hungry fans will buy anything, I did. I would think as big as HYBRID THEORY was they would put a little more effort into their second album. Guess I'll look forward to GODSMACK, hope they just don't throw a quick 13 songs at us."},{"rating":"2","title":"[meteora]","review":"the album is pretty good.

Its sad to see a good band go bad, now you might be thinking why didn't i just rate this 1 star? well because the 1st single \\"somewhere i belong\\" has meaning isn't stale and shows potential for this and same with breaking the habit but other then this the album sounds like they failed at making hybrid theory pt. 2"},{"rating":"1","title":"somebody help this guy","review":"As part of the rap-rock scene, Linkin Park is one of the leading bands on the charts. The reason, however, is beyond me. Their songs all have the same basic melody of techno mixed with rap and each song has the same idea. In the hit single \\"In the end\\" the band sings \\"I had to fall/To lose it all/But in the end/It doesn't even matter.\\" In the song \\"One Step Closer\\" they sing \\"Everything you say to me/Takes me one step closer to the edge/And I'm about to break.\\" In \\"Crawling\\" the band sings \\"crawling in my skin/these wounds they will not heal/fear is how I fall/confusing what is real.\\" It seems that every song is about a guy who is falling. You would think that after 4 years of success and millions of dollars, this guy would be flying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kronos is right","review":"Metora is about as original as the next album from the next artist. Im sick of hearing little and big people alike come around and act proud that they're listening to Linkin park. Its not that angry guys. what makes you want to be angry listening to this? I get angry listening to the singer trying to scream. You suck! Your whole band is about as angry as Nora Jones. Good job guys, you just won best rock from MTV, a channel dedicted to kids who dont know what rock is. Same goes for that girl crap from velvet revoler and evenesence(no excuses, look at kittie). Go suck on small objects. The only people who can pull off that girl look and still be cool are Jrockers like miyavi and Deadman. Anyways. help support music by not wasting money on this junk, and if you havent listened or watched their stuff by now, go download all their stuff to steal all their money.

When I heard he was doing something with Linkin Park, I didn't really know what to expect (they made Collision Course, a great six song album, a must buy). Anyway I bought this album to see if Linkin Park was anygood on there own. I like this album a lot. Though in one song they try to rap and it's just not good. Linkin Park I think you guys should drop the rap and stick to rock music because you're very good at it. This is a great album and if you liked Collision Course your going to like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as the debut","review":"After buying Linkin Park's Hybrid Theory album, I was expecting a lot more. On their website, the band billed this album as being \\"darker\\". I suppose that's one way of looking at it. I found the album to have a murky, boring sound, and I actually found myself enjoying the rap more than the rock, maybe because the \\"rock\\" part is very slow and balladial. It was completely devoid of the screaming that made the first album so enjoyable, and almost devoid of the rap that made the first album so fun to sing along to. What was I left with? This murky-sounding, second-rate alternative metal. But still, I have to give Linkin Park credit for being a metal band that is anti-violence and anti-hate, and curses even less than Good Charlotte."},{"rating":"1","title":"ONE LONG SONG...............","review":"THEY SUCK!!!

Don't you see what this poor excuse for a band is doing to you. They're doing the exact same thing that they did with hybrid theory. They real you in with these songs that sound catchy at first. But they get REAL old REAL fast. Besides it sounds exactly like their other stuff. Wheres the change? Wheres the evolution? Everyone knows truly great bands try and reinvent their musical sound every album so that they aren't just recycling the same thing that people have heard before. They also do this so they can improove as musicians. Of course what would linkin park know about being musicians. Yeah nice job with those whole three chords. Loosers.

If you bought Hybrid Theory, and liked it, I suppose you'll buy this one too. But anyone else, don't buy it. They really aren't that good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Linkin Park's Superb Sophomore Effort","review":"One of the most anticpated ablumns of 2003 has finally arrived, Linkin Park's Meteora. The follow up to the highly successful Hybrid Theory( multi platinum ) delivers. The ablumn features improved vocals from Lead singer Chester Bennigton, and deeper ryhmes from MC Mike Shindoa, along with great instramentation by the rest of the band. 13 new songs keep the listener in his or her head phones for the duration. Without any dissapoining tracks the cd flows from one track to another. Featuring the hit \\"Somewhere I Belong,\\" with many potential chart toppers such as: \\"Easier To Run,\\" \\"Faint,\\" \\"Breaking the Habit, and \\"Numb.\\" The band's best work to date, cementing their status in music culture for years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Hybrid Theory... but still needs some work.","review":"This CD had the potential to have 5 stars and be by far the best rap/metal CD ever. The problem I have with Linkin Park is that they ruin a perfectly good song with yelling at the end almost every time. I find myself listening to the songs and then when they start yelling, skipping to the netx track. The band should have realized by now that their two most popular songs \\"In the End\\" and \\"Somewhere I Belong\\" both don't have yelling in them.Basically, the CD is pretty good and I would reccommend it to anyone who liked Hybrid Theory. If you aren't really a Linkin Park fan, then the yelling might annoy you and you may want to steer clear of this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"If You Like It You Like It, And IF You Don't Well...........","review":"Overall a good album, but.....Like my title says If You Like It You Like It, linkin park has a rare sound, and if its your thing then buy the album, if it isnt go buy some hard rock and set some of your savings aside for hearing aids when you are 25.the songs are well crafted, i have had the thing for 2 months and i am still discovering new layers and beats, i was listing to a track 5 min ago, cant rember which 1, and found a realy erie spooky oooooooooooo hiding in the background of a chorus. and it took me a month to find the great piano in \\"somewhere i belong\\",1 of the reviews here has some weired and interesting facts, i allways pictured the forward as a old pice of glass or somthing, not a CD burner, interesting.OVERALL, a good 2nd album, its hard to find a 2nd album this good, and they did a good job, even if they were a bit perfectionist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the worst CD ever...","review":"It really took me a long time to find something I liked about this album, but after a while, it grew on me, and while I doubt it'll ever grow on me to the point where I give it any more than 2 stars, it's got good points. It unfortunately suffers from an overreliance on programming and a stray away from the band's already-minimal metal influence, but somehow or other, they manage to pull the synth and guitars in enough to make a decent product. I can't really say it's an improvement over their first album; it's got more good songs but also more filler. Basically, the tracks on here are either good or garbage. Nothing great, but also nothing mediocre. Unfortunately, the bad outweighs the good, and there are some tracks that are almost entirely hip-hop. Hardcore Linkin Park lovers will probably like it, but if you just use LP for an easy-listening deal, then you might want to think twice before investing in this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Disappointment","review":"When Meteora came out, I went crazy. I was obsessed with this album. Linkin Park finally gave us some completely new songs after what -3 years? But over time I realised the truth. What did we get? An album repetative in song style, with teen-anst driven, watered down lyrics, and increddibly simple instumentals (especially the guitar). It's the start of a great band just losing it. Hybrid Theory an HTEP were always and still are some of my favorite albums but Meteora was just sad. It's the start of a once awesome hard rock band going into the MTV-pop genre. And now releasing singles such as Numb and Breaking The Habit is only going to bring more young fans who share their love of Linkin Park alongside their other favorite band; N'Sync."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst. Band. Ever.","review":"Linkin Park takes all of the horrible aspects of wonderful bands like Led Zeppelin, Aerosmith, and AC/DC, and mixes them into a hunk of poo. this album is garbage. I was severly dissapointed with Hybrid theory, but at least that was tolerable. Re-animation took a mediocre album, and made it worse. things like that should not be tampered with. this reached an all time low. if i could i would give it a zero, exept for the song Faint which is the only thing i think theyve done thats any good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterpiece","review":"I Don't see how anyone could complain about this album. First off, anyone that has complained has done so about one part of the band. Maybe it's just me, but everytime I see LP, theres more than one person in the band. THe musicianship on this album, although not as successful as Hybrid Theory, is still excelent. The band blends so many things together wonderfully. And all the bull about selling out. Name a band that hasnt. The CD is well worth 15 bucks for Faint alone."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Album of All Time","review":"When Linkin Park's first album, Hybrid Theory, came out, I was skeptical about the group. From the little I had heard of their song In The End, it sounded just like any other screaming Rock group. But I then heard a full version of the song in my friend's house and was hooked. I had been heavily anticipating their second original album (I say original because their second album, Reanimation, is a remix CD), Meteora, for months and I got it the day it was released. When I listened to all the new songs, I was blown away. All the songs are great, even the Foreword ties nicely into the CD, and the DVD is informational and funny (watch The Wizard Song). Believe me, if you like Linkin Park, or if you've never heard their music, you'll love it either way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Real Rock","review":"Ok the reason that i gave Linkin Park new album \\"Meteora\\" a two was, first the album is around 36 minutes, second the album is not real rock like \\"Smashing Pumpkins\\", Or \\"Nirvana\\" which are true rock groups. What I mean by they are not a real rock group is that they are produced for radio, and not produced by the indy seen . The only true good song on the album is faint, which is about 2:45 minutes long, which is not enough for me, because im used to album being at least 60 minutes long not 36 minutes. PLEASE SAVE YOUR CASH ON A CD WORTH BUYING MAYBE LIKE RADIOHEAD !!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment","review":"I bought this cd last night expecting another great set of powerful music, similar to Hybrid Theory. I was wrong.The whole album is only 36 minutes long. They filled the other 300mb on the cd with useless multimedia for PC. The only song that really begs to be played more then once is the single \\"Somewhere I Belong.\\" I'm sure I'll be sick of that after it's played 8 million times on the radio. The songs just don't flow.

Until you listen to real music.","review":"This cd has plenty of catchy tracks, namely Somewhere I Belong and Numb to name two which have also got clips.The rest of the other tracks kind of blur together.Even the good tracks on this cd can't last repeated plays, after awhile one just finds them utterly predictable.I could care less if this band made bajillions, but at least they could make their later releases somewhat different.The music aside, I recommend not reading this band's lyrics, which are utterly average and gives one a feeling that the band members perhaps hired angsty high school teens to write their lyrics for them"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not better than Hybrid Theory","review":"this wasnt as good as hybrid theory because it had 2 much rap.

This album builds on the strengths of the previous one, and adds new factors to lift it a standard higher.I particularly liked 'Numb' and 'Somewhere I belong.' The vocals and rapping go nicely together with the rockish and sometimes techno tune. 'Breaking the habit' was good, though it could use some of Shinoda's rapping.But the main thing is, that the lyrics are all about negative things, such as giving up, or being rejected. It would benefit from some deeper lyrics, and perhaps a quieter, more melodious song.Song music blend is fantastic 5/5, but is pulled down by the good but insufficient range of lyrics 3/5. Overall a good effort, and I do recommend it to rock fans"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad","review":"This CD is a perefct example of why alot of folks hate new metal. First there's the drums. Like most new metal bands they are processed and myre the depth of the music and overal quality of the alledged metal feel. The lyrics are just what every drama queen teenage punk wants to hear. Wich is pure uncontrolled emeotional despair and rage. Not only is it annoying and cliche, but it takes very little skill to write. The giutars are an improvment from Hybrid Theory, hats off to them for elvoving in that department at least. But they are still simplistic to the point of limiting the replay value significantly.All in all....It's a notch above other new metal bands at best, and a slap in the face to music in general at worst.

I lovedHybrid Theory, but this is probably my favorite CD that Linkin Park has produced to date. Everything is done better. There are more tracks, more songs, and broader emotional appeal.Obviously hits like \\"Somewhere I belong\\" and \\"Lying away from you\\" are awesome. Other songs like \\"Nobody's Listening\\" are great as well. The songs combine metal, rap, and electronica extremely well. If you are a fan of any of those genres then this CD is for you. The songs appeal to your emotions. Whether you are feeling like an outsider or feel you have mistrusted, this CD has tons of songs for you.I will say that I hated the song \\"Breaking the Habit\\". Many people enjoy the song, but I just do not. All the other songs on this CD are great to listen to though. Pick this one up as soon as possible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fire!!!!!

Even Though I Like Hybrid Therory Better its awsome. best song LYIN FROM YOU"},{"rating":"2","title":"Linkin Park rocks mad sox!","review":"Meteora was amazing. I got it the first day it came out, and once I put the cd into my cd player, just hearing the foreward, I knew it was going to be perfect. The songs have a variety of different instruments such as violins etc.. and it's cool how they sort of connected all the songs so it's like one whole long song. The booklet impressed me the most. Every page was full of different designs all made/thought up of by the band. And beside the song lyrics, they'd have a little \\"NOTE\\" thing that tells you about information about the song. This is defnitely the best cd of the year."},{"rating":"2","title":"What I think.","review":"Ok I think that the CD is good But it's lame that you can not play it on your computer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hybrid Theory pt. 2","review":"This is the album for hardcore Linkin Park fans. If Hybrid Theory never left your CD player and all you did was whistle Linkin Park, then you need this CD. Their sound DOES NOT CHANGE at all. It is \\"classic\\" Linkin Park (even though the band is only like 4 years old). If you like a band's sound to change and evolve, then you will most likely not like this CD. Linkin Park's sound does not evolve, they just play some great \\"earspank.\\" This is the CD all Linkin Park fans should OWN, not BURN. Support your band! Buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Great CD from Linkin Park","review":"This CD/DVD combo is a must buy for fans of Linkin Park. The DVD is a nice extra with bonus footage of the process they went through making Meteora, but the CD is where the magic is. Every song is put together flawlessly as the CD progresses from Foreword to Numb. You can just sit down and keep the cd in for hours, the replay value is awsome just like Hybrid Theory. It's hard to pick out one or two songs that really stand out because they all have their own appeal yet are on the same scale of greatness. You just have to hear the whole CD to appreciate it. Some notable songs just for mention sake are Lying From You, Faint, Breaking the Habit, and of course Somewhere I belong. This is all coming from not just a Linkin Park fan, but a fan of all kinds of music. So do yourself a favor and check it out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Labeling this band and this album as Metal is a travesty","review":"Linkin Park is in no way heavy, nor are they metal. This is really overrated, overplayed pop. Chester sounds awful with his constant screaming, and the lyrics are poor. If LP really wants to impress me, let them start by making an album with substance. For example, writing more than just a bunch of songs about how they're outcasts or how they suffer from huge amounts of angst on a day-to-day basis."},{"rating":"1","title":"corporate rock at its best (worst)","review":"So let's face it. Corporate radio rock these days is going down the tubes with few exceptions. This band is pretty much one of the leaders of the \\"canned music revolution\\". My friend told me about this band and I had heard one of their songs before and thought it was pretty good, so I bought Meteora with high hopes. When i got to about song 3, the horror of my realization dawned upon me. This stuff is pure, manufactured crap!! I busted out my guitar and looked at some tabs and their songs are like 3 notes, at best. The vocals...oh man. Constant screaming about how the lead singer's relationships suck. Every single song. Oh yeah, and I listened to hybrid theory and found that a lot of meteora is a carbon copy of their first album...just listen and you'll probably notice.Please everyone.

I was disapointed by the bands first cd and didn't expect to be really moved by this one. But this cd is a step in the right direction with harder hitting beats and lyrics that I can relate to more. I was supprised by this outting. Other songs that cought my attention are \\"Lying From You\\", \\"Hit the floor\\", \\"Faint\\", \\"Breaking The Habit\\", \\" Nobody's Listening\\", and \\"Sessionn."},{"rating":"2","title":"So much hype.....","review":"To put it nicely, this album was....disappointing. With the hype surrounding the album, I expected every song (or damn-near every song) to be spectacular. While there are a few stand-out tracks like \\"Somewhere I Belong\\", \\"Lying From You\\", \\"Faint\\", and \\"Breaking the Habit\\", the rest of the album is simply not worth noting. Now don't get me wrong, I still (and probably always will be) a LP fan and will continue to listen to Meteora. All I'm saying is that it doesn't even come close to touching Hybrid Theory (but, contrary to popular belief, there REALLY is so many times that you can hear \\"In the End\\" and still keep your sanity) :-P"},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE! please don't buy it","review":"Just as bad as Hybrid Theory.

I cannot pick out one element of Linkin Park's music which makes their sound attractive enough for people to actually buy their CDs. You have 2 vocalists (i'm sorry, 1 of them is a rapper, pssh) who constantly whine about broken relationships. They might as well hire 2 neutered cats for vocals. I really wonder if current Linkin Park fans (mostly the tone deaf) think this band is going to be around forever. They'll drop off the face of the earth like Jesus Jones did in late 1991. I guarantee this. At least Linkin Park couldn't hold a candle in the wind to Jesus Jones, who at least had substance and depth in their music."},{"rating":"1","title":"LIMP BIZKIT Suck or is this the other crap band","review":"linkin Park are the 2nd worst band in history only beaten by the great crap bizkit.

All you Limp Bizkit Wannabes can't keep up with the words so u go to this pansy music if you want HIP HOP/Metal go get Rage Against the Machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Linkin Park hits Mainstream, and hard","review":"Linkin Park has always been a favorite of mine, from their early EP to their days in 2000 when Hybrid Theory was released and before it went huge. \\"Meteora\\" has a lot of hybrid sounds, but doesn't have the roots of LP. Too me, the background effects put on by Mr. Hahn are spectacular, but Shinoda's lyrics have changed, and so has their sound. I think this album is a big version of the song, \\"In The End.\\" Its too soft and melodic for true numetal or rock fans. Although it is appealing to listen to while relaxing, the true rocker and old school LP fan will find this album to be very disappointing. Those Grey Daze are coming back faster than we know it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Formulaic.","review":"I really liked Hybrid Theory. It was fresh, it was original, and it was everything I liked in a CD. Meteora, however, was none of these. It was a great disappointment.Each song by itself is actually pretty good. But when you look at the CD as a whole, each song sounds incredibly similar. EVERY SINGLE SONG (except for the 13 second intro...why wasn't this just combined with the second song into one track?) has a sampled intro that soon ends with a heavy guitar riff. After that, it's mostly the same: Rapped verses and screamed choruses.Linkin Park's musical progression has been close to 0 in the almost 2 years since Hybrid Theory was released. It's clear that they'd rather stick with the Hybrid Theory album-selling formula rather than make interesting music."},{"rating":"2","title":"LP ROCKS!!!","review":"I love this cd soo much... everyone should buy it.

No matter how much you listen to it... it never gets old."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another MTV sellout record","review":"Ok, first of all, anybody who likes this cd, click \\"no\\" on the helpful voting thing and then kiss my ass. This cd blows. It's so unoriginal and boring; most of the songs sound extremly similar to each other or to something on \\"Hybrid Theory\\". The entire album screams SELLOUT, and they're releasing singles like nothing right now. I admit, I liked Hybrid Theory, it was hard and catchy, and, even a little bit (not much, though) original. Overall, I thought it was a decent album. I don't what the hell these guys were talking about on MTV when they were saying that their music was \\"evolving\\" on the new album. It's the same stuff, goddammit! Actually it's worse, so I have to give them props for that. I can't believe I wasted 14 bucks on this crap!

Awesome background music and great lyrics. 5 stars for this Kick A@@ band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!!","review":"How they managed to make a better album is beyond me, but they actually did it. This album is amazing from beginning to end. From the hard rocking riffs of \\"Don't Stay\\" to the calm, pleasing intro beat of \\"Numb,\\" the album just takes you and never lets you go. Stand out tracks include \\"Lying From You,\\" \\"Faint,\\" and \\"Breaking the Habit.\\" These are only my favorite tracks, but rest assured that every single track in the album is great. If you liked the first one, then you absolutely are gonna love this one. If you are one of those who thinks Linkin Park is not worth listening to, then don't listen to it. You're the one missing out on great music. It's great to see artists who can make music that is this creative. This album, along with Metallica's and Radiohead's new albums will probably be the best releases of 2003."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hell of a CD/DVD","review":"why are you wasting time reading reviews?

I'd say it has been the best album in its genre this decade so far.

I highly recommend this CD to anyone interested in good music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well, at least they're consistent!","review":"If you thought they're first album was as heavy, sincere, intense, and groundbreaking as it gets, wait 'till ya hear this one!If you thought they're first album was as contrived, monotonous, and just plain obnoxious and annoying as it gets, wait 'till ya hear this one!This is more of the same, whatever your opinion of it may be.

Why would anyone want to listen to this disgusting insult of a band? Go pick up a Slayer, Vader, or Morbid Angel album.

I remember buying it and sitting there waiting for a track as good as, say, \\"One Step Closer.\\" Well I listened to the whole album six times and was badly disappointed.Not only is a big step in the wrong direction for Linkin Park, but everything sounds forced and generic. Maybe it's just me, but I felt they could have done a lot better.Nothing stood out on this album to me.I threw it out after struggling to make it half way through a seventh time in an attempt to find something beyond average... aren't these guys supposed to go on tour with Metallica this summer? Hell, they better just play stuff from Hybrid theory and perhaps some of the Reanimation remix stuff unless they plan on putting the crowd to sleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"We are getting the shaft.","review":"As a person who spends a lot of money on music, I believe something needs to be said about this product. Linkin Park may have put out a fine product, but they only put out 36 minutes of worth of it. I find that to be a problem. I also consider it to be a problem because Warner Brothers saw fit to charge the public $...to buy the album. The public is getting the shaft and Linkin Park has not spoken out against this. What a shame. Artists complain about getting [cheated] by their labels but they don't seem to mind if their fans do. Come on Linkin Park, let us here what you have to say."},{"rating":"1","title":"mmm... no","review":"I don\`t care too much about this band, I like rap-metal but this is not a good way to recognize it.

Meteora is the epitome of a brilliant album with extraordinary lyrics and beats. Chester Bennington's voice is astounding and makes the band who they are. Its very hard for me to pick which song is ma favorite on this cd but with thought i'd have to say \\"Numb.\\" Rating this cd and the songs individually i would give each a 10 out of 10. Any true rock fan would indeed enjoy this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love It","review":"Ok, im a huge Linkin Park fan, i have every single one of there songs, even the rare stuff, this album was one of the best they have done, i loved Hybrid Theroy and Reanimation, both very good.

The first time I listened to the album I hated it, I thought it was horrible!After a while I decided the album decided a second listen, I mean I had only listened to it once.

I loved this cd because it felt like every word he was saying was the same thing I was going through. I was probably around 19 at the time. Either way a great cd, and it pretty much ties with Hybrid Theory but I think I like this better because it's not all yelling, it has mixed."},{"rating":"2","title":"!!!!!Linkin Park to the MAX!!!!!","review":"I've listened some other Linkin Park. I thought they were okay. But when Meteora came out, i never expected this! This is awsome! I love the hardcore guitar on this album. Don't Stay is my favorite one on this album. The guitar is awsome in the beginning. Numb is great stuff. I'm always singing this one. His scream is really cool too. In Faint, he does his scream solo. !It's SWEET! Breaking The Habit is a little lighter than the other ones. But i never skip it. The only ones i skip are HIT THE FLOOR and SESSION. Linkin Park rocks. This album is !!!!!Linkin Park to the MAX!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"kind of disappointed","review":"after 2 1/2 years all they could muster was 36 minutes. Somewhere I Belong and Don't Stay, Faint, and Numb are really the only tracks worth listening to over and over and if it was not for those 4 songs this album would be a complete waste. Hopefully they did not commit career suicide by doing this. Fans expected at least close to an hour of what they came to expect from these guys which is maybe a little heavier than Hybrid in some cases and mellower in others. I am a little worried that we will wait another 2 1/2 years for another project and it will be only 20 minutes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Meteora : Evolution","review":"This album is an excellent example of how bands can grow, change, and experiment with sound. It is impossible not to incorporate sounds from the past, and indeed, there is an undeniable influence from music of the past few years on this record. But if you like the sounds of Hybrid Theory, you will like this album. The fact that it might sound kind of 'pop' is irrelevant. In my opinion, \\"Easier to Run\\" and \\"Breaking the Habit\\" are great tracks that show that you don't need the crunching guitar of Korn or the insane beats of Slipknot to make a good song. While I don't dismiss these other acts, Linkin Park has definitely carved its own niche in the modern world of rock, and this album definitely overcomes the challenge of \\"sophomore\\" albums........ But make your own choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vivid [LP] Fan-Meteora deff makes up for Reanimation & some","review":"I don't know if I can say this is there best album cause hybrid theory can't be beat, but it definitely ties. Right now it is the only cd I'm listening to cause every song on it is amazing. It flows like no other; I can't pick a favorite cause the whole cd jus owns. My favorite tracks on it thought are, Numb, Breaking the Habit, Nobody's Listening, Faint, and Somewhere I Belong. If you haven't bought it yet, seriously next time you're at a music store or something use one of those 50 gift certificates you got for Christmas or something. It is my cd pick for 2003; I also sampled it a week before it came out so I had sometime to enjoy it. Its simple go out or it order online its amazing. : B Saint"},{"rating":"2","title":"A satisfying followup to the let-down Reanimation","review":"I waited weeks and weeks for this CD. Here I am sitting at my computer listening to it, and happy I ran to buy it after school.

Do your self self a favor and download the demo versons of hybird theroy, it's a good example of what Linkin park is capible of which they don't act on.

Linkin Park's newest album is short yet has the potential to touch everyone in some personal way. I love how they continued having one track lead into the next and how they continue to use the mix of rap and rock. Linkin Park's sound is also still unique in their new album. They use the right combination of bass, beat, sound effects, and rock. I would recommend this album to anyone who liked, even remotely, their first album. This album is just a continuation of the last and I can't wait to hear their next one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD to keep the sounds from their previous cd's","review":"Linkin Park is a great band with many strong points, but as always has its flaws. This CD was a great CD to keep up their reputation as an incredible rock band, yet it is not something that will completly blow away fans.Pro's: The music is great. Somewhere I Belong has a strong message, Chester has some quality singing in this song. Session, even though without lyrics, has some impressive moments that will keep you at the edge of your seats.Cons: 37 minutes is definetly not enough for such an album. They should have pushed the limits and either added more songs or increased the length of the other songs. Also some of the songs get old after listening to them constantly.Overall as said before, its a great album that impresses a fan, but does not blow them away. A good fallow up to hybrid theory, but could have been even better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD, only one complaint.","review":"This is an awesome follow up by Linkin Park to Hybrid Theory. I agree with some of the other reviewers that the CD too short. That is the only reason it got 4 stars, I would give it a 4.5 if it was possible. But a lot of new CDS of this genre are around 40 minutes anyways. Example: Sum 41, Trust Company. But all in all, an awesome CD that should be in my CD player for awhile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull","review":"I bought this CD/DVD the first day it was released, listened to it once (cringing the whole time), put it back in the case, and sold it immediately without even watching the \\"Making Of\\" disc. Unlike their first \\"two\\" CD's, I found Meteora to be incredibly dull."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but a little lacking","review":"Overall, not a bad disc. However, I wasn't totally satsfied. First, as has been mentioned, this is a short CD. Second, it just didn't bring out the same emotions as the first CD, for the most part. One of the things I loved about Hybrid Theory was that I found something in every song that I loved, which is pretty rare, most CDs seem to have a good song or two to put on the radio, and a bunch of stuff just to fill up the cd. Unfortunately, Meteora drifts much more into the latter group - \\"Somewhere I Belong\\" and \\"Numb\\" are the only songs I could really get into and expect to still be listening to in a week.Overall, if you're new to LP, go for Hybrid Theory. However, if you're an LP fan, go ahead and get this one also, you're sure to find something you like; just don't expect the near-perfection of Hybrid Theory."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great New CD!","review":"I was waiting for this CD. All new songs that get better every time I listen to them. This CD compares well with all of the other alternative rock CDs I have. Sounds best with extremely high volume.

If you were into limp bizkit but thought they were too HIP HOP, you'll love linkin park. With the exception of one song chester sings by himself and one song that showcases Mike's rhymes, they combine Chester's powerful voice and Mike's smooth raps to perfection. It is a masterful blend of rock quitar riffs with a hip hop bounce. It has something for everyone. Trust me, you won't wanna pass this one up."},{"rating":"2","title":"it could have been worse","review":"Hybrid Theory is an album that blows you away with a fresh sound right from the get-go. Now that this sound is established, it's hard to recreate that freshness. I kept that in mind when listening to Meteora. Most bands who start off explosively have nowhere to go but down, getting worse and worse (Bush, Korn). I was afraid this would happen to Linkin Park. When I first heard their sophmore album I didn't like it but for a few songs. But it does continue to grow on me as we speak. Their sound is consistent and they experiment with a few new things. \\"Numb\\" is hands down the best song on here. Not a bad album, but not enough to be better than their first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Power, power and more power...","review":"I was very excited to listen to this sophomore release by Linkin Park. Needless to say, I was not disappointed! This album is wrecked with power chords, pleasant progressions/modulations and razor sharp vocals. The flagship song, \\"Somewhere I Belong\\" is just one of the very power-wrought songs. Sessions is a definite winner too...Trent Reznor would be proud!!If you enjoy power-metal/industrial - this album is for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great cd","review":"First thing I can say is: wow! A lot of people think that Meteora is just a spin-off of Hybrid Theory, but you can tell that's not true. Mike's rapping is a lot better, for example.My opinion:1. Foreword-nothing to say about it...2. Don't say-8/103. Somewhere I Belong-10/104. Lying from You-7/105. Hit The Floor-9/106. Easier to Run-8/107. Faint-9/108. Figure .09-6/109. Breaking the Habit-8/1010.From the Inside-9/1011.Nobody's Listening-10/1012.Session-5/1013.Numb-10/10Overall, this was a GREAT cd, I don't care what reviewers say about it. Looking forward to more from Linkin Park!"},{"rating":"2","title":"let's PaRTaY!","review":"This cd was GREAT! I really don't know why \\"Somewhere I Belong\\" was chosen for their first video, compared to the other songs, that one's not so good.Really catchy songs, and session can also be found in the Matrix Reloaded CD. As much as I like this one, I still think the first one's better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Booo.........","review":"I really dont get this new music. Screaming in a microphone about breaking a habit is not what I call music. I have so much to say...but I know Ill just piss you guys off. This music sucks....ok? Rap sucks too.... got it? Real rock music was at its perfecting in the early 70's. Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, Jimi Hendrix all saw the meaning of music and life. This meaningless Linkin Park crap...is just....loud and irritating. Plus they are sell outs! God damn this band sucks...."},{"rating":"2","title":"to all haters of linkin park","review":"to all you slipknot-loving, mudvayne-moshing, metallica-blasting lifeless stoners out there, i have a message. You can listen to your 20-minute boring solos, you can memorize every satanic lyric and go worship the devil in your little lucifer shrine, and sell your soul for front-row tickets to get spit on by a 40-year old screamer band, but leave linkin park alone. They have something all other \\"metal\\" bands don't have. Emotion. Emotion you can relate to. And Meteora is a triumph in rock history that everyone can enjoy. Im sick of all you screamer-rebels insulting something you don't understand. So go back to your mom's basement and put on 100 dollar headphones and head-bang quietly to yourself while wallowing in your own depressing life-style. You will never make anything of yourselves except for manager of a liquor store, because linkin park is better than you ever will be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dear Members of Linkin Park","review":"Up to 1995 the Rock musis in general was awesome. Then one day you and another gay-ass fakers like you (Limp Bizkit, Blink182, Good Charlotte, Creed and etc.) came and ruined it, arn't yo ashamed?! Many morons tell me you are so talented, but there is no one talented in your band but that nerd that sits all the day on the computer and mixes your bad music. BTW DJ in a rock band?!?! What the f**k?!?! Anyway the vocals are awful and sound like rap (This Mix of rock and rap sucks), The guitarist espcially sucks, did he ever took guitar lessons?? He always play the same chords and he plays only in the choruses. Oh yeah.. the bass, I found that he knows to play only 4 sounds on his bass guitar, he repeats the on every song.BTW since you made a discrace to the rock music and rap music, the best thing you can do is to get on the 10th floor of a building and jump (Without Parachute!!)

Rap, screams, guitar riffs so dreadful they are incomprehensible, and the drumming, terrible. The lyrics are plain and sound like a 15 year old would like them, but judging by all the ridiculous five star reviews on here, I guess that is the case. Every song seems to be about the same thing and the songs seem to lack the conciseness of hybrid theory, also the production is a step down from hybrid theory. Hybrid theory was a breath of life into a dying genre, this is just noise, pure noise, the mere sound is stale, i was really looking forward to this album. Linkin Park jumped on the rap metal train to late, they won't last long, but then again, i guess thats the only time they have a chance to be big, when the other monsters of the genre are taking the hint and evolving or fading away. take the hint LP, go away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missed the boat!!","review":"I like Linkin Park's first release. It was good, catchy, I could maybe believe the manufactured angst in the songs but all in all it was a good CD with many high points. Meteora just doesnt have the same spark that kicked me in the pants that their first one did. Sure the songs are more well crafted with keyboards and such but it seems to me that they dont have that same motivation. Where as the angst worked the first time around, this time I just dont believe it. Maybe it's their sudden rise to success, but one things for sure, Meteora is certainly a more commercially appealing radio-friendly CD. Too bad. I think it could have been much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm Impressed!","review":"This is quintessential Linkin Park. I must say I'm addicted to track 6: \\"Easier to Run\\".

This band is so inept of talent it makes me sick. For someone to actually compare this rap/pop whatever sort of waste you consider it, to a great composer is an abomination. Simply put, a very overrated band that does not have enough talent or creativity to fill a thimble. If you have any respect for music, letalone self respect, you will never consider buying this cd.

This time around the album is packed full of poorly sampled blips and sounds that are mixed in with the more annoying than usual rapping, repetitive down tuned guitars, and inconsistent drumming that people the world over have grown to love. Chester Bennington, who I had said before had a unique voice and is quite talented, sounds tired and plain old uninspired here, and the band is so poorly knit that it is plainly clear that \\"Meteora\\" was released just to make money and get on the radio. This isn't hard rock. This isn't metal. And none of these guys are Mike Patton (the other vocalist whose name slips my memory seems to try to mimic him more and more). Linkin Park is only part of a trend....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterpiece","review":"This will always be my favorite album by linkin Park.

In the early 90s, Korn puts out their first album, which is admittedly pretty damn good. Was it really necessary to milk the concept of no guitar riffs, unimaginative and totally childish lyrics, total lack of talent to such a degree that we end of with Meterora from Linkin Park? This is the downfall right here folks, kids are praying for it more than anyone apparently. Linkin Park is just terrible, how can you not see that kids. And the fact they tour with Metallica, well theres another review in itself. I give up and will need to find some other kind of music to listen to."},{"rating":"1","title":"It doesn't even merit a star","review":"I can't for the life of me understand why people listen to this band.

Most of these songs sound like someone hit the \\"demo\\" button on the keyboard and sang over it. I'll stick with my Aaron Carter CDs. He may be silly, but at least he's fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chester, get a voice","review":"Ugh. I won't spend much time on this review, simply because it isn't worth my time. Let's get a couple things straight : Linkin Park's biggest downfall is their vocals. Sure, they're arguably decent musicians, but if you can't sing, then what's the point? Chester's voice is scratchy and painful to listen to, and it totally butchers potentially good songs. It's the kind of voice where you know he hurts afterwards. That's probably why this album took so long to make, because after they recorded one song Chester most likely wasn't able to talk for the next two weeks.Anyway, the only reason I gave Meteora 2 stars is because of 'Faint', which would be a great song if not for Chester's nasty vocals, so it's only decent as it is.Do yourself a favor, save the 15 bucks, and go by Evanescence's Fallen instead, or even Avril Lavigne for crying out loud, it's better than this. Evanescence actually have someone who can sing, and beyond that too."},{"rating":"1","title":"GARBAGE","review":"joe fleckenstein here to give you my opion about this posotively awful album. first of all im not a linkin park fan THANK GOD! just someone who had to endure the pain of listening to his friend eugene talk about how great this band is. well theyre not.

The only good song is Faint and that really isn't even good if you think about it.

Correction: It was below average. But now, the band has chosen not to develop, but instead keep up it's un-innovative, cliched, terrible sound. They are just the most mainstream of a genre with very narrow boundries, and one that takes 2 genres which sound great alone but terrible together and mixes them together. Rap and metal don't mix. The slews of modern metal bands that have been inspired by KoRn and Limp Bizkit are destroying the music industry, and this is just another one. If many of the impressionable youth are creating bands to sound like Linkin Park and their similar counterparts, then they have really missed the mark. If these guys are going to be the future of music, then the hard rock/metal community is [in bad shape]. Don't waste your money. It is nothing new. The only reason the band didn't change their sound is because IT WILL SELL!!! Excruciating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meteora..... more like Mediocre!","review":"I have to say I liked the first CD.

On their past album One Step Closer and Crawling helped.Linkin Park uses a mix of rap and rock.

Well that just shows how much musical quality is declining these days. When someone who is no good at what they do \\"playing their instrument\\" can get rich.

It took ME but 3 months to cast this band aside. You can buy this album if you want, to maybe listen to it before it goes stale.This band's style is just such that if you listen to it enough, you will probably become very agitated. I listened to it for about 2 hours once and discovered myself coming out of a deep feel of impression to realize myself into a migrane. This band mixes far too many different genres into one style, and you will easily get annoyed after a while. Go ahead, be my guest, buy this album. No one's stopping you.

A little more hip-hop and a little less metal. There are definately some innovations and new territory explored here. When I first listened to this CD, it seemed that some songs were modeled after their previous successes. That may be true. But I do thouroughly enjoy this CD. I like \\"Breaking the Habit\\" for its catchy rapid-fire beats. \\"Don't Stay\\" could actually be from their first album (its good). \\"Hit the Floor\\" has a crazy adrenaline pumping chorus. If you are a fan of LP, you wont be dissapointed. Just make sure you give this CD a few tries. I did NOT like it the first time I listened to it. Now I love it.

Well, this album did just what we thought couldn't be done. Every song is killer, the oriental theme throughout the album is different and adds to the uniqueness of Linkin Park. I thought the radio would kill \\"Somewhere I belong\\" but play the album start to finish, you'll hear NIN influences for one, and it'll all come together. It's well organized, chaotic and angry but beautiful.Everything Crazy Town wanted to be!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not all expected but still holds true to linkin park","review":"This album is different from the original Hybrid Theory but still has songs that reflect the hits of old. There are track that sound remarkable as others don't quite live up to my standards of this band. But you can tell the elements of instrument talent have risen.

Their rapping is pathetically substandard, even for white kids. Their electronic beats/synthlines are simplistic and formulaic. Their lyrics are self-indulgent whiney garbage remniscent of high school goth poetry. Maybe its just me, but there's nothing more annoying than faux-misery. Their sound is so overproduced and unchallenging... easily absorbed without a struggle or a brain cell utilized. The sung vocal lines remind me of any MTV happy boy band of your choosing. Basically a radio-friendly mish mash of popular genres glossed over with a pop shine aimed at pre-teens who don't know any better. But I guess what can you expect from a band that was signed to a major label after their first show.Please people, stop listening to garbage like this. It makes the RIAA think you're stupid enough to keep buying this kind of tripe..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!!!!","review":"This is a great album. I highly recomend this album to any music fan!

But i'll try to get that away.Linking Park shows some good evolution in Meteora, doing this sort of \\"Korn meets The Backstreet boys\\" metal. In fact, one could easily say that there's no metal at all in Linking Park's approach to music. There's just a couple of heavily-distorted guitars and that's all. But that's my opinion being a metal listener.The songs are very catchy, and the guys can sing and scream like they were in a real nu-metal band (i don't like Nu metal either). So, Linking Park did a good job on this one, and there's no doubt that this album is going to be considered just great by the teenagers."},{"rating":"1","title":"lacks authenticity","review":"in short, i just don't believe the authenticity of this band and their music. i believe that they blatantly ripped off the work of lebbeus woods in a set piece for their first video 'somewhere i belong'. look at the cover image of the book 'radical reconstruction'. in the video, you will find a sculpture that clearly copies this design."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stunning melodies","review":"Lyrics & melody really make this CD upscale-the group has the potential to explode onto the charts.

Screaming choruses and catchy rap lyrics, but I beg to differ.For one thing, there's an aura of new age in it. More instrumental-type effects then Hybrid Theory. The riffs are excellent, such as the beginning to Somewhere I Belong and in the song Numb.LP always had meaningful lyrics, and they don't lose that in this album. The song Breaking the Habit is my favorite because it's very catchy and sounds very good. There's no heavy riffs and it's a simple song, but it took Mike 5 years to finally get the right sound for it, and boy, did it work!The song \\"Hit the Floor\\" is a hip-hop beat song. Rapping lyrics coupled with guitar riffs make it one of the best songs on the album.Anyone who has loved LP's songs, such as the hit single In The End and the new single, Somewhere I Belong will absolutely adore the album. 5 stars makes this album one of my favorites."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too short","review":"This new album is very incomplete. i would like to trade in my enhanced cd content for the rest of the music on this cd. only 37 minutes of music??? thats about half an album. the music is good and most of the songs are catchy, but every song needs to be longer, and there needs to be more go and less show..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review of Meteora","review":"I think that this album is very goo, although I still think that Hybrid Theory is thier best album yet.

My only complaint about this CD is that its only around 40 minutes long, but the qaulity of this CD musically well supercedes the length of the CD tracks. I was thoroughly surprised at how great this CD sounded, and quickly forgot its few faults after one good listen of the CD. I highly recommend this to any Linkin Park fan, and for those who like good unique music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pro Tools","review":"All I can say.... is that Linkin Park got a hold of ProTools and ran with it. ProTools is computer aided audio editing and mixing. It's a wonderful tool, but I attribute it's heavy use in this song like bands used synthesizers in the 80s.... way over used. This album lacks in play time and it lacks in strong lyrics. I hope their next one, if there is a next one is better."},{"rating":"2","title":"addicting album","review":"When i heard Linkin park was finally coming out with a new album after all this time, i was excited and nervous at the same time. Hybrid Theory was so amazing as a debut album that it seemed impossible for them to be able to produce an album that would satisfy the high expectations that all their fans had for them. Meteora has proved itself to truely be worthy of listening to. It still has some of the feel of the Hybrid Theory, but they have progressed to a higher level of music. You can tell this in songs like, Breaking the Habit and Faint. This album is extremely addicting; you play it once and it won't leave your stereo. I would have to say that Linkin park has really outdone themselves this time, and i can only expect more wonderful music from them in the years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not another sophmore bomb","review":"LP did a good job in avoiding mistakes made by many artists. When Reanimation came out many people said \\"Why remixes? Why not just release a new album.\\" I saw it as a stall job to pacify us fans and give them more time to work on this album. It worked. Meteora might not be as great as Hybrid Theory but is far from a bad album. The same formula still exists. Insightful angst driven lyrics, fueled by a powerful beat, rythmic guitar licks and Chester Bennington's rageful vocals make Meteora a CD well worth buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sits in your head","review":"well the first time i heard it the only song i liked was lying form you , but after listeining to ti 2 more times , i m addicted to it now , althogh i wanr u this is thousand time better than reanimation and almost upto the hybrid levelit gets repeated although ,s songs build up the same way , he sings , chorus , sings again ,chorus ,shouting but then WHO\\"S complaining :-Di seriosuly recommend it to ever1 , for all genre ppl ,atleast give it a shot"},{"rating":"1","title":"Meteocre","review":"Dear Linkin Park:Thank you for developing another mind knumbing talentless album such as your previous two realeases. Meteora, much like your other records, is void of anything creative or inspiring, or even remotely interesting. Meteora plays on the concept that radio LOVES sameness and uninteresting music, as do kids who dont understand the value of difference and the power of following your own path. Meteora is the XMen of music, lots of flashy stuff but offering little in talent or value. Perhaps most depressing, Meteora drains me of hope for any kind of heavy metal talent coming this year or any time soon, this fact enforced 100 fold by the fact heavy metal sellouts Metallica will be assisting in the sale of Meteora."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE BEST CD EVER!","review":"This is the greatest album i've ever heard...no, wait terrible, absolutely terrible, this album proves that if you can talk and scream, you can be in a band, and of course have a cool drum machine, greatest cd ever though man, excellent!"},{"rating":"1","title":"They let themselves down :(","review":"After listening to this album, I now regret every day I wore my Linkin Park T-shirt with pride!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Same crap as Hybrid Theory. Which, by the by, sucked as well","review":"Linkin Park. How can I describe these guys? I'll do my best here ....\\"Whiney, corporate-created Top 40 pop-rock.\\"That about does it. Linkin Park is talentless. The only band member with some promise is Bennington. He actually has a decent voice. The rest of them blow. Simple power chords, simple drumming, simple bass, et cetera. Indescribably simple songwriting. I mean how many songs can a band write that goes Verse, Chorus, Verse, Chorus, Break, Chorus. Christ man. Learn to write something else. And for the love of God, please stop whining about how bad your relationships are, how no one loves you, how you can't go on, and so on.And to whoever is classifying this band as metal, please, educate yourself a little more thoroughly.By the way, the only reason this thing got 2 stars (and that's stretching it) is because of \\"Lying From You.\\" I can actually tolerate that song."},{"rating":"1","title":"N'SYNC with screaming.","review":"Ho - Hum I reviewed Hybrid Theory ( NO BASS, NO FEELING) and gave it 1 star. I would give this nothing if I could.

But hey I am not surprised, this is just a happy meal, mass marketed overplayed, overated, plastic junk. If you are 13 go out and buy it, who cares. AHHHH."},{"rating":"1","title":"A poor follow up","review":"I liked the first linkin park album but this follow up album is [bad]. It is slow, depressing and has no quality at all. The first release off this album is 'Somewhere I Belong', and i should of known that if that was the first release the rest of the album wouldn't be much better and that was the case. To put this album into perspective take the worst songs off of the adema album, the hoobastank album and crazytown's first album and you have a quite pitiful follow up, I have given this album two stars because quite simply thier first album was that good; the phrase 'One Album Wonders' certainly comes to mind. I suggest to anyone even thinking of buying this album KEEP YOUR RECEIPT!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best CD ever","review":"This is the best CD ever, there is no song on here i didnt like. I would even say it is slightly better then hybrid theory! If you prefer Rage Against the Machine to linkin park then shame on you! Linkin Park is way better then metalica, they are old grandads! My favorite songs are nobodys listening, from the inside, lying from you, and faint. Buy this CD! And if u dont like it you suck!"},{"rating":"2","title":"~~~~***~~~BUY~~~***~~~~","review":"everyone has to buy this cd!!! this is the best band that ever came out....people say that they r bad but then that meens that they have No taste in music....so take it from me...BUY THIS CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"LINKIN PARK at their best?","review":"I can't believe how much people are raving about this album. The album is pretty cool, but not life-altering or any of the stuff I'm hearing people say. The CD carries about three solid good songs (Somewhere I Belong, Faint, and Numb), but you start to wonder at the lyrics. After all, what the heck are they talkin' about? In this LP, Linkin Park ventures further into the hip-hop world with plenty of deejay beats and the vocals seem to striving to be more emcee-ish. But Linkin Park is good where they are in the music biz. This album is their best, although Hybrid Theory is close behind it. After listening to this whole album in just over an hour, I started to relaize the songs just blend together. You can pick out Somewhere I Belong and Faint becuase they have been played on MTV and teh radio a lot, but the other songs are just a blur. The bottom line seems that Linkin Park is capable of making every song a smash hit, but they choose to seem to perfect a few specifics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another waste of time","review":"Yep this follow up is just like their last one, stupid pretendious, nu metal nonsense, the songs are boring, the screaming is more horrible and the lyrics are unimpressive, ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just the same ol' thing","review":"I heard this album by a friend and I didn't see difference about the 1st album. This is just the same thing... It's sounds like a certain scrapy pop rock (I can't believe we call it ROCK). The Chester voice is to horrible when he yell and the turntable n'machines don't have place in the band. I just want to say many bands deserve more attention than this generation of \\"Gently Rock\\"..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Linkin Pork's Meaty Aura","review":"Linkin Park is back with more quasi boy band metal. Seriously though, on one of the songs the singer sounds like he's doing a Nick Carter impersonation, i think its number 6. Anyway, I didn't expect this to be much better than the awful Hybrid Theory. It's virtually Hybrid Theory II, if not slightly more experimental. My problem with Linkin Park is that while the music is tolerable and sometimes they come up with some good hooks, the vocals and the lyrics are horrendous. Chester Beningtons screaming sounds more like a poodle being strangled and the rapping is just plain cheesey. He doesn't vary his delivery at all, it's the same in every song just different words. The lyrics are also the same in every song. You could interchange the lyrics between any two Linkin Park songs and barely tell the difference. If you're not into real music and just want to be kewl and hip like everyone else, then Meteora is waiting for you down at the mall."},{"rating":"1","title":"30minutes!!","review":"This album is a disappointment . It took them this long to make it and it's only 30 minutes long...and the 1st track is 13seconds, Please!Most of the tracks are indistinguishable from the 1st album.I wouldn't waste my money on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"...","review":"I thought Hybrid Theory was a piece of junk. This one is worse, if that is even possible. What a waste of a perfectly good CD. I'd rate it a negative number if I could. Go find some real music, and throw this piece of junk out into a blazing inferno."},{"rating":"1","title":"They're Very Talented, But That's All","review":"Linkin Park is a very angry band and, even though they don't swear in any of their songs, they're not a very good example to the younger generation who listens to them. I'm in that younger generation, 14 years old to be exact. About a year ago I was totally taken with them and not realizing that their songs were changing me into a rebellious teen. I finally got over that whole Linkin craze and saw that, as much as I liked their songs, I had to stop listening to them. Even though I'm a Christian I can't help but fall down sometimes, and so I'm giving you some advice: don't go the way I did, just steer away from the bad stuff. Like it says in my title, the guys in Linkin Park are talented, but that's all."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best one yet","review":"this album was very powerful and it is a lot mature than the last one but the last one was great also.This album is the best one yet, because it has more choice in what you are into the mood to listening to , from electronica, hip hop, trance to rock.I was very impressed and happy with this album compaired to the last one because the sound is so much better and the music is deeper than past albums.These six guy bring diffrent types of music into one genre and make it there own"},{"rating":"2","title":"I have only one complaint.....","review":"This CD is way too short. Good, hard rocking CD, and the use of double vocalists is one of the coolest things about this band. The music is fresh, with just enough bite without going overboard. Very highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hybrid theory....but better","review":"Linkin park isprobally one of the most ..well...the most unique bands today...besides MSI but thats besides the point...ill be quick with it....Meteora is harder and more meaningfull than HT....go get it....cuz its good...very good!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"I think this is an awesome followup sophomore album. After listening to this I've realized that curse does not exist for this band. There is something about that mix of heavy metal and hip-hop that makes them so awesome. They have their own sound that you must hear because it is like no other. Chester screams and Mike raps out emotional lyrics that just help ease troubles of life. \\"Easier to Run\\" is very melodical and slow with some hard rock guitar and awesome drums, they achieve almost a punk rock sound in \\"Faint\\" from the fast tempo, and \\"Breaking the Habit\\" is very soft, with no heavy guitar but with a 10-piece orchestra. All of the lyrics are different from other people. They are like poetry. They can be interpreted any way you want. The DVD is an awesome added feature and you will understand the whole painter thing and art on the cover of the cd and the 40 page booklet. You will not regret buying this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Kick[en]","review":"It's pretty good. But there is about 3 or 4 songs that are just sung by the guy that doesn't rap. Most of those songs are too soft for linkin park. But Most of the Cd Kicks ...The first half of the cd till about up to track 8 is awesom. I definately recommend it. Maybe I'll like the songs I don't like with time. That's how it was for me with the first Linkin Park Cd. And then I started liking almost every song on their. .... It was worth it..."},{"rating":"2","title":"LP Did It Again","review":"I can say i'm not at all disappointed with 'Meteora' Me being a huge Linkin Park fan, jus' love every bit of the CD.. and every track is great.

I give this CD 5 stars, and If you liked 'Hybird Theory' then I strongly suggest your purchase 'Meteora'"},{"rating":"2","title":"Linkin Park Does It Again","review":"Put simply, if you enjoy Linkin Park, buy this album. They've definitely taken their sound to the next level, but are unmistakeably the rap/rock group that became so amazingly popular.While instantly recognizable, the album nonetheless holds a few suprises: \\"Nobody's Listening\\" contains a captivating loop of a Japanese flute; \\"Faint\\" is a high-tempo joy to listen to; \\"Numb\\" a crisp industrial instrumental.So... don't like Linkin Park? Sorry, but you're not gonna find enough change here to make you want the album -- go listen to your New Found Glory CD again. If, however, you ARE a fan, this is undoubtedly a must-buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good","review":"I really liked this cd. The only drawback I think it might have is that some of the songs sound, and are written, a lot like the songs on the parent album Hybrid Theory. For example, Easier to Run has almost the same form and structure as Crawling. Not that thats a bad thing, because both are excellent songs. Somewhere I belong is a lot like In The End. Again, both are great songs. So unless you didn't like Hybrid Theory, go ahead and buy this album. Even if you didn't, you should give this one a shot. You may find something different about this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbelievable from 1 to 13","review":"This is an unbelievable album. The amazing way that Chester and Mike can blend together is outstanding. I now have all three albums and i can't really decide which one I like more. Im currently deployed with the army in Afghanistan, i was really looking forward to getting this album and i was without a doubt not dissappointed. Long Live Linkin Park!"},{"rating":"2","title":"meteora maxes out a 4-star rating","review":"this album is a great follow-up to hybrid theory (as far as new studio music)... the guys bring their same gut-wrenching style to brand new tunes which will be sure to get you out of your seat."},{"rating":"2","title":"If You Like The New Single You Wanna Buy The Album","review":"If you have heard the new single, Somewhere I belong, and thought it was good wait until you hear the new songs. It's been awhile since they put out a new record so I was expecting nothing but a masterpiece. From what I have listened to so far I have to say that the worst song is the new single, even though it is great also. If your a fan of LP then you'll wanna rush out and grab this, and if your not, you soon will be like me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Reviewer Dissing Linkin Park","review":"I hate to jump on the bandwagon but I can't help myself. Linkin Park is simply not a very good band. I heard this album when my friend who swears up and down by these guys asked me to give it a listen. Never one to be closed minded, I thought what the heck, it can't be that bad. Well I was wrong, it was horrible. Every song sounds the same and though I haven't listened to Hybrid Theory, it sounds like all the singles i've heard on the radio.They basically have three elements, whining vocals over a monotone rap, the same distortion filled guitar riffs they have always had and buried scratching to fill spaces. Lyrically it's the same pre-packaged rage every other nu-metal band has been spouting out for 5 years.... Two stars for being 38 minutes, at least they aren't pretentious enough to make a 75 minute album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bit of a commentary on people....","review":"first off, the cd is pretty good...second, yeah, its short, big deal.... third, it sounds a little repetetive... and fourth, there are different kinds of music for different people... and here we have people saying that linkin park is just pop with a harder sound to it.... i think they have way more emotion than any pop song i've ever heard.... so, people, just calm down... listen to what you like...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, please.","review":"Wow. This was disappointing. I first bought Hybrid Theory two years ago, and loved it. It was just the right balance of scratch, rhymes, and heavy riffs. Meteora does this, but too much. So many people say \\"It's the heaviest thing I've ever heard!\\". Oh, please. It's all about the lyrics they say. Well, when the music blatantly [stinks] you can't stand to hear the words. Shinoda does his rapping thing with Chester wailing like a monkey in the background. He has two modes: scream, and sing softly. The bass and guitar riffs are plodding and the scratches are annoying. Buy Tool or System of a Down with your money, rather than waste it on 37 minutes of screaming, scratching, and bad riffs. Unless you like that kind of thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fairly good, actually","review":"This was one of the first rock albums that I ever bought, I instantly loved it, it was hard, it was angry, it was everything a teenage boy could want. But then after a while of getting into better music and starting to play music of my own, I lost interest. It didn't seem near as interesting. But then I picked this cd up again and listened to it and actually thought that it was pretty good. Yes, the guitars sound the same for the most part and lyrics are kind of childish, but I like Chester's voice and I am a fan of using a dj, though i think Incubus does it better.Overall not a bad buy if you are able to look past a few things."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pies rule. Agree with me or die","review":"You know what? I'm sick of people using Linkin Park in their insults against other bands. In the review section of most metal bands, there's always someone who doesn't like it and says something stupid like \\"Go listen to your damn nu-metal like Linkin Park, p****,\\" and such...That being stupid because Linkin Park isn't even Nu-Metal.I actually like this band, and this cd for that matter. It's got lots of fairly simple songs, yet each one is completely different from it's predecessors. And ALL the songs on this cd are enjoyable to listen. Hell, even the lyrics aren't bad.I'd take this band over any Nu-Metal."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Sequel Almost as GOOD as Hybrid Theory","review":"OK! If you have NOT listened to Hybrid theory - you are either deaf or are living in a cave!I can still remember the days when I was on the street handing LP's promo tapes of \\"One Step Closer\\" and \\"With You\\" to people. Even my most critical friends that are hardcore classical metal to trendy nelly fans LOVED what I gave them. NOT a single negative review. Linkin Park I personally knew and they are SOOOO down with the fans. I musta received so much stuff from them - from backstage passes to signed posters and limited edition WarHall Original Artwork posters! This album 0wnZ! Almost as tight as Hybrid Theory, but still contains the essence that made LP so popular. They are popular for a reason - dont hate them cuz they are liked...! They make awesome music and thats just down. I mean I like all music except country - and I can say LP really tries hard to do the very besy artistically! Buy the album its worth every single penny!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Amazing","review":"I bought the Linkin Park album w/ the dvd. It's amazing!

All I can say is go out and buy it, cus It rocks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is awesome, I totally recommend it","review":"Wow, you can definitely hear that the Linkin Park guys have come a long way since their hybrid theory album. First, I have to say that just like their first album all of the songs are great. On my way to school, like almost everyday I jam to this cd in my car. My favs include Don't Stay, Somewhere I Belong, Hitting the Floor, Easier to Run, Breaking the Habit, and Figure.09. This is most definitely an album worth getting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its Cool But It Sounds The Same","review":"Well I guess I can start by saying this cd is like everyone else is saying Hybrid Theory pt.2. But I guess I cant complain much it sounds like what I loved on Hybrid Theory(until it got stolen). The songs are more experimental and have more melody to them but no drastic change. Well,If u liked Hybrid Theory get this but dont expect to be blown away like u were when u got Hybrid Theory because it might feel a little like dejavue when u listen to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"LP threw 12 Stones at me","review":"First, let me tell you whats bad about this album.1. It is 37 minutes long2. Some songs (Breaking the Habit) are nothing like what LP normally does...that song is way too softNow the good stuff.While you might have to listen to them a few times before u really like them, the whole CD aside from Breaking the Habit is very strong and is what you expect from Linkin Park.The best on the album are Hit the Floor, Figure 9, From the Inside, and Numb.oh and if you're wondering if there are Christian bands like LP, give 38th Parallel and Pillar a listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even Better Than Hybrid Theory","review":"Yes, it is no lie. Meteora is even better than Linkin Park's debut album, Hybrid Theory, which was simply incredible. I'm so happy that Linkin Park didn't sell out and make all of their songs sound like \\"In the End\\" since they had such a success with that song. Instead, Meteora is much heavier than their first effort, Hybrid Theory. The music is better, the lyrics are more mature, and the vocals by both Chester Benington and Mike Shinoda have improved greatly. I definently recommend this album. It's what every rock fan has been waiting for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as Hybrid Theory, but still very enjoyable.","review":"Linkin' Park does make a successful comeback with this new album, Meteora, following their last smash hit album, Hybrid Theory. I liked Hybrid Theory little bit better, but Meteora definetly delivers. It's quite enjoyable and worth buying for any true Linkin' Park fan. However, this album doesn't seem to have as much unique rap-metal style as Hybrid Theory did. It's more of a hard rock album than a mix of rap-metal. But it's still a cool CD. I enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Linkin Park at their best","review":"When I was first introduced to Linkin Park a year and a half ago, I was pretty amazed at how well they can mix different types of music for an awesome sound. Somehow I went backwards, buying Reanimation first, then Hybrid Theory. Each album has a slightly different sound, but they are all amazing. When I caught the opening strains of Meteora, I was really in awe. At first I thought that Meteora had a little bit higher-pitched screaming than Reanimation or Hybrid Theory, but I loved it all the same. I would for sure reccommend this CD and all other LP albums to anyone who likes pop, rock,or rap. Those guys have gone to so much work to bring us some really cool tunes, so keep rockin!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Is it worht the money?","review":"now i admit, i am not the biggest likin park fan ever. I thought there last cd, hybrid theory, set a new page in music, combining rap, rock, electronica, and other elements to get a very new sound out. However this cd is normally supposed to be a maturation of the band, but yet, this is falling short of the goal. it will please the ears once, maybe twice, but the cd will lose it's flavor, like old gum, and it lose flavor quite rapidly. the cd has it's bright spots, but they are dim compared to the bar that was set by the last cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"A matured Linkin Park","review":"the title says it all...the lyrics are more mature and i think that they are better than the lyrics from the first album..but even though the lyrics are nicer and the album is a little harder than the pervious one,it's still LP...i mean the songs could fit perfectly in Hybrid Theory...so the band havent developed a new sound....the album has more skirts and rap mixing..so you will hear a lot of rap in it...even though it's a cool production,i think that Hybrid Theory was a lot better than Meteora...but maybe that its not a surprize...as a lot of bands who have a lot of success in a short time...the band its very busy...so they dont have so much time to develop a masterpiece like Hybrid Theory..anyway..the whole album doesnt show excellent sparks...the tracks are average...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deja Vu again!","review":"I loved \\"Hybrid Theory\\" and was really looking forward to Linkin Park's new release, but this one's a big let down!

I got it right when it was released. After a year, you begin to get the slightest bit bored of it, honestly. However, it is very solid.

But at the beginning, you're gonna think it's the spit. Really, it is. At the beginning. Afterwords, you just revert back to Hybrid Theory and the several good songs on Reanimation. But yes, GET THIS ALBUM. It is truly amazing.Also, try your hardest, and I mean thumb a ride if you must, to see Linkin Park live. I saw them at the Meteora Tour, yes this album, and they were simply majestic. Nothing short of phenomenal. 10 fold better than Live in Texas, which is good.

I was not expecting this album to be as good, as sequels never are in the hard rock world, but Linkin Park has abandoned everything that got them here in the first place: catchy guitar riffs, a driving beat, and the originality of their album. I was expecting the originality not to be there, but i wasn't expecting guitar riffs and especially the driving beat to be lost. Linkin Park has tried to mellow their music but still stick to their hard rock roots, and the results are disastrous. There is not one song that I would listen to again on this album. I can only hope that Linkin Park finds its mojo soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its real simple...P.O.S.","review":"This cd, Is a HUGE and I DO MEAN HUGE.. Dissapointment..

How they pushed 5 singles out of this album is beyond me.Forward, the most pointless waste of 13 seconds, kicks off this CD. Sadly, the sound of thumping and glass breaking represents basically the rest of the CD.Don't Stay comes next. Not a very impressive first song.If we jump to Breaking The Habit, this is the lamest attempt at an emotional song EVER!!! Chester F!ckington or whatever his name is still screams, even though this song is intended to be slow and mellow.The song Numb is a drastic last impression. It made it to the top 5 on 2 charts:1. The Top 40 charts2. My chart of Horrid songs that should have been thrown out as soon as they were finished recording them.An overview of the album:it is sucky, screaming, and repetitave.Please save your money and invest it elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good, always sucked","review":"I think linkin park is a very crap band on all of their cd's. Out of every song they wrote the only one that I think is at least a little bit good is the Breaking the Habit song and that is the only one, all of the other ones are mostly in a rap form. I hate it when people say that this band is a hard rock band when I would say it is a band for little girls that are under ten years old and have no example of what real rock is like. This band has childish lyrics for simple-minded people, I think bands that are actually good would have to be the black metal bands."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wherefore art thou music","review":"I tried, I realy tried people.Everybody is always telling me how great LinKin Park is, and how i have to run out and buy the CD.

And the rap-rock stuff I keep hearing? how does anyone really like this? I'll admit these guys can play some decent music, but it sure seems like they haven't really tried too hard..

I have regrets buying this piece of crap now. They have become one of the biggest mainstream \\"rock\\" bands out there, and their talent is wasted. One and a half years later, I burnt a copy to put in \\"safe keeping\\" in case I wanted to give it to one of my kids (I may not have kids...I'm an idiot). I sold this CD and got $6.25 out of it!

Linkin park's Sophmore album is work of art. While I would not recomend going to see this band live, there studio work is among the best in the industry. Every riff, scratch, and electroic sound was carfully placed, and the result was amazing. My only real complaint with Meteora is that every song is so dramatic that it takes some of the fun out of the album.(Come on guys lighten up a little).

Its a short CD with 13 songs and goes for 47 mins or there abouts. But it has many great songs layered in their successful blending of rock with rap and comes out with a good effort. This is the enhanced CD version that comes out with great multimedia content. The video of 'Somewhere I Belong' was the highlight and shinoda has a great voice almost reminiscent of Aaron Lewis from Staind.The hit song from this album became and for good reason, 'Somewhere I Belong', it shows Linkin Park at their full potential with gritty lyrics and a delivery that is amazing. My other favourite songs from this album were 'Faint', 'Breaking the Habit' and 'Sessions'. Sessions is one of the better instrumental songs I have come across recently."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why do people listen to this?","review":"This cd sucks, and that is all you need to know.

I love Linkin Park, but this album ain't that hot.I have to say that making \\"Somewhere I Belong\\" the leadoff single was a good idea, because it's the best song on the album. \\"Nobody's Listening\\" is pretty good too (except for the dry chorus), and \\"Breaking The Habit\\" is decent, but the rest of the album seriously falls short of what LP are capable of. For instance, Hybrid Theory showcased Chester's screaming blending in well with the songs, but here he's either yelling without really saying anything, or the screaming drowns out the music (Craig Nicholls of The Vines shares the latter problem). And Mike's rhymes are decent, but after a while they start to sound the same.I got the limited edition of this with the bonus DVD, but I didn't even watch it because I was so disappointed with the album."},{"rating":"1","title":"tatoly dezaponted","review":"I fought this cdd was goinna roack simplee becauz this band is got the ferst word spelled wrong... its lookes koolr lake thet do not't get me wroung...

I hate kids that call this stuff \\"metal\\" or \\"rap\\". Its just crap if you ask me. If anyone needs a definition of metal I would recommend bands like Metallica (The greatest band of all time), Slayer, Pantera, Megadeth, Iced Earth, Dream Theater, and anything else besides this \\"nu-metal\\" stuff. Linkin Park is the biggest sellout band of all time. For Meteora how many videos did they release? See my point. They have no talent. Their guitar riffs cannot be distinguished from the bass and all the other crap. This is not talent at all.

Papa Roach,korn,Nickleback,Limp Bizkit,and P.O.D's last albums all flopped. Linkin Park is the only band hanging in there, but not for long. Luckily bands are coming out bringing back the sound of the old roots of rock n'roll.

At first I thought it was awful and I was ready to rip up Linkin Park for getting so big and then releasing a mediocre record because they are going to sell millions anyway.But honestly, after the 3rd and 4th listen something clicked. Once you realize that LP has a formula that makes them sound the way they do and accept the music then this album becomes a pleasure. There are heavy tracks and some lighter, more melodic ones. A few have interesting drum tracks and backing samples. Overall I would recommend this CD to anyone who liked the first CD. I think as an overall album is concerned this is a bit more diverse which I found more rewarding for repeated listenings (which will be quite alot, since their next record won't be until another 3 years)"},{"rating":"1","title":"oh...my...gosh","review":"wow, my original review was way off from what i think now. at first, i was blown away by this. after about 10 listens at the most, though, it started to get old. fast. their lyrics are subpar when compared to their past works, under whatever name they happened to be going by at the time (Xero, Hybrid Theory, etc.). Gone are the open-ended songs, full of imagery and begging to be interpreted however you wanted to. Now, the lyrics are so straightforward and unoriginal on most songs, it's almost enough to make me sick. it's like LP teamed up with an emo band to write a lot of songs on here. i'll give it two stars because there are a few good tracks, namely Faint and Breaking the Habit, and the DVD was entertaining. but please, for your own sake, stay away from this. go buy Reanimation instead, or better yet, go and get Waking the Fallen by Avenged Sevenfold, which is easily the best album of 2003."},{"rating":"1","title":"IM MAD BECAUSE YOU WONT DO THIS!","review":"IM MAD BECAUSE YOU WONT BE THIS WAYMAYBE I USED TO BE BETTER EVERY DAYIM REALLY NOT OKAYSTOP BEING THE WAY YOU ARE!!!!!!i just wrote linkin parks new hit number one single!! yay. add some power chords over and over, and your gonna sell a few million albums to some stupid 14 year olds.O, ya, and for the review....

Every song is the same, some Japanese dude rapping with some white clown screaming over the top of him. Chester Copperpot needs to refine his skills so can be called a singer and not some buffoon. The best song that LP has ever done is on the Matrix Reloaded soundtrack. It's the best because there is NO singing on it. No rap, which sucks anyway, and no screaming to hurt the ears.

I read (and re-read) this marvelous novel a long time ago, so I do not recall all its details. But now, so many years later, I am still left with the distinct feeling that I had partaken of something very, very special. \\"Loving Little Egypt\\" is not an easy book to come across, so if you find it in some second-hand book shop, be sure to buy it and read it.

It exudes a charm not found on many albums of that period. It also is one of the benchmark releases with Ulrich Roth (now known as Uli Jon Roth) on guitar. His guitar skills mature on this one and point towards sweep appregios and other guitar techniques that he and subsequently Yngwie (who are both good friends) would explore later. The euro metal scene owes half of their guitar techniques to this guy. He is my favorite guitarist, period and unlike Yngwie he knows how to be subtle. But thats not to count out the rest of the band, Klaus and Rudolf are full of energy and enthusiasm and also their songwriting skills are truly honed on this one. The rhythm section is also great. I would suggest picking up the two cd Virgin Killer boxset ... but wanted to do a seperate review for people wondering about this paticular album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only Blackout is better...","review":"Scorpions' 4th album,truly became a classic in my rankings. All tracks from \\"Pictured Life\\" till \\"Yellow Raven\\" are all brilliantly worked and awesome both lyrically and instrumentally. The leads are all so nicely done and full of soul, Uli Roth really went for it on this one; Klaus gives out his best vocal performance of the 70's albums, and Rudy bangs that guitar crazy and of course also needed to add the fantastic percussion by Rudy Lenners and bass by Francis.\\"Polar Nights\\", is one easily the best song sang by Uli (how I'd love to hear Klaus sing it), very complex and well built.The ballads are also fabulous, and without all those dramatics that Scorpions started to do in the 80's, with \\"Crying Days\\" being the best. Other classics like \\"Catch Your Train\\" (they really killed this one on Acoustica) are also present.Being more consistent than \\"In Trance\\" and \\"Taken By Force\\" this is and ABSOLUTE MUST, if you don't have it and you love the TRUE Scorpions buy this NOW!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"classic","review":"I have always been a huge fan of scorpions, this album is no exception.

Zuckerman's concept of the \\"commercial best seller\\" is very specific. His advice might seem constraining and formulaic, but it's hard to argue with the success of a best seller, monetarily and in terms of number of readers reached. For us philistines who would like to produce a good read and reach a wide readership, Zuckerman shows us the way to go. The successive outlines for Ken Follet's Man From St. Petersburg were very edifying, showing the author's struggle with plot development and characterization. It's a rare opporunity to see a clearly weak first idea develop into a first rate novel. So get this book and write a best seller first, then you can go back at your (well bank-rolled) leisure and write exclusive arcana for your elite cadre of literati."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for First-Time or Published Novelists","review":"After having written and published several novels, I picked up Mr. Zuckerman's book and was astonished to find, all in one place, a concise dissection of all that I had labored to teach myself. It was a gold mine of information about the craft of writing commercial fiction (and by commercial, I in no way mean to denigrate).In his pithy book, Mr. Zuckerman has reduced to usable length all the rules that other \\"how-to\\" books ramble on about. I wish that I had found this book prior to begining my writing career, but am thoroughly pleased to have found him mid-career. (He's also a great guy, whom I have since met.)If you want to maximize your chances of writing a successful commercial novel, pick up a copy of this book and DO WHAT MR. ZUCKERMAN SAYS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book for the aspiring writer","review":"Fun to read and very informative. If you want to be an author, then talent alone isn't going to do it for you. This book gives you insight into the world of authors, agents and movie producers, all looking for the next BIG thing. Notice I didn't say Good thing or Great thing. This book tells you what everyone is looking for. You may have an idea for a good book, and you may like it, and your friends may like it, and maybe even a few thousand others will too if they ever hear about it, but this book will show you what the people who are looking for you, are looking for you to have written. (read it again, it makes sense ; ) Well written and gives great examples in books you will have heard of, and some you will not.

This book doesn't contain anything I haven't seen explained better in other more helpful books. Probably a fifth of the book is taken up in direct excerpts from the books the author analyzes, and there are hardly any principles that don't apply to any well written book. This is just a gimmick to sell the book to writers who have lofty dreams of writing a bestseller. The premise is bad - you shouldn't write a book expecting it to be a blockbuster. Write a good book first, and through editing and promotion, you might realize your goal. I would recommend \\"Structuring Your Novel\\" by Robert Meredith and \\"Building Better Plots\\" by Robert Kernen."},{"rating":"1","title":"too severe","review":"i think this is more for an editor. or any person who reviews a manuscript and helps the author improve it. if i had read this before completing my novel - i think i would have been discouraged to the point of giving up. it negates the creativity, excitement and fun of writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"look elsewhere","review":"This book was a total disapointment.

The war veterans father was so irritating at times and it was a little too bloody for me!Some of the films aspects I did like! The war veteran seemed very creepy(imagine a 20 something year old man who spend most of the day sitting in a rocking chair)! Very creepy! However, I was disappionted the overall film was otherwise not really all that creepy as I hope to see in a low budget early 70's film and I didn't like the frequint us of Gods name used in vain (esp. by that old goat father)!

It disrupted the entire neighborhood for several months and the uproar when \\"outsiders\\" found out it was a horror movie was so funny. Some of us were background \\"extras\\" and had quite a blast. The house has finally gone up for sale after the last of the original family has gotten on in years and the younger generation doesn't want something so large, so if you're interested, and have a spare $419,000.00 you might want to look this one up.

Even though the song is about a man adoring a woman, I love my mother dearly and thought the title was lovely.

To really understand the man who is the 44th President of the United States, one should read this book.

What Obama is about!","review":"I could not put this book down. Maybe it was because I am also in public service but something about that man's life was really intriguing. He was rich in culture (found culture), family and most of all, rich of thoughts and questions. Those questions he had are questions that many Americans have whether they're black or white and getting them answered by his experiences make it that much better.Like the other readers, I would have like to read more about his experiences at Harvard and also how he got to be a US Senator but I'm sure there will be future books. I hope to see him as a presidential candidate in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suprisingly Candid Self-Portrait Of A Fascinating Man","review":"FINALLY got to sit down and read this after sneaking peeks of it at Wal-Mart, on the Internet, etc. In spite of a slow middle section (sorry - I grew up in northern Illinois and the first newspaper I read on a regular basis was the Chicago Tribune, so the inner workings of Chicago politics are not exactly novel to me), I found this to be fascinating reading. I was particularly intrigued by Obama's frank depiction of his teenage years (at the risk of sounding naive, I really didn't expect the f-bomb to be dropped more than once in a book by a sitting president) and his in-depth examination of the lives of his father and paternal grandfather, whose stories have been (unsuprisingly) vastly oversimplfied in the mass media. In conclusion, I think you'll find this to be a insightful and well-written work regardless of which side of the political fence you sit on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"I have both of the Barack Obama books and out of the two this one is the better one.After reading this book....I started thinking a lot differently about myself and my family history.

It was also fascinating to here the narration in his own voice. I highly recommend this audio book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"I loved this book! I'm so glad he wrote it before attempting public office because it was an honest expression of his experiences and beliefs. I think many things would have been left out if he had considered possible future consequences. However, by leaving them in there were no skeletons in his closet.

Along the way he found his true purpose by helping others achieve change for the better. He is very open with the reader about his experiences and defeats. The writing is so well done that I often have to sit back and remind myself that this man is a lawyer and politician and not an author.

I was interested in this book because I thought it would be interesting to read what this man has gone through. Yet when I started reading, there was nothing exciting or gripping to make me read on. Obama manages to write 4 pages on the morals behind a lady that wore colored contacts one day. It has nothing to do with the story and makes you lose attention. It gets interesting when Obama hears who his father really was. But immidiately after that, the interest is lost.I myself have not lived in America during the time of this book, and am not an African American. This book doesn't say much to me.Finally I think that he should have spend more time discussing his mother and the influences she had on his life.I wouldn't recommend this book if you do not like books that sometimes lose track of the main plot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard to read??","review":"I don't know what the earlier reviewer was thinking about, but I couldn't put this book down!

Obama's relections about the events of his life are poignant and insightful. I learned so much about the man as he recounted his real education (the one he got on the south side of Chicago) after Occidental, Columbia, and Harvard Law.Obama's capacity to weave something handsome and strong from the disparate threads of his inheritance gives me hope that through his vision and leadership he can help our country appreciate and make good use of our diversity."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Narcissist's Blog","review":"I felt I was reading a story about a Narcissist who was trying to justify how great he thought he was.

Whether your politics place you on the left or right, the fact is DREAMS FROM MY FATHER is a clumsy, amateurish effort with little insight and even less truth, and it probably would have been more compelling and weighty had Obama waited until later in his life, after he actually accomplished something, to reflect on and write about his formative experiences. In contrast to the image propagated by mythologizers in his campaign and elements of the media, Obama demonstrates little skill as a writer and his work here falls far short of publication quality.

The result was not pretty: In this book, Obama vows to embrace his black half and denounce his white half. That is unquestionably racist and contradicts his promise to be the \\"Great Unifier.\\" That was profoundly upsetting, yet wonderfully revealing. More people should read this book. They wouldn't be so enamored of His Majesty. It was also disturbing to learn that his exalted father, whom he admires and adores, lost his legs driving drunk and subsequently died driving drunk. Daddy Obama also fathered eight children with four women and at one point was married to three of them at the same time. He abandoned Barrack. Mommy and her parents raised the future president.

If you want to hear hollow, ingratiating political rhetoric, all you have to do is turn on CNN or any other 24-hour news network. But Obama is obviously no average politician. I think the biggest reason why he drew so much support in 2008 is because Americans could tell that he actually did have a real personality and his character had not been totally compromised by his desire to be elected.

Due to time constraints, I never finished it. However, I recently found the time to pick it up again and realized that I could not put it down.

As a child of immigrants, I often longed for that recognition of me in my predominantly Caucasian surroundings. It wasn't until my first trip \\"home\\" that I fully understood myself and culture.

Because of the style I didn't find myself able toemotionally connect with his story and It lowered my enjoyment of the book.That being said I still Think that people should read this book because thefirst step in figuring out what a person is like(i,e. vetting) is to read whatthey say about themselves.

The similarities of life in Africa to life on early St. Croix, Virgin Islands of my youth was profound. I felt transported on the same journey to the earlier years of my life, especially the similarities in people, culture, community, politics, economics, and class structure. Also, I think that it is an important part of who Barack is if he does make a run for the Presidency. It helps to identify and position him in the political world of his people, the Democratic Party.When Barack decided to include his black ancestors it gave him a stronger sense of community and a wider connection to the global community of the world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Racist","review":"It was interesting only in the fact that it shows the Authors true dislike of the white race without a lot of basis to his feelings"},{"rating":"2","title":"A life story told with courage and compassion","review":"Gives an insight into the life and family of one of the most gifted politicians of our times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware the deceiver","review":"Quotes from this book.

Amazon refused to publish it probably because I said what I think: this book proves him to be a racist.However, I won't reproduce my work, rather, I will leave you with this following warning: Mein Kaumph was Adolf Hitler's assessment of what needed to be done. Dreams of my Father is Barack H. Obama's warning to the world. He is no Martin Luther King. Think Malcom X, and you get the idea. Peace out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I felt that the Obama hadn't mastered a unified voice. The narration veered from lyrical to vernacular to ungrammatical colloquial--and all in the narrator's voice. Obama didn't identify his own voice and then let characters speak in their voices; his voice shifted in tone and language so much that I felt he evoked an \\"unreliable narrator.\\" I don't think that was his intention. As a result, the potentially moving aspects of the book were diminished."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay...","review":"I swallowed this book for the first ten pages. It was intriguing, conversational, and I was excited to read about the man I voted for. I was into this book all the way up until he went to Africa. After he went to visit his family, there were just too many names and characters involved and I went from being confused to not caring at all. The author would tell me things like someone sipped a cup of tea. In a fiction story, that matters--in a nonfiction story, it's irrelevant. Many of the things Barack encountered while in Africa were unnecessary to tell me in this book although they may have been imperative to him. Every once in awhile, I'd hear a good story from his grandmother, I liked to hear about his father and grandfather growing up, but all the cousins/midwives/brothers/sisters etc. were a bore to read about."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic","review":"Dreams from My Father is a greatly inspiring memoir. Controversial, though it is, the story reflects the soul of a man who is open to his identity. In this book, Obama argues with himself and comes to terms with his identity. You will not regret getting into the pages of this page turner that bear the hallmarks of a classic. It is a recommendable read. I also liked The Color of Water, Triple Agent Double Cross---stories with remarkable characters who come to terms with their identities."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intelligent and insightful...","review":"I have always been impressed by the President's talent for speech, but I am even more impressed with his writing! Especially when I realised that he wrote this when he was still quite young, long before he was well-known. A Tea-Party friend told me this book was heavy and depressing and would change my mind about Obama, but I must tell her now, \\"Au contraire!\\". I found the book to be deep, moving, interesting, witty, and downright fascinating. No, it's not light fluff, and thank God for that! My respect for our President has only increased now that I have read his own story in his own words. I love that he comes from such a diverse and colourful (no pun intended) background.

I thought, given the groundswell of controversy surrounding him and his Tea Party perceived hatred of white people, it was revealing to see how conflicted about race Obama really was/is.

They were talking about foreign influence in Africa. She mentioned how her daughter casually spoke a mix of Swahili, English, and German with her friends. Commenting on this she said, \\"in the end, I'm less interested in a daughter who's authentically African than one who is authentically herself.\\" I eagerly anticipated that Barack would reflect on that statement...but he never did.The book is an enjoyable read and Barack is a great writer; however, he becomes entranced in trying to be identified as African-American and seems to shy away from, and almost become critical of his Caucasian identity. In a book from a well-educated, bi-racial politician about \\"race and inheritance\\" I wrongly anticipated that Barack would help meld the racial divisions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Identity struggle told eloquently","review":"I read this book during the weekend my youngest sister got married. His search for his identity, while familiar to anyone who had gone through adolescence, resonated with me as a person whose own narrative is not the neat ethnic line, strong family ties type. He eloquently described his continuing struggle to prove himself black, while equivocating on his drive and acheivements. I felt like I got to know him in a way we rarely do a political candidate. Since it was written before he ever ran for public office, it is spin-free (unless you believe those that say he played up his drug use for \\"street cred\\").This is a story of someone who felt himself an outsider in a any group he \\"belonged\\" too.

It was even worse then THE BRAIN THAT WOUDN\`T DIE and ZONTAR, THE THING FROM VENUS!!! So anyway, the plot is that evil Ro-Men (Gorillas in diving helmets!) kill the entire planet except for one large family of six, so they send one Ro-Man down to Earth to kill them-but he falls in love with Alice. Overall silly, so bad by itself you don\`t need to make fun of it! The stock footage from ONE MILLION B.C. and THE LOST WORLD doesn\`t help.

In the movie you can see Ro-man's face. You can also tell that its in a costume.I have seen better old sci-fi movies than this. I'm telling you after all the other black and white movies you have seen this will probably be your worse.I have seen movies such as: Frankenstein meets the Wolfman, It came from beneath the sea, Creature from the black loogan, and some other movie I dont know what the name of it is but there are these butterflys attacking a city,but Robot Monster is probably the worst of all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Robot Monster","review":"This was a very entertaing movie.Not only is it interesting it is defenitly one of the most fun movies to watch. I give the director all the credit he deserves. This just proves that anyone with a good imagination can make a movie work. There is no room for laughter in this movie. It is to be taken seriously. What would you do if you found out a talking gorilla took out the world and would give you messages that he would hunt you down and end you? Thats right you would be scared out of your mind and would hope it was all just a nightmare. Think about it for a minute."},{"rating":"2","title":"I must, but I cannot. How do you calculate that ?","review":"The last time I saw Phil Tucker's masterpiece, 'Robot Monster', was over 10 years ago. Having seen it 17 times at the cinema, I was delighted to discover that on video it is just as excruciatingly bad as ever. What a hysterical, crazy film this is ! Surely the most obese monster ever, and it must have been hot in that gorilla suit. Rib-tickling dialogue, and memorable performances from Claudia Barrett, and George Nader, who used to be intimate with Rock Hudson, apparently. What I did not like were the comments inserted by the Rhino distributors during the film. The film is funny enough without additions. This video will command a proud place in my library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Little Johnny was adorable.","review":"As the wife of the now grown up \\"Johnny\\" and the mother of his children, I consider it an honor to be associated with such a talented young actor.

But I guess anything goes when you are a little boy dreaming."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty bad, but...","review":"Okay, you know going in that this will be a bad movie. But if you are young and are just starting to have an interest in film then maybe you can use this to your advantage. You may be able to learn what not to do to make a film. Try to figure just WHY this film is bad instead of taking it for granted. After watching you should look into the history of how this film came to be. It's actually an interesting story. Case in point: If you are making a movie about a \\"Robot Monster\\" but don't have the budget for a \\"Robot\\" costume, you should probably realize that you should not even start production instead of using your friend's gorilla suit that he happens to have. Oh, and please note in the opening credits that Elmer Bernstein, who later went on to win an Oscar, wrote the music."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true cult classic!!!","review":"This DVD is by far the best version of this cult classic on home video!!!

The plot is preposterous, and the acting is, by far, the worst I have ever seen in a commercial film. Supposedly it was produced for less than $16,000 but not a single penny seems to have made it on the screen. Even the hybrid gorilla with a diving helmet, was done because the costume shop had lost the head to the gorilla. The amazing part is that the music was composed by Academy-award winner Elmer Bernstein, who was the next-door neighbor to the producer-director Phil Tucker. Beyond belief."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too awful to endure!","review":"I received this DVD for Christmas in the two-pack with Plan 9. I could not get through this one-hour mess, even in the company of 2 good friends with great senses of humor. The \\"message\\" of the movie was completely lost on us. The basic message of Plan 9 actually made sense, and could have been salvaged with better writing and acting, and the movie as it stands is still ENTERTAINING---you can watch it with any mix of sympathy and mockery. Robot Monster is merely boring. Still, if you're a hard-core fan (and ONLY a hard-core fan) of truly awful cinema, then by all means, don't let this one pass you by!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A lot of people don't see the point of this movie -- I say, see the entire film and you will understand it","review":"If you see the entire film you will get it and you will not complain about the disjointed, surreal elements.

It was never meant to be high art in cinema but I am afraid many viewers never understood what the screenwriter was trying to do because they missed the ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"There Is No Escape Hu-Mans!","review":"Classic example of a movie that's soooo bad it's good. I dare say, as much as I howled at \\"Plan Nine From Outer Space\\", this was even funnier! Between the cliched family cast, the oh so state-of-the art special effects (like when the orbiting platform gets blown up, the hand moving it thankfully was unharmed, and of course, that infernal bubble machine), the Ro-Man's dialogue has got to be the most hilariously classic textbook example you'll ever find of \\"I will destroy all of you and rule the world\\" silliness. The late great Elmer Bernstein provided an appropriately hokey sci-fi musical score just adding to its hilariousness. And of course, the completely arbitrary and bizarre cutting in of fighting dinosaur footage, WHAT WAS UP WITH THAT??Great fun if you need some popcorn and a good laugh!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Watch it in 3-D","review":"What can I say about this movie that hasn't already been said. I am lucky enough to have it in 3-d, which just adds to the delight of this movie. It's really a wonderful movie and if you look at the back of the gorilla suit you can see the zipper, now what does that tell you?? That it's one of the best. I love campy films especially campy horror films. But I did take one star off because it's way too easy to fall asleep during it. This is definately a movie you should watch with the lights off and a bowl of popcorn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Screwball Comedy Wodehouse Style","review":"Just today I was making a list of the best-written bits in Wodehouse, and Damsel in Distress topped the list. Gracie Allen of Burns and Allen fame starred in an old black-and-white film based from this book and cast in the Billy Wilder screwball comedy vein. Arguably this book may not top the PGW cannon--nearly everyone would have a Jeeves, Mulliner or Drones book at the pinnacle of great reading--but it does contain some of the most delightful passages in Wodehouse.The movie falls far short of the book simply because it was made when \\"All Singing, All Dancing\\"--(and no plot) was considered a good review for a movie. Any number of PGW novels critique and lampoon his experiences in Hollywood, but seeing the film first and then reading the book, one might be pleasantly surprised. For me, this novel holds up as one of the best non-Jeeves stories, others being French Leave and The Girl On the Boat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charming and entertaining!!","review":"Wodehouse is one of my favorite writers whenever I want to laugh with very witty conversations and funny situations. I like the most the way he portrays the characters and overall I know that at the end I will have a very satisfying conclusion.

It is a treat!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality Ebook","review":"The pagination is awful. Paragraphs are routinely divided into two.

I alway regretted never seeing John Cullum do the show.( I saw it in summer stock.) It may be a bit hokey by some standards,but I find it quite appealing.

I especially enjoy regency era time travel romance from present to past. Although I did enjoy this book immensly, I must warn anyone thinking of buying it. The story was a little hard to keep straight and the ending seemed to be hurridley wrapped up. Also (SPOILER ALTER)the main character seemed all too eager to give up her love without a fight because she loved him. It barely even touched on how that may have been a difficult desicion for her! Despite those fact, the rest was an enjoyable read, but it definetly could have used a few more love scenes!!!

Upon looking through the O'Reilly book and the Forta 5.0 at the bookstore, however, I found the O'Reilly to be superior for an experienced CF programmer. First of all the Forta is too big. Picking it up and sifting through it is cumbersome. Also, Forta removed the extended appendix explanations of each tag and function (present in the 4.0 version). The O'Reilly book has the detailed appendix, which is essential for reference. The O'Reilly is strictly about programming and much of the super basic stuff is skipped. Overall, the explanations and writing style are very good. There are some good tips on advanced topics, too. If you have some CF experience, I would get this book. Otherwise go with the Forta.

Whilst \\"Beethoven\\" is experimental yet catchy, \\"I've Got A Lover ...\\" tuneful and pleasant enough, it's with the buoyant \\"Do You Want To Break Up?\\" that the album really gathers momentum. The next 3 songs are true classics, each mirroring a different side of Eurythmics at their most creative. The deceptively breezy \\"Chill\\" is a strange mix of cynicism and hope, sadness and elation, \\"Shame\\" is perfect 60s nostalgia at its most deliciously tuneful, while the eerie \\"Savage\\" creates a beautifully bleak landscape of alienation and despair - Love Is A Stranger devoid of all romanticism. I find the rest of the tracks less inspired, with the exception of \\"Brand New Day.\\" But with three absolute masterpieces and seven great songs in all, this album stands proud amongst Eurythmics' great oeuvre."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite Eurythmics release!","review":"Described as the album that saw Annie and Dave take a sharp left in their sound, their sixth album entitled \\"Savage\\" is a major departure from previous outings. Coming off from a grueling tour of their \\"Revenge\\" album from a year before, it became apparent that the two were becoming increasingly distant and for the first time in their career, wrote and composed the tracks to this album separately. As the booklet to the remastered edition says, \\"Savage\\" has a dark, and unmainstream tone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very experimental","review":"This cd is some Eurythmics fans favorite cd.

This cd is more experimental but is very upbeat and very dancy."},{"rating":"2","title":"As Good Today as the Day it was Released","review":"I was blown away by this album when I first bought it back in 1987. I felt it was an artist pushing the limits of what they do best, being experimental and arty, without sacrificing good music. After listening to it now, over twenty years later, it retains all of the brilliance it had on the day of its release and shows that true musical greatness is timeless. This album goes from moody electronics (Beethoven, Heaven, Shame) to in your face tongue-in-cheek rock (I Need A Man, Do You Want to Break Up, Wide Eyed Girl), to joyously beautiful sparse and acoustic tracks (I Need You, Brand New Day.) This CD is a truly vital addition to any music lovers collection. Don't hesitate...buy it now and give it repeated listens. The remastering on this re-released edition is superb and it adds five tracks not available on the original release, including an interesting version of the Beatles' \\"Come Together\\". Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible.","review":"\\"Savage\\" was the album that put me off Eurythmics for a long time until a friend convinced me that \\"We Too Are One\\" wasn't nearly as bad. Yes, they're back to their electronica but it's nowhere near as interesting as it used to be. \\"She was a wide eyed girl in a purple dress, she coulda been good, she coulda been the best\\"? \\"I've got a lover back in Japan, he's got tattoos, he's my Superman\\"? It sounds like Annie lowered her IQ points by about 90 to come up with the lyrics to some of this drivel. The production is boring, too. The three better songs on here are \\"You Have Placed a Chill in My Heart\\" which has a good electronic backbeat coupled with some nice vocalese, \\"Savage\\", the definitive Annie \\"ice queen\\" performance, and the capper \\"Brand New Day\\" which, at the end of it all, proves that Annie can send shivers down your spine just singing A CAPELLA.

If your grind is even slightly too coarse, you get a watery shot; too fine a grind and the machine won't even produce a shot! Nothing happens! The machine just backs up. I've ground the coffee myself and tried multiple grinds from multiple coffee shops/vendors. Let me put it this way: When this machine works well I'm absolutely stunned!

I beleive the pump is weak and has broken. Repairs are not easy to figure out, either.

For $400 this machine is a bargain. It heats up quickly and produces very nicely foamed milk qucikly and QUIETLY! The high pressure pump easily pushes though tamped fine grind and produces a very nice crema.

Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for One to Two","review":"I bought this machine in 1998 (when it cost $550) and it's been problem free with regular descaling and cleaning ever since. The only limitation is that it can't keep up with demand if you have guests (by the time the third and later cups are done the first two will be too cold). For one or two it's great. I still use this in my country place but in the city use a superautomatic Jura-Capresso S9 that can crank out one hot espresso after another. For one or two, though, don't let you stop that. You can serve guests beyond two regular coffee instead anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like it!","review":"I was very disappointed when the first machine that I received was dead on arrival... Not Amazon's fault however, I wondered if anybody at Gaggia did basic quality control? Apparently, not and this one slipped by.Nevertheless, Amazon quickly responded by sending me a new machine and, so far, I really like it.

I started with a DeLonghiEC155 entry level espresso machine, with poor results. Then I bought the Gaggia Classic. All the shotswere sour. I tried everything recommended by several people on the Gaggia forum. Temperature surfing,better beans, roasting my own beans, adjusting the boiler pressure, darker roasts. Since I couldn't drink the espresso, I did start making cappuccinos, which this machine can do.Putting lots of sugar in the drink offsets the sour coffee taste. Not what I wanted, so I returned the machine. (Kudos to Amazon for their liberal return policy!) Wondering what to buy next to get that heavenly shot of espresso in the morning?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Arrived inoperable","review":"Unit arrived and pump didn't operate. Unit was packed in an outer box barely larger than the unit's box, with a few of those air things thrown in so it's no surprise that the unit didn't work. And then Amazon forced me to pay $6 postage to return the separate tamper which I purchased but now no longer need since I'm returning the espresso machine. Thanks, that's what I get for spending typically $2,000 a year as a faithful Amazon customer. Suggest that people not order delicate Italian machinery mail order from Amazon but rather why not try that bed and bath retailer so that at least you can return a defective unit to their local store."},{"rating":"1","title":"I bought this piece of junk for a Christmas present","review":"My Pavoni was acting up, electrical problems.

We plugged it in and nothing happened. Typical Italian engineering and instructions.

I am not hopeful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Needs espresso cups","review":"I replaced my no longer pumping Breville espresso machine with the Gaggia Classic. I also purchased a box of K cups since my wife wanted them. The coffee it makes is fine but my coffee cups don't fit under the spout and my attempts to purchase espresso cups have failed (five stores I visited selling espresso machines and regular coffee cups don't carry espresso cups). I haven't yet tried eBay. I have a small pitcher I can tip under the spout and then pour the espresso into my coffee cups. Also the K cups don't fit into the K cup strainer and there is a notice in the manual about being careful to not let paper from the cups extend over the lip of the strainer. My K cups are aluminum and plastic and I have to cut out the lid to pour the coffee into the cup strainer and then there is too much to close the cup holder and I have to scoop some coffee out. Maybe not all K cups are the same. Some better documentation might help."},{"rating":"1","title":"total disappointment","review":"I am so disappointed in my Gaggia. For a few months it worked fantastically (after I threw away the stupid frother that made \\"dish suds\\"). Now it is leaking water from the pump and is getting super hot-- the water is boiling. So it looks like the thermostat is broken as well. This sucks. I never had problems like this with my Saecco which worked forever. Even though there is a warranty, which I will take advantage of, it will be a lot of work to ship it off to the other coast and I won't have the machine for a while.

Unfortunately, the high points of this book(the discussion of her dresses and the three sex scenes), did not make up for the lack of continuity in character development and plot. It seemed as though Palmer contradicted herself on nearly every other page which made the book both confusing and annoying to read.

That means not only having the right elements, but it is they way they function together and interact with one another. This is the case on this album and a couple of others and sets it up above many others of the day. Reed is no doubt a skilled song smith Perfect Day a good example yet the studio muscians, production team when they have all things together as you have here makes this perhaps his best studio album.

Obviously its not without its charms, however, and who better than Mr. 'Venus In Furs' himself to chronicle the exploits of the grotesque parade of transvestites, hustlers, hookers, and other unsavory individuals, as vivid in depiction as an F. Scott Fitgerald novel set to music. Thankfully, Reed didn't crank out this same kind of crap endlessly in the seventies, however, instead producing the mordant 'Berlin' awash in a sea of apathy, drugs & divorce, after this one, which I prefer slightly."},{"rating":"2","title":"IT'S SO VICIOUS","review":"Nothing but brilliance her from start to finish, tracks like Beautiful Day, Walk on the Wildside, and Sattelite of Love obviously stand out but the rest is great as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glorious music from 1972","review":"This album, of mellow laid back rock ballads really set the benchmark for this type of music. Without its influence, rock music in the seventies would have been much less adventurous.The album has a delicate, light touch and it always rewards careful listening. If you look at the list of names on the credits, including David Bowie, Mick Ronson and Herbie Flowers, it is no surprise that it reaches such musical heights.Of course, the highlights of this album are \\"Perfect Day\\" and \\"Walk on the Wild Side\\" but \\"Vicious\\" is also worthy of special mention.Lou Reed's mellow voice and the lyrics at once cynical, surreal and witty capture the attention first on this album but when you look further, there is just so much good music here. For example, the bass line on \\"Walk on the Wild Side\\" is wonderful and it really holds the whole song together.If your music collection includes just one CD from the seventies, it should be this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"smooth transaction","review":"Everything went great.

Some people have said that he was just the recicle of The Velvet Undergound, but they just don't know how the hecks he got on stage every night to play in front of a bunch of old fashioned rock & roll soldiers, whom by the way have you ever seen my diploma of the rock & roll Hall of Fame?... well back in my review He's a \\"goodfella\\", I met him back in 68 in Warhol's studio, you know the one with the used toilet paper in the walls It was the good old days anyway... so enjoy this psicodelic bestiality album.

This album has the classic 'Walk On the Wild Side,\\" \\"Perfect Day,\\" (which, if you're in your late teens or early twenties like me you'll best remember from the Trainspotting soundtrack), and \\"Satellite of Love.\\" Plus, it has loads of other awesome songs... this is one of those albums where every single song complements the others and IS GOOD. And, man, it's so cheap..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Transition","review":"Although he had already released a self-titled solo album, I believe Transformer marks the transition for Lou Reed from a member of the Velvet Underground to a solo artist. There's some great material on this album, including Vicious, Walk on the Wild Side, and Satellite of Love, along with some less engaging numbers (hence I gave it 4 stars versus 5). The production and backing by David Bowie and Mick Ronson add greatly to the quality and richness of the recording. The remastering seems to bring this out even more. And although this is a 30th anniversary release, the music has held up very well and doesn't sound dated at all; in fact, Transformer continues to be a highly influential album that is frequently called upon by contemporary musical scores."},{"rating":"2","title":"Audio Bliss","review":"The newly remastered version of Reed's \\"Transformer\\" is one of the few recordings boasting said term and actually mean it. The sound is now a lot cleaner, bursting with a fullness that it hinted at with it's original release, but never fully realized. This definitly marks Reed's depature from being the soft spoken frontman for The Velvet Underground and his acension into the flamboyant, abriasive and unpredictable Rock n Roll Animal persona which he kept until the early 1980s. A Very experimental album, not in terms of structure or sound, but rather of feeling, identity and content. Though some of it may seem cliche by modern standards, this truly is in my opinion THE album of the 1970s generation. Pure brilliance"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable after five months","review":"Lots of reviews for the CD, and I read about twenty of them. It seems one either likes \\"Peace\\" or is very disappointed. I've listened to the CD for around five months: I still find it one of their most enjoyable albums. Much of it is reflective, catchy, and melodious pop. Favorites have to be \\"17 Again\\", \\"I've Tried Everything\\" (the refrain \\"Oooo, you're a loser now\\" has a haunting, yet hummable pop quality to it), and the soulful/gospel tinged \\"Lifted\\". There are no flops here, but fans might be disappointed that there are no striking singles or quirky/stark/electronic twists to the music. Nonetheless, the music demonstrates how mature both members have become in their themes and arrangements. One hopes that their next album, and there will be a next album per Stewart, could be more adventuresome ala their earlier works, but \\"Peace\\" is still a wonderful addition to any Eurythmics fan's collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never bought a Eurythmics CD until this...","review":"Wonderful stuff. I too first heard \\"Saved the World Today\\" on the Sopranos and was impressed (also \\"I've tried everything\\" is on the soundtrack).Peace was my first Eurythmics purchase.

Peace is so untypical of their past work. gilbertefarah@hotmail.com"},{"rating":"2","title":"An overly mellow, but very welcome return","review":"Dave Stewart manages to throw a bit more edge into it, but this album is a bit too reminiscent of Annie's rather mellow solo albums which, though enjoyable, are not nearly as powerful as her work with Dave. The only song on here which rocks even slightly is \\"Power to the Meek\\" and it fails to even come within shouting distance of \\"Would I Lie to You\\" or \\"Missionary Man\\". There are a greater number of listenable songs on this album, however, than there are on many of the Eurythmics prior albums, wherein many of the songs are too experimental to be accessible to many listeners. The only song that I find it hard to listen to here is \\"Keep on lifted\\", but that could just be my grammarian streak. :) Overall, it's a relaxing sort of album to listen to and sing along to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mellow yet still strong reunion","review":"Right after seeing their 'I Saved The World Today' video, I immediately got myself a copy. The opening track 'Seventeen Again' mirrors their distinct reteaming. However their edgy performance for this CD, Eurythmics' power and audio capture became erstwhile mellow. Annie Lennox's voice is more subtle but still piercing. Her textured hit for the highnotes, coupled with Stewart's juxtaposed instrument blending, is apparently absent. Their melodies still stark, tempo still swingy and moody, lyrics remained cheeky and heartfelt bleedy. Peace is simply a concoction lacking a few fey ingredients and has now gotten into the median than our expected sanguine consistency of the musical bonding they once had in the 80s. However most of the tracks are hardly minor earcandies, and Annie Lennox and Dave Stewarts return, though a segue to the devitalized, is a successful return. This CD is still worth the wait."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poetic Lyrics, Strong Melodies Make for Fully Rounded Album","review":"The Eurythmics--a band composed of Annie Lennox (vocals) and Dave Stewart (guitar)--strike back with a vengance with their newest album, \\"Peace.\\" The soaring vocals and poetic lyrics shine on this CD (\\"Peel back my skin/So that you can see/What I really am/The true color of me\\" are not lyrics atypical of \\"regular\\" pop groups, shall I say), as does some of the instrumentation. However, while this CD is a fully rounded, consistent work, I found the instrumentation and themes to be a little repetitive. If the Eurythmics' songs had showed a wider range of basic emotions (e.g. merriness, anger, dispair, etc.), I think this work would be less dispensable. All in all, I feel that this is definitely a strong work, especially by Eurythmics standards."},{"rating":"2","title":"One comeback worth the hype","review":"I don't know what people expected with the CD, but probably nobody expected it to quite sound like THIS. Some people may complain that this CD sounds too \\"mainstream\\" and \\"slow\\", and there are times when they would be right. However, there are also moments of musical bliss that blow most top 40 acts out of the water. At the very least, Peace proves that, at least in some cases, some things improve with age. Those longing for Annie Lennox's rich voice and Dave Stewart's musical tinkerings won't be let down. Maybe it's not the best CD they've ever done, but it awfully darn close."},{"rating":"2","title":"An offer I couldn't refuse...","review":"I heard, \\"Saved The World Today\\" on a recent episode of, The Sopranos.

I've always associated their music in a Non-ballad sort of way. I liked it, but didn't hear it this way. This is a nice way for the Eurythmics to reappear on the scene.

It may have been my mood, or maybe it's the melodramatic lyrics. Anyway, I got over that pretty quickly when I realy listened to the the lovely \\"Saved The World Today\\", or the rocker \\"I Want It All\\". Then I noticed other standout tracks like the spare and beautiful \\"My True Love\\" which showcases Annie's vocals best on the album, and \\"Power To The Meek\\" reminded me a little of the duo around their \\"Missionary Man\\" days. And if the slower tracks leave you a little downtrodden, they do at least leave you on thier last cut with the subltle and pretty \\"Lifted\\" - a song about just hanging in there.So, no, this is not my favorite album from Dave & Annie (I have all of them), but it is a satisfying update to some of their classic work, so I gave it four stars.

The album has no style, and although Annie's voice is sweet as always, the music is rather pathetic.

If you look for something new from UK check out DIDO."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not the Eurythmics that I know.","review":"I love the Eurythmics but this CD could be a totally different band. It does not have any good hard driving dance type rhythms. I am sadly disappointed in this CD and if you think it will sound like their former albums you will be too. Contrary to one reviewer the former albums sounded great when Dave joined in which he does not in this album. Buy an older CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty darn nifty.. :o)","review":"Flipping through the endless channels on television a few weeks ago I heard the song \\"17 Again\\" being performed live on VH1. I was not an Eurythmics fan and didn't own any of their other CD's. I was a casual fan of Annie Lennox's work like \\"Walking on Broken Glass\\" and \\"Why?\\", whenever those come on the radio you know you're groovin ! Anyway, because I don't have any of their other work to compare this too... its Great ! All new albums shouldn't be compared to past releases all artists grow and mature (if we are lucky). I really enjoy Annie's voice and the lyrics are profound in their own way. \\"Power to the Meek\\" is my favorite song. A few of the songs have the same kind of poppy funky beat. I enjoy this CD even the slower songs are great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sublime","review":"One listen to the trak ''Peace Is Just a Word''. the melody, the harmonies, the climax....everything alone makes this album worth buying. It does contain other real stomping tunes such as ''I Want It All' and ''Power to the Meek'' are crackers in the same vein that Dave & Annie have been known and loved for for so many years. A true welcome return to form (not that they ever lost it) and comes to match if not surpass the likes of Be Yourself Tonight and We Too Are One"},{"rating":"2","title":"Here comes the Team Again","review":"The dynamic duo better known as the Eurythmics are back with there first new studio album in ten years. Peace as the cd and tour is called does not disappoint. This cd will not appeal to the Brity Spears, Backstreet boys, and latino acts flooding the airwaves. This cd however should not be overlooked in a landscape that supports such one-off acts. Here today gone tomorrow. The hightlights here are the autobiographical 17 again, the here comes the rain agian sounding \\"I saved the World today\\" and the rocking good \\"Power to the Meek\\". Their is not a weak track in the bunch. The Eurythmics stay ahead of the game by what made them popular in the first place. Annie Lennox's soulful voice and Dave Stewart's polished production. This cd will keep you hoping for more music in the future from the British duo. Hopefully the duo can keep the \\"Peace\\" and not wait another ten years to record a new cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where did the music tuneship go?","review":"A talented duo still but the direction of their public's taste is not met here...ok, artists can do what they want, but we like to sing along with you, not here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be 'Piece' as in 'This Record is a Piece of ....'","review":"I'm simply stunned. The excellent songwriting - gone. The supreme tunesmithing - gone. Annie's vocal power - missing. This records is a tremendous disapointment. After such a long silence, it feels like they put this together in about a day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad Attempt At Brining Back Past Glories","review":"This album never really was expected to be good, at best the Eurythmics were always a bit of a novelty act. Nothings changed it seems."},{"rating":"1","title":"STUNNED, SHOCKED, AND UPSET! THIS IS TERRIBLE!","review":"Oh, how I was waiting for this CD to come out....I have been a Eurythmics fan since the beginning \\"Sweet Dreams\\". \\"Peace\\" is a boring, dragged out CD. Obviously their worst yet. Everysong just runs like a slowwwwwwwwww boring song on Muzak. The only song that brings anything to the forefront is \\"Power of the Meek\\", otherwise this CD is just a pitiful shame....Annie Lennox stay on your own, you were doing fabulous.....A total disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed...","review":"This reissue could have been so much more. Firstly, the versions of several of these songs are markedly different from the original album, especially \\"I've Tried Everything.\\" If they wanted to remix these songs, they should have just used them as bonus tracks! And the original album artwork is not here (the back shot of David Stewart is missing), as are the lyrics. And finally...these bonus tracks suck!!! They should have definately included the dance mix of 17 Again, which, here in the U.S., was the only hit version of that song!!! What a drag."},{"rating":"1","title":"Peace not so good.","review":"Compared to Annie's solo efforts, which were excellent, this CD is not great. Now we know why only half the songs on any given Eurythmics album were good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn, zzzzzz.","review":"My suspicion is that Dave's bringing Annie down. This album drones on, nothing spectacular or entertaining about this disk. Save your $$$$ or go get Medusa by Annie Lennox--which is a fabulous cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing: Soul, feeling, intensity, originality","review":"I have long been a fan of the Eurythmics and Annie solo. I have overlooked and forgiven them their less than spectacular cuts on some of their later albums such as Missionary Man and other uninspired efforts. I loved their first three albums-Annies' blue-eyed soul and fantastic vocal range were always high-lighted. How anyone can compare this pablum to their past successes amazes me. Be thrilled with mediocrity and that's what you'll get. I expect much more from Dave and Annie. Sadly, a missed opportunity for them to do something great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy something else!","review":"How could they allow themselves to be heard doing such boring stuff? I bought it (elsewhere, hence my bad karma) because of their track record, and I feel very let down. I should have listened to samples on Amazon first!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Peace At Last","review":"I queued for this album to be released, and it's even better than I expected. 'Peace' sums it up - it is an emotional album, but not full of conflict or eroticism like earlier work - the overriding feeling is of deep, calm emotion - perhaps of two soulmates, back together despite everything. If you know that feeling, buy it for the first track alone - 'Seventeen again' says it all. (It may refer to the past, but it's also firmly in the present.) There may be a couple of tracks which don't seem a good fit in the album, but there's more than enough to enjoy. Dave's guitar still sounds good, and Annie's voice has, if anything, improved over the missing years. See you in Manchester, Annie and Dave - we'll be right at the front, singing along!"},{"rating":"2","title":"beautifully conceived peice of work","review":"well, i just saw EURYTHMICS live in Sysney, Australia.and it was the BEST ever concert i've been too. PEACE is, as u all know by now, not filled with a lot of techno-driven pop tunes. instead, it's a warm, tender, angry, ironic look at life and is presented in a more subdued musical coating. annie's still a drama queen, and i love it. buy it NOW"},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you guys kidding me?","review":"The cost of this replacement filter with shipping and handling included is almost as much as the wet/dry vac originally cost!"},{"rating":"2","title":"10 years and counting","review":"The filter once replaced gave a new lease on life to my little Dust Buster.

I have not come across anything like it. For those who are just starting to study the paths, please do not read this book. Every other resource I have come across for Qabalah has had the same attributions for the most part. This book is COMPLETELY different from every other thing I have seen. I would recommend Madonna Compton's \\"Archetypes on the Tree of Life\\" if you are looking for a good pathworking book - though it is a little hard to find."},{"rating":"1","title":"Qabalah, Tarot & the Western Mystery","review":"What a disappointment! The author provides lots of information in terms of lists and names but does very little to explain their purpose or relationships. The information he provides is found most anywhere.

If you are a fan of Superman stories these should be added to your collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry collection of stories","review":"Most of the stories in this book offers little or no insight into the character of Superman. In fact very few of the authors display more than a limited knowledge of the history of the Man of Steel. With the exception of \\"The Warrior of the final dawn\\" & \\"mine enemy grows colder\\", none of the stories here offer anything meaningful. Whats equally puzzling is the absence of several notoroius Superman villains such as Brainiac, Parasite, Bizarro, Intergang etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Super performance, defective CD.","review":"The actual performance is outstanding, and sonically the recording is excellent. BUT, track 4 and part of track 5 have a defective SACD layer that renders the CD useless in SACD playback.

His character Geoffrey is a badly cast 1-d persona who, given his fondness for, must be based on himself yet portrays aboslutely no discernable traits from the piece of tissue I've been wiping my nose with all morning (home sick hence must read what's available)The only worse read I've ever been subject to was Cecelia Ahearn's Whatever it was called.

However, every song on this CD delivers..This is what REAL music sounds like, this CD is for anyone who enjoys pure, from the heart music."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is what it says.","review":"This CD is named perfectley. After a long night of partying & jamming you can sit back & chill on the tunes so you can do it all over agian . I have read alot of negative stuff about this album but I personaly love it ,I feel that variety is the spice of life .Dont get me wrong I love the hard stuff too . I find it mind blowing the way Zakk shifts gears , very few pepole can do this . I feel he is a true musician heart & soul . Many pepole compare this to book of shadows the music is very diffrent . This is not book of shadows but same caliber of greatness ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Give me a freaking break","review":"Some of these reviews are asinine. It would have been better if it wasn't titled BLS? Either way it is still freakin Zakk. How much more of the heavy BLS stuff do you want? It started to become repetitive with not a lot of new creativity. I have to give Zakk a sh*& load of credit going back to the acoustic stuff because I think thats where he really shines and I hate it when fans try to pigeon hole an artist. Like \\"your not allowed to do any other type of music because your last five albums were the same style\\". This cd really shows Zakk's talent,I kind of like BoS a little better because it has a bit of that southern sound but I'm heavily digging Hangover Music, sort of has a bit of a 70's feel to it. The only reason why I'm giving this four stars and not five is because I still think that Zakk has not created his five star CD yet. This guy just has so much talent which he hasn't unleashed as of yet. One of these days he's gonna nail it all on one CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT IS THIS S**T???","review":"I THOUGHT ZAKK WAS DONE WITH THE WHOLE PRIDE AND GLORY THING.

HE IS NOT VERY GOOD AT IT."},{"rating":"1","title":"Limp Bizkit heavier and more talented than ZAKK???","review":"Let me first start off by saying I loved Book of Shadows... why? because even though the songs were slow and soft, they still hit you in the gut, for the song writing was amazing... ever try to play some of the acoustic stuff on that album?? simply mind-blowing stuff..Hangover, or should I say \\"waste of hard earned cash\\", was simple strumming and boring lyrics.. something a first year guitar student would write..What makes this even album worse is that it is BLS!!!!! Proven Metal machine ... this isn't some Zakk side project.. these are the guys that came to my town last year and blew [me] off... it's a shame.. Zakk, you should be embarrased for what you did to all of us... When I saw you had a new album coming out, I couldn't wait... thanks for ruining 2004 with this pathetic display.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Zakk does it again","review":"Zakk returns to acoustic with this his sixth offering under the Black Label banner. And what a wonderful return it is.It is a journey of emotions and sincerity told by guitar, violin, piano, outstanding songwriting and superb lyrics. Zakk's voice and guitar work will send chills down your spine. The highlights being 'Steppin Stone' and 'Fear'.For those expecting hard metal you're not going to get it on this release but then again the album is called 'Hangover Music' so it really is a dead giveaway.A must for any real BLS fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"This should be two and a half stars.","review":"First of all, I am a huge fan of Zakk Wylde. I thoroughly enjoyed his last album \\"The Blessed Hellride,\\" which had a good mix of ballads, heavy down tuned riff music and many examples of Mr. Wylde's technical brilliance. In case you didn't notice, his vocals have suffered since his album \\"1919 Eternal.\\" He's not a trained vocalist, and he doesn't necessarily care for his vocal chords. However, it's probably more due to all his drinking. Alcohol is not good for the liver, the brain, or this album. For those of you who think his voice is improving, just compare his current vocals to his Pride and Glory repertoire. His Zepplin cover really shows his talent and ability. He sounds worse than Ozzy these days. As for his guitar playing, he's never played faster. But, he's starting to recycle his licks. Although he still plays well in a jam session, I have to say, Hey Zakk, please start living up to your own standards!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Breaking the Boundaries","review":"Its been on repeat for the past two days and it is simply stunning.

I have only recently become aware of BLS (from Boneyard Satellite Radio), and this CD is GREAT! 3 Bona Fide metal hits, plus another 4-6 that are just good listening. Remember the title - this is hangover music, so ALL headbanging wouldn't fit this CD. Best BLS CD I have heard to date!"},{"rating":"2","title":"How can anyone not like it?","review":"Seriously people, how can anyone not like it? *gasp* Oh no, it isn't hard metal, BLS is ruined. I mean come on people. I love BLS, but I have to admit, I get kind of sick after listening to all the heavy metal for long periods of time. So what, it's slow acoustic rock, it's good. Honestly listen to the CD before you criticize it just because it's not die-hard metal. I think it's better than Book of Shadows. I personally like Zakk's acoustic stuff more than his metal stuff, it sounds so much cooler. Honestly how can you diss this stuff? It's good that they went and made a nice slow acoustic rock album.Everyone who likes Zakk Wylde, or anyone who hasn't even heard of him should get this album. It's amazing. The acousticness is awesome. You can't go wrong with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"this cd kicks ass","review":"thsi cd is a very good cd. for those of you who say this cd sucks and what not because its soft are obviously not true fans of black label society.

I bought Book of Shadows and Pride and Glory and loved both albums. Zakk's vocals and guitar playing was both thoughtful and impressive. This new album should not even be compared to Book of Shadows, though. The lyrics are unprofound, the solos sound forced, and Zakk's vocals are not impressive. He does not sound like the same vocalist on the \\"Book of Shadows\\" album. He sounds more like Ozzy. Anyways, I feel ripped off for spending 20 bucks on this, so just a warning. Still a BLS fan for life"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the hard rocking album I was expecting!","review":"To each is own.... I guess. I heard some of the other B.L.S. stuff on the radio, and with Ozzfest in a few days, I finally decided to pick up one of his CDs. WOW! What a disappointment. I was ready to f#$cking rock and... NOPE! All the songs on this disc are slow, moody and pretty lame. I'm sure there are die hard fans who love this disc, but if your are a B.L.S. first timer...DO NOT BUY THIS DISC!

Cool songs include \\"Crazy Or High\\", \\"Steppin' Stone\\" and \\"House Of Doom\\". Even these tracks are extremely mellow for BLS. As usual, all tracks include awesome guitar solos and guitar work in general. Pop \\"Just Killing Time\\" or \\"Spoke In The Wheel\\" in the cd player before buying this and you'll be ready for this cd.In closing, this is not a bad cd, just not a BLS one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy Book of Shadows Instead","review":"I had high hopes for this album and was highly disappointed since The Blessed Hellride was so great. There are about 4 good tracks but on the others, Zakk is singing out of range which makes the songs sound ridiculous. Also, most tracks are way over-produced so if you are looking great acoustic work by Zakk, buy Book of Shadows, one of the best albums ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak album from a great band","review":"I don't mind athat the album is soft I just mind that it's not very good. Zakk isn't the best guy to be singing slower songs anyways, great guitarist but a crappy voice. I love other albums from BLS but this one was extremely disappointing. Crazy or High is one of their best songs ever and there's a few other decent ones but overall very boring album."},{"rating":"1","title":"big disappointment, even for Book of Shadows fans","review":"Let me preface this by saying that I've been a Zakk Wylde fan ever since he joined Ozzy Osbourne's band in the late 80's. I loved Pride & Glory and enjoyed his BLS projects, but none really matched my love for Book of Shadows.Having said that, you can imagine I had high expectations for Hangover Music Vl 6. Boy, was I disappointed. The songwriting severely lacks. It sounds as if Zakk really rushed through these songs. Unfortunately, Zakk never had the best voice in the world, but he was always able to back it up with either crushingly heavy guitars or great songwriting. Here, there's some decent guitarwork, but much of the time, it doesn't flow with the song. \\"A Whiter Shade of Pale\\" sounds like it was performed during a drunken hangover, hence the album's title. All I have to say is, Zakk, what happened?!?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful new look at the Easter story","review":"This book is a collection of vignettes about the final week of Jesus.

To carry it in the field I was looking for just a holster style case. I didn't need to carry extra lens and other gear. Maybe a battery and a memory card was all I needed. I wanted the smallest possible belt style carrying case. By the way, the B in Kata Macro KB stands for belt. The fit was tight, but the fabric was flexible. There are two partitions of the flexible fabric to hold the camera tight. I cut the rear piece out to allow a touch more room and left the front partition as the case has a plastic insert that might not be gentle to the lens. The camers stores in a perfect position for a 'quick-draw'. I believe the case can stand some rain.For those looking for the same size but a little more protection, consider the Kata DH-421. It comes with a rain cover and shoulder straps. Both cases are perfect in a minimalist way for an afternoon hike."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ok product","review":"My only complaint is that the heads (which come painted) of the nails used to fasten the edging tend to lose the paint when struck with a hammer.

Reminded me of PLAINSONG with its understated language and the strong sense of character. One of the best novels I've read this year."},{"rating":"2","title":"i love books written by philip yancy","review":"I have read 2 other books by Mr. Yancy. When reading his books I usually read a few pages and then stop and think about his words-- they are both profound and simple at the same time. He speaks clearly to Christians who want to have a strong faith in Christ and at the same time struggle with doubts and questions.I would read anything that he has written , and was very excited when this new book came out. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yancey does it again","review":"Holding nothing back the author (Philip Yancey) writes about our world from a Christian perspective. He shows us that there is more to this world than initially meets the eye, something supernatural. Rumors of Another World is a book that explores these 'rumors', not as proof as if Yancey knows the absolute truth, but as possibilities that there is something more. This was a well written book that goes outside of the 'boundaries' that contain many Christian authors. I have recommended this book to several of my friends and relatives."},{"rating":"2","title":"inspiring book","review":"I am not an avid reader, but I decided to give \\"Rumors of Another World\\" a try after a friend mentioned it. I enjoyed it -it is not the \\"average\\" religious book, as Phillip Yancey discusses things I wouldn't expect to be in a book in the \\"religious section\\" of a bookstore. It was an inspiring book. It made me think more about questions that I wonder and ask myself. He addresses topics that have confused me in the past, but he did a great job of making it understandable while not lecturing. It is hard to describe in just a few sentences, but I would recommend others to read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adventurous Yancey!","review":"I especially like this one; Yancey takes a risk with this one, but it is still vintage Yancey. He explores the wild with Christian intellect. Good volume if you are a Yancey reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought provoking read","review":"The book is pretty good. I recommend it as a refreshing uplift to rejevenate perspective from the scriptures."},{"rating":"2","title":"Other worldly wisdom","review":"A sense of longing -- a hint of meaning -- a glimpse of beauty these are a few of the rumors that there might be something more to life than simply what can be seen and touched. These are part of the bread crumb trail left behind by Almighty God. Yancey nails it again. This is my favorite of all of his many solid books. It is great for those seeking spiritual meaning or for anyone wanting to share a subtle but powerful witness with a seeking friend.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Book that Serves as a Compass","review":"Philip Yancey has written a wonderful, insightful work that utilizes the nature of duality to point the way towards truth. Without providing spoilers, consider a compass needle: it points in 2 directions; North by virtue of its design and South by virtue of the fact that the needle has two ends, the second of which always points in the opposite direction of the first. Mr. Yancey uses some very evocative rationale that strongly suggests that a great deal of that which we perceive in this world hints or points toward another world. I found his use of simile and metaphor both informative and inspiring. Quite obviously the author is an ardent admirer of C.S. Lewis as his works (Lewis's) are frequently quoted. Well written in a very personal tone, I would highly recommend this book to anyone, especially those looking for a different flavor of inspiration and contemplation. A very enjoyable read. 4 stars from me today!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"For $40 I was hoping for thick and luxurious towels. These aren't.

Otherwise the size is good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice big fluffy towels","review":"That leave nice big fluffy lint balls all over you, your floor, your face, your hair, your hands, and your washer/dryer.Other than, really nice towel.

Snazzy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Started unravelling almost immediately","review":"I ordered these bath sheets and started using them. I immediately noticed threads floating around. I thought it was just left over strings. Then I found otherwise. These were the threads that sew the end part of the towel together. So half of that end cover part was already hanging off.They will still make a nice drying towel for when I wash my car."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD BUY","review":"These were a good buy. I checked them over carefully before and after washing the first time and they've been washed many times since. They didn't unravel. I didn't worry about the \\"bad\\" reviews I read because I have a great sewing machine. These towels are soft and were a great bargain I'll be buying more if they go on sale again. The color stayed true after washing also."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much Better than Standard Beach Towels","review":"Based on the old addage \\"you get what you pay for\\" I purchased these as an alternative to beach towels for use around the pool. Previous reviews advised that they were not as thick or as well made as some that cost 5 times as much. I didn't expect they would be. What I found, however, is that they are much thicker, better made and larger than most of the beach towels available--and less expensive. They've held up well so far and I wouldn't hesitate to buy more. These towels get washed once a year; they are used, hung to dry and put back into the pool box to be used again. As such, they've taken this abuse well. Will they unravel a bit when washed consistently? Maybe...but for my use I'm guessing they'll last a number of years. I love them! If you're looking for bath towels that can be washed twice a week, you might want to opt for a higher quality...but be prepared to pay a much higher price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice towels","review":"These towels were exactly as expected -- very large, soft, and not too thick; just right for stepping out of the shower and drying off. A little more thickness would have made these five stars. Still, the price was great, and we use them daily."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great new hit!","review":"I really liked this song by DHT.

The book introduces several different ways to conceive of a space that has n-dimensions; then it constructs a huge and grand circle of proofs that show why all those different definitions are in fact equivalent. Years later, this was my inspiration for writing my own book about the many different ways to think about the nature of Computation. (That book, called \\"Computation: Finite and Infinite Machines\\" is now out of print, but I plan to republish it soon.)Later Witold Hurewicz and I became friends, and I believe that he was involved in inviting me to become a professor of mathematics at MIT.Marvin Minsky, MIT."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful book about Kamehameha's youth... how he came to be!","review":"This oversized book is just a beautiful combination of prose and illustrations. Author Ellie Crowe has focused on King Kamehameha as a youth on the Big Island. She doesn't dwell on the events that often get emphasized, such as the episode that precipitated the \\"Law of the Splintered Paddle,\\" or Kamehameha's meeting with Captain Cook. Instead, she discusses a young Pai'ea hiding from King Alapa'i, the lifting of the Naha Stone, and Kamehameha's interactions with his cousins.Crowe makes Kamehameha human.The illustration by talented artist Don Robinson are outstanding, and complement the text throughout. You will be reminded of artist Herb Kane!This is really an enjoyable book. I only wish it was longer!I realize that we know little about the specific exchanges between Kamehameha and Captain Cook, but this would be an excellent topic for Crowe and Robinson to put their talents together and explore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous","review":"We bought the red one online (not from amazon). It arrived with a cracked front wheel. We thought \\"ok. no problem. We will exchange for the pink one at the store (babies r us).\\" (We have too many pink things for her so we opted for the red one initally. They are both the same btw).We put three things together and noticed one of the plastic screws attached to the main piece was broken off. This product is too cheap apparently.It's a shame too because they look great! The windshield cannot be put in place well enough by design - so it kept falling off every time we attempted to move to the next step in the instructions. I spoke to other mothers who have had this and they complained about the same thing. Sadly, the legs crack and come apart - most assumed it was from wear and tear. But judging from our experience it is a case of poor products. Please don't buy this jeep. It's so easy to break."},{"rating":"1","title":"POORLY MADE PRODUCT!","review":"I purchased this from Babies 'R Us a few days ago. Put it together per the instructions -- problem #1 -- the box was missing the correct legs -- it comes with legs marked A, B, C, and D. It only came with A, B and TWO C's. So, I returned it for another.Problem #2 -- the windshield falls off all the time - it will not attach securely.Problem #3 -- legs will not set in the \\"1\\" height setting correctly.The first time I put my daughter in it -- IT COLLAPSED DOWN -- My daughter is only 16 pounds -- there is no reason for this EXCEPT THAT IT IS A POORLY MADE PRODUCT.

It is unnecessarily complicated to put together. The windshield repeatedly falls apart and the fake \\"tires\\" won't stay in place. It is also difficult to adjust the height. It is very bulky and is difficult to maneuver. My son does fine on linoleum, concrete or wood. BUT he cannot move it over the carpet.I would recommend something less bulky.~Aiden's Momma"},{"rating":"2","title":"TOO CUTE","review":"MY daughter loves her new Jeep!!! It was a sinch to put together, the one and only thing i dont really like about it is that its so hard to adjust the height.

It matches perfectly with my toddler's bedroom Gossamer Wings Character. Is very confortable and is VERY wide making it basically imposible to fall in the stairs. On top of that it has a skid-resistant rubber.The reason that I am giving 4 instead of 5 is because the front part where the windshield goes is too easy to take apart and my toddler is always taking it apart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"As a die-hard FMA fan, I had to start getting the dvds. This started my collection right now. It shows the first four episodes of FMA. I was taken down Memory Lane, just enjoying the first four. The first four episodes are really good, and they tell you who our heroes are and where they came from. You'll definitely be wanting to get the second dvd after watching this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Show - Poor DVD","review":"I love this show and I'm very happy to be able to watch it whenever I want. My only complaint is this DVD. It skipped the beginning on the first episode, repeated endings and the ending credits a few times, and at one point froze despite the fact that there is no fingerprints or scratches on the disk. It made what should have been a very pleasurable experience, frustrating. I paid for this and it should work right. I really hope that this is the what I have to look forward to in the rest of the Fullmetal Alchemist videos."},{"rating":"2","title":"sweet","review":"I first started watching the series at like episode 30 and I was hooked. I went to Best Buy some months later and bought this DVD. The first 2 episodes really just introduce you to Ed and Al. Lot's of humor and an intrigueing storyline kept me watching. The 3rd episode explains wy they are the way they are a lot better. Episode 4 just apears as a side story in my opinion. All in all one of the best series I have ever seen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super!","review":"This is a great series that is about two teenage boys coming to terms with the decisions they have made in life. And now, trying to fix their mistakes while at the same time, helping others out and \\"being for the people\\", as the Alchemists are suppose to be. Now at first I didn't want to watch this because I do not like anime. But my brother kept insisting I try it and so I did. And guess what? I have been hooked ever since. And while it is a confusing concept at first, they do a really good job filling you in without it getting redundant. So I highly recommend this series no matter your age or your gender. It is awesome!"},{"rating":"2","title":"this is what got me into anime","review":"Now I had watched and enjoyed some anime before this (like Vampire Hunter D), but Fullmetal Alchemist is really what got me into anime (and this led into Ghost in the Shell Stand Alone Complex; Case Closed; Lupin the 3rd; Samurai Champloo; and others--thank you Adult Swim). It is an original, intersting premise, with great characters. It's mature enough for adults without being too mature for younger viewers, though I would be careful how young you allow your children to watch it--the subject matter and some scenes can be a bit intense at times. Episode two can throw you off slightly because it begins in the middle of the storyline rather than the beginning, but because of great writing, it doesn't take much to get it all caught up. And episode 3, \\"Mother\\" is one of my favorite episodes. And episode 1 is great. This is phenomenal work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Failed attempt at Humor","review":"I found this to be goofy, slapsticky, and yet not funny. It seemed as if they were either trying to make a satire on action/anime cliche's, or just make a goofy funny Anime but they missed the mark entirley.

Its certainly not something to be taken seriously if you like serious intense action, this ones just goofy all the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Sh*t!!","review":"I have never seen an anime series as unique, complex, and amazing as this one.

The intstructions were not that easy to follow. If you followed the written intstructions the characters will not necessarily look like the ones in the book. Maybe I may be a bit of a perfectionist, but I would think if I am making the Flintsones they should look exactly like the Flintstones. I did manage to make the Flintstones cake and it took quite a bit of time to create each character. After spending so much time making Fred, Barney, Wilma and Betty, I didn't have enough time to make Pebbles, Bam-bam or Dino.

So maybe it's not quite THAT good. However, this grossly underappreciated film (and I say FILM, not \\"movie\\") has a lot to offer. Not only does it capture the zeitgeist of the fun, innocent 70's, but it also strips away the seemingly carefree life of the characters and shows the desperation within. Duane -- I mean, Abdullah is played brilliantly by the wonderfully gruff yet fragile Bill Duke. Ivan Dixon, who died today (and prompted my thinking about and reviewing this film), is equally marvelous as Abdullah's older, wiser alter ego, Lonny. Add in the always-memorable Antonio Fargas, along with Richard Pryor, The Pointer Sisters, George Carlin and Professor Irwin Corey (only in the 70's could such an ensemble be brought together), and you have a silly, fun, and, yes, meaningful slice of 70's nostalgia wrapped around a serious film.

The book was not very intuitive. Most of the examples in the book reference mathmatical expresssions rather than real world examples. This may be helpful for the math wizard crossing over to programming, but it does not help somebody who needs practical advice on database design.As comic book guy from the Simpson's would say....\\"Worst database book ever!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"I like it","review":"I really liked the book, especially the detail with which relationships were described. I have an older version so the programming examples are for DAO. This means you'll get errors if you try the examples in Access 2000 which defaults to ADO. You can add DAO to your components and the examples then work I just ordered a newer version of the book which has updated it's programming section to include ADO."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needlessly complicated, should be titled Access for nerds","review":"They've got to be kidding by glossing over relevant points such as Cartesian products and making the rest of the book needlessly complicated. The author has made real world examples completely cryptic.

But when one wants to get practical experience, problems arises since Access and/or Windows crashes all the time. I have now converted to Linux."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"True to its title, this book has an excellent section on database design, particularly as it pertains to Microsoft Access. However, I found it particularly frustrating when none of the code examples in the book worked with my databases. When I read Balter's \\"Mastering Microsoft Access 2000 Develoment\\", also available at Amazon, I found out why. DAO has been replaced by ADO. This book covers DAO first, and mentions only later. I spent five days trying to get DAO to work and failed. I am so glad I had my other Access book to steer me straight.The great introduction to relational databases is useful, but you could glean the same information from Hernandez's \\"Database Design for Mere Mortals\\" and it would apply to all DBMSes.I hate to give an O'Reilly book a bad review, but this one didn't meet my expectations. It is advertised to apply to Access versions 97-2002, but I don't think it is as up-to-date as some of the other books on the market."},{"rating":"2","title":"When you've got the basics down turn here","review":"An excellent introduction to sound database design theory and how to execute it with Access.

It explains some of the most strange traditions & habits of cultures other than and including our own. This book explains that all cultural traditions evolve from very real and material circumstances. Sacred Cows, Love/Hate of pigs, Military Messiahs, Witch Hunts, it's all here. At some points, however, the book does get self-righteous, especially when Harris just starts attacking the Counter-Culture and the New Age movements.

But still, it's a very informative & entertaining book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Facts cannot be relied upon","review":"The first three chapters were interesting. But the next two on Jesus were a surprise. He stated that the militant Jesus and his band of terrorists attacked a synagogue. Then in the final passover, they attacked Jerusalem but were captured and killed.Since these \\"facts\\" were clearly fabricated to support the conclusion he later wanted to support about how drugs can help one see their inner self, it appears we cannot rely on any other of his \\"facts\\" because they may be just as fabricated and self-serving.The book appears to be nothing other than fantasy fiction, not a book on cultures.

Harris writes in an easy laid back style with plenty of anecdotes, and though the work tries to explain a lot of deeply ingrained cultural practices as well as taboos, it is never simplistic. The general pace of the book however did not quite prepare me for the strongly worded final chapters however, where the author takes a shot at the hippie movement of the late sixties and early seventies.

After just a few days in this charming town, \\"Colli\\" finds herself getting attached to the colorfull people who live here. She finds herself especially drawn to True McKitrick, a local boy who \\"made good\\" and starts wondering what is important to her: a job in D.C. or living a more quite life in this wonderful town with True.I liked thie book, however, I enjoyed Wingate's \\"Tending Roses\\" series better."},{"rating":"1","title":"A recipe for annoyance","review":"This book was one I set down, picked back up, set down... lather, rinse, repeat... more times than I could count. There wasn't anything in particular I can point out that was really bad (except the ending, we'll get there) but, there was also nothing I can point to and say \\"that was good!\\" The main characters are unbelievable and shallow and the plot is a bit on the thin side. I didn't buy it, didn't like it, and was really turned off by the sanctimonious, preachy ending. It was just \\"eh\\" until then, but the last 20 pages put it firmly in the one-star rating.

The book's devoted to Cole's jazz output (mostlytrio work). At the time the Cole's career takes off (@1950)the book tails off, offering virtually no information on thelast 15 years of Cole's studio work. The book's not without value, but certainly not a comprehensive look at Cole's recording career."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good combination of natural atmosphere and history","review":"I wasn't certain what to expect when I got this book. I was a bit concerned that since it was written about experiences in the 1960's that it would feel a bit dated. Although the 1960's view of the future of East Africa's peoples and wildlife is not entirely accurate, I am finding the book to be an excellent way to prepare for a trip to Tanzania--for someone wanting a combination of background on the peoples, landscape and wildlife. Matthiessen's usual subdued, to me, dry style seems leavened a bit by his awe. And the account of the elephant researcher who's 'close encounter' approach puts Matthiessen off his feed, was really enjoyable to me--a departure from his usual, very dry approach. I recommend this one to anyone interested in the peoples and wildlife of Eastern Africa."},{"rating":"2","title":"photos and text are not connected","review":"Great Matthiessen book. The pictures are great, but are too few and have nothing to do with the text. PM shifts between his experiences, the tribes and history lessons. The stories of his expeditions are exciting and even amusing. His discussions on history and culture are fairly interesting. It gives a good look at East Africa."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Opportunity Wasted","review":"What an exercise in frustration! The DVD has a good conceptual framework but the translated idea is very poor and too many shortcuts were taken with the production. There is no tab displayed on the screen or in a booklet for the user to follow so you have to keep going back and forth over the scene to write down what is being said. Each scene moves quickly into the next without any numbering or title to alert you. The DVD menu does not allow you to go to a specific scene so you really have to guess or write down the time of the scene you want. Pity really, because if the DVD were done better, I would have given it 5 stars. Instead it barely gets two stars for the effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Think It Kicks Butt!","review":"This guy knows how to teach!

Major hassle since this is not an option I can turn off with my printer. Don't even get me started on the print quality...smudges, over deposits, uneven and blurry.

It's super cute--I especially love the swamp pieces that you move--they are a snail, snake, turtle, or frog. You roll two number and one sign (plus or minus) dice. You add or subtract the numbers you roll and move forward that many spaces. If you land on a number, you roll the sign dice to see if you move forward or back that number of spaces. If you land on an \\"even\\" or \\"odd\\" space, you roll one dice to see if the number you roll is even on an \\"even\\" space or odd on an \\"odd\\" space.

He also now understands even and odd. We've owned this game for 6 months, and he still loves to play it. My only problem is the durability.

This coffee maker is straight forward and brews great. The fact that it makes 4 cups is even better as I do not have thow out extra coffee. (Coffee aholic here, but 3 cups is good enough).

Worked for six months then began to leak severely during brewing process. It's now useless. Not built to last. My other Capresso coffee pot broke nearly right away. The feature where you can remove the carafe during the brewing process depends on a tiny plastic piece that broke off while removing the carafe rather than preventing drips. I've had experience with two Capresso coffee pots of this type and both didn't last very long. I feel it's because they used flimsy/cheap parts in critical areas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reservoir hard, if not impossible, to clean thoroughly","review":"If this little coffeemaker didn't make decent coffee, I would have given it one star. It does, and had I writtent a review before trying to clean the reservoir, I would have rated it at least a four.Unfortunately, the difficulty of cleaning the water reservoir--and the impossibility of removing the water indicator level from the unit to clean it--are points important to consider if you live in an area where ants periodically invade everything. Even with the use of a cleaning agent, crud remains and is unreachable.Furthermore, the carafe has a metal band around it, making it impossible to rewarm coffee in the carafe in the microwave. The \\"footprint\\" of this coffeemaker is bigger than it needs to be, too.Overall, these seemed sufficient reason to downgrade my rating of this coffeemaker to a two.BOTTOM LINE: There are better options. Check out the Braun in the same size. I give that a solid five."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great machine,great price.","review":"The day after I ordered this for [$$], I saw it in 2 stores for [$$$].It makes great hot coffee. Burner keeps it hot.No counter mess. Much better than my old, messy Mr.Coffee (don't even think about that one). The only thing I did not know was that it takes small cone shaped filters... All for less money than I could have bought the machine alone for at [a local store]."},{"rating":"2","title":"best 4-cup coffeemaker on the market","review":"Although an unfamiliar brand name, the Capresso more than lived up to its stellar rating. Very well designed unit for small family -- I drink a mug, my wife a cup of coffee -- at breakfast. The waterlevel indicator helps you brew less than 4 cups, and the coffee tastes just fine. All in all, great value for your money -- beats the name brands, and we've tried most.The one improvement recommended is the pour spout that overflows when you pour too fast from a full carafe. Otherwise this is a compact, neat and reliable unit in the 6 months we've had it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet Dreams","review":"A great peak in the Eurythmics careers indeed.

This book leaves out huge sections of information that is really important to the exam, including whole sections of information listed on the collegeboard website in the description of the exam. They also expanded at length on completely irrelevant information. There were typos in the practice exam and often the test questions woud ask specific questions about information never covered in the text! It goes into statistics and psychobiology in FAR too much depth. I spent so much time memorizing and learning information that did me no good. This book is a COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY! I am so angry with this book. Buy the sample questions from the College Board website and then read about the subject matter of each question in a developmental textbook. Trust me, that is the way to go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Passed with a 53","review":"This is the only book I read to helping me prepare for the 90 question test. I read the book once, tested once (with a 44% on average) and studied my wrong answers. I retested once with the CD with a 75% average score. My CLEP today was heavily based on child development and theories of development. There are also a few questions on who wrote what so you do need to put names to theories. Some questions are based on theory discussion and not just fact. Dates are not important. There are definitely facts on the test not covered in the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book doesn't help","review":"I took the CLEP test and failed.

I reviewed the book and did two of the three study exams, as well as a $10 prep kit from CollegeBoard.com (the test makers). As with some other people, I questioned whether I was passing the test while taking it, but I did pass with plenty of room to spare (67/80). The materials give you enough information to be able to narrow down the answers substantially. Make sure to study the explanations for ALL of the answers (even the ones you got correct) to the sample tests, as these help you solidify multiple concepts per question (and often provides small keys to differentiating the terms)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Study hard","review":"I studied I passed. This book is a good resource this clep is a tough one however. This was my eighth clep and I don't know if it is the wording or choosing the best answer when two options looked plausible,but I was not confident I passed till I saw the score. I suggest using this book and firm up your knowledge of researchers such as Piaget, Kohlberg, Freud, Pavlov and Erikson then you should have a great chance of passing. I hope this helps."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look elsewhere!!","review":"The three \\"tests\\" that come with the software have questions that are not even covered in the book!

This REA book only covered a third of the information that was on the test I took. I was able to guess my way to a 50 ACE (College \\"C\\" equivalency) score, but that is not good enough for my college which requires a 63. This book was a waste of time. Do not buy this book until they turn out a newer version or make it the last after studying Sociology and Psychology and you will do better. If your college accepts a lower ACE score than mine, you should be okay especially after preparing for the Sociology and Psychology CLEPs. I wish I had read the reviews before taking the exam. That will not happen again."},{"rating":"1","title":"too much unnecessary info","review":"This book was a total waste of time and money. It had far too much detail unnecessary for the test. The information was not presented in a logical, easy to remember manner. A review of the main learning theories from a basic psychology book would probably prove as helpful and less frustrating. I got a 74 on the test, but common sense, logic and a little psychology background were the reasons, not this guide."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not relate to real test","review":"I read and took the practice exams several times.

I took the pretests and passed all of them with 60 or better. Well low and behold I went to take the CLEP exam today and failed. Almost all of the test was on child development and the book vaguely covered this material. DO NOT waste your money on this book, find another alternative if you can. Almost everyone that I have talked to that passed this test has said they did so by just having a psychology course. Of course this was not the case for me. Good luck on this test, it is a tough one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Strange; pictures blurry; rather crudely written","review":"Although this book was supposed to focus on gel candles, there were recipes that used no gel at all! Instead, there were simplistic candles made of regular paraffin wax. You got the distinct feeling that someone messed up in publication and put the recipes in by mistake, or that the author was really trying to stretch the length of the book (which was pretty skimpy) and threw these recipes in. Very strange."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I am just beginning to get into candlemaking as a craft and was very excited to try something new. The book is self-published and it is obvious. Some of the pictures were stretched and are blurry. There are grammar and spelling errors that, being a teacher, were hard for me to overlook. Not all of the recipes were for gel candles, which I think is a little weird given the title of the book. There were a few good ideas, but overall, I don't believe this book was worth the price I paid for it. In fact, Soapmaking for Fun & Profit gave me much better business advice (it applies to all crafts) and I found better instructions for Gel Candles on various web sites for free."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't BUY!

This teaming with James Galway is fantastic. The choice of songs if perfect for the two of them and arrangements by John Dankworth (Dame Cleo's husband) are smooth and lend themselves to Galway's dancing flute. Favorite cuts of mine are \\"Skylark\\", John Denver's composition \\"Like A Sad Song\\", \\"Drifting & Dreaming\\" and the title cut \\"Sometimes When We Touch\\".

It is unfortunate that she has neither the talent nor the voice to go very far. She certainly will never make it in Latino (or Spanish music), kind of funny because she tries to sing in Castellano in a few of her songs. Very few latino artists have succeeded in crossing over from Latino music to Spanish music and those who did succeed were already superstars like Shakira, Thalia, JLo and Ricardo Arjona. Perhaps she should try singing pop music in English where neither talent nor a voice is required, she could make it on her looks alone. Her sound tracks are quite good, if her band found another singer they could probably go far. I will give one star for her band."},{"rating":"1","title":"busted","review":"I bought this for our son and we got some use out of it, but sure enough it broke because you can't get the games out of this thing without forcing them out.

All in all I'd give this product zero stars if I could because after testing out most of my NES games and having them look and sound bad I've decided to return the NEX and try and find a toploading official NES."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy this Piece of Garbage","review":"this thing looked good in the store, and at the price, it sounded like it had to be good (I paid $60) ive seen it for $50 - $80. the video quality is really noticeably different from the Real NES, and the sound is sometimes very distorted, it is also made of really cheap plastic, and the controller it comes with, sucks, and the Game Genie usually doesn't work in it. if u never played a NES before and you bought this, you wouldn't know about all this, so just pay $50 for a used original NES somewhere with a new pin connector."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Good Console if You Just Want to Play Again! (Update: Not So Much!)","review":"I purchased the NEX Videogame Console recently and was not disappointed. All my games played in it, a couple of the older ones I had to clean first but then they played fine. My favorite feature of this console is it allows you to use the controllers from your original NES, including the zapper!Yes I will agree with the reviews that the sound in some places is a little off and the color quality isn't the same. The games also do fit a little snug. However, if you just want to be able to play your old video games that you thought were forever doomed by that awful blinking screen, this console is for you. If you want every aspect of your gameplay (i.e. sound/color) to be there 100% I would suggest finding a new original NES.UPDATE: Since this review the console no longer works. The above review applies to WORKING consoles. I recommend looking for another brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"great if ya could get games out!","review":"This would be great if the games would load and unload more easily!

Too bad as it's otherwise sturdy but the abuse of forcing the game out would ruin something I'm sure!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great live edge","review":"This is an excellent extension of RocknRoll Animal. The raw edge of the live recording is superb with Vicious,Satelitte of Love and Walk on the Wild Side real stand outs for me. My favourite is the treatment of Waiting for the Man.

Instead it is mostly Dr. Kirwin's thoughts about how the legal system treats mentally ill patients unfairly. This is all prpbably true, but it is NOT what the title implies. She just goes on and on about lack of funding and peoples reaction to a not guilty by insanity plea. She talks more about the legal system than about the criminal mind. I wanted a book that talked about why criminals act the way they do. This was not it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fair","review":"Dr. Barbara Kirwin draws on her years of experience as a forensic psychologist to talk about some of the the most eyebrow-raising cases of the past 20 years where the insanity defense was used and abused.She has seen a lot in her line of work and readers will appreciate her insider's view, but too much of this cheap book is a wordy and repetitive diatribe against the criminal justice system. Her memory is keen and I do not question her credentials as a psychologist, but she is neither philosophical nor wise enough to be a social critic. Much of the book is like listening to a child whine about a denied sundae."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heraldo Rivera show in 300 page format","review":"Could be titled \\" The omnipotence of me \\" the biography of Dr. Kirwin. The author tends to embrace that which she condemns in others in that by poking holes in the professional diagnosis of other equally accredited members of the psych. community one must consider the potential falability of her arguement from their professional viewpoint.

The film goes much deeper then snipets of Noam Chomsky's many talks around the world, it also goes into his upbringing and inluences which led him to be the much loved dissident he is today. This film is a must see, whether you are a fan of Noam Chomsky or not."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good way to start...","review":"\\"Manufacturing consent\\" is a very good documentary that introduces the spectator to Noam Chomsky's ideas and political views, thanks to interesting footage of some of his interviews and conferences.I think that this documentary is ideal for those who would like to know more about Chomsky, but don't want to read several of his books in order to do so. All the same, I must highlight the fact that you will probably learn less by watching this dvd than if you decide to devote time to reading his books and articles, and that this dvd only includes footage until 1992. By that, I mean that there is more to Chomsky's ideas than what is shown in this documentary, but that watching it is a very good way to start.All in all, I can say that even though \\"Manufacturing consent\\" is very long, it will make you think and it is a good introduction to Chomsky. Those are the reasons why the time you spend watching \\"Manafucturing consent\\" will not be time lost. Recommended!Belen Alcat"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great American Hero","review":"This wonderful film will expose many to Dr. Chomsky for the first time. This brilliant American scholar and activist has more wisdom and integrity than most of our congress combined. Everything Dr. Chomsky has to say can be substanciated, this should be required viewing for every high school student. Wake up and learn what is being done by this government around the world in your name. Learn how the controlled media works non stop to mis and dis inform the general public and how any debate is usually outside of the parameters that should really be addressed. You can see how much worse it has gotten when you realize this film is 10 years old.....Dont miss it, Long Live Chomsky!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best documentary on Noam Chomsky!","review":"This documentary is the best presentation of Noam Chomsky's ideas that I've seen. Thanks to good editing and clear visual examples of what Chomsky is talking about (the US propaganda machine), it is clear and convincing. It also addresses in depth two of the claims Chomky's critics often attack him with ( that he's a Holocaust denier and that he was Pol Pot supporter) and explains why they are unfounded. And, of course, as he always does, Chomsky mentions the Spanish anarchist movement during the Spanish Civil War as an example of the ideal to which he aspires. The DVD version contains the debate between Chomsky and Michel Foucault (a classic), as well as the debate between William F. Buckley and Chomsky. I love this DVD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth the time and money","review":"This is an excellent, low-budget film, that chronicles the life and thoughts of America's toughest critic, Noam Chomsky.The number and range of reviews displayed here prove that this is a film worth seeing. The film's director does a masterful job of revealing Chomsky - his politics, his vision and the keen, analytic scientist who pioneers discovery.For the past 3 decades Chomsky has turned that keen, scientific mind towards America; it's politics and it's power. This film delves into the control the media exerts, the subtle and not-so-subtle ways its used to control and influence America's political posture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome...if you're up to it.","review":"This film is to \\"Fahrenheit 9/11\\" what a symphony is to a ragtime pianist: infinitely more complex, multilayered, subtle and incisive...but also far less accessible to the average viewer with the typical 15-second attention span.I've never read any of Chomsky's books, only excerpts and reviews and lots of casual mention of him but in this film he comes across as surprisingly good-humored, down to earth and likeable.

Although I had read a book of Chomsky's (Secrets, Lies and Democracy) I never fully understood his views. That is, until I saw this film. I then began asking myself certain questions. Why had I never learned about dissenters (i.e. Chomsky, Zinn) in public high school or read about them in a paper? Or for that matter why was \\"mainstream\\" politics and the media that \\"covered\\" it so exclusionary? That is, why does the media never fully investigate dissenting voices.

The movie essentially attempts to add a serious spin on high school sexuality where a group of friends can't quite figure out if they like girls or boys...or both. I'm not sure I buy the premise but hey what do I know. Yes, there's lots of talk and clothes-on action, but when the rubber meets the road, the cast and filmmakers cop out.

Without the bulwark of tenure, he could have been challenged to have written something less formulaic and outdated.What is more the pity is that he cares about his subject; he is just not used to having to defend his ideas, so he just comes off as a boring, monomoniacal old professor. One without an editor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth seeing more than once for sure.","review":"I am not a Bob Dylan fan but this dvd is so interesting and insightful that you can't help but be a fan after watching it and to then share it with others.

Perhaps.","review":"On Charlie Rose, Scorsese said that he would be willing to continue the documentary if there is more footage, but it is not his decision. I don't recall if he knew how much more footage there was -- clearly he'd want to avoid just rehashing stuff. The late 60s early 70s Dylan could prove more interesting, in many respects, than the early 60s Dylan. Consider how elusive Dylan was during that period and the possibilities of new footage...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bob Dylan - No Direction Home","review":"I'm not sure if the review will put my fathers name or my name as the reviewer, but I'm the son of Mark DiMartino.I have to say that I really enjoyed this dvd. I saw parts of it when it was aired on PBS. This actually got me into Bob Dylan. I started researching his music and I love it.This dvd was made very well. There is a whole lot of information that you can learn about Bob Dylan. I like how there are scenese of him performing various songs throughout too. The bonus full length Bob Dylan performances are great to have.I just have to say that this is for anyone. If you're a hard core fan, just getting into him, or now nothing then you'll enjoy this product. I'm really glad I purchased this and I know you will be too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where's Jack","review":"Overall, this is a great film. A lot of footage never seen before. The biggest criticism of this documentary is the absence of Ramblin' Jack Elliott, who played a huge role in making Dylan who he was in the early days. Elliott was the original Woody Guthrie protege, and Dylan's early persona was probably more a copy of Elliott than Guthrie, who was already too sick to play. Maybe Elliott didn't want to participate in this film? Who knows? He's still alive, unlike Dave van Ronk, who's in it quite a bit. Nevertheless, his absence is a big hole....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tanlgled up in Boredom","review":"It's hard to tell which is more confusing - this terribly unfocused rambling documentary or its insufferable subject. Bob Dylan has always struck me as nothing more than a very coy businessman. With a few exceptions (Tangled up in Blue, Shelter from the Storm), his music is quite feeble in terms of melodic composition, lyrics and actual performance. This documentary, like many of Dylan's sheep fans, confuses pretentiousness with profundity. I gave it two stars for the backround scenery in the old film footage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only Fullscreen????","review":"I can't believe this is only offered in fullscreen and not a widescreen version. I realize they aired this on television, but there must be a fullscreen version coming out. I'm waiting until there is. I have a large screen tv and I want to take full advantage of it. Plus, fullscreen sucks, you lose so much of the picture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ummmm..........huh? Did Dylan die in the late 60s?","review":"I was so disappointed with this documentary. Why does it only go through the late 60s? Dylan has THIRTY more years of his career, which is ENTIRELY ignored in the film. Martin Scorsese made this? What? Oh how the mighty have fallen. To me, the most interesting part of Dylan's career was when he turned his back on all the folk music/hippy nonsense and got real, real weird - but you won't see any of this in this clunker. Avoid."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a snooze!","review":"Bob Dylan thinks putting out of movie of him talking is supposed to be cool? Granted there are some performances but its all in black and white!!! And sometimes there's no band, just him and his boring guitar and harmonica. He doesn't even try to solo. I've seen much better rock performances by the likes of Dokken, Ratt, or Poison (take your pick). At least these newer bands look like they're trying to have fun. Bob Dylan just mopes and poses but never rocks out. Funny thing is people just seem to gobble this suff up. Sometimes there's no accounting for taste :("},{"rating":"2","title":"Astonishing","review":"Ok, so if you've read his book (Chronicles) you probably won't get any new information here. But should that deter you from viewing this film? Absolutely not. The sheer joy of this film lies in seeing and hearing the actual people, performances, critics, etc. in their space and time. So, while you won't get any new information you are bound to get a perspective on Bob in some way that just isn't possible without watching this film. The bonus material of Bob's performances is just icing on the cake. A must have for any Dylan fan and a must watch for any casual listener wanting to gain some perspective on this artist."},{"rating":"2","title":"A \\"Must Have\\" dvd","review":"I have to admit... I have never been a Dylan fan. I have enjoyed some of his songs and loved his lyrics, but he was never my #1 record choice. My husband, on the other hand, has always REALLY liked him. I rented this dvd for my husband.Ten minutes into the dvd, I was hooked. Twenty minutes into the dvd, I got online and orderd one for us, one for my daughter in SF, and one for my 30 year old son. WHAT A TREASURE! I loved seeing the making of Dylan's career...I was intriqued with the passion he had for folk music, and the love and respect he had for all other music. Every note he heard was never wasted! He is an amazing man with a fasinating career. I am a Dylan fan now!TRUST me ... this a dvd WORTH owning!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"New Look On Dlyan.","review":"I loved this movie; Dylan finally opened up and speaks frankly about the early years (Pre motorcycle accident.) Most of my favorite music was mad and recorded during the time period presented in this movie. To me Dylan gave us the impression of an apathy about his wrote, sure they were protest song, but they really didn't protest anything specific. Perhaps that is why his music is timeless. The movie gave me a new view on Dylan, but not necessarily a bad view just different."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dylan reinvented again, this time as human.","review":"Scorsese, an unabashed fan, reveals the real Dylan. His camera lens does not blink and Bob appears as himself. Yes, we all know his is a living icon but his too, too solid flesh is real. Not surprisingly, under the bright lights and microscope of Scorsese's documentation, Bobbie (as Joan Baez calls him)is still way cool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Documentary, but beware...","review":"This documentary was fantastic. I have no qualms with it. Rather, my problem lies with the extra DVD of 'performances.' I thought, when I bought it, that I'd be able to watch entire filmed performances. This is not the case - the 'performances' are simply the same clips from the documentary, not full performances. So, this is false advertising. Beware."},{"rating":"2","title":"BOB DYLAN IS THE MAN!!!!","review":"Only ultimately Bob Dylan reigns as the hero. He's gonna haunt you with the current interveiws; but he's still gonna make you laugh too. Scorsese put together a hell of a film DON'T MISS!Joan Baez, wow. A lot of insight here. Bob Dylan is still the man. A heart felt statement from Joan (and just wait for Dylans counter statement HES SO COOL!)Also the man: AL KOOPER, he's the other hero in this film, that guy rocks! He'll make you laugh too. He's got himself a new solo album out now, did you know that? THE HAWKS also save the day as DYLANS allies by KICKIN' ACE!DO NOT MISS THIS FILM.oh yeah, in case I forgot; MARTIN SCORSESE is the man too. ROCK AND ROLL!"},{"rating":"2","title":"well done","review":"If you're already a Bob Dylan fan, or even just like a few of his early songs, then you will find much to appreciate in this documentary. Even if you just like to watch a well-made documentary once in a while, and couldn't care less about Dylan, I'd recommend that you check this out. I'd seen some other films on Dylan before and thought they were pretty good. This one is the best I've seen so far. I like the coverage it gives to his early influences and I was really impressed by how open and revealing he seemed in many of the interview clips."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bob Dylan the Master Songwriter","review":"Have a collection of some great Dylan live performances. Didn't get to see him often in my life time,but when I did I was truly entertained.When I'm in the mood I can sit and watch my DVDs anytime.I like the fact that I am able to purchase almost anything from Amazon.It arrives quickly and the prices are great.Don't have to go out hunting down something I want and not being able to find it.

I do wish, that it would have continued on with more current years as that's of interest to me as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Dylan DVD","review":"Awesome footage and dialogue. I would recommend this to any Dylan fan.

Bob Dylan's life and work are incredible, and this documentary shows an important time in history, both musically and politically. This doesn't white wash or make Dylan look like something he is not, and that he never was - he is not a God, a Saint or a Hero, rather Dylan was and is a brillant, observant and complicated artist. I highly recommend this DVD;I only wish I'd bought the DVD verison with the book inside...."},{"rating":"2","title":"A bit stiff but the child loves it","review":"First time I ordered this, they said \\"I refused to accept it\\" and never bothered to contact me telling me they shipped it.

It has many good features / accessories such as non clog filter, measuring cup, and spray shield. Out of the box you can tell it is well constructed (better that the improvement store sprayers - such as Roundup and RL Flo-Master sprayers - that I have tried in the past). The hose, brass tip, and the plastic container are all well built (the wand is very small and flimsy). But the main issue is it does not spray well (adjustable cone nozzle). The spray goes from a heavy stream to a wide cone (again heavy), with very little variation in between. I have read the customer reviews for the Chapin Premier 1 Gallon Sprayer (21210) which I am interested in and I came accross exact same customer complaints regarding the spray pattern.Chapin are you reading this ?

Had to go out after Christmas and purchase a new battery which added $8 (plus tax) to the cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ralf is wasted in this bland effort","review":"Next to DC Cooper, Ralf is my favorite singer at the moment. Whereas the first Primal Fear CD was almost Ralf's vengeful I-shoulda-been-chosen-as-the-new-Priest-singer effort, and he made the most of it with a top notch power metal CD on par with any Priest album, this album shows a weary, tiresome, void of creativity band. Yes, it is heavy and fast, but it lacks melody and is just plain boring. I wouldn't be surprised if all of these songs were leftovers from the first CD. With few exceptions, it is a CD of filler songs. Ralf can growl better than anyone, but I miss the days when he incorporated more of his operatic ability. He needs to surround himself with more creative musicians - Come on Ralf, you can do better than this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"very average metal","review":"not particularly technical or inspired metal from the Judas Priest imitator Primal Fear. No heart, soul, or decent lyrics. Certainly no blistering Gamma Rayish guitars or drums. Overall sound quality is good. Slightly better than the first album, but really, neither is worth buying"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning!","review":"This album is stunning! This release might even be better than their stellar self titled debut. No sophomore slump here! Incredible vocals from the vastly underrated Ralf Scheepers, an awesome twin guitar attack from Tom Naumann and Stefan Leibing, and a pounding solid delivery from bassist Mat Sinner and drummer Klaus Sperling make this a must buy for metal fans! Standout tracks include: Final Embrace, Under Your Spell, When The Night Comes, and an EXCELLENT cover of Rainbow's \\"Kill the King\\"! Primal Fear proves that great music is still being made! My favorite 1999 release hands down!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Too critical","review":"THis CD is great and is the epitome of heavy metal especially in this day and age.

This is mainly historical fiction. I read through 370 pages of murder, rape, and cruelty to get barely a page of glossed-over love making! If you want history, read Alison Weir...at least it's real.Having said that, I did like the characters - I wish the author had developed more of their \\"sixth sense\\" of knowing one another in a previous life. And, I wish she had placed them together in the story line more often....Unfortunately, they were only together for 20% of the book - the other 80% was devoted to battle scenes descriptions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"This book is boring and you don't get to feel for the characters. It is predictable and not believable. It was hard to read it until the end. It is going straight to the dustbin. There is no real romance, nor adventure, or any original story. I am sorry I bought this and the second in the series (Rivals for the crown) at the same time for I would definitely not buy the second one after reading the first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved this book! It left me wanting more...","review":"A definite page-turner that I couldn't put down. Not a lot of fluff. A well-developed story-line with well-developed characters. Lots of historical details but not so many that it disrupted the story-line. Caution: there are some rather violent parts but it was authentic to the time period. I would classify this book more as historical fiction than romance. Although I was personally satisfied with the romantic details--others may want more bodice ripping.This is a beautifully-written, painstakingly researched story. I was ready to devour everything else written by this author but found that she only has a few other books... I was sad to discover she passed away suddenly earlier this year.

The price kept me away for a while , but I got over the price and bought the Visor Deluxe. Ice was not my first choice, but I like it now. If you are going to buy one and use it at work and home buy two cradles so you can synch both, it helps. What I like, the alarm feature, fast communication and beaming. The graffiti is not that hard to learn, and its a great way to keep a to do list (I keep multiple for personal and work). The Deluxe has expansion potential, so I opted for this in lieu of the Palm IIIxe, which is a good unit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Handspring reigns supreme","review":"My work was going to pay for a PDA, so had to choose between a HP Jornada, and a Handspring. I got to take the HP thing home with me for a week to try out, and then the Handspring. The Handspring blew the PocketPC away. The PocketPC runs a version of Windows, which is awful - it crashed on me several times for no apparent reason, and had a clumsy interface. It has a lot of 'gee-whiz' features that are useful for trying to impress geek friends (and eat bettery life), but which do not help keep organized. The Palm OS is elegant and easy, and the Visor's battery life is amazing.

Not only does it look good but MP3, backup, flash memory, modem and digital camera modules are just fab and a cellphone module is on the way!Only one complaint - you can't upgrade the operating system which means that unlike a Palm you can't get new OS features like infrared syncing with your PC / laptop. Handspring say it makes it more stable but..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have!","review":"I received my Handspring Visor Deluxe today and it is so easy to use. I have already memorized the Graffiti. Hotsyncing is also really easy and extremely fast! Get it NOW. You won't regret it. It is a great deal. The slim leather case is normally around $25. You can't get much better than that. Some people say the slim leather case makes it look bulky. It is not bulky at all to me. If you want to see bulky, take a look at the oldest laptop there is.

A person who has a relationship with the true, living God Jesus Christ has the Holy Spirit to warn him when confronted with unGodly (satanic) ideas. The author, Raymond Hendrix, is one of those people. If you a are perfectly content with your state of spirituality and the Godliness of your church home, read no further. I believe the true christian always knows there is more of God to be experienced than what he already has, and continues to search in humility. If that is you, then this book is a must read.

But the plot bogs down quickly. After the first part it seems, in fact, to wander into another novel--specifically The Devil's Day by James Blish. But Wilson draws none of his characters with the same care and realism that he did in his excellent Harvest, a novel which I can hardly believe is out of print already.Adding to the disappointment is the tendency, like so many other tedious SF novels, to treat the fate of the universe in such banal terms. I winced when the predicable fallback on the misnamed Uncertainty Principle showed up at the second Interlude. It's like black holes; a handy cliche to explain just about anything..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Half is fantastic, half is mediocre","review":"Robert Charles Wilson is one of my favorite authors so I was a little disappointed with this book. The first half of the book detailing the metamorphasis of Europe is interesting and exciting but the second half where you discover the cause of the change is less interesting. I liked the adventurousness of the first half, but I found the second half to be plodding in some places.Still, Wilson is a great author and this book is better than most of the science fiction being published today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alternate history that becomes something else...","review":"Before I read this book I read a lot of the reviews by other readers, and I learned a lot about the plot of this book that I would have been better off not knowing and discovering on my own within the pages. Read other reviews at your own risk...So with that said, I compare Darwinia a lot to the movie _Fight Club_... no joke. If you have seen _Fight Club_ you know it starts out with a relatively straight forward plot and ends up becoming something entirely different- even epic in scope. This is what Darwinia is all about, giving you an interesting premise and then taking you on a very intriguing ride with an ending you would not have anticipated when you first began the story.Darwinia is not perfect, but it certainly is a breath of fresh air and quite different than probably anything you have read lately. Of course, your mileage may vary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning, wonderful, unexpected","review":"Involving, intricate, with developments that were marvelous and unexpected.

I was truly excited over the prospect of reading it. The book let me down. The content is choked with cliches, very predictable from the mid-point on, and finishes in too big of a hurry.

I guess I'm just disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely disappointing.","review":"I thought \\"Darwinia\\" was just plain awful. From the BookList reviews, cover painting, and jacket description, this novel purports to be something in the \\"Alternate History\\" vein. In fact, it is something completely different. Darwinia is a member of that most-hated sub-genre, the \\"it was all a dream\\" novel.About 1/3 of the way through the book, it is revealed that every character and every event you are ready is just a giant computer simulation. Nothing is \\"real\\", even in the fictional constraints of the novel's setting. Instantly, I ceased to care about what happened to anyone and anything in the story. Why should I? And without giving it away, I'll say that the ending was the worst, a sort of cyberpunk version of the end of \\"2001\\" done poorly.A friend of mine says that I missed \\"the point\\" of this novel. If by \\"point\\" he means strong characters, a tight plot, interesting speculation, and a good story told well, then I definitely did miss \\"the point\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"A lost opportunity for speculative fiction","review":"One could anticipate that a fully satisfying explanation for the replacement of Europe by \\"Darwinia\\" may not eventuate, and it was not for this that I read the novel. Rather, the impetus was the occurrence of such an event within an early twentieth century setting. Unfortunately the scientific, political and other ramifications of this were not adequately explored, and using the context to simply highlight that creationist beliefs are deficient represents a lost opportunity for the novel to be of greater relevance and significance (in terms of speculative fiction). However, it is the novel's progression into shallow violence and horror that are its weakest aspects, with the few passages producing \\"put the book down and ponder\\" moments belittled by juvenile accounts of humans morphing into bug-like aliens."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been a lot better.","review":"I found this book to be very disappointing. The first hundred pages or so were great and really caught my attention despite the pretty skeletal plot and characterization. Once Wilson introduced the whole Noosphere idea, the book fell apart for me. It got super vague, disjointed, and ugly with regard to writing and I really doubt this was meant to parallel the lives of the undeveloped characters in the book. All in all, I can't say I'd ever recommend this book to anyone. It had its good moments, but really fell short of the award winning mentioned on the cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"A slog and not worth the price.","review":"I bought this after reading \\"Spin\\", expecting more. More....what exactly? I don't know. I didn't like the timeframe of the novel. I didn't like the underlying idea. I didn't like the characters....ANY of the characters (except, perhaps, the frontiersman). I don't like bugs. I don't like powerful bug overlords. I don't like fern trees. I don't like the idea of saddling up my oversized grub for a ride. Yechhh.Did I tell you how much I didn't like this book?I didn't like the novel.What I really didn't like was the Kindle price. It was way too expensive compared with excellent self-published sci-fi.I wouldn't recommend this novel to anyone who truly enjoys classic sci-fi."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great premise, Fantastic beginning, disapointing overall","review":"The book jacket description and the beginning of the book hold so much promise. It is unfortunate the author abandons these gems and switches to a much less interesting storyline a third of the way into the book. Maybe if the new story was better it wouldn't have been such an overall disapointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Concepts, Bad Fiction","review":"Let it first be said that Wilson's novel does contain a number of interesting concepts (that is why I gave this book two stars instead of one), especially ones pertaining to evolution, as the title obviously suggests. However, overall this book is a good example of stagnant fiction. The plot goes nowhere until probably page 200 in 360 page book. The author seems to be heavily influenced by the \\"Highlander.\\" Moreover, the prose of this book is simply awkward, not to mention a number of anachronisms (the novel is primarily set in the 1910-1920s).It is more like a second rate Western than a science-fiction novel. In fact, the \\"science-fiction\\" part can be summarized in probably two pages. It is hard not to notice the heavy influence of Stephen King (and I mean the worst parts of Stephen King). Frankly, I am surprised that TOR would publish this nonsense. Overall, a disappointing read--not worth the time or money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliantly creative and original","review":"I like stories that have big ideas. Stories like Fritz Lieber's _The Sinful Ones_ that proposed that all the other people in the world really are automatons, or _Celestial Matters_ that takes, as its premise, the notion that ancient Greek science and cosmology were accurate.This is another Big Idea book, and it is brilliantly rendered. The only complaint I have (hence the reason I only give it four stars) is that the solution to the mystery is given away far too early, but that doesn't really hamper the story as badly as I would have thought. Dawinia is an existential fantasy and a vindication of secular methodology all at the same time. By all means, do buy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Convuluted nonsense","review":"Fans of author Fred Hoyle will notice startling similarities between Darwinia and Hoyle's classic book, \\"October the 1st is Too Late\\". Both involve time-shifts that change the earth's surface and mankind's attempts to come to grips with the change. Unfortunately, Wilson isn't as capable a writer as Hoyle. Darwinia is a confused, depressing tale that is difficult to follow and unaccountably convoluted. The plot changes midway through, steering away from Darwinia's ecology into a chaotic tale of aliens, gods, and mankind's future. In writing this book, Wilson should have stuck to the theme of Darwinia and ignored the alien mumbo-jumbo. When I finished the book (with difficulty), I breathed a great sigh of relief."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good start but goes downhill","review":"This novel did start as a clasic Edgar Rice Burroughs or Jules Verne type novel - as stated on the back cover by the Toronto Globe reviewer. However, that reviewer must not have read past the middle of the book because it then turns into a garbled story-line about the changed continent of Europe is due to a computer virus attempting to rewrite the archieved history of the universe. While interesting to read to its conclusion once started, I would not recommend it to others and won't keep it on my bookshelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Premise, Bad Book","review":"This book started out with a good idea, but soon flopped. I was looking for an alternate history novel, but this is more science fiction than anything really. I like the fact that Wilson covers a wide range of history in this novel, so I gave it a higher rating than I would otherwise. The scope of the novel is it's only redeeming characteristic. If you wish to try this novel, I would recommend that you request it from your library, so in the likely event that you do not care for it, you may return it quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not too good.

I have taken the test and I would have to say that the best tool I had to use was the Topscore Pro program. This program has difficult questions that are much closer to the actual questions that are on the DAT, plus the format is exactly the same. It is tougher than you think to go from looking at a paper test the the computerized test, SO BUY THE DAMN PROGRAM! Dont waste money on the other books available unless you need practice on the PAT. The best study guides are the textbooks you used for the classes.

It basically consists of a few practice questions and a full sample test. It has a fairly decent math review though.

The title track is an astoundingly upbeat song for Skunk Anansie, but thoroughly enjoyable and masterfully performed.

A sort of character study, it builds from subdued observations to full-fledged ranting without ever growing obnoxious; on the contrary, it remains tuneful from start to finish.

Also, whenever there is a victory, it seems as if the President acted completely alone -- no one's help -- not even the legislature which wrote the bills to which he put his signature. When there was failure, it was anybody's fault BUT his.

After wading through this self-absorbed book it is evident to me that Bill Clinton is the perfect poster boy of a narcissist. He continues his tiresome theme of \\"Look at me, I've made mistakes but none have been my fault.

He repeats himself too much to write more pages. It is 600 Pages too long!!!!!I was disapointed that he still blames Starr,and says how it cost our country 40 million for Starr's report on his personal life.Mr. Clinton,When you became President,your personal life was no longer Personal! And with a Law Degree,shouldn't you have known that? Sir,it was your fault. I did enjoy his childhood memories.He has a talent for making people like him,and I do. Would I want him again for President? NO !I just wish he would take responcibility for his own actions,and stop thinking others are to blame.maybe then he can find peace with God, and become the man that God wants His Children to be.it seems he did more traveling than attending classes in College,but he picked smart friends and copied their notes!! oh yes,and he gave them Government Jobs!!

I frankly fell asleep many times reading this. Not because of the content, but because of his style of writing. I felt like it was targeting fifth-graders. I would give anything to have him back in the White House, but I was disappointed in his explanation of the whole Lewinsky scandal. He did his obligatory statement of accepting responsibility for his stupidity during that event, but he couldn't leave it at that.. he had to spend most of his energy on that topic blaming Ken Starr.

It's too much information.This book could have been so much better if he focused on just the highlights and didn't try to provide an entire history of the world from the time he was born until the end of his presidency.As much as I respect Bill Clinton for his accomplishments as president, I'm giving the book 2 stars because it's overkill.Unless you have a lot of time on your hands, get the abridged version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tiresome recap of an exhaustive list of life events","review":"President Clinton's autobiography reads as a near endless series of events rehashed from his diaries.

It lacks even the barest hint of self-evaluation or honest soul-searching. Clinton accepts responsibility for nothing. Every mistake he has ever made- political, personal, sexual- he blames on some other person, entity or phenomenon. His continued attacks on Ken Starr and his whining about his failure to secure peace in the Middle East (a failure brought on as a direct result of his pandering to Arafat) are pathetic. Readers who are hoping for an genuine look into this man's inner state are bound to be disappointed- either he wrote most of this fluff for filler or his life really is as shallow as some of his critics allege."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING!!!

Maybe he would have been more honest with himself and the reader. Both Nixon and Reagan brought you into the oval office with thier biogs.

As a very liberal paper, called the NY Slimes in my household, I was very suprised with the bad review. I decided to see for myself. But yes, the book was long, drawn-out, and full of lies. Bill Clinton has to be one of the most self-centered people that has ever written a book. Don't bother to read this unless you would like to just get angry. Also, don't waste your money.

Bill Clinton does have charisma; yet this book lacks it in every way.Second, this book does not cover the important unanswered questions of Mr. Clinton's presidency. Most galling of all the omissions is the death of Ron Brown. Mr. Clinton called Mr. Brown one of his closest and dearest friends; yet there is no mention of the Secretary of Commerce in this HUGE book.There are so many people, even common people, who are coming forward to say that Mr. Clinton mis-represents not only himself but the facts of history in this meandering, long-winded, tome.I have to agree with many of his detracters: this book title should be \\"MY LIE\\" by Bill Clinton."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is a failure for Mr. Clinton","review":"I tried to read Mr. Clinton's book with the hope that he would finally admitt his errors instead of trying to find excuses to save what little legacy he has as our 42nd President.

Sister Soulja, the retarded black man sacrificed on the Arkansas death row for the \\"Reagan democrat\\" vote, Rwanda, Haiti--Bill Clinton was a cracker from the deepest, darkest part of the South and he ran the country that way. TM should burn forever for sticking this man with such a title, besides it belongs to Abe Lincoln.Buy Bubba's book: he makes right wingers mad and he has a great story.

His description of his presidency is easily the most interesting from budget battles to the Middle East peace process.

My greatest wish is that he could have been president forever. This book only strengthened my views and made me stand firmer in my beliefs that good will always win if Bill Clinton has a say. My favorite part of the book was the beginning. I had never heard much about Mr. Clinton's childhood and I loved hearing his charming stories full of intrigue and innocence. All in all, I think that Bill Clinton did accomplish his goal of becoming a good person and I only wish more people could see it.

The book is an excellent reminder of Clinton's superb ability to shift, deflect, and/or mislead. I always thought those qualities helped make him the most effective politician I'd seen in years.As far as his impeachable offenses (lying under oath, obstructing justice) Clinton does not take responsibility for any of those transgressions. Apparently he was just trying to save the \\"office\\" as well as fighting Ken Starr, Newt Gingrich, and \\"demons.\\"The whole text (and there's lots of it) seemed rushed, awkward, and sophomoric.

Maybe policy wonks at the Kennedy School of Government will like this, but they read 1500 pages tomes on water treatment policy.Its just me me me, for more than 900 pages; I was right, and when I made a human mistake it was always really someone else's fault.

The quote from the above mentioned John Wayne/James Stewart classic sums this book up perfectly: \\"When the truth contradicts the legend, PRINT THE LEGEND\\" and Bill Clinton is, undoubtedly a legend in his own mind. This should be considered a work of fiction, and a poorly written one at that. Any similarity to the actual events surrounding the Clinton years in the White House are strictly co-incidental. (...) The only questions left are, what will he get for the movie rights, and can he get Mel Gibson or Tom Cruise to play the part? This should have been written on newspaper stock, so that it would at least be useful to wrap garbage in. My rating of one star for this piece of pure fiction is only because there are no negative star ratings allowed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pants","review":"This book should be called Me, Me, Me with extra cheese, as demonstrated at the conclusion of chapter 16 when Clinton quotes the Beatles.

It reflects the character of his presidency: high expectations crushed by a lack of discipline, squandered opportunities, lack of focus and scattered concentration. An extremely bright and talented man, Bill Clinton could have (and should have) been one of the greatest men in history. Instead, he has been one of the greatest disappointments. His book is the same. Sadly, he seems to assign more blame for the Monica debacle on Ken Starr than on himself. In fact, he sees that embarrassing episode and his role of dishonesty as a badge of honor! I want my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who Cares?","review":"Clinton is one of those completely forgettable people who, once he passes, will quickly settle in the dust bin of history. A crass opportunist, a politician in the most vile sense of the word, a liar, and a pathetic moral coward, one wonders why anyone would want to read about this man. I surely don't, and I most assuredly have not.It is most irritating to see this book listed among books of true American heroes such as U.S. Grant, Lee, Patton, and similar great Americans.

Sadly, he will go down in history as a great president, although he had zero accomplishments. Good public speaker, though, allowed the ignorant to adore him, but he is and was a disgrace to America. Hopefully, we won't see him in the future (with Hilary as president) and he can fade away.

(It is really the anniversary of a battle the Mexicans won.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book shuld have been place in the Fiction category.","review":"It was hard to get through most of this book -- while not only a very boring read, it was filled with inaccuracies and lies -- but I guess that is the sign of the Clinton presidency. He kept with tradition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Life Without Soul","review":"Perhaps what makes this book so fascinating is that these 900 pages comprise the historical according to Bill. Despite Dan Rather's enthusiasm, The Memoirs of Ulysses S. Grant, this is not. I won't join the partisan cheerleaders and detractors among the reviewers here. I will say only that I was disappointed. My Life is a triumph of spin over substance. I have a recommendation. Read Chuck Pfarrer's WARRIOR SOUL, The Memoir of a Navy SEAL. Tell me which was the life better lived, and tell me who is the more honest man. Pfarrer was one of the servicemen who carried out Mr. Clinton's often contradictory foreign polices in hot spots all over the globe. (Remember Somalia? Remember Rwanda?) Chuck Pfarrer was a man who lived at the end of the spear, and Bill Clinton a man who lived by opinion polls. I can hardly wait for the movie. Pfarrer's movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"A self-serving drivel rehashing past lies","review":"The book is indeeed, \\"sloppy, self-indulgent and often eye-crossingly dull - the sound of one man prattling away, not for the reader, but for himself and some distant recording angel of history\\". The writer of this review could not be more correct. Once again Mr. Clinton uses the women ignorant enough to believe his lies. This time, he reiterates the fabrications told during his tenure. Not worth wasting the money over. What a LOSER!"},{"rating":"1","title":"pathetic","review":"here he goes again. thanks to slick willie, i look at democrats in a different light. what an embarrassment he was to the USA as our commander in chief. he still can't fess up and admit the mistakes he made, still blaming everybody else and never himself. the book should be called \\"my lies\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just plain poor","review":"I like Bill Clinton. The book is just awful, though. A pack of lies and excuses. It really lowers my opinion of the man. He is often described as brilliant....and often described as the average man's president. I think the latter is more appropriate because his writing, his thinking and his morals are as average as you can get. Arrogant, yes. Brilliant? Hardly. Funny...Hillary's writings are just as disappointing. You really expect better from these minds, after all the hype. Can't they at least hire brilliant ghost writers? Then again, when Bush writes his story, it probably won't be much better but at least he's likely to exceed expectations since he has some humility: something the Clintons know nothing about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enough already","review":"Ron Brown's Body by John Cashill is a far more insightful read into Bill Clinton than one will get here. Honest and impeccably researched Cashill's book will rivet you whereas this Clinton self-aggrandizing tome is best read when one is attempting to induce sleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Life???","review":"No one could have possible read all of this drivvel in less than 24 hours and think it is interesting. My day book is more interesting. It is definitely all about HIM! The long, run on sentences are impossible to cipher."},{"rating":"1","title":"my life... through rose colored glasses...","review":"this book afforded him the chance to retell the same lies to the american public. true greatness is exhibited through one's actions, not words. his recollection of his 8 years in office greatly differed from mine.what a megalomaniac!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Propaganda at its best...or worst","review":"I thought this book might give me some insight on what its like to be a president. After reading 1/4 of the book I feel betrayed and mislead. It's not accurate and therefore not worth reading unless you want to continue to be lied to. Read between the lines people. Bill Clinton only cares about three things - Bill Clinton, re-writing his legacy, and MONEY!This book has galvanized my opinion of the Clintons forever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Empty suit","review":"What more can be said about this person.I choose to view him as a sign of the times; and a sad time it is. Amoral, dishonest, selfish & self-serving. All the qualities that we see in the people held up to us by the media giants as icons. We shouldn't expect anything different from this lump of offal.His presidency should be seen as a watershed: his last day in office was the last day of the slide toward Gomorrah.Don't let this tome be a loadstone to the return to decency."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Love Paula Jones!!!","review":"I would rather read Paula Jones' biography instead of this.

Another very good and easy to read book is Barack Hussein George W & The American Dream by B. Charles Henry, ISBN 1466312645. In addition, his homepage at Amazon's B. Charles Henry Page reveals some interesting APA scholarly written texts. These are two great authors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Honest, Erudite, and Insightful","review":"President Clinton lays his life out on the table honestly and openly in the way that comes most naturally to him: extremely detailed--perhaps to a fault-- and long. Oh brother, there were times where he was losing me midway through a page, but that's a true indication of what the man is like. Granted, I am an unapologetic, die-hard Clintonite. However, this book transcends politics and has greatly broadened my knowledge of recent American political history. For example, being not even 30 yrs old yet, I wasn't fully aware of all of the events surrounding the DNC here in '68. Clinton's vivid first hand re-telling of that tumultuous summer in my city's history was brilliant. Kudos to President Clinton."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I am a big Clinton fan but this book let me down, big time. Clinton has a shield around the real person and he doesn't let the sheild down for one moment. Everything juicy that he exposes has been exposed in the newspaper and I read it before. Nothing new here. And there are just so many people you can meet and so many places you can go before you just say, \\"This book is a bore.\\"The one thing I got from the book, which I already knew, is that Clinton eats, breathes, and sh*ts politics. Not much on the human side of him is ever revealed. Not one conversation between him and Hillary or Chelsea is ever recalled. A whitewash or expurgated version of I don't know what."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book from a great president!","review":"This book starts from August 16th, 1940 something and goes through Bill's presidency. I really enjoyed learning about different parts of Bill's life and all the great things he did for the American people. It was frustrating to hear about how much more he planned to do for us that was all stopped by our republican congress. The only reason I gave this book 4 stars instead of 5 was because there was a lot of policy talk which was a little dry for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Book, Great Cover Shot","review":"This book is so dull and boring, but the cover shot of Clinton is terrific, he looks so handsome. I guess that's all that really matters -- the picture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Your Father's Democratic Party","review":"This book is the epitome of modern liberalism. First, it is poorly written - it is like reading a high-schoolers journal. Secondly, it is all about \\"ME!\\" Example, compare FDR and Clinton. FDR's party affiliation was one of making the common man great. Democrats rallied for equal opportunity for all. However, the party was hijacked about 40 years ago and it received it's greatest leader of this new agenda in William Jefferson Clinton. FDR was about the greatness of the nation. Clinton is about the greatness of himself. FDR was committed to selfless sacrifice for the betterment of his nation. Clinton is committed to the sacrifice of others for the exaltation of himself. FDR was devoted to moral fortitude. Clinton is devoted to moral perversion. I encourage you to buy this book so that you will know the mind of those who seek to bring down our great country."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Life, or My \\"Lies\\"??","review":"I got this book, and I made it through 34 pages before I finally quit reading. I noted in the margin, \\"At this point, I will stop [reading]...I have the feeling that the rest of this book is going to be nothing but B.S., anyhow.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than I thought.","review":"I really enjoyed the first part of this book,which rebukes the notion that he was born of a privledged class. But the second half sounded like a bunch of stump speeches about \\"The environment, education and welfare.\\" His perspectives on the Supreme Court decisions Gore v. Bush was interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long but worthwhile book","review":"Bill Clinton is a very complex individual, and I am sure he could have made 5 volumes of his auto-biography. The book mentions many of the events that have occured in his life. Clinton writes very well and is easy to understand (therefore making his book more accessible to all.) After reading this book, I respected Clinton much more. He seems to be the only president since Kennedy who has had any guts. Clinton has always meant well, and that honesty is felt throughout the book. Although it is long, it flows pretty well. This book could motivate young readers to involve themselves in politics, which will be good.Reading this book also makes me very sad.This year we have to either re-elect an embarrasing idiot or a sleep-walking zombie. No Bush or Bush Lite - I want Clinton back."},{"rating":"1","title":"B-O-R-I-N-G!!!","review":"I bought it, I read it, and I don't reccommend it. A big waste of time! Very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bill Clinton, \\"My Lies\\"","review":"Yes, the title should be \\"My Lies\\". Here are two people that \\"couldn't recall\\" and \\"couldn't remember\\" a thing for eight years and are now writing their memoirs... I think this book is an insult to the american people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent as Memoirs Go","review":"This book is excellent as presidential memoirs go. Presidential Memoirs are generally boring things, but Clinton actually manages to do the genre proud and turn in a work that he actually wrote instead of using a ghostwriter and a work that gives us new insights into his own mind. I have a new respect for the man after having read about his childhood.Much better than any recent President's memoirs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shred of evidence","review":"How many times does Bill Clinton say \\"There's not a shred of evidence\\" in this book?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of much paper","review":"Clinton had better be glad that his pre-release hype was so high, otherwise he would never have sold many copies. This book is ridiculously long, the last half is poorly edited, and much of the time he is doing nothing more than making excuses and passing the buck. I heard earlier today that world leaders like the former prime minister of Israel are publicly refuting \\"facts\\" from the book. I'm not surprised."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too long and too dull.","review":"Before I begin, let me say that I don't have a huge grudge against Bill Clinton. I picked up the book at the library because I wanted to learn more about his presidency, and hey, Hillary's book was a good read so maybe this one would be too.WRONG!Bill likes minutiae, and this book is crammed with them. Call me crazy, but I did not need to know the names of every teacher he had in grade school, nor every club he joined in high school, nor every class he took and grade he received at Georgetown. It took him 500 pages to get to 1992 Election! As a result, he had to gloss over a lot of the things that happened while he was President, and that's the part of his life that's most interesting.If you want to read a good book about the Clinton presidency, I'd recommend either Living History by Hillary Clinton or Madame Secretary by Madeline Albright. Skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Like many others, I've been waiting a long time for \\"Bill's Book.\\" I am a Clinton Democrat, and was a huge fan of the President's, even through his trying times. Clinton is such an eloquent speaker... Why is his writing so pedestrian? Now that I am focused on the tedious writing (he uses 'a lot' a lot & chooses vague verbs \\"doing\\" and \\"making\\"), I cannot enjoy his narrative. He over-simplifies his emotions (for example, when he relates that a friend of his from Arkansas died in Vietnam, he wrote, \\"I was so sad.\\"). Truthfully, I expected much, much more from this intelligent and interesting past president. I'll finish the book (I am only on page 107), not out of compelling interest in the writing, but out of my own neurosis for finishing books that I start."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read","review":"Well written, good book. Interesting to read his perspective on world events different from what I was seeing in the media."},{"rating":"2","title":"From The Beginning","review":"A good behind-the-scenes look at the everyday workings of the President. The man everyone either loves or hates, I guess you know where I stand having voted for him twice. This book only revealed what I could already sense; a genuine people-person, that experienced an upbringing that is crucial for one seeking the White House, or any public office. Mr. Clinton paid his dues, observing the many sides of American life by living them. Made mistakes? Of course. What President hasn't? Should the \\"Monica Affair\\" wipe from our memories, the many advancements for good we enjoyed under his leadership? Our current rising debt should remind us of the age-old question, \\"were we better off then or now?\\" Could have gone deeper into the scandal, but refreshing that it didn't. Unless that's all the reader was looking for. Maybe a reason some readers were bored. Its reading may even help us as \\"Christians\\" and Americans, to find a place in our hearts for forgiveness."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book sucks!","review":"I hate this book! When I bought it I thought that it was a joke. There's nothing funny about it. It really is about Clinton's life. Who even cares!? I, along with everyone else in the world HATE Bill Clinton!!! In the entire book he just makes up good stuff about himself, while in reality there is nothing good to say about him. A truthful book about his life would have been funnier and more entertaining. Do NOT buy this book!!!!!P.S. I only gave it 1 star because I can't give it 0.Feel free to e-mail me at supremeruleroftheearth@yahoo.com"},{"rating":"1","title":"LIAR, LIAR. PANTS ON FIRE!!!","review":"I can't believe I even bought this book. It only made me even more upset than I was when I watched OUR PRESIDENT lie to the world on television. How can I take anything he says seriously?I found this book to be very disappointing. Rachel"},{"rating":"1","title":"A big sleeper ...","review":"I really tried to read this one. I'm not a Clinton supporter, but I was interested in his view during his gubernatorial and presidential years. I returned the book when I couldn't get past his childhood. Page after page of VERY EARLY childhood memories that somehow tie into the socialist philosophy he embraces today. All I could do was shake my head - and most of the time it was only to wake myself up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Old Habits Die Hard","review":"More of the same self-serving lies and spin we heard during the eight embarassing years with Clinton in the White House. I regret I wasted the time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Life","review":"This book was long in the tooth. Nothing new or remotely interesting. Hiliary's book was much more in depth, especially on policy. I was disappointed in this book. Don't pay for it. If you insist on reading it go to the library and get a free copy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Environmental Disaster","review":"During the impeachment saga Bill Clinton responding to a question by saying: \\"That depends on what the menaing of 'is' is.\\" Apparently that is not the only problem which Mr. Clinton has with the English language, as this is a very poorly written book which is also completely lacking in substantive content. The reason that this review is titled \\"Environmental Disaster\\" is because that is what this book actually is when one considers the tremendous amount of natural resources that were squandered in the manfacturing of one million copies of Bill Clinton's \\"My LIfe.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Dodgey, deficient dereliction of democracy","review":"Thank heaven for this rambling nonsense, so that we can now show our levelheaded, young, aspiring writers how not to write. Liberal hack writers, however, will take their cues from their idolatrous fascination with the man, his prowess, and his prose. For imitating his style, they're bound to become ineffective, muddleheaded laughingstocks. Oops, perhaps that's already started. In any case, thank you Mr. Clinton!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Book of Lame Excuses","review":"I thought my teenage children wrote the book on lame excuses...it seems President Clinton is saying no one ever listened to him and that's the reason for our current problems. I find it hard to believe that the international community ignored the most powerful man in the world, the President of the United States. On another note, it seems no autobiography would be complete without racy parts, but they were pretty lite. The idea that Hillary made the President sleep on the coach for infidelity is laughable: how many bedrooms does the White HOuse have?"},{"rating":"1","title":"More Bill Blah","review":"Dull and over-rated, this book does not approach being worth the money. It became clear early in Clinton's presidency that to understand him, you pay attention not to any of his words but to his actions and patterns of behavior. Spend your money wisely and buy something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Waste","review":"This is the most self-serving book I've read. It was a waste of money and time. This man is so not be to admired or looked up to in anyway. He made this a private arena for his side of the story and to make people sorry for poor Bill. Don't waste your time or money on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rivisonist History","review":"This book is awful. Bill Clinton is so full of crap. This is the way he dreamed things would have happend not actually how they did. This guy truth if he tried. I think this is the worst Presidential memior i have ever read. I have read past presidents books that have written them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bleak House - large and dull","review":"I was given this book as a gift and I tried, really tried to get into it. Sorry, but I just don't like the man and I don't believe a single word he says, including a, and and the. I have no doubt he will continue this saga on and on with another volume.I really did not need to know the name of everyone in every town he lived in, and other minutiae. I am sure his childhood was not ideal and that is too bad since it surely colored his behavior in later years. I really find it hard to believe that Amazon biggies chose this as the third best book of 2004."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like The Title","review":"Like the title of this book, it is rather boring and pretentious. The only interest in this book is salacious: Monica, Monica, Monica! And that he shrugs off as him merely being a bad boy. A man his age, who is also the leader of one of the most important countries in the free world, and he is just a bad boy? Well, he had eight years to make an important contribution to history, a lasting impact on the world. Instead he chose to be a bad boy. Nothing but a huge yawn!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A big fat bore","review":"This is the most boring presidential autobiography I've ever come across. It's too careful and so mannered that it's stodgy. One wishes that Clinton had simply fired the ghost writer and written something lively and so what if it showed him warts and all. Instead we get mind numbing details about stuff that doesn't matter now and probably didn't matter then. Do we really need to read about every meal he ever ate? There's no life in this book, no passion, and none of the famous Clinton charm. Reading it made me think of that line from On Golden Pond, \\"Bore, bore, bore!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"A study in clinical psychology","review":"Bill Clinton rivals Richard Nixon as perhaps the most narcissistic, pathologically dishonest president in U.S. history. This book should interest clinical psychologists who also have a fairly detailed knowledge of the history of Clinton's presidency. Ordinary citizens should be aware of the pathology underlying Clinton's version of the facts."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Far, So Good","review":"I anxiously awaited for this book to hit the shelves. To my surprise, there wasn't a long line of customers waiting to purchase same. Nearly 1,000 pages. I read through some of the others' reviews just to see what the consensus would be. I am personally enjoying \\"My Life.\\" It offers wonderful inside political views as well as some of Mr. Clinton's personal history. This book is a great tool to have in your library for your children as a research project. That's just my two cents. Also, I too, have also purchased the novel, \\"LUST OF THE FLESH,\\" by Beverly Rolyat and found it to be a fascinating novel. Yes, I can see the Monica Lewinski/Bill Clinton scandal wrapped up in the novel. I would recommend that you pick this one up. It's a great summer read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Self-centered, self-absorbed, Unimportant weakling among the presidents","review":"Almost all people have difficulties keeping selfishness and self-centeredness under control. But poor Clinton he really loves himself and always seeks that which is selfish and self-glorifying as his chief end. Plus he was a weak president who desired to secure the civil and social practice of the anti-nomian commitment for autonomous self-regulated infanticide. He will be remembered in the celestial halls of probity and justice as a moral ogre. It is more than difficult to read his notions of government when he failed in personal government, family government and civil government.I recommend that we put this volume down and read something ethically edifying."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a bunch of tripe.","review":"I only gave it a star because it is a required form field. There are no stars in this book, just a bunch of pathetic losers. I would recommend reading the Bible both before and certainly after reading this painful screed. I was not the least bit surprised that there was no chapter on China, however there is an entire paragraph on astroturf. I would not wish this book on my worst enemy, however, making the prisoners at Gitmo read this might be the perfect torture without leaving any visible evidence. They would however be scarred for life. Please consider donating what you would spend for this \\"book\\" to your favorite charity ie. PETA ACLU etc. Bill and Hill don't really need the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING","review":"This is the most self-serving, boring tome I've ever tried to read! Must admit I couldn't finish it. Weren't we led to believe this was to be a tell-all? Was there anything told that we didn't already know? If so, I must have missed it. I suppose I will go back to attempt to find something interesting when I have some serious insomnia. A page or two should be the cure."},{"rating":"1","title":"A president will colorful life but the content is biased","review":"This 957 page book introdcued the colorful life of Bill Clinton's . I think he was a great president. He realized the importance of learning from all people, and how a boy challenged his life and finally become the CEO of a nation US.Most of the content is the good thing of this CEO, only little content on the scandal like Whiewater, Monica. If the reader want to know more on this, you will be disappointed.Being the U.S. president at the end of 20th century, he had done some great job, of course, and you can find many achievement mentioned by himself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get your facts straight: IT WASN'T ABOUT SEX","review":"He wasn't impeached for his activities with Monica. He was impeached for LYING UNDER OATH. Us commoners in flyover country refer to that as perjury.Debate his merits and faults all you want, but never forget that FACT.Clinton can't erase history no matter how much he spins it...or mo matter how much the pathetic sheep who hang on his every word cling to their idol."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninteresting","review":"Again as uninteresting as he was. He calls himself a great president. He was a felon, he lied under oath."},{"rating":"1","title":"The most amazing liar in American history","review":"Reading \\"My Life\\" (as told by a liar who lies and has been lying since the day he was born) was a rather nauseating experience. As many professional reviewers (some of whom no doubt diehard Democrats) have pointed out, a lot of what's in the book is nothing short of outright lies. Like Whitewater, Monica-gate, to name just a couple of the scandals Bill Clinton's joke-of-a-presidency will forever be remembered for. Even a lot of the stuff about his youthful days has been questioned for their truthfulness. I was convinced this guy was the best con artist in american history, and after reading the book, I felt even more disgusted.Give your money to charity instead of enriching this pants-on-fire liar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Trash From A Total Liar","review":"The Clintons are the most evil family ever to try to take over America. Even though I think Hillary is a worse liar, Bill is just as evil, pathetic, and sleazy. I'm sick of everyone going nuts over this guy, as if he was some sort of hero. But all the left-wing sleazes seem to forget that he was almost forced to RESIGN!!!! Somehow that always slips their minds. And Bill makes it look like he's such a good role model, so innocent. Harumph! That'll be the day! I am using this book for kindling right now. That is the only use for it!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Self-serving junk","review":"This book is a complete waste of time to read. It offers no new information not available elsewhere and Clinton admits or describes nothing new about his sins and foibles. Its mostly a rant against Ken Starr. He doesn't even really describe Hillary very much. He is in love with himself though, that's obvious. I want the hours I spent reading this insufferable tripe back. Take my advice, DON'T buy this book, mine is now residing as a doorstop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the millions he was paid","review":"Dull, boring, and a waste of paper it is printed on.

He should write fiction, it may make for a better read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting read, recommended","review":"Its an interesting book to read about the White House in the volatile times in the 90s. Beyond the impeachment it reveals a deep insight of the presidency and how clinton was affected by his rough childhood and how that affected his presidency. Good job Mr. President!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A wasp aka W.A.S.P.","review":"Ignore the negative reviews of these book. Ignore all of them.This particular autobiography is genuinely engaging.

Only for the most ardent Clinton fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Remember when presidents were intelligent and honorable?","review":"I sure do!Listening to Bill Clinton's voice reminds me of a time when terrorists were dealt with before they became problems, when we had nuclear attack subs patrolling the waters within striking distance of Afghanistan to keep tabs on Bin Laden and his friends (they didn't dare try anything with the subs around), and when intelligent tax policies insured prosperity for all.Now, we have in the White House a dishonorable twit who raids the Treasury for his already-rich buddies, and then invades a country that was minding its own business simply so he could grab its vast oil reserves. Meanwhile, more and more of us fall into poverty.I can tell you who I'd rather see in office right now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I was so disappointed with this book. It will make a great paper weight. With all the things this man did he writes hundreds of pages about his adolesent years. He leaves out everything about Monica and tells a lot of I should have done this. I would not reccomend this book to anyone unless your a die hard fan. Save your money and buy it on Amazon in 3-4 weeks. You'll be able to pick it up for a buck or two! What a let down!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting look at day to day","review":"OK, so we didn't get any lurid details (read the ken starr report for that). What we did get was a great look into his life and presidency and for those of us who have felt that Clinton was the best president of our day it was a fantastic look into the white house.What goes on day to day? What are meetings like? Clinton, with his incredible attention to detail, gave us this. We know what happened with Monica. The book, which is a bit long at times, shows us what we didn't know, and does it in a way that is detailed and instructive."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVED IT!!!","review":"I purchased the audio cds (6 of them) and listened to them during my 2-hour roundtrip commute to and from work.Despite one's opinion of this man, he will go down in U.S. history as being one of the greatest leaders to run our country."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Doubt Important","review":"The book, like the man, is no doubt important.

Unlike the man, more is not better.Like the man, there are salacious bits. Unlike the man, they are insufficient to keep one's attention.Serious historians will doubtless pore over every detail. I found my attention wandering early and often. I thought about waiting for the movie, but in an odd way, the presidency itself was the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get Lives!","review":"I originally wrote a very positive review of this book in 2004.

It doesn't come thru in this book at all. He's also not much of a writer or at least the ghostwriter he used (if he used one), isn't. (Maybe Clinton went cheap on who he used because he was saving his money for possible legal issues.) I like Clinton alot, just not this book. I agree that he should talk more about his mistakes. In fact, that's part of what makes him charismatic when he speaks; he talks about making mistakes, he seems real, not someone trying to present himself as all-knowing, like Bush. Maybe Bush wrote this book. It seems like he could have."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS IS A $12 MILLION DOLLAR BOOK?","review":"ABSOLUTELY THE WORST BOOK EVER BY A POLITICIAN!

I learned about his shockingly disappoiting upbringing, but was even more impressed after reading just how much effort it must have taken to turn his life around and make something of himself. He worked hard and became a Rhodes Scholar, and eventually Governor and twice-elected President of the United States. Anyone who can still be alive after what he has been through deserves praise and admiration. Bill Clinton was a phenomenal President, despite his own personal shortcomings. I'll always admire him sincerely for his leadership and inner strength. This book provides great insight into this man's life, and just how incredible of a person he is for managing to survive it all and still come out on top. We miss you, Mr. President!

To read about his difficult childhood and to see the pictures of his family made him seem like someone close to me. I think part of his leadership ability comes from the fact that he has lived a life like so many people live- a hard life. Yet he has been able to rise up out of that and be a beacon of hope for all people. I have the book and my 78 year old father requested the book for Christmas. Both he and my mother who grew up during the depression have enjoyed the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Revealing but at times skims the surface","review":"I think President Clinton should have produced his bio in a series of volumes rather than crowding it all into this one book. I had a natural curiousity about how Bill would have discussed his affairs with the several women he had affairs with. He discusses and defends each one of them from a point of view that he was just about falsely accused. This leaves the reader, justifiably, with the point of whether or not his personal life should have been exposed as much as it was. Does the President have to admit wrong-doing in his bio? Maybe not.The photos included are a inclusive snapshot of some of the major occurences of his administration.The last 4 chapters are too quickly discussed. A paragraph to some very major events which could have been a book onto themselves.I recommend this book. It is extremely well written and flows smoothly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many uninteresting details!","review":"I am a fan of Clinton and a registered democrat, so this is not a review from a conservative set out to hate the book. Clinton went into way to much detail on things that seemed insignificant. I also think he is not far enough removed from his Presidency to write objectively about his years in office. I would like to see what he thinks about his time in the White House 10 years from now.

Rather, Random House appears to have cut corners by producing a SINGLE volume that tips the scale at 6.5 pounds, and is nearly 1,800 pages. Even at that, the paper used is so thin it is easy to tear a page by just turning it. This book should have been produced in TWO VOLUMES, and a higher quality paper should have been used. I feel shortchanged. Yes, I did send the publisher a note of concern, but no response has arrived. Yes, I called Mr. Clinton's office in NYC to let them know the book is not only unwieldy, but poorly presented. Try lugging this tome around -- you could sprain a wrist.

The latter event could have been prevented if Clinton would have taken Osama bin Laden out at least three, count em, THREE different occasions. According to Clinton, OSAMA had not committed any crimes against the USA. This was in 1996.

Several reviewers have observed that the 900 page book is too long, but the abridged CD version cuts some of the detail and covers the major events of his life in six hours.

It was a bit boring at parts, mainly when he dragged on about his childhood, and growing up.

Other than that, the book was very good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh Bill.","review":"I stopped reading this book after about 100 pages. It was just too too detailed. Really, I didn't need to know every tree species that grew in the garden of his childhood home. He also seems to have mentioned EVERY human he has ever met. And every course he ever took. And every girl he ever kissed (hence the 900 pages ....) Yawn. He should have hired an editor to cut this down by about 50%. Very disappointing. Another door stop for my growing collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"YAWN","review":"Rather than naming this book \\"My Life\\" it would have been better to call it \\"My Lies\\". If you got tired of the ceaseless detours from the truth during his administration, you will find that this book is more of the same- interspersed with long drawn out ramblings that add no substance to the story.

He spent more time talking about his childhood than he did speaking about some of the major issues during his presidency.Granted, most biographies can also serve as an opportunity to make excuses for past errors but I thought this carried that a bit too far. In addition, I felt he used it as an opportunity to \\"settle some old scores."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Review","review":"I pictured Snoopy typing \\"it was a dark and stormy night\\" after reading the first line of this doorstop. Snoopy would have made a better editor than whoever edited this book. As much as Bill Clinton likes to hear himself talk, he likes long, rambling, comma filled sentences.There's no new insights into the events that took place that has not been covered elsewhere, so if you love him or hate him, this book will not change your opinion of him.Any good sophomore english teacher would say this book is too long, the sentences are too rambling and he needs to stay more focused on his subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time or money...","review":"Is this book worth reading?

The book started slow and never picked up. I had expected better from a book about Isabella."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"It is surprising to note that the author of this book had written published items before. Firstly the book takes forever to get through, it just plods on and is not well written. It is completely and horribly disappointing a book. Most of the book is conjecture and no real proof the authors' assumptions are given. She jumps from one area to another and the writing is completely disjointed. I recommend saving your dosh for a book that is more historically accurate and a better read. I could not wait to finish this book, and not for any positive reason. On one page she even contradicted the dates regarding the same item. Her conjecture is ridiculous and makes no historical sense at all. She would have been better writing a fiction novel, for that is what this truly is."},{"rating":"2","title":"great read for european political junkies","review":"This was a great read. For those who have read the author's other books on British monarchy this one will not disappoint. It is a compelling and engaging narrative that sheds light on a historical character I knew very little about. The story of Queen Isabella's reign in England is well worth the effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Biased Writer","review":"Alison Weir is the most biased writer of history I've ever read. She constantly slants things to conform to her own ideas of what \\"really\\" happened in history. I find it ironic that she goes out of her way to prove Isabella's innocence after the hatchett job she did on Richard III. I don't enjoy her writing style either. She rambles on from one thing to another and quite frankly, she's boring. I could not even finish her \\"Mary Queen of Scots and Lord Darnley\\" as fascinating a story as that is.

In all honesty, I have never come across a work of historical non-fiction so biased, so slanted as to be almost untenable.Here are Weir's salient points:Edward II was evil.Isabella was a saint.Really, those are the points made over and over and over and over. Now we're no expert nor do we have a dog in this fight, but we're pretty certain that any historical portrait should be a tad more balanced to be taken seriously. I was reluctant to even continue on with it for fear that Weir was unreliable all together. I understand a historian having personal preferences, but to present them as fact when they aren't is irresponsible in non-fiction.Unless it's about Hitler...that's pretty much my only exception."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very thorough biography of the She-Wolf","review":"Alison Weir has written better biographies than this. Although it is very, very thorough, this same thoroughness makes it quite boring. The author often keeps repeating the same things. For example, the people who supported Isabella are repeated times and times again with long explanations of the reasons why, while they remained mostly the same people with the same motives.Nevertheless, Isabella is a very interesting subject and Weir is convincing in her effort to rehabilitate Isabella from the bad press she has received from male chroniclers through the ages."},{"rating":"2","title":"One for History Buffs","review":"I am enjoying reading this book.

Weir outlines the woman's point of view and the female role in Medieval society where 'rights' we given by the husband. When Queen Isabella witnesses everything she is entitled to as Queen removed she tactfully polts to regain her freedom and ultimate revenge. Alison Wier shows that Queen Isabella was the more powerful character and ruler compared to her husband and how this role was viewed in Medieval society."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rip-snorting Good!","review":"The title promises adultery, treachery and murder and this book delivers. A fascinating glimpse of the disorderly royal politics of the Middle Ages. Unfortunately, the author buys into a dubious theory that Edward II survived his captivity, lived in Italy as a monk and perhaps never said boo to anyone back in England."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm not an expert, but I enjoyed this read","review":"I will admit to not being an expert on Queen Isabella. I have never read a biography on her before, so when I picked up Alison Weir's book in the store I had nothing to compare it to and enjoyed it immensely. There is wonderful period detail here, especially in the beginning, and I think the reader feels a measure of sympathy for Isabella, whose husband wasn't interested in her sexually (or emotionally it seems). My favorite part of the book was when Isabella (finally) took a lover and decided to make a stand against her husband with him. Part slighted young woman, part Lady Macbeth, Queen Isabella is a very interesting read with a few theories about Edward II's \\"death\\" I hadn't heard before (whether or not they could be accurate I can't say)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Board DOA","review":"Board was doa had to rma to evga I waited over 30 days to try it in my grandsons computer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool Gun","review":"This is a pretty cool gun.

The feel of the plastic stylus on the screen is also somewhat poorer than that of the Palm that I had been using prior. However, the expandability of the Springboard modules, while I have yet to take advantage of them, is promising. The speed of USB Hotsync is a clear improvement over Palm's standard serial. Finally, I like the Visor's design feature that allows it to be snapped into cases designed for it, rather than using velcro. Overall, I would recommend the Visor as an alternative to Palm's products, unless you want the Palm V. I haven't noticed any problem related to the absence of flash ROM on the Visor compared to the Palm.

If it breaks in shipment I think it wasn't made or packed very well.I might just buy a new one (Palm? something else?) instead of pay the $85, because I'd get another cradle, the software and maybe the newer one's don't break as easily.

If you do not then I promis you that it will get dirty scuzzy and you can never get it clean again, because it sticks between the buttons(where you almost can't clean), your screen (mostly pet hair), and it is hard to clean.

I'm still learning!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not work for me","review":"I needed composter mostly for kitchen scraps and grass. When the composter arrived, I filled in up with green stuff, turned regularly, but it did not compose at all and it only smelled. I called the company after couple of months of waiting for my compost and they told me you need to add 2/3 of carbon rich stuff in (hay, dry leafs etc) together with the green stuff so it can compose. I do not have hay or dry leafs during most of the year! Obviously, this composter will not work for me. Returning it was easy. I am going to try something that can compost kitchen scaps only."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product","review":"I was concerned about the assembly, based on others' reviews, but it was very easy until the final moment--one of the sides did not have the hole drilled out, so I couldn't insert the screw that holds it onto the stand. Fortunately I own a power drill, so I was able to remedy this, but it did add some time to the process (this is the only reason it got 4 stars instead of 5).Now that it's put together I'm very happy with it. It's sturdy and just the right size for two people. I really like that it's off the ground, as our last composter did not have a bottom, and some small animal excavated underneath it every night--flinging lots of rotting food for our dog to eat!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap hardware ... makes it non functional","review":"I echo a previous reviewer who found the cheap latches a problem. Ditto for the door construction. Mine broke after a few months use. As it is a plastic piece, once it broke it was gone. I had to drill into plastic and add a metal screw which is a poor solution but all I've got to hold the door in place (sort of). The latch doesn't hold well, meaning it's got to have a strap around it. This is a very light use appliance, which if you use it very little, may give you satisfaction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back Porch Tumbler","review":"We received the Back Porch Compost Tumbler within a week of ordering.

You need a Phillips head screwdriver, a wrench, and a pair of pliers. This said, it takes quite a bit of strength to turn the screws.The instructions could be better. There are two round screens that, according to the instructions, come preassembled in the endcaps. I am not sure this is true. They were on the bottom of the box and nothing in the instructions refers to them, but they presumably go inside the holes in the endcaps.I can't rate the product yet because I haven't used it.Modified after more than a year of use. It takes 6-9 months to get more or less unextraordinary compost."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compost Tumbler","review":"Was fairly easy to put together. I love that it's portable--easy to roll around. Easy to tumble to mix the compost. Still to early for me to tell about how long to make compost."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good while it lasted","review":"The tumbler didn't even last a year before the plastic broke around the metal rod that holds it onto the cart. It wasn't overloaded or abused in any way, the plastic just wasn't strong enough to take the load of compost as it turned around and around.Before it broke it was pretty nice though. I was able to get two loads of compost, from green grass (dried in the sun so it didn't mold first), leaves and kitchen scraps to black gold, before it broke."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed Lid","review":"While a tumbling composter sounds great this design falls short.It simple does not do a good job of turning and mixing the humus. It is occasionally necessary to manual flip the material which is not a huge undertaking but the poor lid design makes it a challenge due to the lack of a lid latch to hold it in place while you mix the humus or remove it."},{"rating":"1","title":"not for serious composter","review":"I have a small garden and I bought this item because of the perfect size, and beautiful design. I have owned this product for over three years. Two of that years unit didn't fully perform. It's good for small yard and if you don't fill it more than one third. It's easy to assemble, door is sturdy. Problem is when you fill it over half full. It's PLASTIC, and I should of known that. The screws that hold the barrel bent by heaviness of compost, and I would of replace them if the plastic around them didn't tear and now I cant turn it anymore. The other problem is that it takes some time to make compost, so I actually need two composters; one to lay dormant and process food and leaves and another for fresh clippings and scraps. I am planning to purchase steel one with double chamber.

But it's just too small. Make it a slingshot or a bow. This seems to be a pointless concept in my book.On a positive note, it does encourage good coordination and aiming skills as a slingshot.I intended it as a gift for my 4 year old who requested a bow and arrow, but upon opening it, I was too disappointed.

The author fails to go into verbose detail on almost every problem, leaving you guessing how she came to that conclusion. That would be fine if this was an advanced trig book, but it's the DUMMIES guide and as such I'd expect to be taken through every step of every problem.

It was so disappointing to find there were no songs form any of his films as a Pachuco character. In fact they are some of the least interesting musical numbers. You also have to skip through like a dozen commercial ads for cheap Mexican telenovelas and b-rated movies. There is no option to get to the main menu without doing this, so it it quite annoying.

They all said about one or two things that sounded like me, but none of the sixteen types were actually like my personality. I have read much better books which have acurately described my personality. When, I finally settled one of the sixteen types, I was disappointed because none of my personal career choices were listed. I think they should have listed more careers.

Because it truly puts you in a category and provides you suitable careers according to your personality type, i.e., what careers you'd possibly find enjoyable based on the functioning of your brain.But each type offers varied fields of career. For example, as in my INFP type, you could be an actor as well as a psychological counselor. That means you have to pounder into what your abilities and interests are before you can find the right career.Thus I worked with \\"Discover What You Are Best At\\" by Linda Gale, which shows your aptitudes(abilities) to narrow the focus.

I appreciate the author's perspective on God's promise to walk with us through all the times of our lives and give us exactly what we need when we need it most. There is truth and humor in the present day examples Evans gives of how easily man pushes away God in an effort to be self-sufficient.I think this book is appropriately titled because indeed God is more than enough as the scripture reminds us.

The flow of songs is incredible - just pure magic.This CD requires more attention initialy as there is a lot of sound layers in the mix and it took me about 4 listens to fully get into it. Good earphones and playing it while driving at night should do it. Now it gets better with each listen.This is possibly the most underrated act in the world.

A few of the movies are old classics, and were OK. Most are suffering from poor image quality and sloppy, unprofessional transfer to DVD. There are sound problems, ranging from very weak to loud and crackly (from over driving the audio input while recording to DVD). Many of the movies are outright ridiculous, being too lousy to classify as a B or a C film to begin with, let alone with the image and sound quality problems. I watched the set once, then gave it away. If I hadn't found someone to take it, I'd have tossed it into the trash. Believe me, you DO get what you pay for with this set."},{"rating":"1","title":"ok","review":"I don't care much for Spagetti westerns and this was ok. not great.

As a music writer myself, I checked this book out for some Dylan research. It has proved much more helpful to me than other Dylan resources, even the 1,000 page Bob Dylan Encyclopedia. The materials you'll find inside range from interviews to reviews to poetry to literary analysis. I would have liked to have read more analysis, but that is just personal taste. I would say that Hedin chose the pieces very well, skirting the line between an actual college-level \\"reader\\" and something that is entertaining to read. It reminds me of the Popular Philosophy series that is out now (like Battlestar Galactica & Philosophy, Seinfeld & Philosophy, Radiohead & Philosophy, etc.), but it is more extensive and more interdisciplinary.I recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"CLEP analyzing and Interpreting Literature","review":"This completely prepared me for the exam.

I read the review in the book and then took Practice Test 1 on the CD. When I reviewed the answers I got correct and incorrect, they were not accurate. I know the score the CD told me (though passing) is not accurate as the answers it says I chose I know are inaccurate. In addition, the CD does not match the book, so it makes it difficult to analyze your answers. In theory this is a great idea, however, the CD does not work correctly. I would not purchase this for the CD. The review was an easy read and probably gave some good information in terms of vocabulary.

One of the passages actually was on the test. If you want to pass, unless you are an uber genius, you really need to spend some time getting in the mode of test taking, and with the practice tests included, this book will get you there.

John Denver has a lovely voice that is sorely missed and this album, in my reckoning, is his best. He tells stories of love, the country and memories. My standout track is the lovely \\"Wildflowers in a Mason Jar (The Farm)\\"- a song about a child and his grandfather travelling on a bus and the grandfather's memories of times past on his farm.Every song has a nice easy feel to it, and is a good listen to take you out of the stresses of everyday life.A wonderful album that is an essential purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I was a die hard John Denver fan during the '70s.

But this is just about awful. I have heard that he did not want to do this album and I can see why. A Bobby Goldsboro song? Just plain awful. The title track and a couple of others are the only ones worth buying this for.I have to admit that it was very interesting listening to the maturity that had grown in his voice by the time this was recorded. If not for his very untimely death, we might have heard a lot more from him.I will miss his music, but I would not miss not having to listen to this album again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book If...","review":"Juicing has long been a viable practice to restore health. But this book takes the concept of juicing to another level by explaining which juices help what ailments and so forth. I'm a big fan of Norman Walker, but what I've found is that there can be blood sugar issues with juicing - when you remove the fiber, and if you're sensitive to sugar (diabetes, hyperactivity, candida), you can have some serious problems with this approach. Great information but it should have come with a note explaining this approach is not perfect for anyone.

The explaination for why some of the foods Americans eat to day, cause us so many problems seems rational. Walker gives reasons to change your eating habits. However, I find it difficult for someone to just drink/eat vegetable and fruit juices and salads. I began juicing 2 months ago due to an ailment. I have been taking the suggested cocktail/vegetable juice mentioned by Walker for this ailment. It has noticable worked. I am a generally healthy person, but I have been taking in 1-2 servings of juice cocktails and feel better overall.

It is a complex story that twists and turns with every new level. You'll get pulled into playing more and more. I gave it 4 stars, because at times the game gets really hard and complex with puzzles and it gets really frustrating. But it is definatelt worth playing to find what happens at the end.

This fared better, with three number one country hits that also did well in the American pop charts, although a serious attempt at a UK pop breakthrough failed.The three singles were Feels so right (perhaps the best love song they ever recorded), Love in the first degree (not to be confused with a completely different song of the same title by the British pop trio, Bananarama) and Old flame, all of them outstanding love songs, typical of most of the album.The one song that contrasts sharply with the love songs is Ride the train, an upbeat song reminiscing about a bygone age. Trains are not a common theme in Alabama's songs, but this is a classic.Alabama have recorded many fine albums, but this is a classic. If you enjoy romantic music in a country style with a rock edge, you will surely love this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Focus","review":"This is the only vinpocetine I have ever taken so have nothing else to compare it to, but this stuff is pretty great.

Actual Play-Doh does hardly stick together which makes it difficult for children to model with it. In my opinion, the air dry feature is not even a feature.

There were a number of secondary topics that are covered that are very interesting. Certainly not a substitute for a good commentary, but a worth while read.

There were a few areas where I do not completely agree with Mr. Missler on his theological views, but those differences were minor."},{"rating":"1","title":"an ok Bible primer","review":"As \\"Fun With Dick and Jane\\" type books go, this is adequate.

It is dangerous to apply the immediate gratification concept to spiritual truths. Some things need to be taken slowly."},{"rating":"1","title":"under par..","review":"I can't recomend this, 'Cliff's notes' commentary. I've read several in this vien.

Simply great. It is in a class with Lou Reed's Rock and Roll Animal and the Who's Live At Leeds, both real gems. The Airplane was pretty uneven on stage, but every song on this CD works well. They play with exceptional passion and ability. The vocals are strong and the guitar work is fluid and elegant. In particular, Jack Casady's bass never sounded more powerful or better. He really drives the band through their classic numbers and listening to his bass runs alone are worth the price of the CD. If you like the Airplane in particular, or 60's San Francisco bands in general, this is a CD that you will listen to often."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fine text","review":"This is an excellent astrological text that deserves a wider audience! It offers a good summation of contemporary astrological study on the subject of the moon and it's meaning in our lives. I found the historical introduction on the moon's place in ancient astrology a little dry, and wish the author would have developed the section on the moon phases a lot more, but the book is so fine overall that these are minor criticisms indeed!Equally impressive is the author's understanding of human nature and spirituality, as well as how practices such as meditation can bring the lunar function, in all its flux, to awareness. Those readers who are familiar with meditation, or spiritual teachings such as those of Eckhart Tolle or the Buddha will find an easier comprehension of what could be very conceptual stuff, yet be amazed that a birth-date, place and time could reveal a mirror of their intimate, and ever-changing inner world!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wolrd Champion?

The problem is that too many songs are being forced into one collection, and in order to allot for every song, most are edits.

It also doesnt explore any other facets of trance or electronic music, but stays strictly within the bounds of the epic/uplifting schme of things. It's up to you wether you like this or not. Bottom line: This is not trance as we know it today, but Trance as it was. Like it or leave it, this is what it offers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good, Not Great","review":"This CD is only good if you are into generic Trance ... or are an artistic purist that loves the Trance that can bore you or put most people to sleep. If you like upbeat, catchy, beautiful and memorable Techno/Trance tunes then this is NOT the CD for you. A couple of the tracks are really good, such as Chicane's Saltwater, Robert Mile's Children, and Veracocha's Carte Blanche. But those are available on other CD's. Better yet, just buy a Robert Mile's or Ian Van Dahl CD. Again, this is good, but not great."},{"rating":"1","title":"a dissapointment...","review":"I don't quite understand why so many people gave this CD such high marks. There are a couple of good tunes.

I've tried them all, from \\"Meltdown 2000\\" to just about every Global Underground production, and \\"Best Trance Anthems Ever\\" stands out as supreme. The CD is a mix of tracks you've no doubt heard S&D spin at Twilo, or PVD belt out over the dance floors of Ibiza, but there's also plenty of fresh material you'll be glad to discover.The mixing is brilliant, especially on disc 2. Anyone I've played this compilation to wants to steal it from my CD player. It's that good. Don't let the large price tag deter you; after listening to the entirety of disc 2 you'll say you would have paid double the price!They certainly weren't taking any liberties when they named this the BEST TRANCE ANTHEMS EVER, because it is!

I did about 2 coats on my hood scoops and so far 7 months later, after the summer heat, all the rain, the winter weather i'm currently getting, it still looks like the day i painted it.

Most of it is as current and relevent now as then. The CD is broken down in to several parts, including RELIGION AND THE SCIENTIFIC METHOD,RELIGION AND DISEASE,RELIGION AND EVOLUTION, RELIGION AND MYSTICISM. Always very polite and a bit understated, the CD begins commenting on Copernicus and Galileo, scientists contradicting the dogma of their times. Then onto Church responses to disease including 1600's Plagues, and Smallpox. The blame was put on demons and devils, not germs aor viruses. His comments on the Smallpox outbreak in 1880's Montreal are worth the price of the CD. Evolution and biology are discussed, and Russll has some interesting thoughts on mysticism. Very worthwhile in this CD format!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Several problems with this item....","review":"I bought two of these at Boaters World. There was a minor problem and a major problem.

For anyone interested in church history, this is a must-read because it focuses in on groups of people who tried their best to stick to the New Testament teaching in the midst of rampant degradation in the church. It's inspiring and sobering to read about the lives of ones who were so absolute for the practice of the pure Word of God. One can really see that no matter how dark the situation of Christianity is at any time in history, the Lord always has a remnant who will come out of the degradation and stand for His testimony in a pure way.

Well written, inspiring and heartfelt, it reads like a diary you happen to find ... except it's a celebrity diary! After reading this book, I felt that even though I had not experienced the notoriety of these people, they were just like me - flawed, scared, and struggling to find their way sometimes. I never thought I'd have something in common with Celine Dion! What a wonderful way to show how much the human spirit can endure and succeed. Can't wait for the next one."},{"rating":"2","title":"OK except for some missing text","review":"I like this book as it has a very good study in the book of Romans.the problem I have noted, especially in Chapter 7 which has 8 separate studies. When the number shows for for each of the 8studies, the subject text is all pushed to the right side and not complete,When going to the next page it starts with the Study andthe balance of the subject text never shows up. Not a real big deal, but it should be corrected."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for the serious believer!","review":"A great jewel.

It's a great story with sometimes predictable, but usually captivating outcomes. The characters really make this show worth watching though. You can't help but think Daisuke's \\"romantic\\" ways are rather cute, We all have to say that With/Wiz is really fuzzy and cute (I want one o_o), and many of us girls can't help but love the way Dark's so mysterious, suave, and flirty ^_^ All the characters have something or another likable about them. Even if you have to dig waaaay deep to find it.It gets you wondering about what really is considered \\"good\\" and when it's okay to bend the rules a couple times. (and just how far you'd go to get a date with Dark =P)Overall, DNAngel is a great story with romance, humor, and wonderfully beautiful bishonen that you begin to wish truly existed in real life... *is thrown out of the room for the bishonen comment*"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Plot...","review":"D.N Angel is captivating, leaving you to keep reading until the end. Overall, I'd say that D.N Angel isn't bad, but it isn't the best either. It has an interesting plot, that the author could do a lot with, but she doesn't really (at least not in this volume).In this volume you meet Daisuke Niwa who, on his fourteenth birthday, finds out he has to bear the family \\"curse\\" like his fore fathers. The curse is that whenever he sees his one and only love, he changes into Dark, an art theif. It's interesting and sometimes funny, but the author keeps making him change in and then back out countless times and it gets kind of old.I haven't lost faith in this manga so I think I'll keep reading the whole series. I've heard it gets better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable, even if you've seen the Anime","review":"I picked this up after watching the complete anime. It's still a lot of fun, and some fairly major differences right off the bat. In my mind that's a good thing.

So many people liked this series, I went to read it.But in my opinion, it's kind of boring. This series is mostly based on romance, but when you have romance playing such a big role, you must have depth and feeling, which this book is clearly lacking. It's just all action action action, with barely any time to think, and the plot isn't so interesting.I give it a two because the title is clever and the pictures are well drawn. And it's humorous. Kind of."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just OKAY","review":"The artwork is good, but the story is very dull. Daisuke just runs around stealing artwork and following in his families' footsteps. Then the only way he can return to his normal life and not have to steal artwork is by having his true love return his love....how many books can they make out of this story?! I expected better of the book since I heard it was a fantastic animee show. Take my advice.....don't buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A sensititive, informed, rendering on modern instruments","review":"After hearing this on the car radio I immediately bought it because, even while preoccupied with driving, I was struck by how much new insight I was being given into this very familiar music. This strikingly fresh interpretation makes the most of a modern complement of instruments (happily staying with the harpsichord but, for example, using transverse flutes instead of recorders in Concerto No. 4) to produce a richer sound than Bach might have imagined but with a sensitivity, and a fidelity to the spirit of the music, that he would surely have applauded. The sound is first-rate and the execution is all one would expect of the St. Luke's. I have several other recordings, mostly on period instruments, which I also enjoy; but this is the one I play the most these days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for beginners","review":"This is not an instructional DVD. Nor is it for beginners.The DVD bills itself as containing \\"lessons\\" from a professional guitar teacher for each song. These \\"lessons\\" consist of a little history of the song, then a VERY brief review of the tuning and chords. Then, the song is played full speed, with the tab underneath (in 2 of the 3 camera views).The song is not begun at slower speed, or broken down into sections.There is no tab booklet, or online access to the tab. It is onscreen only.If you are advanced enough with your playing to be able to play along with this DVD, I'm not sure you need the DVD. If you need more instruction to learn the songs, look elsewhere.For my level of playing (1 plus years), this DVD is pretty much useless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun with horses","review":"This is a clever little book with a British sense of humor.

Do not waste your money on this model, they may have a different logo on them, but pay attention to the way they look, their design. You can change the batteries (way too often) but there is no way to change the filter inside. Save your money try a different one. I mean completely different one.

Since our weather is good I hung it on the fence facing the dog and turned it on. I could tell that it irriated her. Her barks changed to yips but after only a few hours she had learned how far she had to go to get out of range of it. The dog is still barking but now we are dealing with the owners and a no bark collar has shown an improvement."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful soundtrack from a wonderful show","review":"As a kid growing up in the 70s I remember watching Cosmos with my father. The show, of course, was excellent but what really struck me was the beautiful soundtrack. My father purchased the LP and I recall listening to it repeatedly. In recent years I've become increasingly nostalgic and I made it my mission to obtain the Cosmos soundtrack. The problem is that I no longer own a record player and the CD is inexplicably out of print (copies fetch a premium price). Fortunately the cassette is really cheap. I'd rather have this on CD but I'm happy to have any version of the soundtrack. I'm pleased to say that my memories of the music were not tarnished by listening to it again decades later, and it is every bit as beautiful as I recall. My only disappointment is that all of my favorite tracks are on side 1 and side 2 is less memorable. Still, this is terrific music and I often play it in the background while I'm working. Why is this not currently on CD?"},{"rating":"2","title":"This song is really great","review":"Well, I actually don't have the single itself, but I wanted to commment on just \\"Out of my Head\\".

And I must admit, I did buy it for \\"The Way\\", but I soon found out that all the songs were great, and I especially loved \\"Out of my Head\\". I think it's a really wonderful alt-rock song. It's catchy and just the right length. After it became a hit, I was somewhat proud that I could say I liked it before that. And another thing is that I think it's the type of song that people who like different types of music can all enjoy. Not that the song itself is a multi-genre song. But some younger kids I know, all of whom like either groups such as Limp Bizkit or Backstreet Boys, would ask me to put in my CD so they could listen to \\"Out of my Head\\" on repeat. Pretty neat if you ask me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Song&Vocal Performance","review":"I will always say that had Michael Jackson stayed more in the \\"Human Nature\\" vibe of Music Making He would easily be headed toward being Called the Frank Sinatra of His time.MJ truly knocks this song out&just brings a Innoncence to it that just blows you away.the Vocals are top notch.His Lead&Background are CLassic MJ.this Song still is as Fresh as anything you are likely to hear now.MJ sung this Song with such Warmth but also was cool with the Overall Presentation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't fit, Aaargh!","review":"Product claims to work for doorframes at least 28\\" wide.

The essays are organized into three broad sections: The Evolution of Military Strategy and Doctrine(6 essays); Unconventional Warfare(5 essays); Conflict in the Twenty-first Century(6 essays). The editor's overarching purpose for the collection is to provide a source for post Cold-War military professionals who lack combat experience to learn vicariously. All the essays are persuasive in intent and tend to be more analytical in style than narrative, many deal with U.S. military doctrine, strategy, and operations. The book is a nod to Liddell Hart's comment on peacetime militaries that \\"in a literal sense the profession of arms is not a profession at all, but merely \`casual employment'.\\" A good source for fellow students seeking oposing views and independent ideas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"The Girl is a book definately worth reading.

My parents got pretty sick of it, but it helped me learn early on that sometimes, the best songs on a record weren't the ones you heard on the radio. (My favorite was probably \\"Head Above Water.\\") Today, looking over the personnel list, I'm shocked by the number of names I later came to recognize: Larry Fast (of Peter Gabriel's band and Synergy) on synths, G. E. Smith (SNL) on guitar, Jerry Marrotta (also of Peter Gabriel, and King Crimson) on drums. Now I have this on CD, of course, but if my memory is correct this record's two sides were labeled \\"Side 1\\" and \\"Side A,\\" so it was impossible to determine which you were supposed to play first!

Other than the wear on the footbed from body oils, last year's pair still looks almost new. I can't say enough good things about the way these sandals fit my feet and the comfort. I ordered a size 8 and I wear an 8 - 8 1/2 shoe so I would say they run true to size. I highly recommend them. (They are different from the Altamount model because the sole is less bulky and the sandals are lighter weight - otherwise basically the same)."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE THESE THONGS","review":"I LOVE these thongs. I have four pair and wear them everyday in the summer and in the winter as i live in AZ. I was never able to wear a thong because I can't tolerate anything between my toes.

One is SAE and the other is metric. I thought it was all in one. Still it is good for a travel tool kit and is good quality. Most common sizes but a little lacking on size selection. Would like one or 2 more on the small side for use in my shooting range bag (scope adjustments)."},{"rating":"2","title":"allen wrench","review":"Good product. Inexpensive, works great.

Got it to keep the screws tight on my Vapor case on my iPhone 4 and it works perfect. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple effective tool","review":"Not much to it; a set of standard & metric Allen wrenches.

One thing to think about is this cannot be used in a tight space, where an 'L' shaped wrench is needed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good to have but watch out","review":"As any good handy man knows, you need to have allen keys/hex keys whatever you want to call then, in your tool box. I bought these about a year and a half ago and the bolts that hold them together had fallen apart. After using them time after time, you have to make sure that the bolts holding these keys together are tight or they will come loose and it is very, did I mention very, very easy to lose. I repaired both sets after losing the nuts to the bolts by putting a tie wrap/zip tie through the hole where the bolt goes. Walla, problem solved, now I dont have to worry about losing they keys anymore. I do like the grip though. You just have to watch with those small bolts that hold this thing together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stanley SAE Metric Hex Key","review":"I wanted a system so I could just pick out a quick Hex easily in lieu of looking through my bag of Hex Keys.

Hope this helps."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good but not great","review":"As noted elsewhere this is two separate sets of hex keys one SAE and one metric. They have a good range of the most common sizes and, the case is nice and well built. The keys are not designedto be removed. The reason for 4 stars is that they are straight rather than right angle and so can't be used in limited space. Overall a good value and a good tool."},{"rating":"1","title":"ES MALISIMO","review":"Compre uno hace unos meses , y es fatal no hay una herramienta stanley que me allá servido es solo fama y marca , hace tiempo no compro nada de ellos , prefiero trupper , es fantástico, este juego de allen, es malisimo , se parten , se doblan , es muy grande y no entra en espacios pequeños , en fin fatal compra"},{"rating":"1","title":"Money thrown out!","review":"I bought this product based in some good reviews, but, really, it doesn't work.

I picked up a cheap Mr Coffee type system and we started using it in the Fall. I noticed we were pouring out half drank mugs of coffee and a month ago we started having coffee grounds seeping out of the basket into the pot, so I tracked down the old Hamilton Beach Brewmaster again on Amazon. Once I set it up, I noticed I was refilling my coffee cup two or three times each morning, no more dumping out half drank cups.

It turns out it was the same exact \\"Folgers half-caff\\" he drinks at home! He couldn't figure out why it tasted so much better than his and we decided it was probably their Brewstation coffee maker. So, fast forward a couple of months, I got it for him for Christmas! He love, love, LOVES his coffee brewer! In fact, we are now on our second one.

How in the world can each successive machine get worse?As other reviewers have said, the coffee doesn't come out hot enough to drink and has to be microwaved...or you have to wait half an hour until it heats up. But I can promise you you won't want to do this, because you have to wait a week just to make a pot in the first place! I've never seen a NEW coffeemaker that has to be started a hour before you want to drink the coffee.And yes, it leaks. And yes, it tastes like plastic. And no, we'll not be trying the next model.

Some people say it has a burnt taste because of the burner, but since we always make almost a full \\"pot\\", it hasn't ever been a problem. About a year ago, it seemed to be dying on us, but it was just clogged from the minerals in our water and after running vinegar through it a few times, it was good as new.

No problems with the dispensing or leaking as noted in other reviews, the dispenser is speedy and fun. Coffee is actually hotter than my old Mr. Coffee and when I finally get to it 45 mins after it's brewed it's still hotter!

Recently while cleaning it I dropped the filter basket and cracked it. (The actual previous one had additional buttons to adjust the flavor intensity and to make a 4 cup pot.)

Also you have to submerge it & weight it down while jamming something into the spout to keep it open where the coffee flows out to clean it.Yes, it still works after two years, but you have to remove the hot grinds and then pour from the reservoir to get a cup of coffee.

The timer is awesome, and the coffee stays hot for a long time. The automatic safety shut-off timer has come in quite handy on more than one occasion for me. Extremely easy to operate, and I love that it doesn't require specialty coffee filters in it. It is a little awkward to fill with the water and I tend to spill, but that may just be user error. The one thing I wish, is that it was just about a quarter inch taller at the cup fill area, because travel mugs are just a touch too tall to stand in there straight; you need to angle them, which means less coffee in the cup!

I was glad to not have a glass carafe to deal with (and break)... that is until I tasted the coffee from the Brewmaster if it had been in the coffeemaker more than 1 - 2 hours.Because the brewed coffee is housed in a plastic compartment (as opposed to glass), the hot beverage seemed to take on the taste of the heated plastic from the coffee maker. Over time, it got worse.This would be a great product if the unit had an inert material as the liner for the coffee compartment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes the best coffee yet","review":"Bought this coffeemaker because our friends had one and their coffee tasted a lot better than ours.

I used a stiff brush.After a while, it started leaking into the insides by the heating element.Soon after that, the rubber gasket fell off and leaked coffee all over my counter and floor.I really enjoyed the carafe-less maker, but like so may others, this is a disposable product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak coffee, poor design.","review":"The brew basket is too shallow, and has too many holes, leading to a too swift brew time that cannot be overcome by pressing the button that is supposed to make stronger coffee.

Horrid product, just horrid."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY-Spend the money for the Brewstation Deluxe Instead!!","review":"This is really the hardest coffee pot to pour water into the reserviour, not lying whatsoever. It also gives the coffee a plastic taste to it and that can't be good for your body at all. I don't know how people actually like this brewstation. Spend a little extra and get yourself the Brewstation Deluxe. I had one for 5 years and then it started leaking BUT 5 years is pretty good for a coffee maker that got daily use, sometimes 2 times a day I think. I decided to save some money here and downgrade, worse decision ever. Not only did this one horribly stink, I have now wasted money on return shipping. I will be purchasing another Brewstation Deluxe, the one that comes with the permanent filter. They sell a $50 one that uses throw away filters also."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works like a charm","review":"We purchased this as a replacement for a regular coffeemaker with a glass carafe. The coffee stays very hot throughout the entire two hour holding period and it helps the coffee retain its flavor.

The footprint is slightly smaller than a traditional coffee machine and it looks very nice on the countertop.

But coffee from this machine has never been disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does the job - looks good on the counter.","review":"My old white coffee maker w/ glass carafe finally died an it was time for a new one. This one gets the job done. Makes a good pot of coffee, and keeps it warm with minimal evaporation. The only downsides are the buttons are plastic and look a little cheap. And the coffee tank has the stainless front which is very prone to water spots and finger prints when cleaning. Otherwise this is a great product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"Another piece of junk that doesn't last 6 mos. Nice concept but apparently the gasket comes loose and you have a complete mess all over your counter.

A little bit of better planning on the manufacturers part would make a big difference. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Taste of Plastic","review":"I cleaned the new coffee maker four times buy running white vinegar and hot water through it. Coffee tasted and smelled like plastic. I guess I should have expected that since the coffee container is entirely made of plastic; not glass like the pot I use to use.Also, the clock on the maker has a bright!! green background. It is brighter than a night light. I swear there were planes circling the house looking for the runway until I unplugged the coffee maker.Well, it went back. Black tape would have fixed the night light but who wants plastic tasting coffee?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy something else!","review":"This coffee pot is the worst design ever:-Water is added in the top at the back of the machine so there is no way to use this under the cabinets.-After the unit is filled and ready to start brewing, there is no easy way to slide the unit back because of the rubber feet on the bottom. So now you have to pick up the big bulky unit and hope you don't make a mess.-The coffee level window is obscured by condensation so you have to guess at how many cups are remaining.- When you open the top to remove the used coffee grounds, hot condensation often falls on your hands.-Making more than 10 cups of coffee will cause the grounds to \\"splash up\\" and get all over the top of the lid, into the fresh water tank. The tank and lid are connected to the electronics and not removable. There is no easy way to clean them.Over 6 cups of coffee and it produces a weak flavor.My recommendation...buy something else!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I have returned this model to HB twice - still not happy","review":"Let me add my review to the others stating that every single one I have had leaks. For a $50 coffee maker, I hoped this would be the one. I loved it when it was new. Not long after, I found that it leaked from under the dispense button, all over the place. I got HB to replace it under warranty, several months later, same problem. Ditto, third machine, here we go again. This would have been my favorite.I came here to see if anyone else has recommendations for a solid coffee maker WITH a timer, that has held up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great coffee maker for one year!","review":"I thought this coffee maker was the greatest. Yes, it had some flaws, but overall we loved it. (Pouring water into the reservoir in the back of it can be a little tricky and some often ends up on your counter) I have it just over one year and there is a leak inside from the tank where the coffee is deposited after brewing. What a mess this produces. It's a shame that this product had such a short life. I would not recommend it on this basis."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Yet!","review":"We are coffee connoisseurs, (in our minds, at least!)Having used many types of coffee makers, we have been delighted with this model. I read the reviews before buying it, but it was on such a great sale , $29.99, that I had to try it. I will reiterate that it is imperative to run water/white vinegar, through maybe, 5 or so cycles, before you attempt to drink it, lest you get a horrible plasticky/oily-parts taste. After that, it has been amazing. I love the auto shut-off. I love the programmable feature, easy to clean, and NO DRIPPING! We love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Turns off automatically after one cup.","review":"My Brewmaster makes great coffee and we enjoyed it for three months but is now a total nuisance to use. It turns off automatically after one cup. You have to keep hitting the \\"on\\" button again and you can imagine how frustrating that is. Customer service said it was out of warranty.I wouldn't buy another Hamilton Beach product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaks Leaks and More Leaks","review":"I really thought this was the perfect product. I especially loved the idea of having no carafe. However, after having this product for about 3 months, I started to notice that it would leak...occasionally. Now it leaks every time I try to use it. I would not recommend anyone get this product. Although the concept is nice, the problems aren't worth the hassle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great coffee.","review":"Nice coffee maker. Only negative is it is hard to see how much water or coffee is in the the liquid container, marks and window too dark. Reservoir hard to fill , narrow since they put the clock on top instead of bottom like older models."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could not relate, did not help","review":"The first chapter described almost exactly how I feel when I fly. However, in the very next chapter, the character(who like me was terrified to fly), was suddenly obsessed with becoming a pilot! WHAT? I could NOT relate, infact, it was such an absurd and extraordiary jump that I couldn't even finish the book. I needed facts and tools, not an unrealistic story. I also purcased \\"Flying Without Fear\\" and that book is exactly what I needed."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book has wings.","review":"The main character (Mark) finds the miracle of flight and friendship while conquering fear through achievement. Quirky and sometimes mysterious characters help keep it rolling down the runway - A wise mentor named Dan; A spontaneous pilot named Rich; An old dog named Jetlag; A parrot named Howie; And the airstrip's (Dreamland) owner, an elderly woman named Amelia. As a child I'd dreamt of flying like a bird and this book sinks its talons into your flesh and carries you skyward. An easy read with the reward of a glimpse into the wonderful world of flying and our hero\`s view of life. I bought the book for a flight to Vegas. I ended up dehydrated as I couldn't put it down to take a sip of water! I've discovered my wings."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is not a toy","review":"The three prong holder is a great tool to work with.

I still love this book and it is one of my all time favourites. The ability of being able to tell stories from a diverse amount of points of view is hard to attain and Lewis does it effortlessly. Read it, no matter your age, everyone can relate to something."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too simplistic","review":"I was a bit disappointed in this book-it was written as if Israeli children were writing letters to American students. I felt like it was talking down to the kids. It does cover some important information and for younger children it may be very good, but does not meet my needs in teaching to the intermediate students. The photos are in black and white and it has illustrations. I did like some of the activities included in the book which I may use with the 10-12 year olds. Also, the book was published in 1978 and a lot has changed since then, making some of the information on current day life incorrect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Neck Tie Review","review":"The product arrived on time and was professionally packaged. Great quality. The occasion for which it was purchased was for an International Day Celebration. My husband is still wearing it past the occasion for which it was purchased."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"deceit\\"","review":"Evolution theory is a respectable and well-established theory, and though it is scientifically allowed to question it, it is unreasonable to claim \\"deceit\\" in it.What are the credentials of Harun Yahya? I dug up his autobiography (autohagiography?). He attended university but has no diploma. He has been in a psychiatric hospital. Was arrested for possession of drugs (and NOT for telling the truth). He is an autodidact (that is, he read books of his own choice). His autobio reads like one of these long complaint letters written by insane people about conspiracies led by their neighbours, aliens from Mars & the Elders of Zion.H.Y. and the enthousiastic reviewers of this book may be suspected of deceit themselves. Take e.g. the reviewer \\"A reader from NY USA\\", claiming to be a microbiologist. Look at the systematic spelling errors. Would a real microbiologist make such gross mistakes? H.Y. and his supporters use deceit themselves to advance their cause. Does the goal justify the means?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit of a one sided rant...","review":"I'm not an expert on the subject so I can't really comment on how acurate the information is, but my gut reaction is that it's very one sided. About half the book is taken up with information on Islam, and when the author IS discussing creation/evolution he implies that every evolutionist is out to trick the general public, and is knowingly involved in an intricate plot to dishonour God."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant!","review":"This book is simply fantastic. It breaks the theory of evolution into a million pieces, with very good scientific and logical evidences. After reading this book, let me asure you (unless you are totally ignorant!), that you will no longer even be able to comprehend why, anybody with 1 brain cell or more will still believe in evolution. All the scientific proof, that i have been spoon fed, throughout my life has been totally and clearly disproved by the author. **Also NOTE** The Turkish government (who stongly oppose the belief of god, and only approve of the prevailing of ignorance), have arrested the author Harun Yahya, since the publication of this book which has brought many poeple into a more clear light. Seems to me, if you speak the clear truth, you end up in prison(without trial!). I encourage all people who would like to live life with the truth, read this book and see for yourself the beauty of truth!"},{"rating":"1","title":"a ridiculous book to please the ignorant","review":"This book is ridiculous and completely nonsense.

The fact that Darwin did not publishhis Origins for 20 years because he had to think hardabout the revolutionary idea, and come up with weaknessesin his ideas is twisted by Harun to trivialize Darwin'smental abilities.Harun's quoting from scientists are all out of context,and he takes great pleasure to fish out the singlesentence from some scientists work which has a hint ofdoubt regarding the validity of evolution. As a responsiblewriter, he should quote in context by quoting the entirepassage or not quote at all.Reading this book is frustrating and annoying.Please do not buy it...if you really want answers,get 'The Blind Watchmaker' by Dawkins, and you will bepleasantly enlightened."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't know the Prophet had a PhD in biology. I stand corrected.","review":"No rational argument will have a rational effect on a man who does not want to adopt a rational attitude.Hallucinatory bilge beyond redemption.

Bet is on Salafist petro-dollars from the Gulf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pandering to the uneducated","review":"This book is horrible. Even as a work of fiction (which it most certainly is) it fails. I am a Christian and a PhD neurobiologist. Lying about the well evidenced theory of evolution only makes us believers look foolish and deceptive. How anybody with any sort of background (take our MD/PhD reviewer...please) in biology could find this \\"book\\" compelling is beyond me. Yahya demonstrates absolutely no knowledge of his subject matter. In fact, his glaring ignorance is perhaps the only thing that prevents me from calling this book an intentional act of deception. AHA! Now I get it. This IS an intentional act of deception. The title isn't actually referring to evolution as being a deceit, but rather the contents of Yahya's book are the deceit. How clever! Unfortunately, this irony will probably be lost on the majority of its readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"sloppy work","review":"this book canot be taken seriously. It's references are very selective, the author misrepresents a lot of evolutionary theory, he hasn;t realy updated his evolutionary theory since 1980s. Baseless crap really. Full of \\"slogan\\" words.To read for a light nobrainer this is your book. But it screams propaganda to me, which is a shame because I was looking for a book that would give me an Islamic point of view against evolution but this is definetly NOT it. Karen Armstrong with her History of God book is WAY ahead of this guy's blanket bias."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Holocaust Hoax","review":"The blurb on the back of the book lists other works by the author, one of these is entitled 'The Holocaust Hoax'. My presumption from this is that the author is clearly skilled at distorting facts and this makes me very skeptical about accepting any seemingly fact based statements made in the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent resource","review":"No other XML book gets such a good balance between depth and readability.

The errors some times are deeper than mere typographical errors, e.g. void member methods later on called with the expectation to return a rather complicated Tree object etc. Too bad, because together with the attempt to use standard design patterns in java code dealing with XML, it could have been indeed an excellent book."},{"rating":"1","title":"How not to write a book.","review":"I read this book about this over hyped technology as XML.

Not quite on the level of Sweet Dreams, it nevertheless contains brilliant songs like the atmospheric Here Comes The Rain Again with its evocative lyric, the compelling Right By Your Side with its riveting reggae beat and the soulful Who's That Girl. The arrangements are innovative throughout and lend merit even to the lesser songs like Regrets with its frisky trumpets. Another favorite of mine is Paint A Rumour with its skittering beat and subtle synth flourishes - it really grows on you. On Touch, Eurythmics consolidated the sound they introduced on Sweet Dreams, before they veered off into new directions with 1985's Be Yourself Tonight and the following year's Revenge. It remains a synth-pop classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"College memories","review":"Listening to this Touch CD really brings back great memories. My favorite is the \\"Right by your side\\" track. Brings back memories of some college buddies and I dancing all over the floor in our living room grooving to the beat. We were so carefree. I also love the \\"Regrets\\" track. Let me tell you, you will have NO regrets purchasing this CD. There is not one song on here that is not great listening....."},{"rating":"2","title":"TOUCH","review":"Eurythmics' third album,Touch, produced 3 hits (here comes the rain again, whos that girl?, and right by your side) but the whole album is a minor disapointment compared to \\"Sweet Dreams (are made of this)\\" or \\"Revenge\\". It strugles to produce a song that sticks in your head. The only other song, I think is good, is \\"No fear, No hate, No pain, No broken hearts\\" but the albums cover is very strong and stands by itself.I feel its an alright album but buy it anyways, you might regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Album is Result of Drug-Induced Psychosis","review":"Although I like Lennox's later solo work, this album sounds as if Dave and Annie were wasted on illegal drugs, which they were known to do alot of. The song \\"No Fear\\" is about sticking a heroin needle in your arm so you don't have to feel any pain. Not something I really want to listen to since I can't relate. This isn't art speaking on this album- it's the drugs. Most of their albums sound like this except for the later solo works by Lennox. I'm giving it 0 stars because I don't believe that Dave and Annie, former druggies, should be commended and respected for their psychotic hallucinations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Communist Censorship By this site","review":"I wrote a review for this album and others and it seems every time I say something that's really true I get censored by this site and they don't post the review. I no longer want any association with these idiots. I think they should move to a communist country. I said this album was a product of a drug induced psychosis because Dave and Annie are druggies. I'm not writing reviews to make Amazon happy. Anyway, the album I said isn't real art because they were on drugs when they wrote it or they wrote it about drugs on the song \\"No Fear\\" and Dave and Annie were well known for their drug use during this time- but thanks to censorship by Amazon all of the reviews have to sound the same because the truth might upset their whimpy a@#es and all the fat, ugly, white-trash amerikkkans."},{"rating":"2","title":"4 and a half stars","review":"I loved this book. It's entertaining, frightening as hell and beautifully-written. The first chapter grabs you, then doesn't let go. I got hooked by this compelling cast of characters and the interesting story. Fun novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"DOWN TO THE DETAIL","review":"This is a gripping thriller of the highest order and a very original concept! It's a bit out there, but the author handles it like a skilled surgeon and you go for the ride happily holding on for all you're worth. This is at times terrifying, at times moving and overall excellent. With all the other so-called best sellers out there churning out garbage year after year, it's nice to see a new and original voice in the genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Surprises, Unfortunately","review":"The writer is decent, and not a bad book if you're completely out of other things to read. It's a formula. I knew the murderer right away, thus the rest of the book was just trying to get a hint as to why the person was staging these elaborate murders. The author takes (drags) you through chapter after chapter, only to give you a reason that is so tired and predictable that it made me what to toss the book in the trash when it finally reached the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"what a storm!","review":"When THE BREATHTAKER focuses on Police Chief Grover's forensic investigation & tornadoes, the story sings.

Reading this book did have one benefit, however: it makes the good books look even better."},{"rating":"1","title":"...","review":"its horrible, the characters are corny and sterotypical..she lacks any all research to this book even remotely believeable.. I've chased storms for years, Twister was more accurate than this.. I've read books for years too and she sucks when it comes to evidence collection and anything else.. The mistakes were so numerous that you could hardly get through the book, it was so unreal and unbelievable that you almost had to laugh at how stupid it was.... Warner books should be ashamed and embarrassed to think they could trick the public with hype to cover up a horrible horrible book.. This should have never been published at all...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many pages","review":"When you read a book that could be written in half pages its original size it's a waste of time reading it. The main plot -if you can find it - is fairly good. At the book's end you'll find many loose ends in the family plot as well as the main plot. If you don't have anything else to read as some times happen read this one otherwise I don't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"You have got to be kidding me","review":"The writer took a great idea and destroyed it. In a story that is so unbelievable its funny. Her weather and crime scene knowledge and research is non existant. This book is so far out there its not believable at all. She writes in characters into this book that leave you wondering just what their purpose is. This is 1st grade story telling at best. Nothing is tied together and the way this book jumps around its impossible to form a picture in your head. I could barely finish this book it was so horrible. What she did to this book is criminal and whomever at Warner books approved the publishing of this book should be fired. To say a book like this is great is a slap in the face to all the great authors out there like Patricia Cornwell, Iris Johansen, Kay Hooper, Dean Koonz etc. Don't lower your standards.Pass this one up, its not worth the paper its written on."},{"rating":"1","title":"It will give you a toothache","review":"A serial killer who pulls teeth and strikes only during a tornado?

Bravo!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good premise but poorly done","review":"The plot has a lot of potential, but I found the piece poorly done. Limited character development, weak descriptions, and a plot that felt incomplete made this work disappointing. I feel the author would benefit from reading a higher quality literature for helpful examples in future writings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Thriller","review":"With the premise of a killer savagely murdering people in the wake of a tornado The Breathtaker was an interesting thriller of a book!Yes, in theory this might not be realistic, however when I read books most of the time I put normal day logistics aside & just sit down and emerse myself in the story. And this story I enjoyed! It had me on the edge of my seat wondering what would happen next, who was the killer. It gave me goosebumps picturing the gruesome murders that were taking place. I even found myself liking the characters and caring about what would happen with them.If you enjoy suspense or thrillers, I'd recommend this book to you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Serial Killer + Twister = Exciting!","review":"I really enjoyed the premise of this murder mystery (a mash-up of a standard serial killer story and the drama of the movieTwister). Blanchard's plot was well drawn-out with plenty of suspense and tension - and even the killer's identity surprised me! Blanchard included some pretty intense gore and rather grotesque images, but it worked well within the framework of violence from both nature and man. I liked this melding story a lot - and I was intrigued enough to buy one of her other mysteries,Darkness Peering. I am curious to see how it will be!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Okay","review":"There were good things about this book, and there were bad things. First of all, I found it very distracting that all of the characters were motherless. Every one of them. Was there a point to that? I don't think so, I think it was just bad character development. Too many of the characters were the same, the former football player cops, the child abuse suffered by more than one character. It also didn't ring true that Charlie would be so quick to forgive his father for the abuse he suffered.I thought the murders and the mystery were interesting, and quite frightening, Alice Blanchard did a good job with that. But all in all, not a great book, I'm not even sure I would recommend it to friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"singular and strong","review":"Despite the abundance of new folk music this release defines its own space without undue comparisons. Ane has a fine voice and combined with the sensitive arrangements and tasteful production makes this an essential album if you own anything by Suzanne Vega, Emiliana Torrini, Tracy Chapman or Feist. I hope that we hear much more from Ane Brun in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"A high at the beginning, but mostly lows","review":"I enthusiastically purchased the CD after hearing the first song, TO LET MYSELF GO on a music blog. That song is incredible, despite the limited lyrics. However the rest of the album made me drowsy, and never did much to hold my attention. I imagine she is captivating live, and her music is well built for small clubs, in basements, with entrances in the alley, but it doesn't hold an album together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fact or Fishy DVD Game","review":"i thoroughly enjoy this game! it is fun, and sometimes, when i play it with my grandparents, they are absolutely amazed at how much information i know about sponge bob! if you don't have this game, i recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"fun with the family","review":"We have really enjoyed the Fact or Fishy Game.

It seems to be a common theme with trendy directors to belittle the achievements of previous generations and make pointless comparisons with modern attitudes. Having seen the classic 1939 version, whose attitidues seem laughable \\"dervishes and fuzzy wuzzies\\" by modern politically correct standards, this film really plummets the depths of hopelessness. The 1939 film culminates in the massacre of Omdurman, a British Victory, this one in the British defeat at Abou Clea, a fact that makes you wonder about the relative motivations of the different directors. While the battle scenes are reasonably well done, the jumps in the film don't really work - from the Desert to Southern England in a flash leaves you with a sense of being unfullfilled. The directors attempts at explaining this (and his obvious anti-British sentiments) are pathetic in the extreme, but then bashing the brits seems to be a modern participant sport for those with a chip on thier shoulders."},{"rating":"1","title":"Politically Incorrect","review":"This remake of a classic film is an abomination. Supposedly, thethrust of the changes was to remove \\"racist elements.\\" I have watched the original many times, and I don't see any racist elements, unless you consider the depiction of Africans kicking the ... out of the British Army to be racist. In the remake, a mysterious black bodybuilder guides Harry Faversham step by step through his odyssey. The Ralph Richardson character is reduced to a screaming idiot. Please, watch the original and throw this one in the roundfile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible remake","review":"This is a terrible remake of the two previous movies. I would recommend either one over this waste of film.This movie followed the typical Hollywood formula of romance and violence rather than telling a story. Romance to attract the women and violence & a little sex for the men. The story line was lost in in the emphasis on romance & violence. Characters were not developed. The movie jumped around and left a lot to the watchers imagination.I walked away from the movie with a bad taste in my mouth and wondered why I had wasted my time watching it.

It's a movie with no msg at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Potential, lousy plot","review":"Wonderful cinematography, costumes, settings and locations but a poor and senseless plot.The battlefield \\"tactics\\" are absurd, if there was one thing that the British knew how to execute, it was the square.

Good talent wasted on an awful plot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry, you're horrible","review":"the story could have been dramatically heart wrenching if it weren't quite so vague on certain points (\\"i was scared\\" mmmmkay...), the characters had so much potential to be people you couldn't help but empathize with, and plot was somewhat unpredictable. But Kate Hudson's acting was a nice try but she belongs much better in ditzy comedies. Heath Ledger just didn't really seem to have the \\"air\\" or dogged determination of a military man. Wes Bently really steals the show here, giving a powerful performance of a man with everything and yet nothing. the relationship between Kris Marshall's and Michael Sheen's characters is touching and Michael Sheen gives a good run as the funny man with a temper and real heart...it was a decent movie but could have been better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than 39","review":"This was an excellent film. The more modern special effects were excellent and the slight changes to the story line were improvements. There will always be loyal fans of the 1939 version and I count myself among them but you must give Heath Ledger credit for being able to carryout the part made famous by Ralph Richardson."},{"rating":"1","title":"Faithful to its source; just not very entertaining","review":"Well, at least the movie is faithful to its source in its spirit. Based on a book written on 1902, it's nostalgia of the British empire belongs to that era. The plot deals with a soldier who is expelled from his regiment for refusing to go to fight a colonial war in Sudan because of his impending marriage. Not only his colleagues regard him now as a coward, but also his future wife. He had no choice then but to go to war to prove he is a real man and not a coward. The filmmakers try nothing in terms to bring the material up to date, to our more contemporary (and one hopes, more enlightened) attitudes. There's no post colonial guilt here whatsoever. In some ways, this speaks well of the filmmakers in terms of not trying to tamper with the original material; in another way, it is a bit shocking seeing such jingoism in a contemporary movie. All of this wouldn't matter much if the movie was entertaining; unfortunately, it is only intermittently so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic","review":"Four Feathers is one of the worst remakes of a classic film ever and I regret the time and money wasted viewing it. This version, by director Shekhar Kapur, not only lacks character, it virtually lacks a storyline for anyone not familiar with the history of the period,much of which is discreetly missed or misrepresented, anyway.The remake is even more pathetic given the availability of the technical advances in movie-making since the 1939 version, but possibly not advances in actors. As for the actors themselves, there wasn't much there and Kate Hudson was almost embarrassing to watch with her phony accent and complete inability to act.Contributing the movie's failure could also be Kapur's long-winded style of directing.I highly recommend the original, The Four Feathers (1939)."},{"rating":"2","title":"a favorite","review":"I got this and Zulu for my husband for a belated birthday, I had been looking for them for awhile, they are now his most watched movies...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Four Feathers is the best!","review":"Four Feathers was a nice surprise-we just kind of found it on the video rental shelf and had never heard anything about it. It is clean-no swearing, no sex (one scene it is intimated, but not really shown), and the violence is not gory/bloody in the extreme. The story line is very well done and a good example of heroism at work. I highly recommend it to both men and women-you won't be sorry you saw this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A very underrated film","review":"The Four Feathers is a very underated film in that it shows the Victorian era of the British empire something that isn't protrayed often by hollywood. The acting is so-so which all the other reviewers will agree with but the story is first rate. Maybe if more established actors had taken up this project or a different director the outcome would have been better. The story is solid and some of the scene's are sort of uplifting in the sense of the courage that is protrayed. I enjoyed the film for the same reasons i enjoyed braveheart or black hawk down for the courage that was protrayed. A film that anyone who enjoyed them must consider viewing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but a little different from the 1977 Version","review":"Entertaining to watch, but a little disappointed in the character development. I enjoyed the 1977 version, for whats its worth, but this version is good, and well worth buying!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Faversham as Wimp","review":"Nice costumes, pretty scenery and a brief, although well choreographed, desert battle scene are inadequate compensation for poor acting, silly dialogue and a painfully slow start that plague an interminable film with a conspicuously thin plot.Purists will also object to the fact that this current effort obscures the important reason, made plain in the Mason novel and the wonderful 1939 Korda version, for Faversham's apparent act of cowardice. It is not fear, itself, which motivates him to resign his commission but rather the fear of being afraid, of being unable to meet the lofty expectations of a family with strong military traditions.Heath Ledgers' snivelling portrayal, silly hair and floundering accent contribute to the comic aspects of this profoundly unsatisfying work."},{"rating":"2","title":"OUTSTANDING! Uh, does anyone remember what HONOR means?","review":"Okay, I'm not gonna give away the ending, but know this, the four feathers are the trophies of cowardice given to the finest soldier in the regiment. He's given them because he quits the regiment when he hears that they're being sent to the Sudan. Each feather is from a single person, and each feather carries with it a story throughout the entire movie-not unlike the feather motif found in Forrest Gump. I found this to be an extemely good movie. I was not dissatisfied in anyway, and my only thought after seeing it was \\"WOW! I hope I can write a story like that someday!\\" In the end, this story isn't so much about courage as it is the common honor associated with real acts of selfless courage. It's something we don't recognize in everyday life anymore, but it is still there, and the one soldier's speech at the end of the movie summed it up for me very well! GO SEE THIS MOVIE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Slower than a Paralyzed Mollusc","review":"An astonishing mix of great and terrible photography. Painfully slow moving.

Wes Bentley's character is uninspired and particularly hard to relate to.

This one is ponderous, slow, and undercooked. It contains one good battle scene, plunked in the middle, which is surrounded on both sides by an extremely plodding story of redemption. Even the exciting battle scene is undermined by the film's insistence on casting its slow-mo eye on the superfluous.1939's FOUR FEATHERS comes highly recommended and this one hasn't scared me off of it, but it certainly caused me to lower my expectations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Politically correct garbage.","review":"This film is another Hollywood attempt at historical revisionism (this time to a fictional work). I walked out 2/3 the way through the film. The only people it will appeal to are the [crusaders] marching in the streets in protest of the war on terrorism. Just be thankful that Martin Sheen or Susan Sarandon were not in the picture.A far superior version of the Four Feathers, though made on a much smaller budget, was the TV version starring Jane Seymour and Beau Bridges.Anyone who wants to see a quality \\"historical war film\\" ahould purchase Zulu,Gettysburg, or, better yet, wait for the DVD version of \\"Gods and Generals\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Four Feathers Fails","review":"This version of Four Feathers can't even be compared with the original produced in 1939.

It was \\"too preachy\\" about the faults of \\"the white man's burden\\" and the British empire. If they wished to get into this subject, they should have given some backround of why the British were in the Sudan. The movie was very diconnected as far as how the individuals got from one point to the other. The service dress of the troops in the desert was tan not the red red dress parade.IF YOU WISH TO SEE THE MOVIE, RENT THE ORIGINAL!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"THE FOURFEATHERS--VERY DISAPPOINTED","review":"This version is the weakest of the threeI have seen. I own the 1939 and 1978 versions. The acting is good, but the screenplay is a bust--too superficial in dealing with the basic theme of cowardice and redemption. Also,having HeathLedger walk among the rebel Sudanese poorly disguised detracts from his effectiveness.The best of the three versions is still the 1939(a great year for great movies!). The plot/screenplay are more true to the arrogant/colonial mood of the day and the acting by Sir Ralph Richardson, John Clements, and C. Aubrey Smith are as yet unmatched. Clements' disguise is more credible, and the battle scenes more realistic. The 1939 version has it hands down, and the directing/screenwriting of the 2002 version are misguided. This could have been a great remake, but is tepid, shallow and falls far short of the mark."},{"rating":"1","title":"God Awful","review":"Went to see this one thinking that the director of Elizabeth couldn't fail. Wrongo buddy. I think this might be the worst film I have seen this year (haven't seen many though, so forgive me if I'm leaving out something worse). Characters are not flat, they are non-existent. The plot has enormous gaps. The clincher was when a character who goes blind recognizes Heath Ledger by feeling his face. Absolutely ridiculous. This movie thoroughly depressed me because of the waste - of time, of money, of talent. Truly tragic."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my Favorite movies","review":"This is a awesome movie about loyalty,friendship,courage and love.

But because it is a Heath Ledger flick - I had to rent it and see for myself. I ended up really liking it...to the point I knew I would have to add it to my dvd collection. On the strength of Heath's performance alone, I can recommend this film. His character goes through so much to find himself and by the end of the film - he's a different man. To watch Heath go through this transformation is pretty amazing. Would definately recommend it - Heath you are missed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Video Quality","review":"This is not a review of the show but of this DVD release. Bandai Visual USA essentially put zero effort into this \\"remastered\\" three disc-set.There is a thick white line that always runs down the entire left side of the frame and there's a thin white line that sometimes runs down the right side of the frame. There's constant video noise that mars the image (not film grain, mind you, just video noise). Worst of all is the near constant frame judder. The video jumps constantly and almost never stops moving. It's extraordinarily distracting.To sum it up, this release has the quality of a bootleg at best - only it's priced ridiculously high instead.

I'm known for having horrendous handwriting, but it's still quite accurate and fast.With the backlight you can use it in the dark, which is great for night flights, hotels at night when you can't find the lightswitch, etc.It's also significantly cheaper than comparable devices, expandable, and the colors are a nice change from all the bland office equipment out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch out with Handspring Visor Deluxe","review":"Cool colors, cool price (compared to Palm products), but WATCH OUT with the Handspring Visor deluxe...

The production values, acting and story were all quite wonderful with one exception: the costuming of Mr. Ellis was quite horrible. Although probably historically accurate, the plaid suit, bow ties and round crowned hats were less that flattering, and gave him the look of a 10 year old school boy. As the major love interest and hero of the story, a more mature look was essential to his characterization.

A worn-out and on-the-skids Morgan Freeman teams up with Judd to offer his assistance and as cloudy as he may seem, his help is very critical to the defense of her husband. This movie is a great drama with thriller-like moments that kept me interested. Ever since seeing Morgan Freeman in Shawshank Redemption, I've come to have a high regard for him and this movie didn't let me down.

When my package arrived from Amazon.com I disappeared upstairs to my bedroom and prepared to be spirited away to some deserted stretch of wild ocean. Yet it would take a mind with a much greater imagination than mine to believe even for a moment that the sounds on this CD bear any relation to anything found in nature. The sounds of surf are synthetic and artificial, an undifferentiated hiss and roar, comparable to someone blowing on a microphone. I couldn't recommend this to anyone, and doubt if I'll be buying any more of the 'Sounds of Nature' series anytime soon. Darn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning!

When it started up, the pounding of the surf was wonderful. And then...the seagull started. The bird cries seem to be dubbed over the ocean due to their startling clarity. Plus the bird was obviously perched on top of the microphone because it was so loud. No dopler effects from distances, no multiple calls, just a single bird. And the bird keeps jumping from side to side (left speaker to right and then back). Perhaps other birds join in later but I didn't bother waiting to find out. The purpose of the CD was to drown out office noise and allow me to concentrate. Instead I found myself flinching everytime a bird call came. The earphones came off and the CD is gone.

About forty minutes into it, my husband turned to me and said, \\"Have you understood anything that has happened so far?\\" to which I replied, \\"Not really...\\" He got up and found something else to do, I stuck it out. The second to the last scene, when the blind old master sings his last song, is worth sitting through everything that comes before--if you are also the kind of person who enjoys gifts like the set of Chinese boxes where every box contains yet another, or delving into e.e. cummings' Anyone Lived In A Pretty How Town...

On the other hand, other than views of awesome expanses of northwest China that appear from time to time, there is nothing to hold the attention in this movie.

I kept waiting to see some relaxation reactions from the horse Mr. Scott is massaging and saw very little at all. Joy, who assists him in this DVD, is more interesting and knowledgeable than Mr. Scott seems to be. I would like to see her version of this type of DVD! Also, there's too much babble regarding muscle and attachment names. After awhile, it puts you to sleep and makes the whole concept attempting to be conveyed very tedious and mind-numbing.

The author is said to be popular in Germany, but, then again, so is David Haselhoff. The book is slight. Indeed, the title and epigraphs bear little or no relation to the book's content. Except for Lila, the characters are like the cardboard cut-outs in the Steve Martin movie The Lonely Guy, to which the book bears some resemblance. The writing is breezy and unpretentious, but there are many bad metaphors and random acts of introspection reminiscent of the Barbara Streisand movie The Mirror Has Two Faces, to which the book bears some resemblance (notably the poetry reading at the end). Some good things about the book: Its length and the brevity of the chapters. The end of the book is pure hokum and utterly predictable."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Complete Waste of Time","review":"I started this book about 6 months ago and never finished but I started reading it on a recent vacation and unfortunately had nothing else to read so I finished it. Lila, the supposed-heroine of the book is the most annoying and selfish character I have read lately. The rest of the characters were no better and seemed so stereo-typical and boring. I think the whole story was completely illogical, especially how she had never been in love yet but when she gets married she turns into a co-dependent and pathetic excuse for a woman who then is supposed to be this nationally acclaimed poet who seems like nothing but a shallow 30-sometihng who sleeps around. Plus the characterization of her family is completely ridiculous; I know of no one whose own family is that insensitive. The whole story was so trite and so predictable. I wish I would have read all of the reviews before I bought this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"Having enjoyed some of the author's previous novels, I found Pure Poetry to be very disappointing. The story centers around the main character who is incredibly annoying and doesn't seem to ever get it. She is not likable, nor is she even interesting. When the reader does not care one whit about what happens to the main character in a character-driven novel lacking any cohesive plot, the result is a mess.I recommend A Disturbance in One Place instead; that is a much more enjoyable read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"What a disappointment, while there is faint whale song in the background mostly what you hear is water.

I especially like the soft mallets, which bring out the more resonant characteristics of the instrument for slow legato playing (i.e. rolling out four note chords). There is one flaw, and that is that the mallets are heavier than most standard marimba mallets. I have found, however, that the heavy weight of the mallet has greatly improved my finger and wrist strength when playing four mallet marimba literature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cassette Was In Horrible Shape","review":"I received this cassette within a few days of ordering it.

Ms Paltrow is excellent, as usual."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brilliant book dumbed down for film","review":"The book, Possession by A.S. Byatt, was one of the best novels I have read in years. Unfortunately, all of the themes that make it a wonderful novel - feminism, the expectations of society, British reserve, a woman's struggle between love and work, and much more - do not translate well to a movie, and of course don't appeal at all to the modern American moviegoer. The story lines were \\"dumbed down\\" to fit the just-under-2-hours pace of a movie, ignoring all of the subtleties that made these characters believable in print.Gwyneth Paltrow and Aaron Eckhart have no chemistry between them, and that only underscored the fact that their \\"struggle\\" to stay away from each other was poorly written in the film. Jeremy Northam and Jennifer Ehle do sizzle, and made up the only watchable parts of this movie.If you loved the book, keep it in your head and ignore the film version. If you want a light romance, stick with \\"Sleepless in seattle\\" and the like."},{"rating":"2","title":"Katie, CT","review":"I love Gwyneth Paltrow in general, but especially when she blows us away with her perfect English accent.

A romance featuring a modern story, a victorian one starring Gwenyth Paltrow and featuring Jennifer Ehle sounded very good. But everything that happened in the modern romance was just awful. I really didn't care about either of the main characters. I didn't care if they got together, I didn't really care about them at all. Except when they found new information about the Victorian romance, which is a wonderful story.I really wish this had just been a movie about Ash and LaMotte and their relationship. The modern story is just bad. But the older one is very good, well-developed and interesting. Jennifer Ehle is stellar in this movie, while Gwenyth delivers a very, very poor performance."},{"rating":"2","title":"worth seeing for the acting","review":"this is a really good movie made by one of my favorite directors. i don't know why some people don't like this movie. it has good acting, good directing, and very good cinematography. watch asap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Romantic.","review":"Possession starring Gwyneth Paltrow and Aaron Eckhart is a gentle and moving love story. I just love when Paltrow slaps on that British accent, she's the best at it! I like the present time mixed in with flashbacks of two poets who loved each other, but their love brought a lot of pain to those around them. I'm a big fan of Paltrow, she is such an amazing talent. I liked this film, very beautiful story and well-written."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD MIX OF HISTORICAL AND MODERN FICTION","review":"A. S. Byatt won the Booker Prize for writing this novel. It, and the movie, are hard to characterize. Fiction, yes. Historical? Sort of, if fictional characters of Victorian England count. Beautiful scenes of England. A Yank that is not a total jerk (a novelty in modern British art). Believable acting. A predictable story. Yet, a compelling and very, very enjoyable movie for Anglophiles, romantics, ghost-story buffs, and obsessive movie-goers. I will watch this many times and I am reading Byatt's novel! She is brillant! A great Amazon purchase!"},{"rating":"2","title":"From Booker Prize to Motion Picture","review":"Possession was the 1990 Booker Prize that came to screen in 2002's film with Academy Award winner Paltrow. This is a romance that weaves through time the love between a married poet named Ash and a lesbian spinster minor poet Lamott. A chance discovery of letters in the London library send teaching assistant Robert Mitchell through the English countryside in search of proof that there was a connection between the two poets. Joining him is academic feminist Maude Bailey whose a descendant of Lamott who doesn't believe Mitchell at first. The passion is obvious in the flashbacks of Ash and Lamott similar to The French Lt's Woman starring Meryl Streep but there isn't the same level of connection with Maude and Robert. The wild goose chase culminates in some fascinating personal and literary history but it would have been more richer had a similar romantic dilemna fallen upon the modern day scholars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very under-rated","review":"It's terrible that this movie wasn't a box office hit, as it's an excellent movie. The story is beautiful and compelling, and the back and forth between past and present works amazingly well. Any history buff, or a true fan of movies, needs to see this movie. It's just fantastic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the book instead","review":"If this movie was ever going to have a chance, it needed to be about 4 or 5 hours long, or never attempted in the first place. Some books adapt well to being edited and condensed as a screenplay - Possession just can't be dealt with that way. What you have as a result is another story entirely. I guess there just wasn't time enough to develop the characters, or even to include half of them. The only character true to the book and left almost intact was Sir George. The rest were stripped of their layers and everything that made them fascinating, and we are left with painful stereotypes and, in the case of Roland Michell, a character who seems to have wandered on to the wrong set during filming. My best advice is that if you've read the book, skip the movie, but if you saw the movie, you should do yourself a favor and get the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Toby Stephens Fans - save your money","review":"Toby Stephens barely appears in this film. He's supposed to be a villian but you see so little of him he hardly registers.The film itself is well-plotted, well-shot, well-acted but very poorly written. It's about poets (a take-off on the Brownings' story), but none of the characters says anything remotely poetical or memorable. You would have to care about the characters to swallow the fantastical story, and unfortunately the characters are such stereotypes that it just doesn't hold together. If you're hungry for romance read the Brownings' letters -- pure sugar cane as opposed to this way over-processed stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty fun, romantic movie","review":"This is a great date movie for bibliophiles. My girlfriend and I were both English majors in college, then English teachers, and we really enjoyed the film in the theatre. We later bought the DVD.The two stories keep you interested. The \\"modern\\" plotline is fairly predictable, but the mystery that Paltrow and that guy are trying to solve is relatively intricate, but not so much so that you get caught up in the movie and forget about the person you're watching with.Another plus, at least to my girlfriend, is that Jennifer Ehle, Eliza Bennet from the BBC's \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is in it, so the pleasant memories of her girlhood give this film a boost."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breathtaking","review":"I have never seen such beauty. This movie took me in and made me feel as if I were there, sharing in all the love and wonder. I have yet to see a love story that has moved me like this one has. It is truely one of the best. I will love it forever."},{"rating":"1","title":"huh?","review":"I give this one 2 stars for the period sequences. I found the actors in these scenes were very good..much better than the scenes starring Ms. Paltrow and her companion. I got bored with this movie very fast. The only thing that kept my attention was the story behind the story. I really wanted to love this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another American hijack","review":"No! Help!

Stop Doing It!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Believe it or not, Victorians DID have steamy sex","review":"...which is more than I can say about the modern couple. If you expect to see Gwyneth Paltrow take her clothes off, don't bother with this movie. She plays a frigid arrogant scholar, which is not too much of a stretch for her. In my opinion, she is not romantic damsel-in-distress material. She's much more interesting when she plays cold and cynical characters. Jennifer Ehle, on the other hand, shows quite a bit of skin. The clandestine love scene between the two poets still stands before my eyes.I read the book, so I could tell that the movie left too many loose ends untied. For instance, it's not clear in the movie why Gwyneth Paltrow's character is crying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong DVD","review":"The DVD that was sent to me was not what I ordered. Possession with Gwyneth Paltrow was what I ordered but did not receive."},{"rating":"1","title":"2/3 of it should be flushed","review":"I really worked the fast forward button with this one! The contemporary \\"love\\" story between Paltrow and the poorly cast, \\"brush-n-flush\\" American actor was the pits. (I guess the director just HAD to work with this guy.)

Too bad there wasn't more of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was Neil Labute thinking when he made this?","review":"If you are a fan of Neil Labute, you know that he can be merciless in his views of people and the world But why would he subject himself to a pointless and mind numbing film like this?

In one sense, 'Confidant' is a tense thriller, with wonderful pacing and enough clever narrative turns to keep genre readers enguaged. However, the book certainly maintains merits far beyond those of an ordinary thriller. As Timothy quotes in the opening passages, there is more than one line of perception. On a higher level, the book is a compassionate concept, full of the descriptions of relationship, proxy, and, ultimately, the strange and uncertain face of betrayal. It seems that the concept of himself, which Timothy seeks to deface, is one which he earns. Further, the relationship of Timothy and Julien is well built enough that the parallels between the two are only unapparent to a first time reader. While Gonzalez considers these concepts, he also does well to create a narrative which is both gripping and emotional."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for joining cabinet faceframes","review":"I redid my kitchen, and used these wonderful trimhead screws to fasten adjoining cabinet faceframes together.

Now that my children are at an age for reading chapter books together, I can't think of a more lovely story to share with them. The writer's lush descriptions of the land and the animals evoke every sense and bring the reader back to a simpler time. While there is a place in the world for simple texts and high-readability stories, Rabbit Hill is a refreshing counterpoint. A rich text, full of colorful language, this book is sure to draw the reader into the story -- a wonderful read-aloud/ read-together book, the story is sure to capture children's imaginations and perhaps boost their vocabularies as well.

It was not hard to concentrate on the book because every thing flowed smoothly to the next. I connected to Little Gorgie because I love rabbits and in the book he is the same age as me.

This book has a lot of excitement. No because I myself did kind of connect to main character he was just so cheerful. I learned that you could make the best of things. The genre is Fiction. The style of writings significant they use words like feminine. There was a good part with George singing a song about the new folks coming. The chapters did not end with cliffhangers. The story gets uninteresting at some parts, like how the animals talk about stuff. The plot was believable; it had a super good plot. I would recommend this book to people who like animals. It is a good funny book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great","review":"This is one of those books that looks okay but really stinks. It has basically a very small plot and no conflict that isn't resolved before the end of the chapter. It's written like some enviromentalist was trying for a utopia (and this was before the rise of the enviromentalists, too) The only thing that saves it from a one star is that it is very well written. Pity it has such a bad plot, it had the makings to be a great book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rabbit Hill","review":"This is a great book to read.In the book ther is a special event going to happen. New folks are commin! Every body is getting ready for the new folks.Espcaily Little Georgie(main character),until Uncle Analdas told him that they come and they go like every body else.That made Little Georgie upset.Then when the new folks came Littl Georgie was so happy."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a wonderful story & illustrations!","review":"I first read this book when I was about seven years old (longer ago than I care to remember). I just re-discovered it while rambling through the children's section of the library. Robert Lawson's love of animals and the outdoors is evident in not only his story, but in his illustrations. The characters truly \\"come to life\\". In all of Mr. Lawson's books, he was able to bring life and color to the animals who are frequently the focus and narrators of his tales. If you enjoyed this book, its sequel \\"The Tough Winter\\" is also worth a look as well. I can't wait to read \\"Rabbit Hill\\" to my nephew - I know he'll love it! Great CLASSIC children's book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kind and Gentle","review":"This is a great story. It helps identify with how an animal might feel. It will help children learn to teach animals with kindness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable little book, especially for animal lovers.","review":"A charming little story, Rabbit Hill brings the small animal world to life and almost makes one want to plant a garden just for them. The general attitude is one of sharing and looking out for one another, and the book subtly promotes reading as a worthwhile practice. The author's illustrations add to the charm of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pocket PC is the Way to Go","review":"I bought a Visor but now regret it. I've since looked into Pocket PCs and the Compaq Aero 1550 is a comparable size and price with far greater functionality. It has a voice recorder, audio jack, rechargable battery, and a Compact Flash port, which is much better than the Springboard port. It also has versions of MS Office software."},{"rating":"2","title":"Handsprings Scores a 4!","review":"The Handspring Visor Deluxe is by far one of the best deals in the PDAworld right now. It only cost $249, as compared to Palm's IIIxe. However, the Visor Deluxe does NOT have FlashROM to upgrade the OS. To counteract this deficiency, the Deluxe does come in various iMac inspired color casings. Also, the Springboard expansion slot is very promising, as developers continue to announce (and sometimes release) modules every few months. The improved synchronization between the computer via the fast USB architecture and calculator and dateboook applications are a plus! Everything is great about the Deluxe. The only drawbacks is that the backlight screen is a bit darker than Palm's IIIxe, and the lack of FlashROM hinders future OS expansion (unless the OS can be patched via the Springboard.) Overall, the Handspring Visor Deluxe...is a steal! If you're a fan of the Palm OS, buy it now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GRAT PRODUCT","review":"GREAT PRODUCT FROM TRIPPLITE THEY ARE DEPENDABLE AND EASY TO INSTALL THE PACKAGING WAS GREAT AND IT CAME REALLY FAST"},{"rating":"1","title":"Insult to Reason","review":"The book description gives it away: \\"Unger argues for the extreme skeptical view that, not only can nothing ever be known, but no one can ever have any reason at all for anything.\\" Good, so there is no reason to read this book.

Opened the cover and fell right in. The style of writing is great. Oral history type of approach is really interesting and provides a personal view and insight into the Ramones. Great read and interesting images."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Book Written By One Who Was There!","review":"This is an incredible book. Based around the story of Monte A. Melnick, tour manager (and much more) for the Ramones throughout their entire career (1974-1996, and 2,263 live shows), this is actually a superb piece of punk oral history. As well as the voices of Monte, and many of the Ramones (Johnny, Marky, Tommy, CJ and Joey), there's their crew - the road-dogs - the roadie's, lighting guys, sound man, etc., etc. An incredible band, a great story, a wonderful read, and a real insight into the Ramones, and life on the road - sex, drugs, rock n roll, of course, but also the binges, fights, breakups, arrests, OD's, girlfriends, humor, hilarity, boredom, fans, and work ethic. Packed with personal photos and memorabilia this is a must-have for all fans of the Ramones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting and Heartbreaking","review":"This book is a GREAT read for any Ramones fan, but it was very heartbreaking in the end to see how \\"the remaining band members\\" treated Joey at the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame induction. I only wish Joey's mom and brother would have stepped up on stage to accept that award for Joey. He indeed was the most kind hearted soul and he deserved more recognition then what he got that night. May he rest in peace."},{"rating":"2","title":"REAL insight into the band","review":"I've read both the Ramones books out so far(\\"An American Band\\" and \\"Hey Ho, Let's Go\\") as well as Dee Dee's two memoirs, but I think Monte's book - which is really an oral history - is actually the best in terms of shedding light on the band's history and personalities. To his credit, everyone gets a fair chance to tell their story, even when it conflicts with someone else's. And many of the stories and photos are something that only an insider like Monte could put on paper. One unfortunate byproduct of the book is that my opinon of Johnny as a person has sunk. While his near-militaristic running of the band was often necessary for them to survive as a unit, he comes off as an angry, bitter man (both in his own words and those of others) who could have certainly been better to his bandmates and the Ramones support crew."},{"rating":"2","title":"On the Road With the Ramones","review":"A must read for even the most casual fan...is there a casual Ramones fan?Monte details all of the travails and hard work in an honest fashion, but without a \\"woe is me\\" attitude at being the guy out of the spotlight. And in doing so, it gives you a deeper appreciation of what the band was, warts and all.Lots of photos and memorabilia too.Worth every penny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Baby Lamby","review":"This is our 4th lamby from Bowron.

First of all when you have a hit album it doesn't means you are an automatic Executive Producer, leave that for P.Diddy, Dr. Dre, Timbaland, Missy, so please 50 cent, first learn, and then produce.

This makes my hair want to fall out. You guys can't be serious. Does anybody know hip-hop anymore? Lloyd Banks can't rap a lick. His ryhmes are very elementary. His flow is one dimensional. His punch lines are so lame and most of them don't even make sense. If you bought this album or even bootlegged it you need to be hung by your pinky toe. I'm going to leave with this quote from \\"On Fire\\"- I'm buying diamonds by the pair/bu when you stop the only thing still spinning is your ear. ENOUGH SAID!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"G-units best delivers","review":"This is a great debut album from Lloyd Banks and if u ask me he is better then both 50 and Young Buck.

This is one of the worst albums I have heard all year.I thought that the beats would be hot and a little bit uptempo but instead all I got was a bunch wack beats and slow lyrics. There are about 3-4 songs I like \\"warrior\\",\\"warrior pt 2\\" and \\"on fire\\". I thought he could do better. I have heard better stuff from him on mixed tapes. Maybe if he used Dr. Dre he would have done better, but instead he used some D-grade producers whose beats sound like they weremade in somebody's basement. I think he tried too hard to live up to 50's debut and don't believe the hype, just because it sold 430,000 copies in the 1st week doesnt make it hot.However Iam a loyal 50/G-unit always."},{"rating":"2","title":"TRUE","review":"This album is some tight work overall.

Anyone who has listened to Banks rap knows that he has a one of a kind voice along with great lyrics. Put that with some hot beats and you got one hell of an album.For those who dont have this album, This website has the WRONG track list. The CD only has 14 tracks and the one with the Bonus DVD has 15 tracks.Here is the track listing:1- Aint No Click feat Tony Yayo 5/52- Playboy 4/5 crazy beat3- Warrior 5/54- On Fire 5/55- I Get High feat 50 Cent & Snoop 4/56- I'm So Fly 4.5/57- Work Magic feat Young Buck 5/58- If You So Gangsta 4/59- Warrior Pt 2 feat 50 Cent Eminem & Nate Dogg 5/510- Karma 3/511- When The Chips Are Down 4/512- Til The End 4/513- Die One Day 4/514- South Side Story 4/5Lloyd Banks did a decent job with his major debut!

You gotta actually listen to an album before your grade it. At first I thought it sucked and was thinking his mixtapes sounded better. But after re-playing and listening to content and letting the beat drop in it was hot. I hope it gets up there to \\"Reasonable Doubt\\" cause he got the skillz. Banks should be around for awhile. People got their own preference so it's all bout what you like. I mean people say someone is mainstream if they make a song they don't like, like slow jams. But making music to appeal to alot of people is how you become great. Jay-Z, Biggie Pac all did it so stop hatin'. 50 didn't lie about no making slow jam songs, he just didn't know that's the way to appeal to other groups of ppl like females in general. Holla @ Bank$ nuff said."},{"rating":"1","title":"nothing but dissapointment","review":"When Banks annouced that he was coming out with the album earlir this year, anticipation were high for this 21 year old rapper. after all, he is lyrically the most talented one out of the whole group. But wen i bought this cd, i found my self keep skipping track after track. The only good songs are warrior, Warrior part two and Karma, Eminem definitly outshines Lloyd in the Cd with his lyrical and production skills. The Album in general is pure garbage with nothing but filler tracks, Production on the cd is weak except for the two Eminem produced tracks. I would not recommend this cd since it only has 14 tracks and 11 of them are fillers. Maybe Young bucks album will be woth the buying when it comes out."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Hunger for More","review":"The highly anticipated solo album from G-Unit's own Lloyd Banks is solid. When reviewing anything, the best way to go is to give the good & the bad, so here we go.The album starts off with Aint No Click with Tony Yayo. I'd heard this prior to buying the album and i think it's pretty good. G Unit is known for their street anthems so this one definitely was more of what i was expecting. Playboy is a good cut, more of Banks giving his fans what they know him for, the playboy of g unit with the slick punchlines. Warrior is another banger, already popular for it's catchy lyrics. On Fire was a hit single for a reason. I Get High was one of my least favorites, but it's decent. The best songs on here are Warrior Pt 2, Southside Story, When The Chips Are Down, Work Magic & Til The End. The rest are decent songs, with I Get High & If U So Gangsta being the weakest but still OK.Overall the album is from a 3.5/5 to 4/5. Solid debut album from Lloyd Banks."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'd give it a 5 but...","review":"I thought this was a very good cd. The only reason I give four instead of a five is because I thought the cd was to edited. I'd say there were about 10 \\"beeps\\" in each song.Otherwise, I thought this was a good cd. If you like 50 Cent, I'd get this-Lloyd Banks is kinda like him."},{"rating":"2","title":"REAL MAN IN DA GAME","review":"Banks is a real rapper & this being his first solo album has shown his tru skillz. I believe that of all G-unit members, he remains the most profound and truly the best. His album sales may not have reached the depth of as much as 50's but he IS the best in G-unit and this album proves how great he is. To me, the best song is Til the end becuz he spits about life with ya mans, knowing who's real & who's not. Hunger for More is a ill album & those who have gotten it is lucky & those who dont have, u need to get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Manufactured Bull SH@!","review":"Terrible, Dissapointing, Piece of CRAP!I bought this CD hoping to hear some quality songs from the G-Unit trio. Instead, all I heard was manufactures crap mixed with, well, CRAP! I loved the 50 Cent album, 4.75/5 for that one and I loved the g-unit album, 4.5/5, but this album was terrible. All the songs sounded the same, most sounded like they were manufactured for publicity, \\"On fire\\" sounded like KRS-ONE's \\"Step into a world\\" and there was this other song that sounded like 50's \\"Many men\\"... it was retarded. I believe this album has no good songs, no quality, no catchy coruses, basically NOTHING. I was really dissapointed and I will return this CD for something better. It's not even worth buring. I hope the Young Buck CD is better. Lloyd Banks album sucks and it felt like there was no time or skill or anything put into it.

I think he has better rap skills than 50. But the difference between them is the fact that 50 is smart. Not saying that Banks isn't, 50 had people buy into his hype. He knows how to sell his music without having the nice skills like Banks. Plus it was hard for Banks because he was in 50 shadow. But he proves many people wrong on his album. The only thing I think Banks need to work on is the choruses in his songs. He's use to 50 laying down the chorus and the album would have been a lot better if the choruses were better.

The best song is \\"When the Chips are Down\\", featuring The Game. He completely outshines Banks bigtime.

In addition of the 2 or 3 things that do do something, only clicking very specific parts of those things do anything. So for example, if you are suppose to click the bat, only clicking one end of the bat results in a reaction.

The Visor dulex is a great unit, there's no doubt about that, but why get that when you could have the much better Palm IIIxe, or the TRGpro. This is just a warning, this is not worth the money, get the Palm IIIxe, you'll be sorry if you don't.

This includes dropping the unit from 4 feet onto a concrete sidewalk with only a nick in the corner of the case. I had been concerned a bit about the lack of flash memory and the inability to upgrade the OS, but the differences between the Palm OS 3.5 on my last PDA and the older version on this one is negligible.I can't imagine future upgrades will be that significant.

After dumping a large sum of money to buy this product just over three months ago they wanted another ($$$) before I could even tell them what was wrong with my organizer. If 90 days is all that Handspring thinks their products are good for, and if they only last 90 days you will be far better off buying something else, anything else. I even wrote to their customer service telling them how disappointed I was, but they don't care. They got their money and don't want to hear from me again unless I give them more.

I bought it because it was much cheaper than the palm and because of the modules, but I would probably not make the same decision if I had to do it all over again. If you need a reliable product more than you need bells and whistles (in the form of modules) I would not recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a fantastic little machine!","review":"I must say, I'm like a kid in a candy store.

I bought a Handpring Visor last night and am thrilled with it.The Visor is a fantastic and versatile little machine and I am so glad that I bought this one instead of a PalmPilot as an upgrade (my previous PDA was a PalmProfessional). The ability to add on modules was a fantastic addition to the PDA and, as I see it, the wave of the future. The module slot lets you add memory, a modem, a mini harddrive to store information, a pager and, I hear, now a cell phone!

The Visor comes with a USB cradle standard, but their Windows NT HotSync software doesn't support USB, so I had to plunk down an additional $20. This means that it was more expensive than the Palm III XE, which is essentially the same product.Still, the Visor has the \\"Springboard\\" capability that pushed it over the top. This slot on the back of the unit allows you to plug in cartridges or other devices and create an entirely new device. Some available modules are a GPS receiver, a digital camera, and additional memory. There are also games...which is a big deal to some people because they would take up a lot of memory otherwise!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Handspring vs PalmPilot","review":"I recently bought a Handspring Deluxe to replace my Palm III, as the Handspring has 8 mb RAM for much less than the comparable Palm Vx (and the Palm Vx is difficult to find). Beware that the Palm has standard serial port hotsynch cradle, which has to be ordered separately for the Handspring. My computer doesn't have a USB port, which the Handspring cradle uses. Also the keyboard cover for the Handspring has to be taken all the way off, won't just fold up. Other than that, it is basically the same as the Palm.

The ideal price for a visor is .... All the hype about the springboard expansion slots was for no reason.It is no big deal.The screen of the visor isn't very crisp as the m100. It is a little dull.

It gets scratched very easily, especially in the Visor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Win2000 not properly supported","review":"I bought the Visor Deluxe instead of a Palm IIIxe because of the expandability, and because the default HotSync format was USB. I spent many hours trying to make the thing work on my Windows 2000 machine. As a diagnostic, I installed the unit on a Win98 machine to verify that the unit itself and cradle were okay -- no problems. Handspring Tech support was VERY responsive, writing me back within a few hours, telling me what else to try. The recommendations were to visit websites, download more software, etc etc. The unit was shipped allegedly compatible with Win2000, so I see that as someone else's job.

Also mix in CIA and FBI technology and read how the pro's may actually uncover the truth.The only reason I did not give this 5 stars was the very ending. After the building climax takes place, the book almost literally ends. I felt cheated with a few of the main characters. It seemed it just stopped and I asked myself \\"That's it?\\".

Yes, there were some funny parts but they didn't appear until I was 75% through with it. The phonetic spelling of the German and Swedish characters was beyond annoying, the part with Dr \\"Bulge\\" was unnecessary and the characters tended to harp on stupid things such as how Big Jim got his name, waffles and how the main character kept bringing up her injuries as a reason not to do anything. I won't even get into the secret circle and the alleged countess whose accent kept changing. I won't be reading anymore books by this author,who obviously knows nothing about riding clothes. They aren't called 'britches' they're 'breeches'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Horseplay a novel","review":"What a great read. Funny Funny I laughed out loud many many times.

Sure, there are a lot of keyboards and little guitars on this album, but it does not disappoint. Many of these songs take me back to the forests of old, elves dancing and singing, and dwarves digging in the mountains. \\"The Rotting Horse on the Deadly ground\\" makes me think of the great battle of Minas Tirith, winged Nazgul swooping down and taking men's lives with ease. This album deserves 4 1/2 stars, not four."},{"rating":"2","title":"A post-ROTK release book review","review":"I wanted to review this book for people who have already seen the theatrical edition of Return of the King. The biggest thing that this photo guide adds is a major clue into what may be in the extended edition DVD of Return of the King, which will be released sometime in the fall of 2004. For example, there are some wonderful pictures of Sam and Frodo, and of Pippin and Merry, that are not in the final theatrical cut of the film, and therefore, it seems that we can expect these in the extended cut. The only criticism I have is simply that, other than these new pictures, it is of course a rehashing of the story, written somewhat like a children's book. But, like I said, it is worth it for the new photos."},{"rating":"2","title":"Water Crystals in Motion .

So I went to my in-law who is German and she read a few paragraphs from the German. When I showed her the parallel text in English by Guyer and Wood, she was appalled at how inaccurate it was. She said the German was beautiful prose whereas the translation was aweful and didn't reflect the style of the German at all. She thought that the NK Smith was good English, but that it wasn't very accurate either. Unfortunately, I didn't get her opinion on the other translations.The only reason I can think of for Cambridge using the utterly untalented efforts of Guyer and Wood is because of their privileged chairs in their respective University.

Although given credit for discovering the limits of reason in providing metaphysical truths, subsequently making metaphysics a joke among European intellectuals, he nevertheless refused to admit the absurdity of many metapysical concepts -- most importantly God and the existence and immortality of the soul. Kant's genius was in convincing others that he had filtered out metaphysics from reason, and thereby reached an unprecedented objectivity. The truth is that his philosophy is no less metaphysical, and therefore no less without foundation, than that of the rationalists he succeeded. It would take the appearance of Nietzsche almost a century later for Europe and the world to see Kant for what he really is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anti-reason = anti-thought = anti-life","review":"This book is good to read if you understand that it's completly socialistic, and anti-thesis."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mr. Kant should make a few more distinctions","review":"I know that Mr Kant thinks that he's the greatest thing since sliced bread but really, he should try to write at above a third grade level if he wants to be taken seriously..."},{"rating":"1","title":"B-b-b-b-b-borinnnnnnnnnnnng!!!","review":"Having read a lot of philosophy books, I can honestly say this is the worst by far. In fact, I only read thirty pages of this before I realized that Kant was downright rude by being so verbose. Did he think everyone had time to waste trying to get his point? Every once in a while, his writing becomes clear and cogent, but then it's back to Sartreville. Sartre, by the way, is a good read providing you avoid that monstrosity of his, \\"Being and Nothingness.\\" Stick with Nietzsche (excepting, of course, \\"Thus Spake Tharathustra,\\" which, in my humble opinion, is no \\"Twilight of the Idols.\\")"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Enemy.","review":"Kant is the ENEMY; because of his very question of reason; and his systematic approach to knowledge."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is one of the defining texts of philosophy.....","review":"The Critique is often dense and it is consistently challenging.

The unedited real thing is extremely difficult for anyone not (a) totally enthusiastic, (b) extremely familiar with philosophical concepts, and (c) very very smart. Because I didn't fall in any of the above categories (being, in Kant's words, a \\"common man of the commonest intelligence\\"), Kant's critique was lost of me.

As usual, the mobi version of this book for Kindle has a fully linked table of contents, but each and every footnote throughout the book is a link as well.

You can quickly jump to the footnote, then press back and jump right back to the page you were reading. In regard to the table of contents being linked to each and every little section of this book, one might call it excessive, but I prefer to call it \\"thorough.\\"In short, this version is perfect to have for referencing specific sections or even for a full reading of Kant's Critique of Pure Reason."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a must read book for every person.

Jimmy Page's guitar riffage on tracks like \\"Whole Lotta Love\\" are just so, well, heavy. John Paul Jones' beautiful organ solo in \\"Thank You\\" combine with Robert Plant's lyrics to create the ultimate love song. And let's not forget John Bonham's five minutes of pounding on the drums, sometimes bare-handed, on \\"Moby Dick.\\" This album grew out of their live show and is reflected in bluesy improv-sounding tracks like \\"The Lemon Song.\\" Also a great headphones album (check out the end of \\"What is and What Should Never Be\\"), this is blues-based hard rock at its best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Probably their best ever","review":"This CD is a departure from the debut album. This album takes more of a Rock direction than the first album.The first album is essentially a blues album.Again probably some of Jimmy Pages best guitar work.The CD starts with the classic \\"Whole lotta Love\\" which I'm sure you have heard hundreds of times. Still a classic.\\"This and what should never be\\" is also good along with the Lemon song which is actully the blues Classic, \\" The killing floor.They have changed the music an renamed it.Heartbreaker is next. It features probably the hottest solo of any Led Zeppelin song .Living Loving Maid is another rocker. One of Led Zeppelins best rockers ever.Ramble on is another rocker with fine guitar. Moby Dick is a vechicle for John Bonham and his drums. It shows the talent that Bonham had for the drums/ The CD closes with \\"Bring it on Home to me\\" which is blues featurnig Plant on Harmonica. This could be their best album ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"This album is ROCK MUSIC!!!!","review":"I can't stand todays rock music. And when I listen to great albums like this one I know why.

Here is Zeppelin at their utmost raw, incredibly blues and jazz heavy, and yet thunderous in the delivery. Sure, we recognize that most of the tracks are actually covers of older blues songs, but whats important, what makes these songs so goddamn amazing is what Zeppelin brings to the music: Plant's soulful screams and wails, tight guitar riffs, lucid solos, and absolutely explosive drumming. With perhaps the execption of Thank You, every song in Led Zeppelin II is representative of the best of Zeppelin's work. And don't buy the goddamn record for christ-sake, just download it illegally off of the internet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dirty blues with a heavy dose of rock","review":"\\"Led Zeppelin II\\" is a heavy dose of blues and hard rock; not too disimlar from their debut, albeit not quite as bluesey overall.There's lots of great moments on here, really. The raucous, sexy strut of \\"Whole Lotta Love\\" is a major highlight to kick off the album. Certainly one of Zep's most memorable rockers.\\"What Is and What Should Never Be\\" explores soft/loud dynamics nicely, and \\"Thank You\\" is one of their most genuine, beautiful love ballads.\\"Moby Dick\\" isn't so much a song as a showcase for Bonzo's wicked drum solo. And \\"Bring It On Home\\" closes the album in a very bluesey fashion.Other highlights include the sleazy blues/rocker \\"The Lemon Song\\", the bitter \\"Heartbreaker\\", and the folksy rocker \\"Ramble On\\" (first evidence of Robert Plant's love of JRR Tolkien).Like their debut album, \\"Led Zeppelin II\\" has a gritty, rockin' blues feel throughout. It's not their best, but you really can't go wrong with it either."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Led Zeppelin's Finest Albums","review":"Led Zeppelin is, without a doubt, one of the greatest rock bands of all time, and this album proves it. 1969's \\"Led Zeppelin II\\" contains many of the band's finest hits like \\"Whole Lotta Love,\\" \\"The Lemon Song,\\" \\"Heartbreaker,\\" and my personal favorite, the mystical \\"Ramble On\\".Each song is a classic and breaks the boundaries of hard rock. It also shows the band's great diversity in dabbling with the likes of folk music and the ecstatic, eccentric solos, particularly those of drummer, John Bonham on songs like \\"Moby Dick\\". The qualities shown here were the ones that took Led Zeppelin to their height and made them godlike in rock & roll, and \\"Led Zeppelin II\\" is the perfect album to prove it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great song - don't buy from Amazon","review":"They are now forcing you to use their crappy \\"Amazon MP3 Download software\\" It doesn't work on my computer, so now I 1) don't have my music, 2) am out the cost of the album, 3) find out they won't let you buy the album any other way for some silly reason.Try a different website."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thunderous?","review":"I must say that I don't understand how you reviewers can describe this album as \\"thunderous\\".When I first heard Whole Lotta Love I thought to myself \\" it sounds like he's playing a toy guitar, a plastic guitar\\".

However before you Led Zeppelin fans damn my soul to the fiery pits of hell, I have to say that I do quite like this album because the toy guitar sound and cute songs like Thank you and What Is And what Should Never Be bring back some lovely childhood memories of being taking to Santa's Magic Grotto and seeing the elfs,the first time I saw Bambi in the theatre with my parents , and the nice birthday cake I got for my fourth birhday( it had a lovely little pink sugar mouse on it)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Seriously overrated","review":"Another violently average album from arguably the most overrated band of all time.

Have been for over 40 years. Not too many bands can command this following, even to this day. Just look at the reviews.

What I mean is that I can listen to this disc all the way through. \\"Whole Lotta Love\\" kept up the tradition of hard-rocking songs at the beginning of the disc, but it was so good that their manager broke his policy of them only producing albums, not singles! \\"What Is and What Should Never Be\\" is a great song and is next. I didn't like \\"Lemon Song\\" or \\"Thank You,\\" but then come \\"Heartbreaker/Livin' Love Maid\\" which make up for the previous two songs. \\"Ramble On\\" is by far my favorite song on the disc with nice vocals and guitar. \\"Moby Dick\\" is also a pretty cool song in which John Bonham showed his talents on drums, but this song is much better live. This is the first disc where you can tell that Led Zeppelin is something special.

Who were the idiots that supervised the transfer of this album from the master tape to CD? Didn't anyone hear the distortion rampant thru the songs. Sure the album is 40 years old but there are old recordings of Leslie Gore (early '60's) that sound better than this.The distortion is too bad not to notice. The overall tonal quality of the CD has a very noticeable harsh edge to it. I can remember owning the Last Atlantic Records Superhits package that had that labels hits from 1969-70. The edited version of \\"Whole Lotta Love\\" (included on that album)that was sent to radio stations sounded better (on vinyl!).Could it be maybe that the software used to take away the master tape hiss was set incorrectly???I would advise anyone to by the earliar CD release of this album.What a waste!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a staple","review":"Like the Beatles, Pink Floyd, and (sometimes) the Who, Led Zeppelin's albums are without peer.

Well, I'm here to tell you that is not my favorite Zeppelin album, this one is and I'll tell you why, pure bluesy rock and roll at its very best, with the tendency to sound a lot like heavy metal, because it's the birth of it, and it shows. From Whole Lotta Love, to Bring It On Home, and the in betweens like my favorite Zeppelin tune Lemon Song, just pure brilliant guitar work on this track. Heartbreaker is good number too, just wild and crazy guitar playing 101 stuff here. I think if Jimmy Page was not ever born, there would not be Metallica or Megadeath, both bands I like too. But then again you do have other good guitarist out there, he's not the only one, but pretty close to the top 5 indeed.

(Bangs head to Whole Lotta Love)","review":"Ok, I'm a musician and a journalist, so normally my reviews get a little long and complex, but I'm going to say this as simply and effeciently as possible: THERE HAS NEVER BEEN AND WILL NEVER BE AN ALBUM THAT ROCKS QUITE AS HARD AS THIS ONE! For pure headbanging enjoyment, as well as marvelling at Zep's incredible FLAIR (How's that for a metal band? FLAIR!), this is THE album to buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"As a huge LZ fan, this is definetly one of their best.

He has been ecstatic since receiving this CD. It is nice to have a place to find the older good rock and roll. Led Zeppelin Rules."},{"rating":"2","title":"From 1969?","review":"Zeppelin 2 is possibly the most drastic revolutionary album that ever came on the rock scene. Let's face it, most of these songs were too heavy for the top 40. \\"Whole Lotta Love\\" got played a lot, except they'd leave off the ending (\\"I wanna be your back door man\\"). They cut out the middle too, probably as heavy a stuff as you'll ever hear on a rock album. And \\"Living Loving Maid\\" would have to make my top 40 somewhere as one of the best rock songs ever. And it doesn't stop there. \\"Ramble On\\" just simply is a great Zeppelin song, \\"The leaves have fallen all around, time I was on my way\\", this song actually does sound great during the Fall. To someone who had never heard anything by Zeppelin, I would suggest they start with this album. Untitled has some great stuff on it too but this stuff is raw energy that equals or maybe even tops Van Halen's second album."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of their Best","review":"I am a 17 year old huge fan of Led Zeppelin. Led Zeppelin II has a lot of classic songs on it like Heartbreaker etc.. I think that Whole Lotta Love is maybe a little overrated I still love the song though.

If you have never heard psycho-blues of \\"Whole Lotta Love\\" or the riff on \\"Heartbreaker\\", then you must get out from under your rock and get this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great music, lousy sound","review":"What an outstanding album, that brought back great memories. However, as I listened to the CD of the recording I was disappointed by the distortion in the bass and loud passages in general. I wasn't much of an audiophile when the album came out, but I would guess the vinyl sounds lots better."},{"rating":"2","title":"great collector's album!","review":"It is extremely difficult to find this album in brand new condition.

It is highly recommended for any contemporary rock lovers that have never experienced the true sound of the classic rock."},{"rating":"2","title":"Zeppelin at their Best!","review":"most people rave over Led Zeppelin l, whick is very good but this is incredibly better. all songs are catchy and have a great guitar piece. some of the greatest songs are \\"whole lotta love\\" ,\\" what is and what should never be\\", \\"the lemon song\\", \\"moby dick\\", and \\" living lovin maid\\". by far greatest zeppelin albun ever!"},{"rating":"2","title":"one of zep's best","review":"Zep II finds the band still tapping the primordial riff mine that page opened up in their debut. this is still super tight bluesy hard rock focused on sex and relationships, preceding the more eclectic and experiment zep 3 & physical graffiti.from whole lotta love to bring it on home, there's not a weak song in the group. page's irresistable riffs -- the dna for countless future metal and hard rock bands -- plant's howling wolf cum celtic hippy wail, backed by the rock-solid rhythm section of bonham/jones, makes this one of their best. just when you think they are slipping in the slow start to the album's final track, page, bonham and jones kick in with a thundering sound that reminds you what is great about rock n roll."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not their best.","review":"With this album Led Zeppelin found their sound. A Whole Lotta Love is the standout song, THAT RIFF IS SOMETHING ELSE. But my personal fave is Heartbreaker. The Lemon song would be banned today. Quite sexually explicit.\\"You got that Juice running down my leg\\". Moby Dick is a Bonham showcase, where Bonzo hits everything but the kitchen sink. And my second favourite song on the album is the beautiful \\"Thankyou\\".I rate this album as Zeppelins 3rd best ever. With \\"Physical Graffiti\\" and \\"Zoso\\" coming in at 1st and 2nd place. Still no true Zep fan can be without this album. Buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Hit","review":"Coming out of the ashes of the Yardbirds, releasing their first album, Jimmy Page is at it again.

Its not a complicated story, nor is it the non-stop action film portrayed in the trailer but its distinctive and entertaining. Frank Langella is on the money. Four stars because Elliot Gould says his lines in such a way that you expect his eyeballs to move from side to side."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great actors undercut by terrible direction","review":"I got this because the principal actors are so excellent. But the movie is so slow and boring with so many half-hearted plot elements I could hardly watch it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Helpful only as an overall reference to the PCAT","review":"The book was helpful as additional set of questions for practice. The test questions, however, were misleading and tricky, which was not true of the actual PCAT. Each section seemed to be written by a different person and there was no consistent method to the presentation of the material. The Biology section did not explain the answers at all, so there was no opportunity to learn from mistakes. Other sections were somewhat better. I found the study skills and test taking tips section to be of little or no value. The overview of the mechanisms that have been developed to describe how people learn was of no value at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dry as the Texas soil","review":"This was probably the driest history book I have ever read. With all the exciting things that happened in Texas history, it would be easy to spice this book up. However, Fehrenbach spends more time on agriculture and geography that the actual history of the state. He goes on for pages on minor events and minor governors, but then breezes by others like the Mexican-American War. I've read many history books that monotonous, but this one was just flat boring. Furthermore, the author justifies the killing and suppression of Indians, Negros, and Mexicans by Texans becuase they were inferior and did not deserve the land. This at times made me very uncomfortable.The author needs to seriously think about whether he is writing a history book, or a detailed description of every rock in Texas. I would not recommend this book for people interested in Texas history, but could be used as a resource for students."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolute Must Have","review":"This is an exhaustive - and lengthy - book on not just Texas but the the history of the area before there was a Texas, the countries who owned it, the men who settled it and the people who made it what it is today. The author gives a throrough treatment on every topic and that is more amazing than it sounds. If you are studying Texas, or the Frontier, or the Civil War, or slavery, or sociology of American (not just Texan) development - you should read this book. It is fact filled AND interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great information - not so great writing skills","review":"First, let me say I love this book. It is a fascinating history of Texas and especially interesting to me as a relatively new resident of the state. I bought it primarily because the reviews said it was great. And it is.The prolific use of commas is disconcerting. The author could have saved a thousand commas by not using them to separate every single little piece of a sentence. It's just not necessary and it throws the reader off a bit. A few other grammatical issues popped up but NOTHING can minimize the value of reading this interesting book. If you want to know about Texas from way, way back until now, READ IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lone Star","review":"Outstanding and classic. A must for any Texan, westerner or anyone who professes to know anything about Texas. Any history buff on manifest destiny should be required to read it.

We are Texans and wanted him to understand the history of our beloved state. It's a wonderful book, and very comprehensive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Texas History Book Ever Written","review":"I am a fifth generation Texan--both paternal and maternal ancestors came to Texas in the 1850's. The book explains why the events in Texas history caused the state to be what it is today. It is invaluable to newcomers in understanding Texas politics, culture and history. My favorite chapters include the Amerinds and the impact of the Spanish mustang on Indian culture, Anglo-Celtic migration, the battle for independence i.e. Goliad, the Alamo(best description ever written) & San Jacinto, the impact of the Colt pistol on taming the west, the cattle culture, the War between the States and Reconstruction. I recommend this book to every native Texan so that he/she can understand his/her heritage better and to new Texans so that they can understand why Texans are so proud of their state. I hope that Mr Fehrenbach will release a new edition for the next millennium...It's time for one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Modem","review":"This modem is great albeit bulky, making it impossible to fit into any form-fitting cases. The bulk comes from its AAA battery compartment. Having its own batteries keeps the drain on the Visor as low as can be expected from online activity. Don't think 33.6 is a slow speed for Palm-based devices. Data in the Palm world is much smaller than its PC equivalent. IRC, ICQ, e-mail, and web-surfing... you can do it all with this modem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great addition and Fast.","review":"Takes 2 AAA batteries that last about 1 week for heavy duty use. Does POP3 with Eudora Mail. Also works great with Eudora Web browser. With Eudora Mail you don't need to hot sync mail because you access your POP3 email and can remotely erase files. It also lets you bring in attachments if needed."},{"rating":"1","title":"How does this thing work???","review":"I have had mine for a couple of weeks now and still haven't figured out how to work it. The instruction manual is not very helpful. It doesn't even tell you how to go about getting mail and accessing the internet othere than saying you need \\"third party software\\" to do so. Well what else would one use a modem for? Shouldn't the software be included or at least suggestions of which to use? I downloaded Eudora Suite (free) and just can't figure this out. It should not be this difficult for an average person to use. I will continue to work with it but if I can't get it up and running soon I will return it. So far it's been a waste of money. I amn very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"The message by 4Him","review":"Use to own this product, then I gave it to a friend who I thought would enjoy it.I missed it so much that I bought a new one for myself."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"The Message\\" Never Gets Old","review":"I have followed 4Him ever since they came on the scene and have just about every album they put out, as well as the solo albums by Mark Harris and Andy Chrisman. As much as I love them all I think this is their best all-around album. The Message is powerful and uplifting, calling us to live out our faith and demonstrating Christ to a world in need. The lyrics are encouraging and challanging, the music is excellent and the vocals are solid. I never tire of listening to it"},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT!!","review":"This is one of my favorite 4Him cd's!!!!!! It is great!!!!!You have to get it!!!! The words are so powerful!!!

These guys have powerful, soaring harmonies complimented my soulful, lyrics about Our Lord. Excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Visionary Details","review":"Imagine making the micro-stages of a plum blossom's growth the basis of a startling series of nature poems. But this is what Po-Jen Sung manages to do, and Red Pine's translation seems elegent and luminous and baffling in all the right places. The poet is never at a loss for the perfect image. He is intuitive and always flowing with the spirit of the inner details. This is visionary poetry at its best -- and the woodcuts of each of the flower's stages are incomparable. A must read. Thanks to Red Pine for this deeply moving work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great sound but a bit uncomfortable","review":"These headphones sound great and fold down small enough that they don't take up too much space in your bag. They do have two problems though. The first is the cords. Both the cord to the headphones and the cord to the jack come out of the battery pack at exactly the same point. This makes for a tangled mess. The second problem is the headband. It's tight and uncomfortable."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little empty music.","review":"Despite the critical acclaim and Booker Prize nomination, this book is an uninspired attempt to contrast the social ills of two very different societies. The theme is perhaps noble and difficult, but Desai fails to pull it off. Neither of the main characters, the siblings Uma and Arun, are protrayed in more than one dimension and are hardly worth caring for. One learns less about them than how they are perceived by others. The events that pepper Uma's life in India are nothing more than disjointed vignettes, and Arun's little window into a dysfunctional suburban American family left an empty feeling. Desai deserves credit for her skills in human and social observation but the entire novel is only that and never once engages the reader's heart and mind in the story-telling. Finally, the writing style in the two parts of the novel is so contrasting that I wondered if they were written by two different authors."},{"rating":"2","title":"The writing is so beautiful although context is kinda boring","review":"I think Anita Desai is a very good writer in the sense that the book was so beautifult written. I love her similes and descriptions. The plot is interesting in a sad sort of way. I personaly liked the feasting part better. I think it was becasue it gave more backgrung info and had more stories. There was really no conclusion or even climax to the book. So if you are one of those people that needs a very exciting book, then dont get this. But if you appreciate nice writing and some interesting description, I definetly think you should."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor book","review":"This book, I feel is not interesting and I had stoped half way, the grammar of the book doesn't make any sense. The book doesn't chronologically follow. I would not give more 2 stars to this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Can't Believe this is Booker","review":"This was my first and last Desai book. I can't imagine what the Booker committee was thinking. The Fasting part was mildly interesting, although it did leave one wondering what motivated the various characters. The Feasting half simply beggared belief. The characterization was so silly and shallow I often re-read passages in disbelief to confirm my mind wasn't playing cruel literary tricks on me. Give this book a pass - it is a huge disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic literature.","review":"Yes, yes, Anita Desai does it again. The words are simple and precise, but the world weaved through them is profound and sad. The narrative is restrained. The characters are restrained. But the reader can be anything but."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible","review":"this is the story of a young indian boy trapped in a dysfunctional indian family who travels to america to study and ends up an exchange student in the house of a dysfunctional american family. the story raises questions of nationality versus human nature, the loneliness of the human soul, and the search for affection in a world devoid of love.while the story itself may have worked, it's written in a boring, almost expository manner. desai doesn't spend time developing her characters and they come across as flat. they seem puppets in a play rather than people. the novel is extremely plot driven and jam packed with too many issues and too little exploration.i would rather have a simple story and a world of breathing, true to life characters than a story filled with issues and characters that don't emote. this book gave me a good look at how not to write prose."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this book!","review":"Anita Desai has the ability to see both sides of the story.Fascinating material!Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Snap Shot not a Story","review":"There was no story in this book, just snap shots of life. Nothing really happened, it was like a smooth flow of water, undisturbed and undeterred. If I thought that this book would give me an insight into an Indian family, I was not satisfied. The characters in Uma's family seemed to be stereotyped, following a well defined path and so was Uma. She was not happy with her life, but she didn't want to do anything about it. So the story just stayed in one place, never moving, never changing course. Arun was even more of a mystery. We never really got to know him. He just floated around without any anchor and without purpose. Unlike other books written by Indian writers, this book was written well. There were no long winding descriptions and horrendously constructed sentences. This is a good book to read, but don't expect Booker Prize quality, whatever that means. The last three Booker Prize winners I read, disappointed me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely more Fasting than Feasting!","review":"Very disappointing work from one of my favourite authors. Minimal character development, hardly any plot to speak of, stereotypical in the extreme, 'Fasting, Feasting' is a very pale reflection of the earlier (and stupendous) 'Clear Light of Day'. The attempt to juxtapose an eastern family dynamic versus a western one, without fully exploring either, came off as forced and disjointed ..and left each narrative feeling incomplete and unfulfilling to the reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Can't Believe How Bad This Was!","review":"As much as the writing style is nice and it is easy reading, this book is so depressing with no likable character, that it became painful to finish. The depiction of the \\"Typical American Family\\" is so contrived it's rediculous. At some points I almost started laughing.Overall I would absolutely not recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two lives","review":"These are two stories which stand on their own: one of a woman whose personal needs are forever postponed by family and society obligations and the other of a family incapable of discerning the needs of its members and of its visitor. The juxtaposition of these stories increases their impact, for both deal with the everyday accumulation of pressures and frustrations, which can amount to a lifetime of doom or to life-threatening actions. Desai's characters are imprisoned by their inability to change their own expectations or those placed upon them by others. Anita Desai's marvelous command of language transforms, with tender irony and a light sense of humor, these otherwise gloomy lives into delightful characters despite their fragility. It is pure magic and a pleasure to read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Soul-less","review":"The first thing about this book is you can't really can't place these characters and when exactly did this happen? The setting. Some small town, where the mother actually gets a girl to drop out from school when the baby brother is born. Sending the boy abroad for an undergrad education is not exactly a small town aspiration, and that too to MIT, no less! The boy can't even rejoice at he thought of this escape leaves the shores determined not to enjoy any of it and ,of course, he has no plans at all of changing any of this. His elder sister who looks like an old maid now. He is so dead and so are all the characters in this book. Very , very Disappointing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Who Are these People","review":"This book is written from two perspectives: Uma's and Arun's. I felt after I read the book I had no better understanding of either Uma or Arun and their struggles. I wasn't quite sure why Arun was so standoffish and simply afraid of people. Poor Uma, but I did not feel that sorry for her.This book was boring and lacked insight. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tasheba's Makeup (miami, fl)","review":"Dennesa Myricks deserves a reward for such a job well done on this step by step instructional video.

However, I didn't find the book to be as comprehensive as I thought it would be. I can name two wonderful toddler parks in Kirkland that were not even mentioned in the book.

It is close to unusable. In trying to dumb down the interface for kids they have made it a sinkhole of frustration for everyone.

I'm an amateur violinist, having taken lessons from the age of six till I was an adult and now I play on and off. It took a few minutes to set up the bridge and tune the strings, but once properly tuned they don't slip, and the bridge works fine for me. The violin is comfortable to play, doesn't bother my family and friends, and it's such fun playing around with the tone and volume - it sounds like a rock band at high volume, if you can stand it in the headphones... It even comes complete with a reasonable bow, rosin, a little cushion (that I haven't tried), headphones, a cord to connect to an amp, and a surprisingly nice carry case - think electric guitar style.Extremely impressive and a lot of fun - I'm amazed they can do it at this price!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware","review":"Mine arrived with an uncut bridge and faulty pegs (plastic), that would not stay and couldn't be restrung (do to the holes being cut too close to the end of the peg).

I do not reccomend this. It is a bad violin."},{"rating":"1","title":"It arrived with a moldy case, and the pegs are unusable","review":"One thing is to recieve a cheap product and another is receive something that's molding through. I had to wash the canvas \\"case\\" from the molding on it, as well as rub down the violin and stuff. I thought I was getting a half priced 100$ quality violin, but I really received something worth about half of the 60 something that I paid.Sound quality is pretty nice, however the biggest issue is that the violin won't stay tuned for longer than 2 minutes. The pegs are garbage and I am still trying to find a way to make this violin playable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Do It.","review":"It's not a bad sounding instrument, especially with as cheap as it is, but you can't vibrato on it. In order to vibrato you have to be able to hold the violin up using nothing but your chin and shoulder, but with the shape of this it's impossible. It does come with a shoulder rest, but it's very small and will not support the weight of the violin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keep an eye on those headphones","review":"\\"I've wanted to take up violin for a few months and finally just bought one. Delivery was quick and it was double packaged to ensure safe arrival. The violin, bow, case, cloth, and amp cord were in excellent condition. The resin was a little beat up, but no big deal. However, I discovered the headphones don't work properly a few days after their arrival. Only 1 side works; jiggling the cord gets the other to work, but movement makes it cut out. I was happy with the violin, but upset to find out I paid for malfunctioning headphones."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT WHAT I EXPECTED","review":"OKAY THIS THING IS EXTRMELY BEAUTIFUL, IVE BEEN PLAYING VIOLIN FOR 7 YEARS NOW, AND SHOULD HAVE KNOWN TO STICK WITHMY ACOUSTIC, I GUESS I GET WHAT I PAID FOR. MY FIRST TIME GETTING IT THE ELECTRONICS DID NOT WORK AT ALL, AND I HAD A PAGEANT SO THAT WAS VERY UPSETTING. THE STRINGS WERE POPPING LEFT TO RIGHT AND THE BRIDGE IS WAY TO BIG, MY ADVICE IF YOU WANT TO GET AN ELECTRIC SOUND TO YOUR VIOLIN, BUY A PICKUP."},{"rating":"1","title":"Violin wasn't as I expected","review":"The electric violin's fingerboard was messed up and parts of it was chipped off.Not only that, the chin rest was missing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine Tuners","review":"Traditional acoustic violins use only one fine tuner because additional fine tuners negatively affect the natural resonance of the violin. Once you have been playing for several years, you get used to tuning with the pegs, one-handed. For novice players, it's usually better to learn how to play a violin properly first before starting with an electric violin. However, the extra fine tuners are much needed for beginners and probably don't affect the piezoelectric pickups on electric violins as much as the sounding box on acoustic violins. Acoustic violins aren't 'lame', though; the multimillion dollar Stradivari and Guarneri violins can project sound throughout a huge concert hall, with absolutely no help from amplifiers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good enough, while it worked","review":"The quality of this violin is pretty cheap. When it comes, it doesn't even have fine tuning screws. That was my first clue that maybe I should have bought a more expensive violin. My second clue came a week ago when the headphone jack stopped working halfway through playing. The violin worked for three and 1/4 sessions.But, while it was working the sound coming from the headphones wasn't atrocios. The bow was ok, too. So if you get lucky and the violin doesn't break while you're playing it, its not bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth the price","review":"i bought this item because i had never heard of electric violins and it sounded like it would be really cool. it arrived within a week but when we tried to set it up the instructions that came with it were for an accoustic violin and so they didnt even apply to the one i was trying to set up. the strings are frayed and my husband wont let me go near it because hes worried a string will snap and hurt me. also you cant tune this instrument. all the strings are too loose to play and if you try to tighten them they just turn right back. i really wish i wouldnt have wasted 80 dollars on this cheap violin that just sits in a closet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great as a back-up violin","review":"My daughter was to begin taking violin after Christmas, so I let her use my violin and ordered this violin as a back-up violin. This is a pretty good violin."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I would have know this condition I would never have bought it.","review":"When I first opened it up, I was excited, compared to the reviews, I thought minor repairs wouldn't be that bad. There is a small chip on it which the 4th string catches on, and if it does at least it's staying in place, Otherwise it easily falls under the neck, and the key to turn and tune it will not tighten at all to fix this. The receiver under the cords are loose. And I can only hear noise when I pluck the strings with my fingers and I hear nothing when it comes to using the bow EVEN with it plugged into my amp. Otherwise, yes, it came with all that they said it came with, but this Violin needs more work than I want to put into a new instrument. I'm returning it, and never buying this kind ever again. Want a Electic Violin? Please save yourself the trouble and look at another."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great violin!","review":"I purchased this violin not expecting much, but it arrived in great condition. I took it to my local Music and Arts Center and they were so impressed with it that one of the music teachers decided to buy one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ok to start with","review":"I do not know violins very well, but I do play bagpipes at the more advanced level of skill so I know that when you go to buy an instrument, you can't buy one from just anywhere and expect it to last your entire musical career. I want to learn to play so I bought this violin knowing that I would get what I paid for it. The headphone jack seems to have broken (by the second day) so now I can only get sound out of one side of my headphones (if any sound at all because sometimes there's not). I understand that this probably isn't the best quality violin out there, but it was cheap and I know that as I get better, I'll have to upgrade my instrument. So to make a long story short (providing that you'll still be able to hear yourself play) this is a good buy for beginners, but don't get too attached to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"So purchased this violin and upon receival there was no instruction manual and the bow was completely falling apart. I figured oh well let me try plugging it in and hearing how it sounds but nope it doesnt work. I cant even get a note out of it when I plugged it into my amp and when I asked the seller about any possible reasons or how to resolve this they basically said tough luck your money is ours now! So BUYERS BEWARE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"This book is not very good, it is fantastical and epic in scope, but not in prose. The writing is very passive, and all the dialogue is inserted within discription, and it is very frustrating to get used to.The story is also frustrating, I kept wanting to the main character to use his common sense and not get tricked by the evil characters, but he is too naive to do this.Since Kafka never actually visited America, this book has an air of myth about it, the way people overseas may talked about America at the time. A place with riches and oppurutunites around every corner, but with just as many unjust people waiting to take advantage of you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Black Metal!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Unfortunately, I don't own a copy of this album yet, but will soon enough. That does not mean I haven't heard it, for I have listened to it at a friends house over and over again.Anyway, to the point, this is ultra-morbid extreme art. From the hills of Austria comes a black metal band which fuses brutality and melody and do it with a certain proficiency that is unmatched. I would recommend this to any black metal fan who desires being ripped to shreds.

Why lose everything at the same time?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good insurance policy","review":"Many people depend on the hotsync feature with their PC to save their data in case of a loss of battery or the old \\"Fatal Exception\\" error. Re-syncing with your PC only brings back your data ( phone numbers,appointments,etc) not all the programs you have loaded on the Visor. You probably didn't save the original file you downloaded, so know you have to go find them on the web again. This module saves everything so you don't have to worry. It's saved me lots of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"One oopsie and this will save your life!","review":"All I can say is that this one piece of hardware will save your sanity should you ever need to perform a hard reset. I had to, once, and was so happy to have this thing. Hotsynching, alone, does not necessarily back up everything from your PDA. Restoring from your last Hotsynch doesn't necessarily replace all of your data. This module gives you 100% peace of mind by providing 100% back up and restore capabilities. If you don't have a PC/Mac to hotsynch with, then this is the only way to go. Trust me when I say this, the first time you have to perform a hard reset and you slip this module into your Visor and opt for restore you'll be grateful.

It has changed my life for the better! I am a telecommuter between 2 cities, and this magical instrument has made all the difference for me. I cannot imagine doing without it, and the enhancement of the module system assures me that it should be serviceable for the foreseeable future.

Actually, if they marketed this module w/the Visor, it would be a big sell."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stop Working without a Net","review":"Having this unit installed in my Visor has been great. I never worry about lost data because I just hit the backup button all the time. For me, it's kind a routine - I hit sync, then I hit backup, then I don't worry anymore.

No one who has heard this CD has ever failed to comment on it, in fact I had to ship it in from another state because it was so popular in Minneapolis. The blending of their voices is beautiful, the best part is that they don't try to change these traditional songs to \\"personalize\\" it with their style as so many artists do.

However, there are limitations on how fluid the story transitions. There is no commonality for many children and this book will have a limited audience. It is too much for a child under 5 to understand and this is too simplified for a child older than 8. The story does not flow very smoothly and is more of a biographical depiction rather than a bedtime story for the masses.The intentions of spending time with your child and treating her like a princess for a day is a great concept but the story seems to fall short.Unfortunately, this book won't become a classic, even with its \\"Celebrity Appeal\\".It's worth a read at the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what i expected","review":"I purchased this book because it was written by a country singer and I was actively looking for material that illustrated songs I have in my classroom repertoire.

These plates are fine for placing food on them, and for the dishwasher, however, two of them have already cracked and broken while re-heating food in the microwave. The first time surprised me and I thought that there must have been a flaw in that plate. When it happened the second time the same way, I realized that these plates are NOT well made and should not be placed in the microwave. I recall that both times occurred when the food wasn't hot the first time, and I hit the microwave for another minute. Both plates' outer edge cracked ALL the way around and separated from the base.

At first, it wasn't bad, as though the author had actually tried to build a good story.Sadly, the story falls apart at the end, with a comepletely unbelieveable climax, brought on by the cheap plot trick of holding back information from the reader, and introducing new characters to deliver it. Furthermore, one character described as frail and old and ill suddenly morphs into a sly, quick-moving and powerful danger, now with a \\"beefy arm\\". The entire conclusion was completely lame, makeing it seem that the author was in a hurry to slap the book together and be done with it.I was unimpressed. Normally, when I discover a writer new to me, I try to find all the books he has published, knowing I can trust him for a good read. In this case, I won't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"I couldn't even stand to watch it all...","review":"I can't say I thought this would be good. Especially with the lousy actor Ben Affleck playing the lead. It has a terrible plot and really lame script. The acting.....well Ben affleck is terrible but all the other actors \\"seem\\" pretty good up next to him. As far as special effects go, They're either good or really cheesy. The only real reason I saw this in the first place was because it's one of the movies that \\"Scary Movie 4\\" is supposed to parody....I can't wait for that. So if you want a good superhero movie, I'd suggest Spiderman or the X-men movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"What?!","review":"Duncan Wong is obviously a very skillful yoga practitioner, and this DVD shows it -- but that's pretty much all you get: a pretty show of Wong's abilities. If you're a beginner, forget it. There's no instruction for any of the moves, he just jumps right in and goes -- and he goes fast. You have no idea if you're doing anything right: are my feet right? Am I breathing right? Is my torso right? Nothing. I thought I would just follow along, but I had zero confidence I was doing anything correctly, so whats the point?

If you're a traditional Ashtanga practitioner, this is not the video for you. If you're new to yoga, or do Bikram or other variations, this is probably a good video to buy. I think Duncan Wong is talented and gifted. Yet he does not practice traditional yoga, in its purest sense. i don't know that he even claims to. This is his variation and projection of yoga and he is entitled to that.

Sure, they're \\"cute\\" to look at, but to be honest, most people today won't be proud to go out wearing sweaters like these. They're not very trendy, and for this reason I think it would be better to find a knitting book with attractive sweaters that are difficult to make, instead of this book right here.

Sure, the picture is better than DVD but I expect more for a movie with such a huge fan base. I think they will have to re-master this and re-release the trilogy in some kind of box set. Save your money for that. I strongly disagree that this is a \\"A must buy for HD DVD owners\\" or that it \\"looks 10 times better\\". The film looks grainy, if this was re-mastered or intentional I find the result to be annoying. Universal did not bother to include a Dolby TrueHD track or alternative high resolution audio format that takes advantage of the HD format.

It was corny. How corny? Well, Iowa comes to mind. So I think the director was very wise to do a loose adaptation. Damon is terrific as Jason Bourne. Understated and fantastic in the action sequences. His German co-star is also excellent. It is a masterful piece of film making. Sure, it may may cross over from \\"film\\" to \\"movie\\" in places, but all in all it's a completey satisfying spy movie. Well shot. Well directed. Well edited. And marvelous sound design.

That comes to a train-wreck of an end when Damon eyes a young lady. One cliche after another and their on the road together. The film looks good and is well excecuted by director Doug Liman. The story however is slow and predictable just a short way in to it. The extras are good - including commentary, an alternate ending, and deleted scenes. But the relationship is dumb and it takes the movie down for me. For a good Matt Damon film about relationships however strange they maybe check out 'The Talented Mr. Ripley' co-starring Jude Law."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has nothing to do with the book ...","review":"This movie is only surpassed by \\"The Jackal\\" (with Bruce Willis and Richard Gere) as the worst remake of an action/spy movie. Apart from the fact that the main character is named \\"Jason Bourne\\", is found floating in water, and has a swiss bank account, this movie has nothing to do with the book on which it is based. The suspense in the book is replaced by Matt Damon ripping apart a US consulate and a cheap car chase scene where he outruns Paris' finest in a rusty old Mini Cooper ...If you want to see the movie based on the book, get the made for TV version with Richard Chaimberlain instead.

It does not follow the chronological order of the book. The name Carlos the Jackal is NOT even mentioned. They do not mention that Marie is a PHD, and she willingly joins him. He tells her everything from the get go. In the book he kidnaps her and does not come clean until near the end. The closing scene in the book at the safe house is not even in the movie. Based on this movie they have no intention of doing the next two books. It is almost impossible. This movie is as far away from the book as it can get."},{"rating":"1","title":"help! i've forgotten my movie cliches!","review":"I will try to keep this short and sweet. The action sequences are well done (the camera work actually makes Damon look like he can disarm multiple assailants). Unfortunately, the plot is full of holes and leaves you feeling unsatisfied. First, how likely is it that a trained killer will have a change of heart at the crucial moment? (maybe after he's slaughtered the whole family). Second, I still don't know how/why Damon/Bourne suffered from amnesia. It's true that he suffered from some trauma, but complete oblivion? Give me a break. Finally, why on earth did Potente (sp?) stay with Bourne/Damon and risk her life and that of her family? It makes no sense whatsoever. At least with a cheesy Bond flick you know that you are in the realm of the absurd and that you should just sit back and accept implausiblity after implausibility. But when a movie makes a claims towards verisimilitude/reality, and fails miserably, then it deserves to be panned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Okay okay, so it's good.","review":"I did NOT want to see this movie. Quite frankly, up until two weeks ago, the last thing I wanted to see was another movie with Matt Damon in it. However, after seeing this movie, I'm ready for some more!This movie flat out rocks.

The DVD is very disappointing with a making-of that doesn't even show how they made the movie, but shows only actors talking about how great the movie and the director are. There is a alternate ending so stupid, it is gonna make you run to the store to get you cash back. This is very boring, I suggest that we prey to God so that Hollywood doesn't make a sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the book","review":"What can I say? I was enormously disappointed. I've been a fan of Robert Ludlum for probably 15 years. This movie was a resonably decent \\"action/adventure\\" -- but it bore little resemblence to the novel I loved.And Matt Damon? As Jason Bourne? I don't THINK so!If you want to see a somewhat entertaining example of this genre, rent -- don't buy. But if you are a purist (or at least like your book to movie translations to be recognizable) you won't care much for this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and Predictable","review":"This spy movie is a total nonsense. The character appears in the middle of nowhere, with amnesia, knowing many languages and fighting like a ninja. He runs away from different people - everybody wants to kill him. This movie is a recipe for success - there is a good boy, a pretty girl, one romantic scene and lots of action - but it's so boring and predictable. For me, the worst part is the end. The effects are very good, but not enough to give support to a ludicrous story. I don't intend to see the sequel and I would suggest you do the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bour-ing","review":"... I was anxious for this to end very early into the movie. It was not that entertaining at all. If you want a good movie for 2002, check out Signs. It'll keep you on the edge of your seat. This movie will just make you want to leave your seat!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't belive the hype....","review":"This was a real bad movie. Lots of shooting and explosions and no story at all. I laugh at how many good reviews this movie got. It seems the American public do not know what movies are anymore, nor do joke studios like Universal."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Boring Identity","review":"I would have fallen a sleep but was on a date.weak plot, stale, dragged on.Matt Damon better read the script before doing a movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could it have been any worse?","review":"Terrible, terrible, terrible...I would give this one NO stars but that's not an option.Did anyone involved with this movie read the book?!!!About the only parts that had anything to do with the book written by Robert Ludlum was the first fifteen minutes of the movie, the name of the lead character, and the name Treadstone 71. The rest came from some...script writer's head.Gone are the intricate plot twists and surprises that make a Robert Ludlum novel so much fun and difficult to put down. They've taken the title of a great book and made it into a (hopefully) forgettable movie that will have the Author turning in his grave. I cannot believe how horrible this movie was made..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shame on who made this","review":"This is a great movie but whoever made the dvd really messed up the captions. The extended version has no captions and the other it is more subtitles and difficult to turn on. If the extended has no captions someone tell me the point of buying this dvd?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time.","review":"This movie was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I was exspecting what they said in the comercials. I thought that this was going to be a non stop action, edge of your seat movie. That was way off the mark. Many of the action scenes were so boring I had to fight off sleep, which on secound thought would have been a relief so I would not have to suffer through any more of this movie.If you read the book you will hate this movie more than the people that did not. This was the worst movie adaptation of a book since The Firm. Carlos is not in it, instead the good guy from the book Conklin is the big bad guy.So once again don't waste your time with this. You want to see a good movie in this genre, see Mission Imposible or James Bond or an even less well known movie the Advengers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flipper Disc","review":"Watch out for this version of the Blu Ray + DVD. This is a Flipper Disc meaning one side of the disc is the Blu Ray and on side of the disc is DVD. You shouldn't have a problem if this kind of thing doesn't bother you. I just wish they'd say it on the package so those of us that are bothered by it would know."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intense action with a human element","review":"I am a big fan of this series. Matt Damon is perfect as the \\"broken\\" assasin who is trying to find out his real identity after he short-circuits after a botched assasination attempt. I won't bother with a full review of the movie but the action sequences are captivating while Damon's portrayal of Jason Bourne is very believable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Movie, Awesome Sound","review":"i was wanting to buy this dvd at walmart, but then i though, hey... maybe amazon has it so i checked on here and they had a HD dvd version for about a 10th of the price, so i went for it, and i wasn't disappointed! the picture is amazing, and the sound is flawless (using Logitech Z5500 5.1 system via optical connection)! will definately be buying more HD DVD's in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Action Movie Ever","review":"A friend and I watched the Bourne Identity on a fluke. We were on our way back from dinner and decided last minute to stop and rent a movie and this was the first one to catch our eyes. It was about 20 minutes into the film that we realized this was going to be an awesome movie. There were so many cool action scenes. It is an \\"edge of your seat\\" spy thriller about a government agent who is pulled out of the ocean with two bullet holes in his back and turns out to have amnesia and cannot remember who he is. However, a bunch of natural instincts start coming to him, like when two cops confront him and he beats both of them up in like 3 seconds flat.This movie has so many awesome action scenes. There is even a car chase with a Mini Cooper. The story was a little confusing and I still do not understand many parts of it, but the movie was so great that I really do not care. I figure I will watch it again many more times and eventually figure out all that was going on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great...","review":"The book is definitely different and perhaps a little better than the movie; however, I've enjoyed the movie tremendously. It may be different than the book, but it still kept me on the edge of my seat. I got the same feeling of \\"this is fantastic\\" when I watched the movie as when I read the book. The book goes into A LOT of details about minor things. I don't believe they could have made the movie exactly as the book. If they had, it would have been a 10 hour long movie. As it is, I loved it. I wish The Bourne Supremacy was as good the the Identity, but hopefully The Bourne Ultimatum, the movie, will be better than Supremacy. I still enjoyed both and am looking forward to the third installment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie, great DVD!","review":"This movie is not classic, but it is really good. Mind-boggling action, mind-boggling story make this movie a good one for ages 15+. The DVD is great too, with both the orginial theatrical version and the extended edition with the alternate ending and alternate opening edited back in to the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Escapism at it's best!","review":"I saw this at a midnight showing while my wife and her friend saw \\"Ya - Ya Sisterhood\\". First let me say that I exited with the desire to see this film again as soon as possible while my counterparts were highly disappointed with their choice. I did not see the huge plot holes that are mentioned by other reviewers. The fact that it is called the Bourne Identity only tells us that Bourne is the identity that he stumbles onto first. He could just as easily stepped into another life. The action is outstanding and the suspense mounts perfectly. I am eagerly awaiting the DVD release so that I can lose myself in this movies excellent locales and non-stop action anytime I feel the need."},{"rating":"2","title":"A really great movie","review":"This is the best movie I've seen for a while. With all of the really [junky] movies that have come out recently, I was really glad to have finally found a good one. The Bourne Identity was intense and it kept me on the edge of my seat. I've seen it twice already and I'm planning to buy it on DVD. Matt Damon and his co-star were a great pair, and I felt that Damon's performance was unusually convincing and interesting. If you've been trying to decide which movie to go to, don't see Scooby Doo or undercover brother (though that was pretty funny), see the Bourne identity. If you've already seen the Bourne Identity, give The Sum of All Fears a try--thet was pretty good as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy the hype!","review":"There is absolutely nothing and I mean nothing explosive about the extended edition. It has a slightly different begining and a modified ending. But it is boooooring. Don't waste your money. The theatrical release version is a better bet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extended DVD is not up to the mark","review":"The movie is a piece of art. One of my all time favorites. The Extended edition DVD is very badly compiled. The Bonus features are sub par with bad video quality. The alternate ending and beginning look like they are from a totally different film, and do not have the BI look and feel. Other special features are small and without much substance. The extended edition of the film itself is not spectacularly extended. It is not a director's cut (the DVD states this upfront in the opening credits) so it not fun to watch. Don't get this if you are looking for a LOTR style extended edition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken Case","review":"I purchased the Bourne movie and it arrived in fine time however, the DVD case was smashed. I was very disappointed by this since it was going to be a gift... \\"Merry Christmas, here's a broken present.\\" I will not be shopping with blowout inc next time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MOVIE WITCH CAN BE A REALITY .....","review":"C.I.A.

I was very disappointed that this dvd didn't work in any dvd players or on my lap top. I was so looking forward to watching this movie and was very upset it didn't work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great movie, but .....","review":"Great movie but it does not include either spanish audio or spanish subtitles in HD version. What is happening with Universal Studios? Why do they include spanish subtitles in standard dvd version and not in HD version. It stinks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"The Bourne movies are extremely boring. The pacing is slow and the plots are uninteresting. Jason Bourne is an unlikable character and has no personality what so ever. I honestly cannot understand why anyone likes these movies. Instead of this movie series I recommend Casino Royale which is a lot more thrilling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bourne rocks","review":"I had serious doubts before seeing this movie. I just didn't think Matt Damon could pull off a good action hero role.BOY WAS I WRONG.Damon's performance is one of the best \\"action hero\\" roles since Bruce Willis in Die Hard. The plot is nothing new, probably because it's been copied from the original Bourne books so many times before that it's already predictable once it gets to the big screen. It's forgivable though, as the action sequences are tight and frantic, with decent enough acting and dialogue in between to make it more than \\"just\\" an action movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"The talented Matt Damon","review":"With so many meaningless action movies nowadays, most of them are just pieces of fight sequences glued with weak acting and nonexistant plot. \\"The Bourne Identity\\" is not a bad action movie, but never steps above average material either. Matt Damon is ok as the lost Jason Bourne and Doug Liman knows how to make some creative and credible action sequences, but the plot is still typical and not very different from so many other spy films. The predictable ending doesn\`t help, either.While it is moderately entertaining, \\"The Bourne Identity\\" never achieves that \\"something\\" that could make it a must-see. A well-made product, but not much else. Let\`s wait for the sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"better than you'd expect","review":"I thought this movie was gonna be a bore but this one is really a keeper. it puts a lot of action and suspense into one ball and lets it explode. damon is excellent as jason bourne and franka potente is beautiful as always. clive owen is great in a supporting part as the professor(he's the one who gets shotgunned by damon in the field). all in all it pays off and its wonderfully made and the stunts are great. damon is really doing all his stunts"},{"rating":"2","title":"predictable, but still engaging, entertaining.","review":"While I agree with other reviewers that this film is somewhat predictable, it is nevertheless very engaging and entertaining, and I plan to watch it again. Damon is surprisingly well suited for the role and it doesn't insult your intelligence- everything is plausible. Think of it as Mission Impossible, only not silly like it was. Good supporting cast also. Definitely worth owning. A movie you will most likely watch several times, and still enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Bourne Identity a close 2nd to the book","review":"Great action guy flick. It reminded me of The Saint, however, Matt Damon has a greater range as an actor then Val Kilmer. Overall the story is fast paced and action packed. Also the chick in the movie is a POA"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Bourne Identity","review":"As soon as I saw this movie in the theatres, I went out and bought the book immediately. I recommend both items. This movie will look great on any movie buff's list."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great conditon","review":"Dvd plays great, came with out scratches and doesn't skip or get stuck. I love the Borne movies and had to complete the set."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get seasick from the camera motion!","review":"It could have been a good movie, pretty good plot. But the producer opted for lots of filler - violence instead of good acting and camera action so fast it makes you dizzy from not being able to focus on a scene for more than 1/10 of a second! Watched it to the end, but was disappointed with the lack of real quality. Really hated that most of the movie involved the camera swinging back and forth, up and down and around. It was enough to give one a seizure!"},{"rating":"1","title":"decent action flick","review":"Bourne Identity is good if you like \\"on the run\\" type movies. The plot of this film seemed very similar to The Saint. If you have seen The Saint, you might be a little disapointed with the Bourne Identity."},{"rating":"2","title":"A brilliant movie","review":"This was such a cool concept for a movie. It was fun sharing in Bourne's surprise as he realized what he was capable of. Amazing action sequences and a gripping story."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Bourne Identity kept us on the edge of our seats . . .","review":"Matt Damon is amazing as Jason Bourne. If you like good writing, non-stop action, and suspense right up to the end of the movie, this is the movie for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it","review":"I love Matt Damon and the quality of the movie is awesome. In my opinion you all need this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is it?","review":"Same comment as for the previous one. I love the Bourne movies but I don't know where to watch this video. Where is it?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A New Start","review":"This is the start of the new series, the acting and story are better than the original movie. This flows into the next movie just like the books did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great spy movie with amazing shots of Paris and fight scences","review":"The Bourne Identity is a great spy movie with great job by Damon as the main character. The movie itself keeps your intrest all the way threw from start to finish. What did it for me was the fight and car chase scences, I mean having high car chase scence threw heart of Paris priceless. Plus the stunts in the movie helps make the movie amazing and very enjoyable. So if you yet to watch this movie pick it up and savor a great spy flick with amazing shots of country side and city of Paris, plus great acting by the actors in it and action scences that will blow you away everytime you watch it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie","review":"Saw it before. Looked for it. Found it. Enjoyed it againWill watch the others on the series too. Good dtuff"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Bourne Franchise","review":"The Bourne Identity (2002) is one of this years most unusual action films, tossing aside all that is Matrix style action and going for a more old fashioned style director Doug Liman has found himself with a hit. The action style perfectly portrays the person that Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) is supposed to be.After having been left for dead in the Mediterranean Sea, Jason Bourne has no idea what is name is, where he's from, or what he does. The only things he knows scare him and he must find out what he used to do before assassins kill him.With excellent plot twists, well choreographed action scenes (mostly done by Damon), good acting and an intriguing premise, the Bourne Identity is a movie that belongs in any action lover's collection.The only thing that really keeps the DVD from receiving a 5 out of 5 is the extras are less than great, deleted scenes have not been put together very well, and the extras are sparse in general.That said I can't recommend this film enough. Buy it now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book vs. The Movie","review":"I love action films that actually have a riviting plot and good acting. This film fulfilled all of my wishes. I loved it so much that I went and saw it again. I later read the book, which was incredibly different than the movie. Personally, I liked the book a lot more. It is pretty big but so riviting that it will go so quickly. I just bought the rest of the Bourne Trilogy. I hope that they make the next two books into movies. Get this movie, and the book. The book is not a substitute for the film, and the movie does not take the place of the book. They are both so good!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is outstanding, but not Ludlum","review":"I don't want to mislead you, this is one of my favorite films. I bought the Ludlum trilogy, and they have little to do with this movie and the Supremacy. Given that, this movie is a great thriller, just oustanding. The music is pretty cool too. I could watch it many, many times, and not get bored. The actors are just outstanding - Damon, Franka Potente and all are just outstanding."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cliche to the maximum.","review":"Everyone keeps talking about how cliche this movie is, but then they add in \\"the fact that Damon plays a spy with amnesia on the run is the most original thing about this movie\\" and how wrong could they be? I guess no one seems to remember a movie starring Gena Davis and Samuel L. Jackson called 'The Long Kiss Goodnight' where Davis plays a spy with amnesia, and she eventually teams up with Jackson, with whom she barely knows, and they are on the run from Davis's former employee. Despite good (but done-before) action sequences the movie just falls short. Matt Damon played a better role than expected (it was kind of hard to accept him as an action star) but still, the movie is completely and tiredly unoriginal. For action fans who don't mind seeing the same old thing over again, I will suggest it. But for those of you looking for something new, I would skip this and wait until it came out on video. It's just not that great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait... Did I miss something?","review":"Truth be told, I was completely excited to see this movie. After watching the riveting previews, I bought the book to read before hand. Wow! the book was fantastic! But getting to my point. This movie feels like one long preview. There's some epic on your seat chase scenes, and heart warming reunions, but you keep thinkin gto yourself, wait, did I miss something? this can't be the actual movie right? it seems Matt Damon, (giving the best performance he could do with this minimal plot) runs around the whole movie, and can't figure out what the point was. This is nothing like the book, and you're most likely going to be better off reading it than seeing the movie. If you are like me, you will finish it staring blankly at the screen, and saying:Huh?Your better off watching the preview, it just about explains the whole movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Premise Works","review":"Damon does good job of making his CIA superagent hard-nosed, yet emotional, and most of all believable.No he's not Bond, or Vin Diesel in XXX, but Damon comes through as true and real and likeable, as trained CIA agent losing memory, trying to find out who he is, while showing off his secret agent skills. Kinda like that movie \\"The Professional\\".One of the reasons Ludlum's books were so popular, was that his main character was always human, typically with some personal or emotional challenge. This human nature set against the backdrop of CIA and counter-intelligence, made for good entertainment. The movie does the same job admirably, go see it if you can."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fans of the book, The Bourne Identity, don't bother","review":"If you are a fan of the book, This is not it.While a few, very few, plot points have been kept character names and title is all that is left from the excellent book. Not even one of the main plot points, not to mention character, has been kept.This is a first rate example of artistic license run amok. While it is a good movie it needs to have it's name changed to \\"The Re-Bourne Identity\\".All they did was use the Title of a best selling book to sell a movie.I give it 1 stars as an action movie. No stars are awarded for screen adaptation of the book. If this was not a blatant attempt to sell a movie based on title recognition it would have more stars. Hollywood needs to have more respect for the public not to mention the author. Artistic license must have it's limits."},{"rating":"1","title":"Marie's Review","review":"I watched this movie. I expected that I would love it, just by looking at the title. Well It was all chase. But who was chasing who? And why were who chasing who? The movie needs a story. It needs content. It needs to be interesting. I don't recommend it. Even my 25 year old son didn't like it. I wish I could say something good. But I didn't like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"You've seen this all before","review":"You've seen all these elements a hundred times before: karate fights, shootings, car chases, romantic interludes.... It gets kind of old, doesn't it? The director throws all the elements above into a Waring blender, crossing his fingers that the resulting incomprehensible mishmash will prove \\"exciting\\" and marketable. This movie relies upon holding back information from the audience--information needed to understand the motives and actions--to represent itself as mysterious. To be fair, the sound engineering and editing are high quality, but breathless pace alone does not make a good movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"A goooooooooooooood Movie","review":"this movies was very good. it was one of my favorites. The next movie in the series the Bourne Supremacy looks good but doesn't exactly follow the main plot line of the book series. although it does look good and Matt Damon is a good actor i'm going to go see it. The story is suppose to take place in China I think. But anyways you should only buy one dvd od this movies cuz this dvd is a way to make money. This dvd is the same as anyother one. Dont waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgusting.","review":"When I first watched this movie, I had not read the book (an excellent story by Robert Ludlum). I could not figure out what was going on. The movie seemed to be a lot of this guy (Matt Damon, who does not belong in this role, I'm sorry) running around and making out with this girl. There was no dicernable plot, no recognizable conclusion.Then I read the book, and was horrified. I have truly never seen a worse butchering of a book by a movie, except perhaps Girl, Interrupted. Not only were the characters distorted and flattened and the plot garbled and spliced, the most important character was left out ENTIRELY.Read the book instead. If you haven't read it, you will wonder what the heck is going on. If you've already read the book, you will want to hit your head on large amounts of concrete.Don't watch this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Action Movie","review":"This was a fine action movie. The fight scenes were very good although at times you could tell that the film speed was advanced in order to make it look faster. It was also a theme that has been explored before (with Jackie Chan's 'Who Am I') with some success. With all that aside it was still an enjoyable movie. A movie about assassins and the CIA. About someone's personal struggle between good and evil and about a fledgling romance and wanting to be a better person. It was also about betrayal. This is a decent way to spend a few hours. Watch it and enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spy Kids for grown-ups","review":"Matt Damon is terrible. The cinematography is awful. The graphics are cheap. It's basically a movie version of CSI with a few more fight scenes.Terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smart plot,baaaad characters...","review":"This movie feautures a very smart plot,supported by a talented director,but is ruined by the really bad characters.You can't understand how they think,and worst of all,you can't like them.Especially Bourne.I mean,what's up with the guy?He's the ''good guy'',but he's always angry,shaking innoccent people just because things are not like he wants them to me.I've seen ''anti-heroes'' in films before,but not in action films,and not like that!He even bumps his girlfriend's back on the door at some point!Sorry Liman,but my opinion is that if the characters are bad,so is the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"The good reviews are Universal Studio employees","review":"Anyone who thought this was good must have worked on the film or worked for the studio. It was the most boring and poorly acted film I've seen in years. Matt: \\"The Battle of Shaker Heights\\" could actually be better then this."},{"rating":"1","title":"That sucked","review":"I watched the movie a week after I read the book, and that probably wasn't the best idea. The only part of the movie that follows the book is him waking up not knowing who he is, and having the number to the bank account in Zurich. That is where it ends. I tried to appreciate the movie as a movie, and not as an adaptation but I found it impossible and turned the movie off somewhere near the end. Not cool."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why?","review":"This is a decent movie if you live in a cave and have never seen a spy movie. Its main plotline is basically a gawky-teenager like spy fumbling his way through the movie trying to figure out who he is and how he got there. he, as well as the movie are completely laughable. The special effects are non-existant, the plot is thin, and unless you are a huge Damon fan then this movie is about as enjoyable as gigli."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucked","review":"This movie sucked a$$.
