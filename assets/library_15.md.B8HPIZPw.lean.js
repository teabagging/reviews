On the other hand, if you're looking for just a shot of the English Baroque composer, this single disc by Tafelmusik under Jeanne Lamon should pack all the punch you seek.

For good Purcell selections and great playing, this one is hard to beat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for fun","review":"This is a great disc.

The Aerobie has two major advantages over the classic \\"Frisbee\\":1) Very stable flyer - the Aerobie is far more stable and accurate than a standard \\"Frisbee\\", making it easy for even beginners to make decent throws.2) Soft edge - don't underestimate the importance of this feature. This greatly reduces the \\"finger trauma\\" commonly associated with catching a hard \\"Frisbee\\".

Along the way they jell,and get better and better to the point where they actually have a chance to make the big time.Of course money, sex and no leadership allows the band to become a walking bomb.

The formation of the band through it's many stages, and finally it's end, depict what many bands have been through including small time bands like the ones I've been in.

Music is really good though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should Be Called \\"The Committed\\"","review":"When the 'band' is performing, THE COMMITMENTS is excellent. However, in the final analyisis, the backstage squables among the band members overtakes the story and it becomes more of a nuisance than a story conflict device. The characters are well drawn out, the Dublin location shots are atmospheric, and the music and musical performances are all great. Yet,there seemed to be some fight (some of which were very physical, bloody, and abusive) or disagreement among the band members after each of the performances and it became too much of a distraction to enjoy the whole film. In some cases, it made some of the characters/band members come off as people who should be in an insane asylum. Overall, the film gets 2 stars because the fighting amongst the band members backstage overshadowed the great music that was performed onstage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining Portrayal of a Band","review":"This movie describes the inner-workings of a soul band. A group of working class Irish musicians collaborate to bring soul music to the people. Each of the band members bring something quriky to the table. Andrew Strong is especially outstanding as the lead singer as his brutish actions are quite comical especially the banter with the back up signers. The musical score is outstanding. Occasionally it is a bit difficult to make out some of the dialogue but overall the film is strong on charm."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING! NOT LETTERBOX!","review":"GREAT FILM!

Nesta is full of herself, and in a way, a poser. She thinks she MUST appear to be rich, and perfect before a boy will like her past her beautiful exterior.

The comparisons are tenuous at best, and such as they exist, they are not exactly fascinating.

I bought it anyway because flipping though the recipes looked very interesting, and I reasoned that if the author really felt that way about tofu, she probably wouldn't be writing a tofu cookbook... right?I've had the cookbook for a few months and probably made about a dozen different recipes so far. Every one has been a hit with me and with my family. Two of the soups have have already become family standards. My favorite is one with Thai red curry, coconut milk and butternut squash.

It leaves your skin oily, I would not call this moisturized, and I have skin that accumulates gunk very easily as I have naturally oily skin so for anyone who has similar skin I would skip out on this product and go for something natural that actually does the job.

Normally, I have students read and take notes from their text, The Language of Literature, as a prelude to studying the literature of a time period. However, with \\"senioritis\\" kicking in, I thought a documentary film would be a more engaging activity. Although it does not take much to put seniors to sleep, this film was difficult to stay awake for. The sound quality, when it came to the interviews (centered mostly on one expert), was poor. The excerpts from Dickens were extremely long and would have benefited from caricatures or illustrations instead of presenting a monologue by a narrator. Above all, their text introduces a wider range of issues and knowledge. After viewing the film, students took away little from the full picture of life in Victorian times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Show","review":"Our son (19M) loves these shows. We found them 'on demand' with our cable provider and then ordered them here. We do not let our little guy really watch any TV, but he can't get enough of these. Each episode is about 5 minutes, perfect length in my opinion (usually do a max of 3 with him). There are 3 main characters, but they have a lot of 'friends' that they interact with. These shows are more than just entertaining, they also teach little lessons as well. Highly recommend (we bought both season 1 and 2 so this will appear the same on both products for reviews)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Steppenwolf, over and over again.","review":"I love this book. It's like a breath of fresh air into a world you've never been. The book never has a boring moment; it's filled with deep, sophisticated poetry.

The layers of narration, from sober to fantastically drugged are nevertheless always in control because the author's style is clear and locked on the subject even though the descriptions go round and round echoing the psychological chaos that the main character goes through.Steppenwolfe can be thought of as a lesson in philosophy, as Hess mirrors ideas from Plato to Nietzsche, and as an attack on the averageness of the middle classes (not much of what he's pointing out has changed in seventy odd years) and there are probably many other individual ways of looking at it. Of course, this kind of novel appeals to lost youngsters but why not and why so? A complicated matter of latching on to comfort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confused man in Germany thinking about his position in life","review":"Too many metaphors, Hesse forgot what he was supposed to writ"},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS IS IN GERMAN!!!","review":"There is no way to tell from the Amazon page, but this version is in the orginal German language.

That is because, although I feel the first 3/4 of the novel fulfills the status of great literature, the ending completely degenerates. The beginning and middle of Steppenwolf are excellent psycological writing and even contain an engaging love story, in my opinion. Unfortunately, the end of the novel, the famous \\"Magic Theater\\" part, is in my opinion, hallucinatory in the worst sense of the word. Do I reccomend this book? Ultimatly, it is worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book to be read over and over!","review":"It seems no matter how many times I read Steppenwolf I find something new and wonderful with in it's pages.I've read all of Hesse's book's and this one is my absolute favorite. I always underline profound sentences in the Classics I read and with this one a sentence became whole chapters. The whole book is to be underlined.Hesse ensnares and amazes with his depth.

Its flaws are those to which I am most indifferent. This book tells a story, but it often goes into forays of sermonizing that seemed a little forced. A couple of times I had the distinct impression that I was at some sort of psychedelic self-improvement seminar. This may be a literary flaw, but I loved every minute of it, even at it's most didactic.I think this book touches on a very interesting and relevant concept. It is still timely today, for 2001 America has gone even further down the path that the Germany of Steppenwolf had embarked upon. I suppose the message could have been more comfortably wedded to the narrative, but I don't really care.I loved the book, warts and all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"It is a quick read so if one is interested they should pursue it, but with hesitation.

Herman Hesse name-drops elements of Eastern culture in an obnoxious attempt to make his novel more \\"exotic\\". The novel also reads like the pathetic wet dream of an old man. The protagonist of the book, a plain, bitter old man has sex with young, attractive women. And the protagonist openly acknowledges that he's really not drawn to them by their intelligence, only to their youth and good looks, going so far as to point out that one of the women really is too stupid for him. And there's a gratuitous hot-bisexual women scene.

Anderson must have deeply loved the country and its farms to have described it so wondrously. And his skill in depicting even the most minute of characters is quite remarkable. This ability to draw out of the smallest things such vivid detail, is really outstanding. I liked this book very much and would almost wish to return to those \\"old sweet things\\".

Yet, spontaneous violence sends an absolutely wrong message of physical superiority making \\"right\\" in a confrontational situation.My children turned out quite well, I think with equal parts luck, love, and parental boundries.

Very intuitive menu set up and the software works with little problems after the upgrade is installed. On the other hand the support on the website is horrid. The downloads dont work and the site seems more interested in selling their stuff and setting you loose for better or worse. I got an error each time i tried to download any file from the website. The only bad part of the player itself is that it is very large for an MP3 player. This isn't really too much of a problem when you consider that the massive hard drive holds more than many computer hard drives. I would reccomend this purchase only if you consider yourself good with computers and dont feel that updates are very important."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product, but wish I would have known...","review":"I really enjoy this product. I don't have that many MP3 or WMA files so there is a lot of room (I've used 5% of the resources). One reason I bought this over the Nomad III is because it had an FM tuner built right in, however, I hardly ever use this feature since all of my music is right on the player. One big thing I wish I would have known is that THE BATTERY IS NOT REMOVABLE, it is part of the player. It is a Li-Ion battery so nothing should happen to it but if I need more juice after the built-in battery runs out I have to plug it in. Rio DJ is awesome it is much easier for an auto-playlist to be built than to build one myself (which isn't hard to do right on the player and comes in very useful). I would suggest that no matter what player you choose that the player offers WMA compatablity. WMA files at 128 kb/s are so much better than their MP3 counterparts. Do look at this the Apple iPod and the Nomad III before considering a player."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I would not reccommend this MP3 player to anyone. The pro's: it can store alot of music (sounds good, huh). The cons are many (they out weigh the pro's by a mile).

The corporation that makes this doesn't seem to respond to e-mail...but I did forget to look up their rating in Consumer reports (my bad)."},{"rating":"1","title":"What about support?","review":"This player is OK at best. Yes it holds 20 gb of songs, which might be great if it had a useful search function, say to play all songs with \\"Tricky\\" in the filename or if it would play album tracks in numerical order. Imagine hearing the songs from Abbey Road in alphabetical order only. It's (stupid). If you run Windows 2000, the only software that will load songs into the player is a horrendous MoodLogic. Why wouldn't Rio's own RioPort Audio Manager work? Find something better. Good luck ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks Great, But Where's the Audio Out?!","review":"I thought this was superior to the Archos 20Gb, with better interface and FM tuner, only to be shocked to observe that the only output is via USB?

One was that I was going on deployments and was tired of carrying books of CDs that could get scratched, lost, or stolen. The 20 gig HD was perfect. The FM radio was an added bonus. And for a while, I loved this thing.However, when I had a problem with the battery, SONICBLUE would return my emails until I sent them 2 more. Then for no reason, the machine got stuck in a loop and would not come on. When I emailed SONICBLUE 3 times about this, they didn't even respond.I downloaded firmware, software, drivers and everything from the web site with no succes. It's been about 2 weeks since my last email and still no reponce. DONT BUY THIS PAPERWEIGHT. IT WILL CAUSE YOU GREAT FRUSTRATION. If nothing else I have said has convinced you, look at this.

However, the Rio Riot is also physically large and not 'shirt pocket size' like the iPod. You'll need both hands to use this clunky player. The Rio Riot also falls short with the slow USB connection. ... A 5 GB transfer to this player will take 7 hours. With the iPod, this would only take 20 minutes! Also the FM tuner is very weak and has trouble picking even the strongest stations. Bottom line: if you want a sleek mp3 player with ultra fast firewire and great battery life, get an iPod."},{"rating":"2","title":"You'll love this product but requires a learning curve","review":"I'm up & running after one day of tinkering with the software & hardware.

I'm happy to say that I don't see ANY problems with this unit. I'm very happy after one day of working out the complexities of the Riot. I don't need USB2.0. The transfer rates are very fast with 1.10. Beside how many users have 2.0 at this time. I don't. I use the XP OS and everything installed & works correctly.

My wife bought me the Rio Riot for our anniversary from Amazon.com and it's the first Rio product that really isn't up to par. I'm already a big MP3 music fan, so I have both iTunes and RealJukebox installed. You CANNOT use the Rio Riot with an existing copy of RealJukebox. I verified this with Rio tech support. The Rio Riot simply did not show up under iTunes no matter how many times I installed and used different USB cables. This definitely won't be my last Rio product, but I'm no longer going to buy their products so confidently.

How about firewire or USB 2.0?Although the screen is nice and big, the navigation is lacking. No ability to queue up songs and playlist management is difficult (also playlists cannot be managed by the software, only the player).The deal breaker is the battery. It is without a doubt low-tech. Each time you use the Riot you end up having to recalibrate the battery (takes about 13 hours).

I transferred all 20 gigs of my music from my other MP3 Player to this new Riot and now I'm [in trouble]. I deleted my music from the other player thinking that I now had it all on the new Riot. Well I do but you know what? Once it is on the Riot it's stuck and there is no way to get it off or transfer it back to a hard drive. I called their tech support and they said there is no way to get my music back. That is ridiculous considering the other 20 gig MP3 player I had was just a USB hard drive. So much better. And so much faster at transferring. This Riot is the slowest piece of garbage I have ever used. And you have to use Real Jukebox to transfer your files. There's no other choice. Whatever happened to open standards? My other MP3 Player even worked under Linux. This Riot is not worth the money at all. Go with another brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"A decent design, but ...","review":"The Rio Riot is a product that, to be blunt, needed about three more months of solid testing and \\"fixing\\" before being released. One of my biggest complaints, and one that isn't addressed much in others' reviews, has to do with battery charging.To begin with, the battery doesn't charge at all unless the player is turned on. (This is mentioned briefly in one of the paper \\"read me\\" documents in the box, but not in the manual itself.)What's worse, though, is that it the player doesn't hold its charge. A fully-charged player, turned off and sitting for about a day, loses roughly 20% of that charge. Leave it for a week, and you'd better plan on doing a full recharge before taking it anywhere, because it won't last an hour.Given the big price, the terrible software it ships with, and the alternatives in the market (including the iPod and the new Nomad), I couldn't recommend the Riot to a friend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea but poor design!","review":"I was looking for a 20 gig player and the Riot looked like the one for me! It only took me about 2 days to really hate this thing. The concept is great, but seems like it got lost in the design process. The USB 1.1 interface for transfering music files is painfully slow, I still cannot figure out why the designers did not use USB 2.0 or firewire? You have to use Real Jukebox to transfer music files which makes it more difficult than ever.On the brighter side was the menu layout and controls, very nice to use. Sound quality was acceptable....P>I ended up buying the Archos 20 gig Jukebox player/Recorder and I really love it, it has it's quirks too but all around a much more pleasant experience to use"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Hardware, Terrible Software Ruins It.","review":"I love the device. The display is great, the buttons and interface are great, and the sound is great.HOWEVER.When loading music onto the device using the WinXP driver, your songs are polluted with chirps, clicks, pops and sometimes are truncated entirely.The last update to this driver was in 4/02 and it is now 10/02...not a good sign that SonicBlue cares enough to fix the problem.As a last resort (just to the get the music loaded) I installed Win98 and started to load the songs. Loading the songs with Win98 worked - they didn't get corrupt - but the crappy Real software kept hanging Windows! (And this is on a clean virgin install!)My advice: avoid unless drivers are corrected.

The acting, by nearly everyone, was excellent, the story was great, the sets were awesome, the costumes were right-on.This was one of Maureen O'Hara's first films, filmed when she was just 18 years old. She has played all kinds of roles since playing the beautiful gypsy girl Esmerelda, but for some reason, Esmerelda, to me, really stands out from her swashbuckling/Sahara sands movies. Esmerelda is just more realistic than Maureen's roles playing some diplomat's daughter. And more interesting, too.I have never seen Edmund O'Brien before, and wasn't quite sure what to make of him. He reminded me a bit of Mark Hamill. I have no idea why. Maybe it was his 'brotherly' rather than 'husbandly' role in this movie.

The more upbeat aspects invented by the film makers were in keeping with the formula of the time for better or worse. Perhaps the aspect dealing with human rights reflected the political climate of 1939 when Facism and Japanese aggression in China were in full force. I too, however, doubt that any king would have encouraged the people to educate themselves and rebel.

Watching this version of Vitor Hugo's novel it is not hard to see why. Laughton looks like he was born to play Quasimodo, the deaf and disfigured bell keeper of Notre Dome Cathedral. Wearing heavy face make up and a body suit, Laughton literally transformed himself to play the part. This novel has been adapted several times for the screen , but this is the best one. The performances are on the whole excellent. Particularly Cedric Hardwicke as the cold Chief Justice of Paris. Maureen O'Hara also gives a strong performance as Esmeralda. The direction of William Dieterle is very good, although he concentates a little too much on the subplots at times. On the whole this is an excellent film, that despite it's age, hardly seems dated. The story is a timeless classic and so is this film.

They are great, and very knowledgeable. However, the book is just bad. I do very well with writing and pronunciation, but grammar is what confuses me the most. That is because this book is just bad at explaining it, and is laid out very poorly. Sadly, grammar is the building block of speaking correctly. The book simply throws things at you with no way of building up knowledge in an organized fashion.

This textbook picked a font where those characters are impossible for the new student to differentiate.The explanation for each grammar lesson is short. The examples are short. The student is left unable to recognize the techniques in actual usage. There are some tables for verb conjugation but they are very difficult to follow.The index is incomplete. The dictionary in the back is incomplete. The text might spell the same word 3 different ways. The user is forced to write their own index to be able to refer back to useful pages. Furigana is haphazardly shown for some kanji but not all, without reasoning for the omission.Why frustrate students with these additional hurtles when Japanese is difficult enough?If you are unlucky enough to have to use this book in a class, do yourself a favor and find a better textbook to augment this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent DVD - lots of great info!","review":"I got this DVD for watching with my homeschooled kids during our Ancient Greece unit and they found it very interesting.

Also great information on the Battle of Salamis. Great footage from Greece. It showed how smart the Ancient Greeks really were. The kids also enjoyed seeing the modern ships and equipment and all.

This has to be THE WORST adaptation ever of a great book made into a movie, and honestly, no excuses for it being made in 1931. Not that it's in the same vein, or faithful to its original, but one should remember that Frankenstein was made the same year, so the art of making \\"talkies\\" didn't have to suffer in the hands of a great director, or await new technological developments!Imagine someone who has seen Dodsworth, one of the greatest, as well as one of the most adult films of all time, and has read both that book and Arrowsmith, then coming across this ridiculous movie. What were they thinking?"},{"rating":"1","title":"DREADFUL DISAPPOINTMENT","review":"I truly wanted to like this film. The cast. The director. The script. But sadly, it is dreadful. The script is a mess. The direction is hit and miss. And Ronald Colman, in the lead, turns in what must be recognized as one of his worst performances. He is not 'present' in his scenes - save for one, when Arrowsmith's wife has just died and he is drunk. He looks inebriated, with fire in his eyes, and he is actually in the moment. The rest of the film he drones on with his utterly self-conscious voice, leaving poor Helen Hayes acting to a wooden dummy. He simply isn't there.There is splendid photography in most of the West Indian scenes. Quite stunning and worthy of freeze-framing to appreciate the composition.Avoid this and go straight to the magnificent DODSWORTH."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love It!!","review":"I like Robin Williams movies.

When Williams gets behind that microphone it is pure gold. Some of his crazy ramblings have become part of my vocabulary...much of this movie is highly quotable.The setting is the Viet Nam War, but the movie is not about the war itself. There are moments of culture clashes, government censorship, and pure hilarity.Although there are some tender and sad scenes in this film, the comic relief takes the sting out of the meloncholy moments.I gave this item a 3-star review, not for its content, but because I think this would be better rented than purchased."},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie is in a dire need...","review":"To be seen that is! Very funny movie. There were many laugh out loud moments and just other times even if I didn't completely follow the joke I loved the enthusiasm so either way I was smiling. I loved Robin Williams' character and I believe we should all be a little more like him...don't be afraid to live a little and don't worry about being so politically correct all the time. This movie had it all: it made me laugh, it tugged on the heart strings a little when the cute Vietnamese woman told Adrian that she couldn't be friends with him, it had dramatic moments, and it even had a twist at the end that revealed the friend that Adrian thought he had made was actually not the man he thought him to be.Anyway, it's a great movie and well worth the watch, and well worth buying as well if you get the chance. I rate this movie 4.5 stars out of 5."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Story","review":"Set during the vietnam war, Williams is a private who's job is a DJ for the base radio station. He brings his own brand of humor and music to the station, which the troops in the field are thoroughly enjoy; however, his immediate superioirs are against it. Good personal interaction story, many subplots, Williams humor is fantastic! You will enjoy the show!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Exhausting","review":"Robin Williams is an AFRS disc jockey in Saigon during the Vietnam War. He is fast-talking, zany, unconventional - and a problem for his superiors. Williams is so much at center stage behind the microphone, doing his imrovisational schtick as only he can, that whatever else the movie is about becomes inconsequential and quickly forgotten. The movie is an exhausting experience to watch, as it must have been for Williams to perform. It's an amazing one-man show, but the picture as a whole left me somewhat empty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Morning Vietnam","review":"The tape was defective and I was unable to view the remainder of the movie.

With his ability to do so many voices, love the Cronkite, and also his talent to convey some of the most diverse emotions, Robin Williams leads the movie. William's character is a radio dj, as I mentioned, who seems in his own world, and happy with it. Yet, with the violence of vietnam but also it's appeal, which to him is the Vietnamese people themselves, he is torn. One of the more uplifting stories about Vietnam this movie is very good and very funny, as only William's, even early in his career, can be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thought it would be better...","review":"Was so happy to have found this edition of Robin Williams' Good Morning Vietnam only to find out that even though it looked factory wrapped when we played it the spoken words did not match their lip movement. There was enough through the first ten minutes that you just didn't want to watch it. The words seemed to be more than thirty seconds to a minute behind the movement of the actors and their facial expressions. Made a great movie impossible to watch.

But, as with 21 JUMP STREET, the dvd release has stripped all the music, taking away what gave the show a distinctly hip edge. At a time when shows were only beginning to showcase music cues, BOOKER as well as JUMP STREET went a step further, telling us in the opening credits what artists would be featured. Now, of course, Mill Creek is a bare-bones operation, so I wasn't expecting anything other than what I got. And it's nice to see a pristine print (which actually DID surprise me) for the show. But no Billy Idol during the OPENING? No B.B. King episode SOMEBODY STOLE LUCILLE? They even left the names of some of the artists in the credits, but still didn't PLAY THE SONGS! Get a decent bootleg, where you can experience it the way it should be experienced."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I bought the entire 21 Jump Street series a few years ago and Booker was the main reason I loved it so much. I was super excited when I found out that there had also been a series created that just focused on his character, but then I was disappointed when I watched it and wasn't hooked like I had been with 21 Jump Street. Richard Grieco still does a great job, but the drama just wasn't as strong as it had been on Jump Street. I only made it through one disc though and I never bothered to see if it gets better after the first few episodes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Richard Grieco rocks!","review":"This is not a collector's edition....no special features, just the dvds. What makes this series is Richard Grieco, he is so handsome and a good actor. Who he is as a character does get watered down in the end....

We turned off our cell phones, we disconnected our wireless router... We followed all of the instructions.We returned it to get a new one and THAT ONE BROKE!! We had it for about two hours... and then the second guitar's connection wouldn't link up to the base station.The concept is cool - wireless controller - but Activision clearly does not have the technical competency to make it work.This is the most awful gift I've ever given.

If I strummed very lightly it would work fine, but as soon as I started rocking out a bit more I started seeing a lot of extra strums. When I tried strumming up that seemed to work OK, but it felt very unnatural for me.After returning this I bought a \\"PS2 Guitar Hero World Tour - Stand Alone Guitar\\" and the difference is like night and day.

The main selling point of this show over other 50's shows is that it's not cheesy.If you like something gentle and light to entertain you on a weekend afternoon, these stories are perfect.

It is that good. Now I enjoy listenning to the whole album. \\"Shame\\" has a lot of power along with \\"I don't Believe\\", \\"So Wrong\\", and \\"Falls Apart\\". The mellow moody tracks such as \\"Why\\" and \\"Sleep\\" have this mood of being trapped and alone with nothing to do about the given situation.

Yes \\"love\\" is definately and infinitely the word. Since 1996 I've probably listened to this album all the way through 25 or so times each year and I have a collection of over 500 cds. The only song here that I am not crazy about is \\"So Wrong\\" but other then that they are all highlights. Yeah if you have an affinity for the industrial rock genre you need to pick this up. Dark Days (their following album) leans a little more toward the loud industrial type which usually I tend to enjoy more but this one remains a perfect blend of industrial and hard rock throughout the length of the album, and I guess I'm just a sucker for perfect things."},{"rating":"2","title":"They Have Matured a Lot From \\"Ungod\\"","review":"I really love these guys and they have to be alongside Trent Reznor with Nine Inch Nails.

It gives stories taken from interviews of the surviving members of the group that lived in or visited the bunker in those days. It focuses on both the major and minor players in the drama around Hitler's last days.The author describes his visit to the bunker at the close of the Second World War and describes what the bunker looked like at that point before going back to start his narrative of the things that happened there during the previous months. He has spent years tracking down the survivors and getting their stories. There were several stories which were completely new to me and really added to my enjoyment of the book.I would recommend this book to anyone interested in the last days of the Reich along with anyone who is interested in the Hitler court since it shows the personalities which surrounded Hitler in his final days."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Companion for the Best Bible Commentary","review":"I heartily recommend this book to all those who wanted a quick reference about the Bible!

I am trying to have a greater understanding of the word of God and the passages written in the Bible without taking a formal course. The handbook would probably work better if I were taking a Bible Study course, but I'm not. The book doesn't have the details or commentary explaining specific passages written in the Bible.

I am finding what's written in the commentary interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good book","review":"I am surprised that this novel has elicited only one other review. It is very well written, and the author moves skillfully back and forth between 1916 and 2003, with numerous stops in between. This technique could be very confusing, but it is done well here.

Additionally, the author includes Moon, Venus and Mars charts in the back, so you can quickly and easily locate what sign someone falls under. The delivery is very tongue-in-cheek and has a certain crassness to it; this isn't a book that sets out to impress more literary types. However, it does what it sets out to do - enlighten you to the love aspects of the signs. I would recommend this book with one MAJOR CAVEAT: this book is very repetitive of Born on a Rotten Day. I found that much of the information overlapped, and that this book was not a compliment for the first title. If you already own Born on a Rotten Day you won't be overly impressed by this new title and won't find anything new in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shocked","review":"I agree with the previous review, this is dead on.

Dixon-Cooper basically paints Sags as the worst people of all time. All we seem to do is have casual sex, run from commitment and hurt others feelings with our honesty. At least that's how she makes us out to be. This may just be Dixon-Cooper's style, but it's less informative and more critical.

GE manufactures weapons for the US military (it's a fact look it up) so they can go out and bomb less powerful countries to expand their empire. The history channel has an agenda and it's doing spin for the US Empire. Che wanted human rights for all, not just rich people. This piece is total misinformation.

After viewing it, I am still not a fan, but I am more sympathetic to him than I was before. It's the kind of sympathy that comes from better understanding.Those on the Far Right will find this portrait to be too sympathetic; those on the Far Left won't like the filmmaker's refusal to make excuses for Che's brutality.

Hey, it's really not that hard to learn, and once you learn it you can quit avoiding all these good books. The puzzles are more challenging than the notation!The book is small so it travels well; the puzzles are not \\"classics\\" that you'll find in other books.

I told him that I'd try it to see what I thought and I'm hooked.

It needs pronunciations with the words - much like My Spanish Coach. It should also include part of speech in the definition, and at some point, should give you an example of the word being used.

Nonetheless, both my husband and I have persisted through the game for two months and have both reached a point where our expression potential has not updated for three weeks of daily play regardless of the fact that we have reached our word quota almost every day.

It can be a good way to reinforce what one already knows, but that goes against the entire point. As a linguist myself, I seriously question this product.In addition, the process by which your abilities are rated is entirely artificial. Even scoring perfectly on many of the games (I already have an extensive vocabulary), I was rated as basically a simpleton in order to preserve the illusion that I am \\"improving\\".Not recommended.

When I went through the instruction mannual, it had no resolution for. I also had a computer programer look at it and he couldn't get it to work. Also, I find it to take a long time to go to another song if you are in the middle of one already. The last thing I will say about this is that with the capacity of this machine, it should have a search device like iPod or the RioRiot. Those machines may cost more, but it is definetly worth it in the long run."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Dissatisfied","review":"I bought this product as a gift for my wife. The instructions are quite unsatisfactory and it required a lot of guess work to get it up and running. However although the file transfer procedure was relatively simple the Sound output was very very dissapointing. I hardly could hear MP3's which normally are very audible even at mid level volumes in other players. I would definitely advise against it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Archos products ROCK and beat Apples high prices","review":"The Archos line of products ROCK, they even won the BEST PRODUCT of the 2003 Consumer Electronics Show (CES). The 10GB Studio is the base line product for Archos... a simple disk based MP3 player that also allows the user to use it as a portable Hard Disk for ANY PC files in addition to playing MP3 files. These are very rugged, I have dropped mine a few times and use it almost daily for activities like skiing and biking with no problems at all. I even connect it to my car stero with a simple adapter to bring my music collection on the road... and were talking 1000's of songs!

It is always charging, it is never \\"Full.\\" This makes me nervous regarding battery life. NiMH batteries are supposed to be totally drained before recharging as far as I know. Also the backlight stays on all the time while charging. 2)Song files. I mostly downlaod live DJ sets (generally 70-100 mins long)onto the player, and so far I can't break them into individual tracks. I also have not successfully recorded using the digital or line connections.I have only had this player for 2 days so maybe I will figure these things out, but everything takes trial and error since the manual is VERY short and covers nothing.

I took it on vacation with me across the Atlantic and i ran out of battery power before i ran out of music. I also have used it as an additional HD with much success. I must agree with most everyone in the downfalls: Poor manual, and horrible headphones. As of now, i wish that i would have \\"sprung\\" for the 20 gb recorder as my 10gb is to small to hold all my collection, and it is miss a feature that i wish it had, the built in microphone.

Don't try to do anything physical though, a little jostling and it'll lock up on you. The sound quality is pretty good, especially with some decent earphones. Download Rockbox firmware for a better interace and some cool new features. Also, be prepared to buy a new one every couple of months. Me and a friend of mine both bought this player at the same time. His lasted about a month b4 succumbing to a \\"HD ERROR\\" and mine lasted almost 6 months b4 doing the same thing. On the plus side I spent under 150 on the thing, and got a lot of use out of it over the past half-year.

At that price the product is a good deal, especially in comparison to the ipod. It's twice as thick as the ipod and quite a bit heavier.However, don't be fooled by into thinking that's it's the poor man's ipod, because there are a number of shortcomings:- itunes interface works, but it doesn't hide the \\".xxxx\\" files when browsing.- the USB interface is incredibly slooooow.- my unit had some visual defects- the documentation, s/w, and website are not kept up to date. It's as if the product was discontinued.- when it's hooked up to USB it doesn't turn itself off. It also doesn't indicate the batteries are dead during the transfer of files. You just get errors.Reasons to buy:- price (possibly)- size, although bigger than the ipod, it's smaller than the nomad.I gave it 2 stars based on price.

It mostly is about how to have a good friendship!!!This magazine has fashion, but in a way that helps you to express yourself by fashion, know what I mean? So it's cool. I always have a hard time waiting for it in the mail. And it's worth the wait!!!So even though most of the magazines nowadays are all about relationships with boys and ridiculous fashions, celebrities and popstars, this magazine is for normal girls. It's covergirls are normal girls, instead of celebrity teens, giving the everyday girl a chance to stand out.So I think that it is the perfect magazine for any girl, because of it's understandable issues, appropriate topics, cool craft ideas, and fun fashion.

I don't want to be tied up to DG with the \\"do it like we say\\" messages.There is the random article about new hobbies, and talented 8-12 year olds.

Some of the girls photographed in this magazine are being made up to look like women already.Why does our society have to keep pushing girls to grow up so fast. They have the rest of their life to worry about boys! The sheer innocence of childhood should be deeply valued by society not rejected. However, the magazines have to make money, don't they?

The damn Archos barely fit in my pocket.BATTERY: Compare the stats. The iPod has a longer battery life.SPEED: The worst thing about the Archos, besides its chunkiness, is the slow USB connection. The iPod has an ultra fast Firewire connection allowing you to add several GBs in minutes. The Archos takes over an hour to load the same amount of music via USB. *Note: the 20 GB Archos comes with Firewire, not USB.I returned the Archos Jukebox after a couple days because the the above reasons.

And how does the Kaz Jazz Quartet qualify as rhythm and blues? Those songs, as well as Charlie Sexton's gets-old-quick Elvis imitation, kind of disrupt what could have been a much better compilation. The Fabulous Thunderbirds are, well... fabulous on their two songs. But it is the ladies who steal the show. Lou Ann Barton, Angela Strehli, and Sarah Brown sing their hearts out on their respective songs. If they had been given more than five songs between the three of them, this could really have been a great one.

It is the worst movie I ever wasted time and money. This is a low, low, low budget movie made. First off the soldiers are just wearing t-shirts on a combat exercise and through out the movie. The acting, the writing and special effects, are amateurish at best. The Robot looks like it was a reject from a childrens Japanese TV show. The scene with they have a helicopter come into take the hostage, robot and three terrorists was 2 man attack helicopter. If the robot only operates because of DNA of the operator, then the son should ever has worked for him. This movie is so bad, that it is not even going to meet campy status.

Unless they drop the price to less than $5, you should probably move along, as there is no way they pay more than $2 to procure this from China."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Case","review":"The case is slim and does cover all the sides and seems pretty sturdy without all the bulk. I like the fact that it has a see through cover on the back. It does lift the phone slightly so the camera lens is protected if you set it down. The on/off switch and volume toggles are completely covered by the case and you can still work them with a little more pressure. The only reason for four stars is that the cut out for the speaker on the back does not line up perfectly although it does not affect the performance at all, just aesthetic.

However, yesterday while I was at the park I had the phone in my pocket with my cleaning cloth. Well it had rubbed off on the case. I tried to get it off with cleaner, it smeared! Now, near the power button, it is slightly pink. I am worried that this will happen with any type of residue that gets on the case.

Also in their spare time Confederate soldiers ran around in the woods murdering indians.

The author argues that you don't have to choose between being successful at a career and successful at relationships (the book has lots of good tips for singles who want a balanced life as well as marrieds). To the contrary, he says, personality traits such as commitment, discipline, flexibility, are the same necessary ingredients for success at both work and love.

Called them up--same routine: 35-minute wait. Answer was, \\"We do not have any more 20 models.

Well one day I accidentally forgot to take it with me and left in the charger for a total of about maybe 16 hrs in the charger. When I came home I smelt burned electronics and i ran over to see the player and it actually melted from the inside out.

The first thing I noticed when I turned it on was the display... it is very hard to see. The back lighting is brown and with today's technology this is very antiquated. To move around within the menu is not intuitive at all. There is a music queue option but you can only queue one song at a time. While listening to music the buttons on the player do not work like a standard CD player. Example - when listening to a song and you hit the back button it does not go to the beginning of the song you were listening to but back to the song before it, so to listen to a song again you have to hit the back key then the forward key to get back to the beginning of the song."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great product--once you get the right firmware.","review":"I bought one and was pretty dissatisfied with it. Then a little online research brought me to the nice Swedish hackers who've come up with RockBox, an open-source replacement for the buggy firmware that comes with the unit.

It makes the interface work the way you expect it to, and no more skipping or freezing.The player itself is great now.

Forget trying to get out-of-warantee help from Archos. They never even answered my mail. Digging into the box (I don't have anything to lose at this point) I found that the unit was not made to be repairable. If you are lucky and get one that holds up, you have a real winner.

At least it won't take up much space in the landfill."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Player, but recording is mediocre at best","review":"Has a ton of features and doubles as a portable hard drive. Its also really easy to use. I bought the recorder to record live music for band practice. I soon found that the internal mic is almost unusable. I then purchased an external mic hoping that would solve the problem, but I could still pick up the hard drive spinning. Even recording directly from another source like a CD player didn't help. The recordings were way too distorted and the HD artifacts were the only thing that was recorded clearly. Its a great idea, but not usable for anything other than voice or really rough recordings for personal use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great for me","review":"Works great for me. No real problems. It did hang once in a while if I chose another song while one was playing. So, I downloaded and installed the open source interface called RockBox. It is faster and I've had no crashes since installing it. It is incredibly easy to install and you can switch back and forth if you want to use the mfg.'s interface.I've also been getting great battery life. Probaby up to 12 hours if I am just listening and not using it as a hard drive. No problems with skips or noiseAlso, it works great under Linux, at least with RedHat, contrary to what another reviewer said. You do have to be careful to connect it *before* you boot up a RedHat 8 machine or it may freeze the machine. No problems at all under RedHat 9.I just wish you could somehow directly download from a compact flash card like with the AJ Multimedia model. Then I could use it to offload digital camera images, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"...support, .... product","review":"exactly 1 month after the expiration of the 1 year warranty, i upgraded the firmware and the jukebox could not boot up. i had enjoyed it for almost a year, with some annoying problems here & there (nothing major - battery life too short, original rechargeable batteries from archos were no good, losing data). i even upgraded firmware on previous occasions without problem.my big problem arose when i contacted tech support and was told repeatedly that it was a battery problem. it was not. upgrading the firmware somehow corrupted the unit, and i could not get it to work correctly to be recognized by my PC. in short, i spent several hundred dollars to use it for 1 year."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Player that doesn't Play","review":"I was so excited for the first day when I received my player.Sounded great played great easy to use. Then it just powered itself off. Never to turn on again. I sent the unit back to Amazon. They were great the next day a new unit was at more door.The new unit played great for 4 weeks. Very happy with it. Thenkablam, the unit once again shuts down, never to play another note of music.This unit seems to have a power supply issue. I have sent this unit back to Amazon. Don't have much faith the third unit will work muck better. But Amazon is great with their return policy.Amazon might think twice about carring this product. It has extremly poor quality control as far as I am concerned.

Dont bother.. it will [shut down] mid recording, the display will lose its vertical hold (dont ask me how an lcd does that.. it just did). After 2 months of having it the batteries barely hold a charge, and there are many things wrong with the functionality.. like I cant turn it on while its charging..

The instruction manuel is junk but if you play with it for a couple of days you will get the hang of it.

However, now that I seem to have it working fine, I like it a lot more.TIP: If your computer has USB ports on the side of the case, or a USB hub, don't use them for this. Use the ones in the back.Also, if you need to call tech support, be prepared to wait a long time. The tech support people were very quick to identify my problem, though, and help me fix it, so once you do get someone on the line, just be patient and you should be able to get the player working."},{"rating":"1","title":"90 day warranty - non existent support.

I sent an email to Archos support on December 27 and had not recieved any response by January 6, so I tried to call. After 25 full minutes on hold - I gave up and sent another email to support. Again, no response. I returned it and am now shopping for a replacement. With the short warranty and non-existent support - buyer beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dud","review":"According to many of the reviews on Amazon this is a great machine. However, that has not been my experience. To start off, the instructions are at best wholly inadequate - making it difficult to get started (and I am relatively good at computer gadgets).

Maybe I just got the exceptional dud, but maybe I didn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware","review":"Sound quality good. Ease of operation fair. But tech support is a nightmare. Impossible to get on the phone and it's you who's paying for the 60 minute wait, after which you can't get anyone anyway. When you finally do get someone, they're not helpful. My unit had to be sent in before the warranty expired. Although there was nothing wrong with the playback they sent me a new unit and all the files I had recorded were gone. When I finally reached them, they were rude and bad-tempered.

Once I figured that out, the \\"simple drag and drop\\" doesn't work. The Tech Support line is not a toll free number. They keep you on hold. When they finally answer they speak poor English.

Not only was it a great deal, but this little gadget has come in handy many times.

This one simply stopped working while I was walking around. As with the other sufferers...a hard disk error. I tried repartioning etc etc and now give up.

RUN FAR AWAY FROM THIS and spring for the iPod."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent product...it is a shame it is made in France","review":"I have owned this product for a year...having bought it right after it came out and before the IPod. From day one I have used it to carry files from work to home and back again. It is compatable with every operating system I have tried it with. When attached to my PC I treat it as a normal disk drive. Even using the older USB, I have had no trouble opening and running files off of it. Like any other disk drive, though, you must perform normal upkeep on it and run scandisk and defrag once in a while. Doing that improves its speed of function greatly. I have no hesitation in recommending it to anyone. The only thing I am not crazy about is that it is made by a French company. If I were buying one today, I would think twice about it just because it is made in France...but that is the only reason. It is a very practical and dependable device, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would give this ZERO STARS if it were possible","review":"Stop. Don't buy this product. It is not a high quality product and the interface is limited. P>Turn around and buy Creative Lab's NOMAD JUKEBOX. This is the product Archos is trying to compete with and will never be able to touch. The NOMAD JUKEBOX works right out of the box. The interface and software are SO (so, So, SO) easy to use. You can browse and add to the queue while songs are playing! You can shuffle the entire jukebox, albums or just the queue. There is no need to set up play lists on the computer (though you can) because you can set up the queue on the fly! I've never had any technical problems with either of the two my girlfriend & I own (and one of them I bought used!), and the friend of mine that turned me on to the NOMAD JUKEBOX has had his 20GB player for over 2years!!!

I can't believe I watched it through to the end thinking maybe it would get better - well it didn't. I'll give to the local library. I didn't like the movie because the acting was poor. It was a B rated film. The angel didn't speak; but rather made weird noises/tones, then people would look at her and all of a sudden become quiet and peaceful because her gentleness somehow was cast into them. The friends of the guy that who found her were trying to kidnap her so that they could make money from showing her. I think I expected a love story, but this was nothing like I expected.

After finishing \\"Torchlight\\" I now realize that Robert Louis Stevenson III will be bringing us tales of excitement and intrigue equal to those of his namesake for many years to come, and highly deserves Mr. Cusslers glowing recommendation.You literally picture yourself alongside Drake and Henderson as they dive on the Norfolk.

Worse, it is the ONLY series I've seen in ANY language that not only omits the 'Battle of Britain' and Spitfire, but shows such a one-sided, American/Israeli-biased series. If the RAF is mentioned it is to prove how great Americans & Israelis were in comparison to them.If there was fuel to the rising criticism of the owners of the History channels recently producing unprofessional and unethical propaganda programming, this is it.This is the only series I wouldn't even accept as a gift to be beer coasters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Dogfights","review":"This series is so well done, you can't stopping watching until it's it over, so be in sure and taking care of any thing else before you push play.

The aliens send destroyer ships periodically and the people of Earth desperately seek new ways to defeat them. The aliens improve their approach with each attack to counter earlier Earth strategies. The characters harness the WWW to devise strategies that go beyond the abilities of any single individual. The story is flat, the plot is dull, and characters are two-dimentional. Numerous obvious plot holes exist. For instance, detailed tactical commands are beamed from Earth to assault platoons that breach the alien ship. Split second reflexes are needed to defeat the aliens, along with innovative tactics. With the delay required for the Web consensus to develop and the transmission delays between earth and the alien ships, the commandos would be fried.

What kind of skateboarder has a book about himself. Have you seen the commercials he has been in. I mean tarzan, come on! Also a game about himself all because he landed a stupid trick once or twice( a 900).Sure I could see a book about a person who invented electricity, or discovered something that changed the world. I just don\`t like TONY HAWK!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hawk Occupation: Skateboarder","review":"Tony Hawk is a very cool book written by Sean Mortimer. The thing that kept me reading was that I am a skateboarder, too! The character is a boy called Tony Hawk. The book talks about Tony from the time he started to skateboard, to when he was a professional skateboarder. As I read the book, I was always wondering what would happen next, which made me want to continue reading more to see.I easily noticed that it was full of action and entertainment. I recommend all you skateboard fans read this book and have an adventure with Tony Hawk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes a boy want to read!","review":"I am 'Squigman's' mother. Squigman is 9 years old and has been interested in extreme sports ever since he was a baby. He told me that he wanted one thing for Christmas, and that was Tony Hawk's book. Other Christmas's his list of 'I wants' was long and harsh . . .Playstations, electric jeeps, action figures, but this year . . .he wants . . .a book! Imagine that, the boy wants to read an actual 'chapter' book. I have every confidence that he will read it, cover to cover because for the last several years skateboarding magazines is all the child will read. Harry Potter? Who's that? My son has a real flesh and blood hero and his name is Tony Hawk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best skateboarding book EVER!!!!","review":"Skateboarding books are Definetly exiting, but when the birdman writes one it's ausome. Tony Hawk is the best Skateboarder ever, and if you are looking to become a pro or even a hobbiest you should purchase this book. It tells you the way of his life and how he got to where he is today.

If their parents are encouraging their kids to read, then they could buy this for them if they like skateboarding. It tells about his life and how he started.

This is a great read for anyone who likes skateboarding."},{"rating":"1","title":"Geared for Experts, too much footage, not enough instruction","review":"I'm an intermediate to advanced skiier, looking for tips to take it to the next level. Although the instruction in this video is definitely geared towards high-end experts, I still found much of it to be useful. My major complaint is that the video spends too much time showing typical warren miller 'wow' footage and not enough time explaining their instructions. I would have liked a little more explanation and examples to go along with each of their points."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not For Beginners!! Beginner Example is very rarely shown!!","review":"The instructor is annoying, but the worst part is the camera work. The instructor clearly states which team member is the beginner example but they are very rarely seen. When you do see the beginner person, you do see they are doing something different than the advanced examples who get shown much, much more. I know very little about pilates, wanted to learn more, but am extremely disappointed in this \\"beginner\\" video. I don't feel safe using this video as a learning tool at all. The back of the box does say the video has a Glossary with visual footage, but those are just still photos with a background speaker, not a video demonstration."},{"rating":"2","title":"Her voice is not a problem for me","review":"I like this DVD.

Her inflection is reminiscent of a melodramatic High School production of some Shakespearean play. It must be heard to be believed; but then, you'd have to purchase it. There is a reason there are so many used copies for sale so cheaply here. There is one other segment led by a different instructor who is much better, but it's short (the Back Workout).The exercises themselves are standard Pilates fare."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying!","review":"First of all, I must agree with the above review that Carrie Clark's delivery is about as pleasant as root canal. (I honestly kept expecting her to put me on a time-out if I didn't do the exercise correctly,lol!)I am a Pilates instructor, and while I respect the classical format, our lifestyles have changed dramatically in the 40 years since Joseph Pilates passed away. Many people have needs and postural issues that could be made worse by using only the classical format, yet could benefit greatly from modifications and by changing it up."},{"rating":"1","title":"DCC for the complete novice","review":"If you know absolutely nothing about DCC, this is an expensive way to start - you will be better served by buying a different book. Kalbach Publishing have failed miserably with this one - it never hits its mark and is useless as an independant guide - contains almost no information. Cannot recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Basic, Good Primer","review":"This is not a book that will teach somebody all the aspects of DCC. Instead, it is a simple primer that gives the basics. It does so in a clear and logical manner that is easy to understand. A person could conceivably wire up a railroad layout after reading this book (probably with lots of luck and attention to the manufacturers documentation) but that would not be wise. A person should do some more in depth planning. This book will not help with that.The strength of this text is to give an introduction to the subject to somebody who knows nothing about it. The basic understanding gleaned from that should help to determine if further effort is warranted. In my case it is. I will probably keep this book handy for a while until I become more familiar with the tracks and the products but I will soon graduate to a more substantial treatment. Still, this exactly fit the bill for what I needed as a beginner who knows nothing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lack of information","review":"I was very disappointed in this book. It was sorely lacking in content, mostly it was like reading a big ad for a single model of DCC equipment. I was looking for something which would give more than a general overview of the DCC system. Coverage on the accessory DCC capable options would have been nice. After getting this book I had to still go to the internet and research; this book should have been my reference. I would suggest that you wait until version 2 or maybe 3 of this book before buying it, maybe then they might even add a table for the CV values and what they mean for a decoder."},{"rating":"2","title":"Complicated subject made easier","review":"This book does what I hoped it would...explain what I thought was a complicated subject in easy to understand text. The photos and diagrams help a great deal, too. I always enjoy this author's monthly column in Model Railroader magazine because he speaks in a clear, simple manner. DCC doesn't scare me nearly as much now.

Casti is very much a spokesman for the past,not the future. There is really no real science fiction here: it is embarrassing to sci fi to have this called by that name. A lot of the ideas he talks about are out of place at this time ( they were late 50's early 60's ideas). His tone is that of a lecturer who doesn't care if he puts the audience to asleep. I've read several of his other books and none was as arrogant or elitist as this one. He just has failed to read about the lives of the main characters or to understand them? They are not the people I have read about in a number of biographies.I think the worst thing this book does is suck the life out of the ideas that it tries to discuss?He just gets it wrong in so many ways."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice material but zipper hell..","review":"Owned it for a month before the zipper started giving me problems.

All of them are quite strong, but the strongness are different. That's what I like about this book. Every character are different but sometimes same. The book discribed it well enough to let you understand.I like the ending. I wonder was this book based on someone!

This book of her was very good. In the beginning Mary Anne has a regular BSC meeting with her friends, but because of something Kristy did... there comes a HUGE fight between the members of The Baby-Sitters Club. In fact the whole book is about it, but here is too about Mary Anne and her father. Mary Anne's mother died when she was a baby and her father is trying to prove that he can raise a great child without mother. But Mary Anne has to keep her hair in pigtails and her father buys her clothes. And what about Mary Anne's room... I learnt a lot from this book and I think you should read this."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best!!!","review":"This is one of the best BSC book there is. I like it because you meet the real Mary Anne. She want to grow up. The BSC is also is a major fight and no one is speaking to each other. Mary Anne has no other friends so she's all alone. So she meets Dawn. This is the first book with Dawn. I loved this book a lot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too predictable","review":"I found this book very predictable. It was quite obvious that the BBC were going to get back together in the end. I also disliked how Ann Martin always spends at least two chapters in some of her books explaining the history of the BBC. I have read several of her other books and I have found them all very alike. Overall this book is easy to read and easy to forget. It is a pity that the early books contain very few male characters. I also find that Mary Anne is a very irritating character. She is very immature for most of this book and she spends most of her time complaining about her father."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mad with a capital M!","review":"I love this book until I came across a part where Mary Anne talks to Dawn about her parents' divorce. MA said \\"So what if your parents are divorced? There's nothing WRONG with it.\\" I was furious! YES there is something wrong with it!

The Nimzo Indian is the only opening that I play with Black AND white. This book gives me all I need to play this line for both sides. You see IM Pleister tells the STORY of this variation. He has no axe to grind. He just lays it all out. Recent game references abound, the typeface is good, Diagrams are good - though as always I could stand more of them. There are lots of complete games -- old ones new ones and the classics. The games are situated with the lines they refer to not in a group at the back. Overall, I prefer the way ICE has done it. An excellent book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book on Nimzo-Indian 4.e3","review":"This is a truly fantastic book. This is the best book written on 4.e3 in the Nimzo and I dare to say that it is the best book on 4.e3 that will EVER be written. The author has put an enormous workload on this book and it is based on UNDERSTANDING rather than memorizing variations. There is a lot of strategic explanation and the author stresses in the beginning of the book that it is much more important to understand and not just memorize. This concept is kept from the first page to the last. If you REALLY want to study 4.e3 in the Nimzo-Indian and become an expert in it then you just cant be without this book. Dunningtons book is also great but this one is outstanding as I view it.You are lucky if you can find it.

As far as I'm concerned, this should be the most important part of a book like this, and its omission is a big flaw. Without episode guides, it's simply a overview of Britcoms for beginners.

However, it's very sad to watch a decent premise with great performers go COMPLETELY to waste, as it does in AAW - the presence of Edgar Kennedy should lift th proceedings; instead it reinforces the melancholia.

Unfortunately, \\"Air Raid Wardens\\" (1943) and \\"Nothing But Trouble\\" (1944) find Stan and Ollie submerged in the cold rigidness of MGM's studio system - the same fate that greeted Buster Keaton, the Marx Brothers and Our Gang.

It has its moments and early scenes show promise with Stan and Ollie turning an air raid wardens' meeting into a fiasco and then making a mess of a dummy-run, but all too soon you're longing for the days of Hal Roach. King of slow-burn Edgar Kennedy is under-used and the plot seems to drift aimlessly throughout the later parts of the film until it reaches a rather limp conclusion.If you're a fan of Laurel and Hardy who can't find any of or have seen all their better films then this is worth a look.

Don't use that toothbrush again for at least 24 hours -- maybe 48 hours in a wet climate. Brush all the rest of your mouth and gums and tongue and teeth first, then end with a gentle brush across the sore. I used to get a canker sore which would blossom into two more at the same time, with the peak of pain coming about 5 days into it.

The addition of Cootie Williams and Billy Butterfield on trumpets, with Dave Tough on drums, added some 'punch' to Benny's sound, even after the departures of Harry James and Gene Krupa. Forrest is terrific, as usual.Personally, I think there's nothing better than a great swing orchestra, blending sweet vocals with 'hot' solos by the top jazzmen on traks like 'Perfidia' or 'Corn Silk'.

I praise God for this. I am also a Christian and am thankful that God uses many different tools to bring people to Himself. However, I have a very different view of the book itself. This was the second book that I read about the evolution-creation controversy. It convinced me that the creationists have limited intellectual capital. The arguments it makes range from the sensible to the illogical. This book caused me to make a hobby out of the subject. There is so much more to this than the limited views expressed in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is flawed","review":"This book is another in the long line of people seeking to \\"prove\\" their faith.

You MUST read the book first, there is no way to capture the thoughts and emotions of the characters without having done so. Having read the book first, and feeling the background emotion behind the characters, I love the move, just hated the ending. Cried with the book, cried with the movie. Get it for a rainy day...and share it with that someone special in your life so as not to waste something like Garretta and Theresa had and insufficient time to figure out together.

That way, I was able to truly enjoy the way the author of the book, Nicholas Sparks, wanted this truly amazing love story to be portrayed. This movie did not do the book any justice. I did not feel the chemistry of the main characters the same way I felt it in the book. I also believe that the director strayed too far from the actual basis of the story. I could not wait for the movie to be over."},{"rating":"1","title":"The ending spoils the whole movie","review":"At the end of this movie, I felt ripped-off and betrayed. I had invested 2 hours of my time and emotion on an excellent movie, only to have it spoiled by an awful ending that came out of nowhere. To me the ending of a movie can make or break it. If you agree, don't bother with this movie. If you disagree, see it. The rest of the movie is wonderful - good acting, believable and interesting characters, good story, good pacing. The director should have quit while he was ahead."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT a must-see...","review":"This movie is NOT a must-see.

I couldn't believe what they did with this movie. Give me a break! If they made the movie with the same story it would have been awesome. Where did this storyline come from? Why can't they leave well enough alone. Kevin Costner put me to sleep -- I know he was a down-home boy but give him some life! The story just did not flow and if you didn't know any background you really wouldn't know what was going on. Very disappointing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Message in a Bottle","review":"I have watched this movie twice and have seen different things in it each time I have watched it.

There was no mention of his first wife family AND THEY DID NOT GET INTO A FIGHT. 2.HE TAUGHT THIS NEW LADY IN HIS HIS LIFE AND HER SON TO SCUBA-DIVE, AND THERE WAS NO MENTION. 3. HE DID NOT DIE BY SAVING SOMEONE OUT IN THE SEA-HE WENT TO DELIVER THE LAST MESSAGE, BUT THE PART OF THE OTHER SHIP THAT WAS SINKING, WAS NOT IN THE STORY. 4. THE FAMILY OF HIS DEAD WIFE DID NOT EVEN FIGHT OR ARGUE OVER HER PAINTINGS, THERE IS NO MENTION OF HER FAMILY!!! I could go on, but when will they ever make a movie and stick to the origional script.

THIS is acting? Paul Newman on the other hand does a decent job .. but this movie is SO poorly done it is a crime.

Don't waste your time watching this movie. It was a great cast who could not portray the emotion and depth required of the characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"So overrated","review":"Kevin Costner is the worst actor my eyes have ever witnessed in my life. What a crock he is. All his movies are the exact same. He always plays this tortured man who is hard to get to and has a past, but the love a woman teaches him to open up and he becomes a better man. This movie is no exception. It is just like all his other movies, and I think his claim to fame is that people find him attractive, although they must be blind or stupid to think that. Acting abilities? I didn't know grunting and murmuring counted as acting. He coulnd't act his way out of a bottle. On top of that, this movie has one of the worst endings, for a \\"love story\\" and I just think it would be wise to not pay any attention to this, or any other movie by him, they are all the same, just with different titles."},{"rating":"1","title":"YYYYYYYYYYYYYYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAWWWWWWWWWNNNNNNNNNN","review":"A very disappointing bore.

I thought this movie would be a great romantic movie. And I was sorely disappointed. I thought Kevin Costner's acting was a bit stiff, but hey, I still believed his character came to truly (and finally!) love Robin Wright Penn's character. I watched this movie because I wanted a romance story and I loved the actors involved in the project. But tragic?! Catastrophic. What kind of \\"message\\" is Message in a Bottle supposed to be leaving us with? If you get all your problems figured out and then get your life going in the right direction... well that's it it's over, life will play a cruel joke on you?And I totally didn't believe that a born boatsman would jump off a boat in the middle of the storm and not be tethered to something.

Let's hope Nicholas Sparks' book THE NOTEBOOK gets more credibility than this one..The bottom line here is: HO HUM"},{"rating":"1","title":"Left feeling Empty","review":"I like romantic movies. I want the ending to leave me feeling happy, not depressed. Life isn't the fairy tale, thats why I watch movies, otherwise I wouldn't waste my time watching them.

Almost a classic love story, but seems so true in a way. One always hopes that one day they will find their true soul mate. In this story, it's sad for the reason that they had found each other and were so right for each other. It makes you ask yourself should a person wait for a true soul mate. I highly recommend this movie for anyone.Especially for the romantic at heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mesmerizing movie","review":"What a movie! I loved the interaction of Kevin Costner and Robin Wright Penn. This story just broke my heart and days after first viewing this, I am still thinking about it. I must be softie becuase beautiful love stories between men and women seem to be lacking on the big screen. I truly enjoyed this movie as I did The Horse Whisperer. Both are stories about hope and trust, love and caring. There is nothing wrong in desiring to be loved and to love deeply. I only wish that the movie had gone a little further in developing the trust and love and bringing into the mix more interaction of the supporting cast. The ending of the movie is hard to take and I cried over it. My heart ached over the love found and then lost. I give this move 4.25 stars out of 5. Where was I when this movie came out in 1999? Well done! very well done!"},{"rating":"1","title":"whoa--predictable","review":"This movie didn't hold my interest. Finding the message in the bottle was exciting, fun, romantic. But when Theresa went to find the mystery man and conveniently started a relationship with him without telling him the truth of why she was there (checking out the mysterious message in a bottle writer), I knew exactly what was going to happen in the movie, and I was right. There were lots of other predictable situations as well, creating melodrama and way too many tears without grabbing my sentiments. She was supposed to be a serious journalist but spent her time at the Outer Banks as if she were on vacation. Thumbs down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not anywhere near as good as the book.","review":"They changed SO much from the book to the movie version! Paul Newman's character as the father had his name changed, as well as Theresa's son; Garrett already had a boat, he did not have to build one; his wife was not a painter; Theresa lived in Boston and worked for a fictional newspaper; etc. The movie just lacked so much. There was zero chemistry between the main characters. Kevin Costner was the only wonderful part in the movie as he played the character of Garrett so perfectly that it felt like they stole him right from the pages of the book and breathed life into him to star in the movie. He is the reason to watch this movie - there aren't any other reasons. Read the book - you'll get a more satisfying experience and a more satisfying cry."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must see for the Kevin Costner fans.","review":"I watched the movie before I read the book and I loved them both. The movie was so moving and beautifully written that I decided to buy the book. I couldn't put the book down. I would recommend seeing the movie and reading the book, in any order that you want. Kevin Costner is so sexy and made the movie one that I am going to buy as soon as it comes out."},{"rating":"2","title":"A touching love story","review":"Teresa (Robin Wright-Penn) is a newspaper writer who finds a remarkable love letter in a bottle, and is so taken with its honesty that she searches for the author, planning to write a column about him. She finds Garret (Kevin Costner), a sailboat builder, who wrote the letter to his late wife. He and Teresa fall in love, against a backdrop of the beautiful Outer Banks, until Garret discovers her original motive, and feels betrayed.Wright-Penn is lovely and holds her own with Costner, who plays this type of character so well. He's brooding, hurt, vulnerable, and adorable. Paul Newman, as Garret's curmudgeon father, almost steals the show. His plain-speaking old coot balances the sweetness of the love story, to make the film satisfying and memorable. I highly recommend this film especially to Kevin Costner's fans, who enjoy him in romantic and tender roles."},{"rating":"2","title":"WONDERFUL","review":"I READ THE BOOK BEFORE I SAW THE MOVIE, I CRIED BOTH TIMES. THEY COULDN'T HAVE PICKED A BETTER CAST THAN THEY DID -- YOU'VE GOT TO SEE IT AND ALSO READ THE BOOK."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you read the book, don't rent the video","review":"I read the book twice. The movie has been changed so much you won't even recognize it. They even changed Theresa's son's name, for what reason I cannot imagine. You will be terribly disappointed if you are expecting a romantic widower in Kevin Costner's portrayal of Garrett. They turned him into this bitter crotchety jerk. A silly subplot about Garrett and a feud with Catherine's family has been added, again, I cannot imagine why, unless the producers were looking to fill space. I did not care for Robin Wright Penn's portrayal of Theresa. There wasn't any chemistry. At the end there is a needless death. You will be staring at the screen thinking, Why in the world did they do THAT? Don't waste your money on this one! You will be sorely disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip the movie-read the book!","review":"I am a huge fan of Nicholas Sparks' novels. His books center around tragedy. With that being said they are definitely tearjerkers. I loved the movie adaptations of The Notebook and A Walk to Remember, but this one was terrible.When there is a movie version of a book, I tend to read it first and this was beyond the worst novel to silver screen adaptation. I know I shouldn't expect it to be just like his book, but too much of it was changed (including my favorite part-the ending). It was so disappointing. Even though it may not be the shorter route to take (since it is quite long), my advice is to read the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not believable","review":"For a love story to work, you have to believe that the characters are in love. I never quite buy it in this movie. Robin Wright Penn's usual brilliance and believability can't overcome the stupid plot. And it doesn't help that Kevin Costner comes across as, not merely pining away for his lost love, but mentally challenged. Paul Newman is the best thing in this film. In a movie crammed full of scenes intended to bring viewers to tears, the only one that even came close, for me, was Paul Newman's \\"You're my son\\" scene.Skip this failed attempt and watch Sleepless in Seattle or Forrest Gump instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"damaged dvd","review":"I live in Mexico, so I can not return.

By the time I got done - it took me three hours because I kept stopping it and contrasting it to the book - I was very upset. It doesn't stick true to the novel. Now, I'm not saying that it should go word for word like the novel, but it doesn't even end the same. Penn and Costner were good, and their acting of the poorly adapted screen play was acurate, but I think the person who adapted this novel should have been fired for taking the heart and soul of this movie and killing it. If you are desperate for a love story, and they don't have \\"A Walk To Remember\\" by Sparks... Pick it up. Just don't expect it to stay true to the novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fabulous Movie....","review":"... but only if you are deaf. Seriously. This movie is visually gorgeous. That's about it.

HE DIDN'T SEEM CONNECTED TO THE CHARACTER HE PLAYED AT ALL, BUT TO SPARE HIM SOMEWHAT, I BELIEVE THE THE DIRECTON OF THE MOVIE WAS WANTING TOO, AND THEREFORE, WEAKENED HIS CHARACTER CONSIDERABLY.I HAD SO MUCH ANTICIPATED SEEING THE MOVIE AFTER READING THE BOOK, AND THEN TO SEE WHAT HAD BEEN FILMED, DEMONSTRATED HOW A STORY CAN BE LOST IN ITS TRANSITION IF NOT HANDLED ARTISTICALLY."},{"rating":"2","title":"Message in A Bottle","review":"The movie is excellent.

The dvd destroys the whole experience. First off, the trailers, for some stupid, unknown reason, are gone. The special features have trailers for new hollywood movies. The added deleted scenes add nothing to the movie, some are even annoying, particularly the lap dance scene. The dvd packaging is nothing to write home about either.

Then I started watching the film, and what I saw was a two hour movie that was an hour and forty five minutes of filler and fifteen minutes of an average car chase. The scenes of dialogue between the victims, and later on the heroines, drag on forever with absolutely no plot building (mostly because there is no plot to build in the first place), and when the scenes with the cars finally roll around they just aren't worth the wait. And what's more, at the end of the movie I was actually feeling sorry for the villain. Yes, Stuntman Mike killed four girls in the movie and tried to kill three more, but the heroines were just so slimy (I actually felt like taking a shower after their dialogue scenes). All that being said, Death Proof might have been a decent movie if it was a half hour shorter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!","review":"The fact that this film was all dialog didn't bother me. Hell, I loved \\"My Dinner with André\\".The problem was that the talk just wasn't interesting.I'm a Kurt Russell fan and mostly a Tarantino fan, but this film was dull except for the ten minutes following the \\"wrong turn\\" in the first half.The second half never approached the intensity of those 10 min, so there was no payoff for me for enduring the interminable yap, yap, yapping of the first two-thirds of the second half.Zoe Bell was charismatic and appealing, but even together with Russell, who's great as usual (I did like his interpretation of the character when the chips were down; nice touch), they couldn't overcome the intrinsic dullness of the script.This flick had maybe 30 min of good material. The rest had me yawning and reaching for the FF button."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely boring","review":"I've always enjoyed Tarantino's movies but this one is just an excuse to show girls in tight clothing and... that's it.

Watch this film if you want to hear boring dialogue that continues on and on. I didn't care about anyone in the film. I was hoping they would die, I never finished it so I can't tell you if they did. Planet Terror was a million times better. Now THAT was a good film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tarantino Bomb","review":"I had such high hopes for this film but what I saw was a jumbled mess. Everything in this movie was wrong. I didn't know Tarantino could make such a bad movie.Apparently he was trying to adapt his famous conversation scenes to women but they just sound like male gab fests. The action is non existent except for 2 car crashes. The plot is non existent.Half way through the movie the four female leads are killed and Tarantino replaces them with four more and we don't care about any of them. Kurt Russell is wasted. He is neither menacing or funny. Even the lap dance scene is contrived and boring. Shame on Tarantino for making this indulgent drivel. I hope he returns to his artistic senses with his next film. This is a must to avoid!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Utter Garbage","review":"It pains me to say this, but Mr Tarantino owes me six quid and nearly two hours of my life, which I know I won't get back. What on Earth was he thinking? Rambling dialogue is ok when it's entertaining, but when it's utter drivel it's awful. The warning light came on two minutes from the start. I really do like Tarantino's work, but this is pushing the loyalty of even the most unquestioning fan. I'll bet Kurt Russell was stoked to think he'd be in a hardcore hit, but I wonder what he thought when he saw the final cut? I should have hit the fire alarm button and claimed my cash back. All you need to know are the words suspicious/tedious/wasted/ rushed and embarrassing. Sorry, my friends, it's a stinker no matter how much you dissect it. And it DOES pain me to say that.Yours,Baby Cromwell"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"Quentin Tarantino has to be the most overrated filmmaker out there. This movie had 2 minutes that really hooked me as a viewer, and that's the scene between the \\"wrong direction\\" and the accident, without spoiling it for future viewers. Other than that, the rest of the movie was horrible. Tarantino makes his movies popular by shocking the viewer with unpleasant scenes. That is all he can do. That's why everyone loves his trash. This movie had about 2 minutes of that, and the rest was a bunch of girls talking about their tepid sex lives. I realize this review won't get many \\"helpful\\" reviews, but I wasted $5 on a rental as a Mopar buff hoping I would like the car scenes. Seeing the destruction of a few old mopars did not make up for anything. I just don't understand the attraction to Tarantino films.

What makes the movie so good is that Quentin Tarantino ground his beloved \\"Grindhouse\\" movies to a pulp, found the essence of what he loves, and turned it into something completely unique and compelling to watch. Death Proof does drag a bit at times and gets a bit too absorbed in dialog, but you will be well rewarded for your patience.

I wanted them to just be quiet!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good if you like this kind of thing.","review":"There's little reason to wonder why this tanked so badly at the box-office. Grindhouse movies did lousy business back in the 70's, so there's really no reason to expect that they'd do any better thirty years later. \\"Death Proof\\" is the nadir of Tarantino's fixation with the 70's, and indeed, comes off as a parody of his own work. Long, pointless, (and surprisingly boring) scenes of people sitting around talking lead up to two mediocre chase scenes. If you liked the movie, then you already went to see it, so go ahead and buy the DvD. If you haven't seen the movie, there's probably a reason, and there's nothing about the DvD that will suddenly make you a fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tarantino's worst, by far","review":"I was truly dissapointed by this film, especially after the punch that Kill Bill I and II packed. It seems as if Tarantino decided that since he has released a handful of pop culture gems, it gave him the license to indulge in some of his worst tendencies. In the end, the film seems like a rough draft. The characters are not developed, the dialouge is not particularly fresh, and the action (although many will argue is edge-of-your seat) is really rather mundane. The ending was particularly ridiculous. I hope Tarantino gets back on track on his next project, because this is a dud. The cover of the DVD clamis that it is his most quotable movie since Pulp Fiction. Honestly, I don't think I can quote a single line from it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Tarantino Turkey","review":"This is Quentin Tarantino's worst movie by a large margin.

I was wrong and therefore subjected to about 100 minutes of alleged actors blab their way through this film. I guess its called character development which went the way of the DoDo in the first 2 minutes. The scenes with the cars were bordering on idiotic and again we are subjected to a pile of dialogue by the actors.

Kurt Russell plays a stunt man who has rigged his souped-up car with roll bars and other safety devices so that during an accident it will be \\"death proof\\". He then travels the south looking for attractive young women he can terrorize and kill with said car. The movie is broken into 2 parts with Kurt stalking one group of 4 women, then starting over with another group.Death Proof is photographed beautifully, acted well and has some interesting dialogue but overall is very boring. The only part that leaves a lasting memory is a head-on car crash shown over and over from different angles. It takes about 45 minutes to get to the crash and its over in 15 seconds. Tarantino is so enthralled with the dialogue he wrote he lets the movie meander around like it's out for a Sunday stroll which is boring to watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"too much talk and 2 \\"action\\"scenes","review":"Quick review, i love Kurt Russel and that was the only reason i watched this movie. The first 35 minutes are several women talking and that is it. Finally Kurt comes on as Stuntman Mike, you would think all the talking the women do would further the plot but it doesn't. He talks to them at a bar get's a lap dance then well let's just say there is about 8 minutes of bloody action. After that it switched to ANOTHER set of women talking for another 30 minutes. Turns out 2 of the girls are stunt women and one has a gun. They get into a cool car chase with Mike then *spoiler* either knock him out or kill him you can't tell. Then the end. So quick summary, 2 hour movie, 2 action scenes that are total 15 minutes long and the rest is talking, cussing and boring. Maybe watch it on t.v. one of these days for the 2nd car chase and save yourself some time, yawn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deathproof, Deathly Boring","review":"I like Quentin Tarantino movies but \\"Deathproof\\" was a drag...unless you like watching good looking women curse, get drunk and act like twits. A particular scene at a diner came off as an actor's exercise--how many times can you use the n-word, the s-word and the b-word in a conversation. Extra bonus points for using the f-word as an adjective.These women weren't even discussing anything relevant to the story. Yes, the scene where the three beauties beat psycho Stuntman Mike at his own game was terrific but the slog you had to go through to get there hardly made it worth the payoff.I was really disappointed in this DVD and the fact that the fake trailers weren't included was another insult."},{"rating":"2","title":"Revenge","review":"I really didn't pay attention to this movie or the other grindhouse movie when they came out in the movie theaters. So when I saw this on dvd, everything about the movie took me by surprise. Kurt Russell is \\"stuntman mike\\" a serial killer that use his car to kill women he stalks. While the plot isn't that great, the dialog amongst the characters, action, comedy and gore were great. The characters were well developed and there was good chemistry amongst the actors/actresses. The best part is the change in the movie when the hunter becomes the hunted. This will not be a movie for everyone, as most of Tarantino's movies aren't. So it just depends on what type of movie you like to determine if you will like this one or not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Death Proof but not Sleep Proof","review":"I saw the Grindhouse movie combo at the theaters and had a great time with Planet Terror. Death Proof should have been shown first because it was such a very s-l-o-w, long and drawn out movie as to put one to sleep.Y-a-w-n.It finally built to a great, climactic ending that was awesome and finally made the movie sort-of worth watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Death Proof!!!","review":"I loved it, im a huge Quentin Tarantino films, and i have all of them on dvd.I liked Grindhouse a lot, i saw the theather version and loved it, although PLANET TERROR was noisier and had more action, i liked DEATH PROOF more, the final minutes are amazing.I know people are dissapointed about the GRINDHOUSE movie being split, , but what am i going to do, just buy the two dvds.The movie itself is great, great acting, fun conversations, great action sequences and i think its one of the most originals movies i have seen recently.Just the final frame with THEN END was worth the movie.The movie itself (grindhouse) was great. and im excited about the extended version of Death proof, wich was my favorite from the two.I just whished this movie could originate more original movies, because by far, this is one of the best of the year for me"},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst ever.","review":"Some may call this movie an homage, but to me its just a gimmick that doesn't work. The stylized presentation and too clever dialogue cannot hide the fact that this movie is just plain boring. Of course Tarantino pulls his one trick out of the bag, gore, for a brief appearance toward the end. But by then I was itching to push the FF button and get through this dog. Kurt Russell was the only decent part of this whole project and it was a shame his talent was wasted."},{"rating":"1","title":"one of the worst movies i've ever seen","review":"Regarding the \\"Death Proof\\" movie.. I am so glad i borrowed this garbage from a friend (of questionable taste). Some reviews suggest that the long boring dialogs of the girls made them feel some kind of bond with the characters; please spare me... the acting was poor, the script worse... even the barely tolerable first crash scene was ruined by the over use of instant playback... The effect of watching the same scene 5 times from different angles did little more than remind me how fake the scene was and what a bad filmmaker Tarantino is... the final 3 minutes are the only part of the movie worth seeing... sadly there is no lower rating available..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dead Poop","review":"Put Uwe Boll's name on this exact same bore-fest and the rating is one star, its stupid, he's the worst director ever, worst movie ever, yada yada.

I was counting down for it to come out on dvd but when I heard this I was FURIOUS! If they would have cut it in two but left all the fake trailers and movie ads, ect. I could overlook the 2 dvd format and it could still be great. The fake ads were the best part for me. That was the beauty of the movie. It broke the usual format. It was so much fun! The combination of everything together was the very essence of this movie. Now without the fake ads, ect. it won't be the roller coaster ride that it was in the theater. This is a TRAVESTY! I'll look for a bootleg of the original! QT and RR are usually excellent but this is ridiculous. Yeah it bombed at the box office but that is because it was too cool for the average idiot! If they would have left it alone I think it would have made up some of the money in dvd sales, but now... This was a stupid move."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great movie, but won't buy it","review":"Saw this in the theater. Loved it. After reading it is split up and the trailers are gone, won't buy it. Whoever is responsible for this decision is stupid. I looked forward to seeing this again in its original form on DVD and this is what they do. I'm not interested in the extra scenes. I'm interested in seeing this the way it was in the theater, i.e. two movies, fake trailers. I don't know why this flopped in theaters because it was great in its original format, but I hope these dual DVD releases sans fake trailers fail miserably. This was a bad, bad decision. I'm very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst films I have ever seen","review":"At 45 minutes, something happened. Then something happened again about 45 minutes later. This is a tedious talk-fest with some shocking acting (sorry, that stuntwoman CANNOT act). There was no story to speak of. 'Grindhouse' films are normally fast, furious, short and entertaining - this film was none of those things. A massive disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is WRONG","review":"This is soooo wrong. Anyone that buys Death Proof or Planet Terror separately is just supporting corporate greed.

This movie is off-the-wall, filled with action, gore, and comedy. I give it a thumbs up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Death Proof = Babbling Bimbos","review":"This is hardly the work of genius. Just a really crappy movie, masquerading as camp. About half way through the movie, I found if I used a 10x Fast Forward speed, the movie was a lot more enjoyable. Worst movie dialogue, EVER. Quinton should publicly apologize for this horrible flick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Death Proof, Not Suck Proof","review":"Ughhhhhhh, to describe DeathProof as PAINFUL is actually an understatement. Don't waste your time, because you can NEVER get those 90 minutes/2 hrs. back.The characters are weak, dull, inanimated. The pace of the movie is SLOWER than SLOW. The dialogue is pathetic, a 3rd grader in my class could write better dialogue. The best part of the movie was THE END!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like Kurt Russell or car chases don't buy this DVD","review":"I bought \\"Death Proof\\" without prior knowledge of it, based solely on Kurt Russell being in it and a promised car chase.Kurt Russell was in it but I have to feel he has fallen on hard times to have taken this acting job. This was not close to the standard or quality of his other movies I've seen and enjoyed. If you liked Russell before don't buy this DVD.As to the car chase it was at best amateurish with scenes cutting out just before the car actually crashes, cars doing things that just can't be done (radiators can not withstand the beating given etc). Seems they don't feel this type of action is great without being impossible. Car action fans will be disappointed.There may be a segment of the public that will like this DVD but if you fall in the category of a Russell fan or a motorhead this is a waste of your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grindhouse Presents, Death Proof - Extended and Unrated (Two-Disc Special Edition)","review":"I refuse to give in to another studio trying to \\"milk it\\" for all the money they can get.

Maybe I'm being a bit dramatic, but that was how I felt when I walked out of the theater. I saw it again a few weeks later, and felt the exact same way that time too. The truth of the matter is, I want to relive the experience to my hearts content. I don't want to do half now and half later. I don't want to fumble around with discs and trying to flip forward through animated menus and all kinds of crap to relive it. I want the experience I had at the theater - both films and all the trailers on one DVD. I will not spend one cent on any of this stuff until the whole experience is available. To tell you the truth, I could give a rip about special features, I just want the complete package."},{"rating":"1","title":"Redundant!!!","review":"This has got to be the most redundant waste of time of a movie ever. Most of the movie is a bunch of stupid woman spewing pseudo-intelligent dialogue that has to do with nothing! Not only that, but you can hear quenton tarantino speaking through every character. It's not original, not even for tarantino. It's utterly stupid. He easily turns Kurt Russell's character into a whiny turd by the end. Tarantino needs to leave!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth it without both...","review":"these movies were fun for the price of one but that's it. Death Proof is widely overrated. The car chases were nothing special and QT's flair for dialogue is dead. Rank profanity is not \\"clever\\" dialogue.

If anybody else made a movie this long about nothing, it would be destroyed by everyone. Russel tries to save this. He is able to do it in the shorter version. In this one...no chance.I miss the original. By the way the graineyness (not sure if that's a word) blows...yet another thing that worked much better in the movie theater.Release the original release in it's entirety.

This movie could have been great if he made the girls hotter and actually had more than 3 minutes of action in the first hour and 1/2 of the film. Kurt Russell cry's for his mommy at the end and I wanted to do the same because this movie was so terrible. Don't buy or rent this movie, keep an eye out for it in your nieghbors trashcan and watch the last 15 minutes if you want to lose respect for Kurt Russell, then go rent Big Trouble in Little China and get it back again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as Good as Expected","review":"I just finished watching it.I didn't like it.Very chick flickish, even for a supposedly horror movie.When I played it, the video (rental) said \\"for sale only\\", kinda funny.I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.Way to much dialogue, mostly female...Zzzzzzzzz..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Basically a waste of time","review":"I liked the final chase, but otherwise this movie was incredibly pointless. It was long and almost entirely devoid of plot. Now, in the past Quintin and other directors like Guy Ritchie have taken movies with little actual content and made them memorable and interesting because of nifty dialogue, but this movie falls flat in that arena; there is plenty of dialogue between the real parts of the movie, but it's very forgettable and not interesting in the least. My guess is Quintin threw this script together in a single afternoon--two at the most. I cannot imagine ever watching this movie again and wish I'd not seen it once. It gets the two stars because of the scene at the end--which is merely fairly good and certainly not worth sitting through 90+ minutes of the rest of the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"BULLS**T","review":"when i saw this awesome movie was coming out on dvd today i went right away to pick up the dvd, but then after seeing it was just 1 of the 2 movies that I went to see that played together back to back i was shocking as hell 1 movie thats bulls**t so guess what i did? i put it right back on the shelf and said FU. i want these movies and love them but thats low real low!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly made movie","review":"Tarantino has lost his touch when it comes to originality or creativity.

I was one of the lucky ones who got to experience the full Grindhouse movie in theaters and Tarantinos movie had people yawning and looking at there watches throughout.

In a very bad way. It is so slow. The whole movie goes for about 2 hours. 1 hour 40 minutes of nonsense girl talk at best. A little, very little of action in 2 parts. 1st that goes for about 5 minutes and the other one that runs like maybe 10 minutes at best. This is not recommended. I watched it at 2 am. And it is insane. The movie is just plain stupid. 4 girls died by a psycho driver, driver gets his ass kicked by his another victims. Which are another 3 girls. And screams like a girl. They kill him to death. Oh my god. That's a black comedy.

The cars were cool and Kurt Russel is always worth watching, but the aimless dialogue sequences between the groups of female characters drug on forever! I had to fast forward until the scenes of Tarantino's idea of \\"girl talk\\" were over. Imagine two 15+ minute episodes of four females sitting around talking about crap before the movie begins again. If you will take note, Tarantino always has extensive scenes of dialogue between characters...it was ok in Pulp Fiction, but it is becoming quite annoying as his films progress and he sticks to this routine.

One is that we now get to see the missing lap dance footage in the bar. Also we get to see when Stuntman Mike finds the second group of girls. This scene provides knowledge to the viewer that is helpful in putting the whole film together.While Grindhouse split up Planet Terror and Death Proof for DVD release with the missing reels added.For those who miss the wacky The Grindhouse double feature complete with the funny previews and intermission check out:\\"Welcome to the Grindhouse - Black Candles/The Evil\\".I bought this cool drive-in double feature on one DVD and it was EXACTLY the same as \\"The Grindhouse\\" movie released earlier this year to the theatre!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stuntman Mike!!!","review":"This movie just missed.

The conversations are not witty filler here, they are all the movie has to offer and drawn out like they are they are no longer entertaining. We meet plenty of characters but most don't matter and honestly they are all disposable. The only saving grace in this film was Stuntman Mike himself, who was genuinely enjoyable. The other faces could come and go. The only action in the film is a couple of gruesome scenes 30 mins into it and then a car chase about an hour in.

That's about it, really.Nothing else really works in this movie. None of the women characters are ever believable. Their dialogue feels like badly-recycled parodies of PULP FICTION and RESEVOIR DOGS. The story is so thin that you yearn to just watch any of the drive-in grindhouse movies from the 1970s because at least they were better written!I was hoping that the KILL BILL movies would've got all the \\"homage\\" tendencies out of Tarantino and that he would start making real movies again. No. DEATH PROOF is only more, and worse.Posturing, pointless. Forgettable. A waste of a good cast.

Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction are among the best, so violence is fine... Planet Terror was a hit with the group. Deathproof quite easily was opposite in its effect and had moments and a general theme that was unhealthy and unnecessary for a man of talent (QT I mean)."},{"rating":"1","title":"If Boredom Were a movie...","review":"This is not a slasher movie. If it was there would be about 2hrs less dialogue and triple the body count. There is absolutely no pathos to this movie either. What if fails to accomplish by sharing the joy of a psycho who likes killing with his car, it fails to turn over when the girls start chasing the psycho. The dialogue is much like watch a very shrivelled, ugly person masturbate for 113 minutes while the eye candy saves nothing. If you have a choice between talking to a vapid moron with no sense of reality and a vast case of apathy or watching this movie, shoot the moron, burn the movie go out and get a few beers. There is absolutely nothing about this movie worth recommeding except NOT WATCHING IT.

Three days later I took more friends to see it. It is THAT good. For me, Grindhouse was opening trailers followed by Planet Terror followed by trailers and concluding with Death Proof. Thats the movie - this DVD release is half of Grindhouse. As much as I love Death Proof (and am certainly interested in see the uncut version) the films really really work well together in the double feature format. I don't see why we couldn't have a set with the theatrical double and then both uncut films. Ah well, one can hope. In the meantime I'm sure I'll purchase Death Proof and Planet Terror as seperate releases - its better than nothing after all.As to the movie itself, Death Proof is fantastic. Its a fascinating combination of Tarantino dialogue and unbelievable car chases.

His usually quirky, interesting dialogue just wasn't there this time. And to top it off, the characters were incredibly annoying. Not a good mix. He already makes the current day equivalent of grindhouse movies. Now, when he tries to recreate those clunky films, he fails. He should've made the same movie in his usual style without trying to imitate the look or try to live in a different time. It's like doing an old musical and trying to make it the way they did then. It just can't work. You can recreate the look, but it has no heart, it's uninspired. It's like Scorsese's \\"New York, New York,\\" it was set in that time, but was a modern movie.

The dialouge was never ending and it was not unique, quirky, funny, or intriguing like it was in his previous works...it was just ANNOYING. Also I don't think it would have been possible for QT to write more unlikeable female characters in the second half of this film. I was rooting for them all to die! And sadly, they were SUPPOSSED to be the heroes. Also, what happened to Stuntman Mike at the end of the film? He just wussed out.

What I find unacceptable is the exclusion of the fake trailers that ran between them in the original release. So now if these single releases don't sell well the trailers will likely never be released. If sale are high I can GUARANTEE November 08 will see a four or five disk super edition that includes the theatrical version and the extended versions along with all new special features.

I hope that Planet Terror has better extras when it is released. The Machete and Thanksgiving trailers were highlights of the film and I thought part of it. Also, the film itself. Okay, but not nearly as good as Planet Terror. The final half of the film drones on and on with its chase scene. Also, the dialogue between the girls was not up to the par of some of Tarantino's former films (Jackie Brown, Pulp Fiction, or Kill Bill). So, save your money and hope that Grindhouse is released like it should be on one disc (and it would fit on one disc by the way).

For the study on the classical treatment of PDE, many excellent books have already been published, e.g. Courant & Hilbert, Petrovsky. But for the modern and advanced tool of PDE, we can't find so many exciting texts, except this Egorov's one ! This compact text (about 200 pages) is much highly suggestive than I expected. Although this text contains only the \\"Elements\\", many great ideas should be found even by theoretical physicists.

Until I saw him live in Santa Fe. He was playing it all at once, sounding like three guitars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good overview for an icon","review":"This cd, though limited, is worth having because of the in-depth interview material researched from discussions with Tommy Shannon, Chris Layton, and Reese Wynans. There is also input from Doyle Bramhall, Stevie's co-conspirator on a lot of his music. It presents an insight, in a nutshell, of Stevie's career, from his mercurial rise through his rough times, and brings us to that awful night that took him away. The songs included on this cd, with the exception of \\"Taxman\\", can be found on other cds, but it's always worthwhile to add a new Stevie cd to a collection, and the two photos and nice pencil-sketch of Stevie are also good reasons to own it. It presents a short example of his work in unchronological order; it begins with the previously unheard \\"Taxman\\" and ends, ironically, with a song he wrote for a friend of his who died, \\"Life Without You\\", a fitting last song for what is, basically, a tribute album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Last of the blues virtuosos.","review":"None of SRV's imitators have both the chops and the soul, and those who've taken another turn have gone the wrong way.

Those 4 tunes alone need to be at the back of the line (if in line at all). The list order leaves everything to be desired.Whoever put this thing together really missed the boat on the essence of SRV's style and soul.

This compilation doesn't really aim at the potential fan of his music, and instead aims a little lower, for the broad market. The result is not as satisfying as it should be, and worth skipping entirely (as are most compilations). Fortunately The Real Deal: Greatest Hits 2 makes up for it. Check it out instead for the best possible introduction to Stevie Ray Vaughan's music on one CD - it's excellent. Needless to say, if you then want to hear more, check out the original albums. Or, you could just start there instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't be fooled by the 5 stars......","review":"I gave this 5 stars based only on the quality of the music. I really wouldn't recommend this CD. Anyone who likes Stevie Ray should buy his albums instead. There are only four of them. If you have all of SRV's albums then this CD is worth keeping around only for the groovy version of the Beatles' Taxman. This is only a tiny sampling of the great music that Stevie Ray has to offer. This will leave you unfulfilled. You'll take this disc out of your player wanting more. I would recommend SRV's debut, Texas Flood, for anyone looking to get into his music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a complete retrospective","review":"I am a devoted Stevie Ray Vaughan fan, but I was disappointed with this CD. The CD had only 11 tracks and should (and could) have included many more. It contained most of his radio friendly songs, but missed some of his longer, more intimate works. I was much happier with SRV's Greatest Hits II, which was longer and a more complete retrospective of his career."},{"rating":"1","title":"Routine roundup","review":"Okay, if you're starting a fan off, you'd want them to hear examples of Stevie's stunning guitar. Makes sense, right? That's the guy's claim to fame, after all. And yet they miss out on a few of his best solos. Where's Rivera Paradise? Where's Lenny? Where's Things (That) I Used to Do? Wheres Ain't Gone 'n' Give Up on Love? Love Struck Baby? Testify? Wall of Denial? Let Me Love You Baby? Or, if you want a bit of acoustic SRV, how about Life By the Drop? If you're looking for just Stevie's best known songs, this does contain Texas Flood, Pride and Joy, Couldn't Stand the Weather, Cold Shot, Life Without You and the cover of Little Wing. But this was a blown opprotunity to present the definitive Stevie Ray Vaughan overview. Stick to Essential if you're a newcomer, since it contains most of this album plus most the above tracks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the best \\"Greatest Hits\\" album for SRV","review":"Was a fan for many years of this man, and was extremely devastated upon his sudden death in the mid eighties. An artist such as SRV has many great songs as well as lesser-known gems. I like the songs on this album but the bad thing is that it is not remastered. For the money you cannot go wrong, but for a little more you can get a better compilation than this one, which came out in 1995. Groovy sounds and of course the Blues mystique is what you get here. Features hits like Taxman and one of my favorites in \\"Couldn't stand the weather\\". If you can pick up the 2002 release \\"The Essential Stevie Ray Vaughan and Double Trouble\\" then that is a better purchase in my opinion. Other great songs include \\"Pride and Joy\\" and the fun rocker \\"The House is rockin\\". The best thing for this artist would be to present fans with a boxed set that included all of the singles as well as some live performances. If you are new to SRV then this is not a bad place to start."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent compilation of Stevie Ray","review":"When B.B. King and Eric Clapton take off their musical hats when referring to someone, you know that someone has to be something! And that someone is Stevie Ray Vaughn, who tragically passed away in August 27, 1990.Before dying, Stevie left a musical legacy that consists of a four studio recordings and several live recordings. After it, another post mortem studio album was released: \\"Sky Is Crying.\\" Ever since, several attempts have been made in the form of double CDs, a Box, and this album, at summarizing the real essence of Stevie Ray. Just like with so many other acts, SRV is very hard to compact down in a single album, given the brilliant nature of his discography. Based on this, I recommend this album only for newcomers to Stevie Ray Vaughn (like I was until I got this album), since all the tracks (except for one, a cover of The Beatle's \\"TaxMan\\") have been previously released."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I usually stay away from computer books entitled \\"Complete Guide to...\\" or 'Complete Reference of...\\" as they are usually pretty worthless, being clogged up with snapshots of the administrators console and windy discussions of mundane administrative tasks.

Most of the topics are covered reasonably well and give the reader a great overview of DB2's capabilities. One exception is that DB2's support for parallel databases was not covered to the degree that the topic deserves.The programming examples were fairly helpful.

All I will say is that the movie is extremely violent and uses teenagers as actors. If you are against that sort of thing, you should steer clear.The picture quality is decent, but not reference material by any stretch of the imagination. The picture is a bit soft and there is occasional black crush as well as color and detail loss at times. The films are framed in 1.78:1 (16:9 as is the standard for HDTV) and encoded in AVC MPEG-4.The sound, however, is really excellent. There is a TrueHD 7.1 Japanese track and a dubbed TrueHD 5.1 English track, both of which sound excellent. There is great separation and excellent use of the surrounds, providing a very immersive presentation.Video rating: 2.5 - 3 starsAudio rating: 5 starsOverall rating: Four stars"},{"rating":"2","title":"BR is awesome","review":"Love this movie.... it was a gift to my sister, the price was great and the item was perfect... its an awesome complete collection"},{"rating":"1","title":"Once again, packaging that scratches DVDs","review":"The DVDs are housed in book style packaging (similar to the 'Friday the 13th Ultimate Collection).

Anyone who had purchased the \\"Friday the 13\\" boxed set and had to return it because the DVDs were all scratched will know what I'm talking about.

Take away the 'controversy' created primarily with the time of its release at a time when the world was still reeling from student on student violence and your left with a mediocre blood fest. Had this movie come out in 97 (long enough before columbine to be forgotten) it would have never made it outside Japan and their enthusiasts.Calling it the clockwork orange of the 21st century, i guess, is not too far off if you believe that clockwork orange was actually a masterpiece.

I have only one gripe, although minor, they should not have bothered making a dubbed track of the movie.

It has a wheel-shape, the thin, dry, yellow-beige crust has some moulds. This cheese was discovered by Dutch cheesemakers, living in Tilsit which was then in East Prussia. The cheese is washed and brushed regularly for the first two months so that the crusty rind forms. This protects the smooth, supple interior with its tiny, irregular holes from drying out. The aroma is mildly pungent while the taste is buttery and fruity with a spicy tinge. It is generally made with whole milk. A natural hard cheese, German Tilsit has a stronger flavor than its Scandinavian cousins. It has tiny hole formation and a firm texture, suitable for slicing.

The mystery plot was believable and keeps the reader guessing and following clues along with Caroline and Jack.This book is a nice kind that you shove in your purse and yank out while waiting in lines. It provides several hours of entertainment and what more can you ask of a book?I'd rate it at PG 13, since there is one tame sex scene."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book","review":"This was another good purchase for me.

Spurr presents an excellent and very readable account of the last sailing of the Yamato on it's suicide mission to Okinawa. The author switches back and forth between the American side and the Japanese side, and, because of this, presents two sides of the same event. And, when reading both sides, the reader gets the impression that the author has done one heck of a job of research. The American characters, and especially the Japanese characters, come alive as real people, in real situations, in real action. Spurr has done an excellent job in both research and presentation; the book is exciting and hard to put down once you start reading. I was also impressed with the clarity of maps and diagrams, which, in most books of this period, are so small and blurry they are impossible to read. A great battleship. A great story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made-up names","review":"In the passage describing the part played by Torpedo Squadron 84 the attack on the Yamato contains egregious errors in the names of 12 of the 14 pilots of VT-84.

My name is Dewey Ray. An Owen Ray appears in Russell Spurr's account . I was one of the pilots on the attack. There was no Owen Ray in our squadron and the names of the other pilots on the attack are similarly mangled or completely ficticious."},{"rating":"2","title":"A superb book that I shall read over again, and again.","review":"I rather enjoyed this book.

Judith Ivey plays well as the love interest though Martin's ineptitude and her own hang ups keep separating them.Funny and romantic.

I was hoping that a ten-ton safe would fall on the Larry Hubbard character, or that Godzilla would suddenly appear and turn him into a pile of smoking cinders with a jetlike column of fire. That way, he would be put out of his misery and it would be easier to sympathize with him. As it were, the Hubbard character comes across like a sexless zombie in a double-knit suit.

I had previously watched this movie in another version (original Italian sound) with English subtitles and that was one of the reasons I ordered it. The Italian sound was so much better! I think the editing should have brought the DVD with the option of hearing it in the original Italian language, and also adding more subtitle options, such as Spanish, Portuguese (my mother language), Italian and French, besides of English.

The book focuses mainly on 'I was there' first-hand accounts of flying the Corsair instead of the history of the aircraft and aces that flew it. This is OK, but I was expecting more of an aces/pilots/units approach that is the mainstay of the other books in this series. Often, first-hand accounts are just that, sort of a 'this is what happened to me', while overlooking the big picture. The artwork, as usual, is the saving grace of the book.

The book celebrates where Keen lives and what he knows best: the Rocky Mountains in 13 chapters from why is there weather, through snow and rain, cold and hot, to light and weather observation.Errors include use of \\"SierraS\\" (Sierra is already plural) and deliberate rejection of the US system of measurement, SI or \\"metric\\" even though it permeates our lives and is mandated by federal law (Acts of 1866, 1975 and 1988), and thereby eliminates quantitative consideration of Canada and Mexico except for anecdotal events.This is an enjoyable read and good reference, it is just waiting to be updated with SI units so it can better be integrated for use in schools and universities."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't capture the series at all","review":"I was a big fan of the Reds in the 70's. This DVD is a major disappointment. It is full of too close shots of players swinging the bat and Joe G. telling you what happened - you don't actually see it. Most of the game shots are of a player running or swinging the bat. Very few actual plays are shown. Most home runs are shown with a close-up of a player swinging and then a cut to the outfielder looking over the wall. It almost felt like they didn't have the real game action and were cutting the story together from clips they had. All in all it doesn't capture any of the excitement of the 75 series. One of the best ever. 76 is much of the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"Memories","review":"You don't have to live in Cincinnati to enjoy this bit of history.

This albumn represents Fishbone's finest body of work in almost a decade. Production failures prevent this albumn from reaching it's full potential, but the songs cannot be denied by bad mixing. Angelo Moore is at the top of his game as witnessed by an audience that was fortunate enought to catch his performance at the Pearl Room in Mokena IL, on May 11th 2007. The horn section sounded better than it has in a long time and Rocky played ax like a young prodigy with what appeared to be a cast on his picking hand. Norwood (actually seemed sober) kept the bottom heavy and frantic all night. The young guy (dre) is really finding his identity on the keys and bit part voacls. The albumn is good, but if you really want to capture FISHBONE, do yourself a favor and go take in one of America's last authentic treasures.

If you know nothing of jazz, you'll enjoy a well written book about a fascinating person."},{"rating":"2","title":"not as newsworthy as the breathless reviews suggest","review":"This is a good book on a character hitherto encountered only in Ellington biographies. What's silly are the insinuations that Strayhorn didn't get a byline for his work or that he was the creative mind behind the Ellington orchestra. The songs for which the byline has always been Strayhorn are compelling enough to stand by themselves (his accomplishments were remarked at my family dinner table when he passed away). And Ellington had already written many of his greatest songs prior to meeting Strayhorn. So the 'Behind the Music/Entertainment Tonight' angles are ludicrous. Read the book and buy the records and prepare to be amazed."},{"rating":"2","title":"An enjoyable read. Humorous and Scholarly.","review":"I liked this book very much. SO much Joyce criticism is dry and dull. Culleton's work displays a kind of scholarship and humor not found in much Joyce criticism. I would recommend this book highly.

Diana Anaid has 2 earlier albums out, one a self titled album, and one titled \\"I don't think I'm pregnant\\". I own the second of these two albums and it kicks a##. You can find these two albums on this website, but you will have to search under the name Diana Ah Naid. Unfortunately you can't listen to the tracks on these two albums, but i can personally atest to the fact that \\"I Don't think I'm Pregnant\\" will blow you away and become one of your favourites, so if you like beautiful obscene, definetly get \\"I don't think im pregnant.

Having it in the glove box makes it easy to keep my interior dust-free. However, a couple of small issues to note:- Give it a few good whacks before using it the first time, or it may leave small amounts of red lint behind.- Some surfaces seem to suck lint out of it regardless. The matte vinyl areas of my dash have this (very minor) issue.- The handle interferes a bit when I try to dust the dash where it meets the windshield. (This depends on the angle of your car's windshield. I used this duster on a 2012 Hyundai Elantra.) I find I have to angle the handle down or it will tap/slide on the glass. Wrapping the whole thing in microfiber when I do the far edge works as well.These are small complaints; the most important thing is that this product works--it grabs the dust and gets into most tricky spots effortlessly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't Believe it","review":"The California Cleaning thing really works.

We have been warned of this for centuries. The most tempting one is the voice in our own head that tells us what we should look like and strive to be.

Then, they escape and go on a journey of discovery, following a myth to the light. Freedom is close, but only if they can overcome the deception.** By its size, you might be tempted to dismiss this book as one for children, but the point it has to make is one that can be more fully appreciated by someone older.

If you want to see it, I'm sure it's on the computer that you have some where! THE REASON I am commenting right now is because I'm not saying Downey should cast another Only You movie but please why can't you producers, directors or whoever makes movies do another movie, theme or topic related to Only you. Something along that field. I want to see more movies filmed it Italy. But that's just a preference, I want to see more movies with an Only you theme. Not just a regular love story like You've Got Mail, a detailed one like Only you! I will watch it! But all these producers probably care about is how much money it will make and the best looking actors & actresses you can get to play in it! Well if someone created Only You, please can someone do it again. Not the exact same movie, just a similiar type...PLEASE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Award winner","review":"This is, hand down, the worst chick flick ever made. Tomei is the perennial 14-year-old, talking with her hands, giggling, bawling, in constant movement and near hysteria. Downey is perhaps the worst leading man in recent memory; he's the Robert Lowry or James Ellison of our time. The story is simply ridiculous and utterly unbelievable. Still, one can imagine teeny girls in theaters all over the world weeping into their popcorn.In short, this is a first class turkey. Only the lovely photography saves it from utter infamy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please enter a title for your review","review":"did this movie make any sense to anyone? it's the definitive example of the romantic comedy cliche being executed without any regard for detail. just have an attractive man and woman engage in a few antagonistic interactions, then end it with \\"they're in love\\". most Adam Sandler movies have more character logic in their \\"romances\\". a few scenes had some entertainment value so i'll give it 2 stars instead of 1 but the main plot is one of the biggest messes hollywood has ever produced."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"This has to be one of THE best movies I have ever seen. It definately has not got the publicity it deserves. It's funny, charming and romantic. Marisa Tomei and Robert Downey Jnr. are FANTASTIC and the storyline is just as good. An especially good Valentine's movie, but brilliant any time! Get it and don't miss out!P.S. Italy is beautiful! The Italian tourist board should thank the makers of Only You - It has persuaded me to go to Italy sometime!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Still one of my favorites","review":"There are a few movies I can watch over and over and this is one of them. Okay, I am a huge Joaquim de Almeida fan (I do his web site) which was the draw for me to watch it the first time.However, there's something so charming about this movie I'd have liked it anyway. While I do find Marisa Tomei somewhat annoying in the movie and didn't like Fischer Steven's character - the movie is enchanting. Beautiful scenery!Bonnie Hunt by far stole the show from Marisa Tomei in this. And Joaquim turns in a wonderful performance. Most people in the U.S. only know his \\"bad guy\\" roles (such as Clear and Present Danger, Desperado, and \\"24\\") and haven't seen him do comedic roles. He handles it well and he is the perfect seductive character while being totally likeable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy it, watch it, love it!!!","review":"I love this movie. On a rainy day, with nothing to do, curl up on the couch and feel good. What a great movie to lose yourself in.

From scene one, its stupid and predictable. The dialogue was primitive. The fact that I spend a wonderful semester in Rome and Positano, Italy is one of my favorite places in the world was not enough to save this movie for me. I'd encourage my fellow romantics to pass on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst romantic comedy EVER MADE","review":"I am astounded by the number of 5 star reviews for this movie. It has got to be one of the sappiest, most poorly scripted, and ridiculous movies ever. I like Marisa Tomei, Bonnie Hunt, and Robert Downey Jr. But this movie was an epic fail. Marisa Tomei's character was a total flake, the type that gives women everywhere a bad name. Do not buy this movie. You should only watch it if it's free, like if you find it in a dumpster or something. Even then, that should give you a clue about the quality of this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best!","review":"I decided to rent this movie knowing nothing about it. I loved it sooo much I watched it 5 days in a row. It's even my boyfriends favorite movie now. If you liked Return To Me, You've Got Mail or Runaway Bride you will fall in love with this one. It is funny and romantic.

Much maligned and always rated near the bottom of presidential rankings, these leaders, Cash believes, deserve a second look. His book, Unsung Heros, makes the case that they should be seen in a more favorable light. The stories and insights Cash provides about Ohio's presidents make for an entertaining read that will appeal to both the casual and serious historian."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book worth singing about","review":"This is a very readable, entertaining, and enlightening book about eight men Ohio claims as native son presidents -- William Henry Harrison, Ulysses S. Grant, Rutherford B.Hayes, James Garfield, William McKinley, William Howard Taft, and Warren G. Harding. The author makes a convincing case that they are not rated as highly as they should be. All, for example, stood more for civil rights for African-Americans they other candidates and presidents of their eras who are commonly rated as better presidents. Another theme is the heroism of several of them in the Civil War. Another is their humble demeanor, in marked contrast to such self-promoters as Theodore Roosevelt. This is a well-written revisionist look at Ohio's presidents, written for lay readers with interest in history. Also, it contains many \\"human interest\\" facts and anectodes about these presidents, who should not be forgotten."},{"rating":"2","title":"Someone Was Watching","review":"This story is about Mom, Dad, Chris, Pat, Bud, Clover, and Molly.

Chris goes to ( Pat's Chris's friend) the beach where Molly gets kidnapped and has a video camera that will give him all the answers. I liked it a lot.

It is a beautifully written book, very descriptive and pretty straight on the mark with its history.My only qualm with the book is that Greek names were not used for the Greek army stuck in Asia Minor, which I found quite odd...and it gets off to a slow start till the army enters the town. At times I thought are they going to wander the desert forever?Overall I would completely recommend this book, especially to any fans of historic fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forced ...","review":"I cannot figure out why this book was on the shortlist for the 2004 Whitbread First Novel Award. The use of big words and teacher pleaser descriptions was forced and did not come across as natural. The characters were not well developed. I felt the author was either making an attempt at existential thought or else just couldn't come up with much of a plot. Every mention of a Greek mythological story or person was referenced in footnotes regardless of common knowledge (for many readers) of the most famous ones. How many times can an author use the word clandestine without the word loosing its charm?"},{"rating":"2","title":"great resource","review":"I use this as a companion to my Butterflies through Binoculars book.

Most of the tracks only have 2 or 3 of the MC's on 'em, and every member has a solo track. This sounds more like a compilation not a group album. And most of the beats sound horrible, not up to LL standards at all. There is, however, one good thing about this album, The bonus disc! I don't know if it's a limited edition thing or not but the bonus disc had a bunch of classic LL joints like \\"Simple Man\\" & \\"24 hrs w/ a G\\".

It would get one star if it weren't for Get It In Your Soul."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"(This review refers to the eighth edition)This is an excellent textbook for an ordinary 3 semester calculus sequence. Important theorems are not used without proof, the illustrations are simple and tasteful (I hate when math textbooks contain color photographs), and the content is well-written. There's a good balance between theory and applications. This textbook does tend to be more challenging than many undergraduate texts, and may not be appropriate for high school or junior college courses.The least upper bound material would be better placed earlier, before studying integrals. The authors might have expanded the theory involving implicit differentiation and differentials. This is an introductory text, however, and the authors generally make good choices when it comes to including theory. Every university should use this book as the text for their standard calculus sequences."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book is terrible","review":"I felt like this book does not give good descriptive examples to help you throughout the problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not rigor, not dumbed down.","review":"I seen my roomates with this book and thought its just another one of those nonrigor books but its not so bad and problems are half bad and sometimes amusing.

Good book, not bad, look for used ones... I got mine for $4!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"Do not buy this book. It's examples are terrible. I've already taken calculus in high school, but I forgot a lot of the material. This book is not refreshing my memory very well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good","review":"This is a very decent calculus book.One of my favorite features is the complete lack of stock photos -- instead, they decided to fill the space with USEFUL information, and diagrams related to the topic being discussed (no baseball players and businessmen...).The book has a fairly good balance of theory and applications, and does a good job at using elegant but INSTRUCTIVE proofs.It is a gentler introduction that something like Apostol or Spivak -- less theory ... which depending on what you plan to use it for can be a good or bad thing. I personally used it before trying to tackle Apostol's book, and it made reading the latter much easier.All in all, I'd recommend this book over most other calculus books geared towards this audience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely dreadful for Calculus newbies!","review":"If you dread taking calculus and aren't into math theory, I wouldn't recommend using this book. It'll only increase your headaches. The examples are sometimes too simple for the homework problems and will require an additional supplement. The chapters are horribly structured. A new chapter usually begins directly underneath exercises--a definite eye sore, given all the theorems shown. I, however, think the chapter on \\"Limits\\" is by far the best section. If the book implemented this method of teaching throughout the whole book, I'd give the book a better rating.A college calculus book I can stand behind is \\"Calculus\\" by Smith and Minton. They work out several examples in simple terms to help you understand Calculus without all the frustration. I wish I would have discovered it earlier during my course."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended for students (high school or beyond)","review":"This book is the third calculus book I've used since I first took a calculus course in high school, and it's hands down the worst I've seen. The examples in the book are aimed more towards the challenge problems in the back of each section. If you're having problems with Problem #1 in a particular section, don't expect this book to tell you how to do it. I suppose the writers assume that the reader already has a great understanding of what's going on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not suitable for an introduction to calculus","review":"This book is more designed for students who already know calculus and need a reminder.

Even the color, if you look closely, it's not the ivory color of the top 3 items, it's a more pinkish color.I admit, the color is written in the description and I didn't read it carefully enough. But that photo is just bad. Even has a 2nd photo showing the nice floral pattern on the sheet, making me believe that does exist. It may be hard to get an attractive picture on just the fitten sheet, but this photo has to be changed to be more clear of the item that is being sold.Don't mind paying $300 just for the fitten sheets, but at this price, it not only need to be comfortable, it needs to look nice as well. unfortunately without the floral patterns and the pink color, it feels and looks like just like a $50 set of 1200 thread sheets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I teach Gilgamesh every year in my Freshman Honors Seminar, and it has always been one of my and my students' favorite texts. That is, until the anthology I was using put out a new edition and switched from David Ferry's to Jackson's translation. I found that Jackson managed to obscure (or just ignore) most of the important themes of the work. He gives his reader no sense of the bond between Gilgamesh and Enkidu; his account of Enkidu \\"becoming human\\" through his interactions w/ the temple harlot focuses almost completely on sex, with no hint of Enkidu's growing self-consciousness.

The book is recommended for ages 4-8, but the drawings and language are more suited for 3-5 year olds; in fact I found the language down right condescending (babyish).

He walks into bank vaults with fistloads of cash in his pockets, mauls nitclub b-girls killing them with his radioactive touch, all to the big beat of a sleazy screeching 50s big band. The technicolor is rich and over-saturated (the way I like it).No extras on this DVD, but the transfer is cool, bar some excess surface noise on the print.This would make a good copmpanion-piece to \\"X!

There's a great premise buried inside this clunky film, which is how two brothers pursuing separate scientific breakthroughs can converge and then separate, based not on science, but morality and ethics. There's a decent turn by former Miss America Lee Meriweather and the two leads are ok, but the direction is clunky and corny and it's generous to call it a 'b' movie. Still, aficionados might find the bare bones of the story and way vfx were handled in that period kind of amusing, somewhat educational!

Static 80s sounding arrangements.","review":"Having read the two reviews here, and being familiar mostly with Rick's work with Yes and his earlier solo CDs, I thought, 'hey, instrumentals of Yes music done by Rick would be nice background music.' Whoa, wrong! These are static arrangements using 80's digital sample players, with a heavily-Korg-based sound. Okay, they're polished compared to what your average MIDIkid might do in his bedroom, but so boring and commercial and just plain mundane that I don't think I'll be able to stand listening to these discs a third time. And should an instrumental arrangement of \\"Roundabout\\" really be LONGER than the original? If this is typical of Wakeman's later work, I don't want to hear it! I certainly won't buy any more 90's Wakeman without a thorough investigation.

Many of the things you are told to do are just flat out wrong- leading to extreme confusion and frustration in the various project steps. I had to give up on this book because the examples don't even work when you follow the directions. That and I absolutely hate those Ellen and Zak kids, the examples in every chapter.BUT I did find a great book that I recommend 100% for people new to Flash. I was comfortable with Flash animation after working through the first couple of chapters in \\"Macromedia Flash MX 2004: Hands on Training\\" by Yeung and Weinman.

He was one of the members of Solas, who I have also heard live at a festival.What I had not heard clearly before was Doyle's great voice. He can carry a song a capella, but why when he plays so beautifully. From flatpicking to jazz, he's definitely one of Ireland's best guitarsmen.

The throw starts at your feet, up to the seat where you sit, and goes up behind you, and then stops at the top. Sitting down alot will make that throw fall down behind you.

Eventually I have to bent the hook down in order to muscle my tire onto the hook.

I have a hybrid bike and don't get what all the tire size fuss is all about.I was ready to use toggle bolts but got lucky and the stud was right where I needed it. I'm not big on measuring, so I held the bike about where I wanted it, marked it, placed the hook about 6 inches above that, marked the holes in the hook, drilled the holes and hung the rack. I have the bike only a couple of inches above the ground (I'm a woman, why make it harder to lift than necessary?). The rear tire holder was just as easy. Anyone with a very rudimentary knowledge of drilling holes into studs and recognizing that you probably need something a little more robust than what they include, will not have a problem.

I only figured that their voices might come across better in a recording studio and thought I would give the album a fair shot.I regret that now.It seems that the best parts of this album is when only one of these guys are singing. Simon said he found these opera singers individually and figured they would sing together wonderfully. That explains why they are all from different countries. And, yes, they each sing fantastically well... alone. But when they all sing together, they seem a little bit off and don't harmonize well.And, unfortunately, when they sing they drown out the music.

After listening to as much as i could bear to stand, i really feel as though i might need some rest.I give these guys 2 stars instead of one because i think they are actually talented singers, given the right material and and less cheese."},{"rating":"1","title":"American Idol producer tries to make a fool of us once again","review":"Just put four guys together, have them sing old songs (very loudly) in a foreign language, introduce them on Oprah.Does that sound like a formula for making out a deposit slip on your way to the bank?I received this CD along with a dozen roses for my anniversary with the cover of four rejects from the Male Model Contest. Apropos for a reality show *genius.*Roses die quickly, but they lasted longer than my endurance of this screaming songfest. Is there a 99 cent bin, where I can toss this horror?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice attempt at bringing Opera to a new generation but...","review":"The hunky looks of this foursome may make you swoon but their voices may make you cringe! They tend to over power each other's vocals when they sing as an ensemble as if trying to out \\"Divo/Diva\\" one another. You wind up running to the volume control to turn it down! I was given this album as a gift and wound up playing it only once. Watching them perform live on TV definitely showed that they are coyly trying to out do each other vocally. Having the Backstreet Boys' producers on board can tell you that there's a hint of desperation to get young listeners turned on to opera. Your best bet is to pick up a copy of \\"Carreras Domingo Pavarotti ~ The Three Tenors in concert\\" for some real good ensemble vocals, or \\"Amici Forever - The Opera Band\\" if you are looking for a fresh, new, young perspective on opera. Perhaps Il Divo's producers will learn from their mistakes and reduce the volume on the microphones for the next album (if there is one)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absurd.","review":"This is a joke right? This is the worst music I have ever heard. Just because it was endorsed on the Oprah show does not make it alright. Just listen to the music clips and let me know if you think this is worth the 5 seconds you just wasted listening to this complete odure. If Oprah had Trey Parker and Matt Stone on her show and they put out an album classical pop favorites sung my Cartman, Terrence And Phillip, and Mr. Hankey would it become the number one seller on Amazon? What is wrong with Americans? I am embarrassed by this music and by all of you who actually bought this absolute joke called music."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of Il Divo","review":"I think this CD is the best of them all.I have all of them.Listen to them every day.

A little extra money for the duel disc you get a short dvd and full cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Somehow I thought I was buying an album on which Il Divo sang at least a few songs in English. No such luck. Most of the music was totally unfamiliar to me, and although is is of course beautifully sung, it's not a sing-along album for me! And I do sing along with familiar operettas and operas as well as most (Egnlish-language) vocal music.If your Italian is good, you might love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Il Divo","review":"These gentlemen have a wonderful blend.

Middle aged women are looking for good rock and pop, not antique, music. As a senior, and a first-generation rock 'n' roller, I know the difference between good music and a misguided marketing gimmick. This is the latter. I'm going to plug into my iPod now, and I think I'll start with \\"Blood Makes Noise.\\" Preferably Cowell's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extreme Disappointment","review":"I couldn't wait for this album to come out... and after 30 minutes I couldn't wait to take it out of my stereo! The problem is when all of the men sing together. It is not mixed in a way that maximizes the harmonies of the music. It sounds as if one is singing in front with a backup band behind. Also, at times the background music overpowers the voices. This album could have been so much more...."},{"rating":"1","title":"In a country where Thomas Kincaid is considered a great painter ...","review":"No one ever went broke underestimating the taste of the American public.

I can't believe why so many cover bands are so popular. Maybe the judgment day is coming soon! Luckily, then I can hear only real and pure music.Il Divo is something like Gregorian(Master of Chant) but much worse. These boys have really good voice but I can't understand why don't they song more about own songs.Cover songs like Mama and Unbreak My Heart are good ones performed by original artists but these qu**r boys r**e excelent songs.I hate easy riders who use other artist's classic song to get success, glory and many.

This quartet takes itself catastrophically seriously (\\"Unbreak my Heart\\" in Italian? please!); the only thing thicker than the vibrato is the pretense. In the hands of a gifted vocal/choral coach, they could be stunning, but in the hands of Simon Cowell, they're mostly just loud, un-nuanced, monochromatic, and slick. Enjoy it if it's your cup of tea, but please don't tell me it's high art. (On the other hand, it's fun to try to guess what they'll be translating next---\\"Who Let the Dogs Out\\" becomes \\"Chi emette le cani\\"? Hee.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"New Kids on the Block Meet Opera","review":"Having listened to this album I am disturbed by the fact that disgusting elements from the World of pop have decided it is not enough to fabricate stars in their own field of influence, but to transgress into the classical World with this tripe. Il Divo should be renamed Il Trivio as it is trivial manufactured rubbish. There is not one decent tenor voice amongst them, and if their record label thinks that dressing four good looking guys in designer suits creates opera talent, then they are mistaken. Spend you hard earned money on real singers!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh.","review":"Really. When one bad tenor insists on singing it's bad enough, but four bad tenors at once? What did we do to deserve this? Well, we can't really expect great things from Simon Cowell, can we? I don't even need to buy this CD to know that it would horrible. Just from the samples available on Amazon, it sounds like they are all trying to outsing each other, which in turn causes them to strain, which causes them to go sharp. This is like Ashlee Simpson. Why would someone really, genuinely think this is good? It disgusts me. If I could give it a rating of negative stars, I would."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tenors out of tune.","review":"I listened to the samples of this groups' songs and did not like it at all. It sounds like they are trying to outsing each other. Their voices sounds like they are imitating the 3 tenors but did not quite made it. I will not buy the CD even if you give me a hundred bucks. That's what I think of this group Il Divo (really bad sound and bad song selection). So Simon you're not really a good judge, I don't know why you say all those nasty words at some of the contestants in Amercian Idol. This group of yours sounds really bad, it needs fine tuning."},{"rating":"1","title":"IL CHEESO: Cheesy, hysterically bad, preening mess...","review":"Omigod... I am still laughing hysterically from having heard the first single, a ridiculously over dramatized cheeseball version of Toni Braxton's Unbreak my heart... IL DIVO are even cheesier than the Toni Braxton version, its cheesy video, and their cheesy name would suggest... It makes me sad that this passes for moving, well-made music and that \\"formally trained\\" singers have to resort to Menudo-style cheesy commercialism to become famous and critically acclaimed... IL DIVO indeed... how funny... They should be called Il Cheeso!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jan from CA","review":"I absolutely love this CD. I saw this group debut on Oprah and immediately preordered the CD. I have gone on to order more for gifts. I am amazed that these 4 young (and gorgeous) artists have all come from different countries and sing so amazingly well as a group. I love the fact that the songs are sung in English, Spanish and Italian. The style reminds me of Josh Groban's first CD. My Spanish is still not fluent and I know even less Italian but even if you don't know a word of any of the languages, the beauty and sensuousness of the music comes through. The Righteous Brothers were my favorite duo growing up so I was happy to see Unchained Melody included. I automatically turn on this CD when I sit down and have yet to grow tired of hearing it everyday."},{"rating":"2","title":"Il Divo Divine","review":"This music is amazing and just think - we have Simon Cowell to thank!

Imagine a cheesier version of Julio Iglesias times 4 and you'll get Il Divo! Its not that they're completely untalented its just that they are so over the top You want romance & mood music in a foreign language? buy an Andrea Bocelli CD & send Il Divo back to \\"Star Search\\"!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"this cd is a complete abomination......","review":"i don't get why people like this....maybe it;s because the average joe isn;t a musician so they don;t know what actually sounds good. this whole album is completely awkward. the voices don;t blend well at all. i saw another review saying it;s like the 4 of them are trying to over power each other. this is a perfect way to describe it. the lowest voice part *whatever his name is* has a very scary tone to me. not to mention the scariest expressions on his face (if you saw them on tv u must know what i;m talking about) but i think if anything brings this from bad to awful-it's him. the songs are dreadful, and arrangements are so cheesy it;s painful. it;s not that i think all of these guys have horrible voices. i don;t feel that way. but they should be doing something else. this is a bad combination of musical styles and voices that is unforgivable. if you want to buy the cd for a good laugh go ahead, because this cd is so obnoxious it's funny"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh","review":"This is just the type of music that makes me feel that the end of the World has to be at hand. It is simply awful! Sickly sweet covers of love songs done in classical style all sung by 4 men who can't seem to get out of the way of their own vibratos. Listening to this CD drops your IQ by at least 15%. Do yourself a favor and purchase some real classical music.."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites....","review":"This is my favorite album since Norah Jones'. Yes the guys seem to try to outsing each other but after fine tuning in the next album, they sure will find successful careers! Way to go, Simon! Great ideas to try to bring classics to the mass.

Half of the songs are old tunes recycled - some are very poorly rearranged, e.g. Nella Fantasia - the other half are rather bland. The music style is the same old pop/classical crossover, with no individuality whatsoever. The voices, after studio engineering, sound easy on the ear but only when they are heard singularly. When singing together, they haven't quite found the harmony yet. I've also watched their performance in concert, which isn't all that impressive, either. Simon Cowell said, \\"they are going to be huge\\", but with what? I wonder."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh my friggen god!!!!!!","review":"I have to say I really don't care if the groups formed via auditions, their voices are amzing.

I was expecting more avante-garde post-modern 80s music. All I got was a bunch of lousy songs in some kind of moon-man language.

Yes. Tolerable? Not quite...","review":"I must hand it to Simon Cowell, this is an intriguing project. Taking classical (not new wave classical but REAL classical) and pop and attempting to meld the two together is an interesting notion. Ultimately, however, the band fails. First and foremost, Il Divo will never be able to escape the fact that they are a manufactured band, brought together by a talent search and, essentially, given everything they needed on a silver platter. Yes, it worked with the Sex Pistols and a few others, but bands created by a record company, for the most part, spew out whatever crap their adoring label wants them to. Their poppy take on classical will make fans of classical music despise their superficiality, their classical take on pop will make most pop-listeners dismiss them as boring or as a silly novelty. If you must buy this album, \\"Nella Fantasia\\" and \\"Passera\\" are better than most of the other tracks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bravo!","review":"Four very talented young men whose voices blend beautifully.

I have purchased both CDs and I am hooked on this beautiful sound. These four men have bags of Charisma and a wealth of talent. They are quickly becoming the New Beatles for the new genre and generation. The first CD sets the stage for what is to come. I find myself thinking about new and exciting songs that can be interpreted by these wonderfully talented young singers.

How nice to hear real singers, (who cares I don't know what they are saying in another language?) - The song MAMA didn't impress, but the rest is just spectacular. Would have been nice if they included translations in the text of the CD insert booklet, but I'll survive. Right now, it's all I listen to, and if you need to be inspired, you will too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sheep in pain with orchestral backing","review":"The voices are trained and strong but the producers of this CD are tone deaf and probably believe that Justin Timberlake is a musical genius. These four voices deserved far better production, selection, recording and post production. All I hear are four voices straining out each song in the same style and at the same timbre. There is no imagination at all. There is a vocal music term for what is done here: \\"armpit finale\\". These four voices could inspire yet they leave me hitting the forward button hoping that the next track will be something I will want to hear to the end. Sack the producer and give it another try."},{"rating":"2","title":"Il Divo Keeps Its Promise On New Release","review":"Prior to receiving this CD, I was only minimally aware of Il Divo, the princes of popera. I had seen them on television several times, and knew that they had amazing voices and harmonies. When I first listened to this, I was blown away. These songs truly showcase Il Divo's incredible harmonies. The instrumentals are expertly arranged. The melodies are deceptively simple, yet compelling. Each song is full of pleasant surprises in harmonies, melodies and dynamics. If you listen, and emerge yourself in the music, you will not only be interested, you will also be lost in the music. With the exception of Amazing Grace, the songs are in Spanish. Regardless if you understand the words, the music emotes the sentiment of the song in a way that makes it easy to understand the message of the music. Songs such as \\"La Luna\\", Angelina and Amazing Grace really showcase the power, range and precision of Il Divo's voices."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has to be the worst sound I've ever heard....","review":"What is with all the hype for these guys???? I don't get it?? It's gotta be the money for the record execs, as someone else pointed out, they are riding the marketing wave to the bank, and laughing all the way! This album should be put out of its misery. The guys do NOT harmonize well together, they sound like a bunch of dying dogs. They have ruined the value of some wonderful music with the horrible renditions.

Because it is neither classical nor music and the original performers of the songs would flip over if they heard Il Divo's renditions. These four guys just don't sing together, you basically hear four separate lines of music punctuated by pop music like breathing or the occasional baritone splurge of their best singer (Carlos). It is not even elevator music, at best you can call this musac. I don't know who compared them to Andrea Bocelli but it's a crime. Mr. Bocelli can sing and melt your heart out even in diluted classical music for the masses and can interpret them without ever moving from his spot. These guys...oh forget it, I'm running out of poor adjectives to use. Bottom line, don't waste your money or time. Maybe Aunt Margaret might like them since they are young and hunky and the melodies are \\"pleasant\\" to the untrained or undiscerning ear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Il Divo Il Stinko","review":"Ugh...where do I begin. This album is terrible. There, plain and simple. Now, don't get me wrong. I love Josh Groban, Mario Frangoulis, Charlotte Church, Joshua Payne, and all of the others that actually suceed in this pop/opera genre. But Il Divo is marketing gone crazy! Now, they all have beautiful voices, and solo careers for each of them would be better than this terrible GROUP. The songs are horrible. And I just can't get over the fact that they remade Toni Braxton's \\"Unbreak My Heart\\" and called it opera. Wow...I just don't understand this album. I just don't know what I'm listening to (and I don't mean the foreign languages.) Vocally, they all have beautiful voices, but as an album as a whole, they need to step it up a few notches before they get my respect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Embarrassing","review":"I recently listened to this CD and I am aghast as what counts as \\"classical\\" music these days. While the individual talent of each singer is amazing, they do not work well together. The harmonies seem to be sung by competing opera stars rather than a well-blended ensemble. The accompaniment is often over-the-top to match the performance of the vocalists.I think this CD shows the recent trend for Americans to overindulge in the superficial and complete ignore anything with substance. While Il Divo seems \\"new\\" because the singers are all classically trained, they are thrown together with disgusting fanfare. Something tells me this group, like the boy-bands that preceded them, is all about marketing. They were plugged on Operah and put together by Simon Cowell, who judges the ultimate \\"Music as a Marketing/Money-Making Tool\\" show, American Idol.If you want to hear beautiful music sung by a REAL male vocal ensemble, I recommend you check out Chanticleer."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY THIS ALBUM JUST BECAUSE THEY ARE \\"CUTE\\".","review":"I made that mistake already. I saw them on Oprah and thought these guys were hawt! Well it was only a matter of time before reality hit me. This music sucks.Now I know teenage girls will try to convince themselves they like it because of the cute guys and the fact that Simon Cowell of \\"American Idol\\" is the founder of these guys or whatever. BUT PLEASE DO NOT BE FOOLED. Nobody will want to listen to this CD with you. Its embarrasing crap.Soccer moms - no this will not be pleasant music to drive to in your SUV.

They are charismatic, model gorgeous, have phenominal stage presence, and vocally spellbinding. \\"Unbreak My Heart\\" and \\"Unchained Melody\\" are familiar tunes, but with their cover, you will fall in love with these songs all over again and see them in a whole new light."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a joke.","review":"I guess these woefully inept boys are all right for bleating to sports audiences over a stadium PA system, but that's about as far as it goes. I'm sure they think listening to these guys gives them a little culture. Come to think of it, that is probably the case. Horses for courses, I guess.They are touted as bridging the gap between pop and classical. More accurately, they do neither well, dumbing down classical and blanding out pop. The fact that they do neither well does not make them gap-bridgers or crossover artists or anything except the the ill-begotten progeny of a money-hungry producer's greed and bad taste.Of course, he laughs all the way to the bank at his little joke on the public.

What astonished me then, was how a woman writer was able to so accurately describe the psyche of a 17 year old boy with whom I could so closely relate; that she could see into ME.It seems that Shockproof Sydney Skate is likely to be made into a movie; that Cameron Crowe is the screenwriter.

I wish I would have opened it a week before then I would have realized that it is AWFUL. The \\"paints\\" transferred almost no color, the small sponge applicators were useless b/c the amount of pressure needed to pick up any color caused them to pop off. The \\"crayons\\" worked a little better but were still really faint. We ended up using the \\"crayons\\" to color some faces on gourds and then threw the kit away.

I've never had anything but good experiences with their items before. I work at an art museum and the finger crayons and car crayon are favorites. I thought the face painting set would be just as great. I was greatly disappointed. The face paints don't go on, Even with some warm water and mixing, they aren't easy to apply, and the layer is very thin and opaque. The only decent thing about this set is the face painting crayons.I bought this set to face paint at a community festival, and ended up having to go to a Halloween store last minute to purchase an entirely different set of face paints. The difference between the two was astounding.If you are looking for a good, non-toxic, easy-to-apply face painting set, I would suggest buying a Snazaroo palette instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stressful face paint set","review":"I agree with the other posters that this product was extremely difficult to use.

The sounds quality is excellent, and I like the ring tones.I only give this product 4 stars due to several functions of the phone:1. The phone book you added in 1 phone, does not automatically registered in the other phone. You will have to 'send' your phone book to the other phone.2. You have to 'clean' the list of incoming calls (from the caller id) in both phones. There is no function to delete it from 1 phone and applied to the other phone. My old v-tech could do this, and it really helps when you have over 30+ calls a day.3.

The phone is very well made, the sound is very clear and you have so many options on this phone that I haven't had with others. It allows you to keep a phonebook, you can assign ringers for different callers, choose to have the phone light up different colors when people/different people call. It also has a speakerphone on each unit. It also allows you to conference the other unit in. Unlike my GE phone, when I was speaking with people on this phone they could actually tell it was a different phone! They said I sounded very clear. I like that this unit also has a 'boost' feature and a voice enhancer. The reception is great too! This really is a great phone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this phone","review":"This was my first cordless phone and it is the best piece of tech i have bought in years.

The phone randomly drops/hangs up on calls, reception has gotten irregular on the recipient side (getting complaints) and sometimes won't allow you to dial out giving a message something about being too far from the base (and I am about two feet)...I use the phone for business purposes and it's extremely embarassing when you drop off of calls and have to constantly apologize for losing calls and dialing back in.

The first 2, purchased at Circuit City, both in the more expensiverange, turned out to have answering machines that didn't work. Thus, I had to return them. This one, purchased on Amazon.com was fine for the first few months but during the last few months it has been totally unpredictable. One call the phone is working fine, the next call one or more buttoms stop working so I cannot dial my number. Sometimes I get a message on my screen which says that I am too far from the base which couldn't possibly be the case. (On the second hand set the screen has become a complete blank---resetting doesn't help.) Another annoyance is that the date/time on the answering machine stops working about a week or 2 after fixing the problem. In a nutshell, I do not recommend this phone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wall adapter ugly","review":"The phone works great. I bought it replace an older Panasonic that gave me good service. But the wall adapter is riduculous. The bracket makes the phone look cantilevered into the air. The old adapter was much better. No one at Panasonic cared to design a wall bracket/phone for wall mounting.The real problem is that the old phone had a \\"snap in\\" feature so the phone could be vertical in the cradle. In this model the phone will just fall out. So they stick the unit out of the wall in the same orientation as is it were on a desk.If you care about aesthetics, give this a second thought before buying.I may build a custom cherry surround so it looks better...but Panasonic deserves to get dinged for poor design choices on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perfect except for 1 major flaw","review":"Love everything about this phone except their is no audible message alert. The message alert is a visual on the handset, which means you have to check it every time you come home, rather than be automatically reminded by the beeping.

'VE' would change the tone and was a marginally improvement, but nowhere near what I needed.I should also note that the phone I had in the shop for the first 2 days, while hideously ugly and old with some buttons that you'd have to mash to get to work, was loud and clear.This Panasonic goes back today!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cannot be heard well from this phone","review":"I bought this phone 2 weeks ago, and found it very handy but with some drawbacks, which is the reason why I gave 2 stars.1.

After a while, I noticed that too often caller asks me to speak loud, which is annoying. I was trying to solve this problem with Panasonic customer support, but nothing works, even another feature like 'booster' for handset during the outbound calls. And this is not the problem with my phone service or phone line, since my old, \\\\cordfull' phone works find.3.Having a feature to synch phonebook between different handsets, it doesn't allow you to assign 'fast dial' buttons, so you always have to browse your phonebook before you can make a call."},{"rating":"2","title":"works well","review":"After having bought several 'cheap' phones, I am happy with this one.

I really liked this movie however, and the review about it being like Point Break is correct. The plot line is the same but it is based on much cooler stuff. How many people can relate to surfing? How many can relate to suped-up cars on their streets? At first I didn't want to go see it because I thought I would be surrounded by Civics with funny blue lights in the parking lot, but after getting over my apprehension I loved the flick. All ages (ok, maybe not Grandpa) will like this movie.Vin Diesel is one of the hottest actors of the past few years, and for good reason. His part in the movie was right on for him. Plus the chicks are hot (who cares if THEY can act?). Just hit your nitrous and go see it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast and Far more than Furious...","review":"Get in, fasten your seatbelt and get ready for one exhilirating ride. The Fast and the Furious places you in the middle of several street race settings where you find yourself cheering on the drivers as they test their nitrous oxide and other speed booting mechanisms.

I was sick and my girlfriend decided she'd rent a movie for us to watch. So, she comes back with this.In short: bad plot, bad dialog, bad movie.In slightly: This is a movie for kids who take their car and add a 4\\" diameter exhaust to it so that they look 'cool'. Lots of loud noises, a soundtrack filled with Limp Bizkit-wannabes, and not much else. There isn't even much racing in this movie, and those that are are over so quickly they're just boring.There's scenes that make no sense (what's with the cut to Vin Diesel and his girl during the police raid? it has nothing to do with the rest of the movie), it ends unfinished (you spend all that time developping a love interest, and then you aren't going to let us know what happens?)It just sucks, but there's no accounting for taste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good depiction of So.Cal car scene, not much else","review":"If you are into Asian hot rods (lots of new tricked out Mitsubishis and Hondas) this is the movie for you. However, if you are expecting to see tight old school cars...there are TWO in this whole film. Since I am orignally from Southern California, I could relate to the teen scene and street racing in industrial areas that are depicted in this movie. My friends here in Oakland (Northern California) were very disappointed with this film because they expected to see some nice old school cars. The acting leaves a lot to be desired, and the script is so predictable that I laughed out loud at times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie was [bad]!!","review":"The movie was good and the cars were [bad]. Wait, I got that backward. The movie was bad and the cars were sweet. The acting is aweful. Seriously, the only reason why I bought it is for the cars.

I blame this movie entirely for the rage of driving cars with Chinese symbols painted on the doors with lawnmower-sounding exhausts. A creation of Satan both actor and plot wise.

Complete moron."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap thrills","review":"I feel that nearly everyone that's rating this movie are giving it extremely high marks. Give me a break people, let's all take a step back from the \\"cool\\" cars and hot women (there wasn't very many) and see this movie for what it really is. . . A cheap, temporary form of entertainment. Face it, in a few, few years anyone who buys this movie is going to end up giving it away or forgetting about (I know I did with ID4). Also, I have to agree with the other viewer that rated this movie with one star--a complete Point Break rip-off. If you really want to see this movie, either rent it or borrow it from a friend, but for- the-love-of-all-things-sacred don't actually buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT A JOKE!!!!","review":"THIS HAS TO BE THE WORST RACING MOVIE EVER MADE!!!!

Who writes the dialogue for this stuff. I'mnearly in a coma and I could throw better wordstogether.Anyway, hey I expected a B movie so I shouldn'tcomplain. It's a great movie to make fun of. Bad acting,bad plot, bad script and standard action. In a ridiculous early scene,this group of racing knuckleheads with their little midget cars that sound like bees, seemingly thousands of them, take over half the city of L.A. to hang out and say stupid things, act cool and gawk at each other. Not one cop in sight? A race takes place between Vin Unleaded and Paul Walker that's seems very unrealistic and cartoonish. I wasn't impressed or entertained by the editing, camerawork or action. Seen it all before big deal.I got a very 80s feel from this movie. And I don't want to feel 80s anymore. Towards the end the action picked up a bit and things got more interesting, but all in all this movie stunk. As I expected. So all is well."},{"rating":"2","title":"for car enthusiasts","review":"ok I thought this was a brilliant movie, not such a hot story line tho'. For those who said it was a wast of time, you obviousley dont like cars, have not taste in cars and couldnt careless about fine machinery.I can understand your point tho' but then why watch a car movie.... i dont like drama's so guess what ?? i dont watch THEM !! and I certainly dont put my views about them on the net too put others off !!THIS WAS A BRILLIANT PERFORMANCE STREET CAR MOVIE !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent movie.","review":"Quite surprisingly I found this to be one of the most entertaining movies of the year. While it is certainly not an oscar worthy movie, it is simply a movie that entertains. The action is amazing and seeing a movie about the world of import racing was something I've been waiting for and this movie didn't disappoint. The only problem is the misrepresentation of the true import racers. While it is true that people of various nationalities do participate in this import scene, the majority of the people are Asians. And I found it sad that they could only fit Asians in as the bad guys or as background people. Come to my town of West Covina and I guarantee you that every five minutes you will find an Asian driver, male or female, behind a customized, dropped import car. Still, I found myself enjoying this movie tremendously and the DVD has some amazing features. If you have a home theater system, the sound is awesome. Definitely a must buy for you action fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best","review":"The Fast and the Furious is probably the best movie of it's type to come out in many a year. Vin Diesel as Dominic Toretto is rock solid in his performance as a good bad guy. Paul Walker does a good job as the undercover cop Brian O'Conner. The story line is well used but does not drag on and on as some do. Basic undercover cop meets decent ex-con and becomes friends. Of course it does not hurt that Brian falls for Dominic's sister Mia Toretto played by the beautiful Jordana Brewster of The Faculty. Plenty of fast cars, beautiful women and a good story line make this a great movie. Dominic's girlfriend Letty played by Michelle Rodriguez proves girls like fast cars as well. If you like cars and girls and who doesn't, grab this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"super cool","review":"The fast and the furious.one of my 2001 favorite movie.I don't want talk too much about this movie.I just need tellaction movie fan.

The most irritating thing about this movie is it tries to elevate some of the slowest cars on the roads today to not only sportscars, but supercars. The Honda Civic? Please. I love the old Charger, but 900hp? And it still can't beat the Civic?! The movie also features floorboards that fly off when the engine is under stress, engines that heal themselves after blowing, and special effects that make 140mph look like the sound barier. The movie is not without its perks, though, as it was entertaining. Good looking women are the best feature of the movie, which is ironic because more women will enjoy this movie than car-knowledgable dudes."},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie has GUY FLICK written all over it","review":"If you love cars, racing, or both, you absolutely must see this movie. There's more street racing and car lingo in this than the Dukes of Hazzard! If you at ALL like car-chases, than this movie is a must see!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressed, but not totally","review":"This movie was well made and is definitely worth buying. It incorporates its talent wisely which really brings out the best in the movie.It lacked racing scenes, which I feel is the only real problem this film had. The racing scenes that it did have did blow your mind and left you wanting more and more, but thats the trouble you have when you make a good action movie. The viewers want more and more action scenes and could care less about the plot.The plot of the movie was a modified \\"Into Deep\\" story which in some situations more than others left something to desired, and even some points it really started to lack originality.It is no \\"Gone in 60 seconds\\" but it is a keeper."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Slow and the Coulda Been Better","review":"I viewed this film expecting spectacular motor stunts and a great Days of Thunder type plotline involving cops and robbers. What I got was the unexpected. The plot basically drags out Paul Walker's character wrestling with the fact of whether or not he wants to turn Vin Diesel in. The action sequences themselves are reminiscent of something you would see in one of those B movies you see coming on late night HBO and are released direct-to-video. Walker himself has potential (he stole the show in 1999's She's All That) but he was woefully miscast in this role. I see potential in Vin Diesel, too, but the movie relied on viisual spectacle more than characters and plot development. The soundtrack is pretty decent, if you're a fan of air guitar nonsense. The female leads aren't as appealing as you would expect then to be in this type of film."},{"rating":"1","title":"UhHh...","review":"This movie is [not good], Highly over-rated. Let me tell you why I say this:1- THE ACTING IS [not good]2- The creativity and film work is at its best an amature level3- The story is [not good]The only good part about this movie is it has some nice cars to look at. So my advice is just go find yourself a website with some nice cars and there you go, no need to put yourself through this [movie]."},{"rating":"1","title":"Um.... what?","review":"Apparently, I've developed a penchant for stink-bomb movies. This latest one, The Fast and the Furious, may have set the weekly low. Like, almost (but not quite) as bad as Mission to Mars. Anyway, between dialogue that makes no sense and vague gearhead references that probably aren't even accurate, my favorite scene is where they're going after a team of inner city hijackers for stealing $1,200,000 in... DVD players. Now, the average retail of a DVD player is about $150. That means that the team of hijackers has apparently stolen and fenced about 8,000 DVD players. Hmmm... Sounds like a lot of work. Perhaps they should switch to selling drugs. Anyway, stay away from this one... although the ultra-testosterone laden storyline is good for a laugh."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun, action filled flick","review":"The Fast and the Furious may not win any awards, but it is a good movie if all you want is a diversion fron the \\"real world.\\" The movie has awesome cars, sexy stars, and action.

Just watch it for a fun time."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD,BUT NOT GREAT...","review":"The Fast and The Furious is a hot, action (car racing) film which combines fast street car racing and hot women. The plot I did not quite understand and wasn't that clearly developed. Brian, an undercover cop in L.A. races as one of the street racers t and tries to see if the gang of racers have stolen car engines and other car supplies from hijacked trucks. The racing is hot, the women are hot, the acting not terribly great but ok. This is mainly a movie for teens and young adults, I don't think many older folks would like this flick."},{"rating":"2","title":"Caught in the middle","review":"At first I was a bit hesitant to watch this movie. I tought it would be the exactly like GONE IN 60 SECONDS. Well, I was wrong. Yes, THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS does revolve around fast cars and racing but there's also plot. The basic storyline is: Brian (played by Paul Walker) is a race car driver (with a secret) and he gets involved with the wrong people. He ends up becoming really good friends with one of the \\"race car guys\\" while getting involved with his sister. Anyway a lot is revealed as the movie progresses. THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS is an action packed adrenalin rush. The way they filmed the races were awesome. The acting was well done. The underlining story shows a man caught in middle... choosing what he thinks is right. THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS is worth the ride."},{"rating":"2","title":"the fast and the furious","review":"this is a bad to the bone movie. all you young guy's must see it. it brings back memories when i was in high school racing cars. on friday and sat. nights."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast and the furious hd DVD","review":"the picture quality is excellent really liked the movie in hd it was a different experience plus it was delivered on time great job amazon"},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome !!!","review":"This movie was one of my most inspirational movies I've ever scene.

I must confess that I rented it strickly based on the previews of the awesome Dodge Charger that was in the previews. As the movie pulled me in I was pleasantly surprised that it was actually a good move. Kind of a cross between American Grafitti, Top Gun and the Shriley Muldowny story, lol.This is a fascinating, action packed, racing movie about the generation of street racers that are around today. Similar do the older generations drag strips to a point. Intertwined with the street racing was an undercover, good cop helping the \\"good\\" bad buy type of script. The \\"betrayal\\" of the good girl ect.Overall, a very good movie with fast cars, girls and guns.

It wasn't really any different from any other movies of this type, though it was better than Gone in Sixty Seconds.

I must give credit where credit is due. The acting wasn't too great...Paul Walker was very bad, however Vin Diesel makes up for Walker's bad acting.

What there is not is any reason whatsoever to see this film. There is no acting to speak of, no real plot development, no character development, no interesting dialogue. There is no genuine exploration of the racing subculture, or any interest in looking at what tensions, interests, or economic forces might create such a subculture. It would be interesting so understand why these people are in such dead-end, sterile lives that suicidal races and peer respect have become so important. Instead, we see a lot of cars, a lot of races, a lot of rather puerile challenges, and a lot of sex--but no intelligence, no clarity, no calls for the rest of us to examine our comfotable lives--and, in the end, no interest in the very subject the filmmakers are portraying.

I won't even say anything about the souless and silly plot of the movie because frankly it should just be expected, when the formative idea for your movie seems to have been neon paint jobs. Do yourself a favor, instead of watching this movie, go and buy a ticket to an amateur street race track. There you can see real cars and real drivers, who put some heart into their vehicles and do not need special effects to help them along. The one star is for the 69' Charger, which is certainly 2 minutes worth seeing, but I am afraid even something as beautiful as that can't save this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOO FAST !","review":"If you like fast cars,undercover cops, macho (and i mean really macho) guys) this is your movie.No need to buy it you can allways rent it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mighta Been","review":"This film could have been decent. As it is, it's not the worst out there. But it's full of many holes.Keep low expectations and it might be a mildly entertaining view.** Spoiler Below **My main question is why those truck drivers didn't just hit the brakes? That would have solved everything. Instead they just kept driving along while being harpooned. Things like that really bug me because any idiot could have put a better plot device in there and made it at least mildly realistic.Without that and a quite a few other problems this might have been a pretty decent film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Matt Klunk's opinion of \\"The Fast and the Furious\\"","review":"I am a car fanatic to start with, and have dreamed of owning a Toyota Supra Twin Turbo since I learned to drive in 1998. It is still only a dream, but when I heard that this movie's feature car was a Supra I couldn't wait to see it. I first saw the movie at the drive-in this past summer, it was awesome there, and I decided to buy it on DVD as soon as it came out. I did just that, and you should too; as this movie might just be one of the coolest, fastest, and most addictive movies ever made."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whats your favorite movie?","review":"Well what do you think about the Fast and the Furious? I think it is the coolest.If you haven't seen it yet you need to. Its out on VHS and DVD, you can rent it just about anywhere. If you like fast cars and wild driving you will sure like this movie. So go out and see it today."},{"rating":"1","title":"3/4 Fast and 1/4 Furious","review":"Fast and the Furious works ,but we have seen this before. Still you wonder, have the Movie Studios stopped making risky movies? It is a recycled car movie that has all that what the other movies give to you ,but It's not a bad movie at all.I like Vin Diesel as this sort of the God of this group of nightracers. Paul Walker is very slick(SEE PAUL IN JOY RIDE!!!) actor both him and Diesel I think are very talanted.All this movie is, is a fun summer blockbuster to watch....no logic required just buckle your seat belt.... Honestly I wished Universal Pictures could have used a better movie to appeal to Teens versus what we have seen before. Stars **1/2"},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie is extremely LAME","review":"A bunch of gender-confused male posturing with no solid storyline. Lame cars. Should have got Keanu to play the undercover cop...that way at least it would have been funny to watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unless You're in Your Teens, Forget It","review":"While this movie has a few high speed scenes and a great sound effects, the movie's week plot is worsened by cheesy \\"I'm gonna kick your ass,\\" teen talk. A semi-surprising plot twist leaves the viewer hoping for more. In the end, you've got a movie aimed at teen guys who still love cars covered in fancy crome and racing stips. Maybe it's worth a rental on a rainy day, but save your cash if you plan to own it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Adrenaline","review":"Well, let me just start off by saying that I have seen this movie once for every week it's been out in the theatre, which is out of my character. This movie was an adrenaline rush from start to finish, I truly enjoyed it. I especially enjoyed seeing an unfamiliar cast do such a terrific job of acting. I'm no Siskel, but I do know this is a movie that I have every intention of buying; and I will watch it over and over. I was very drawn into the movie, feeling like I had just raced a 10-second car myself by the time I left the theatre. I would recommend this movie to men and women alike. It is a definite must see!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Buckle up for a fast ride","review":"I love this movie!!! I don't watch movies for the reality, if you want that then WATCH THE NEWS!The movie revolves around the tried and true plot of a hot young cop, Brian (Paul Walker) befriending Dom (Vin Diesel) the charismatic hero in the underworld of illegal street racers. Throw in customised imports with enough neon accents to light up a football field, hot women who keep up with the guys, a suspect asian gang, the inevitable love affair between Brian and Dom's sister Mia and the desicion for Brian to make about where his loyalties lie - and you got yourself one slick looking movie!If you love car flicks (did you watch Knight Rider in the 80's?) this is one Dvd that should be in your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasing to car racing buffs","review":"You'll like this movie ONLY if you are really into car racing, or if you are a big 007 fan (you know what I'm talking about, fast and furious action and a parade of \\"hot\\" women). I'm both, so I really enjoyed this movie -- indeed, I have watched the racing scenes countless times. Otherwise, you'll find the plot very silly, the screen play trashy, and the acting, while commendable, rather unsophisticated.This movie reminds me of the 1990 Hong Kong flick called \\"Off Road\\" (a.k.a., Heroes of the Road), starring Jacky Cheung and Loretta Lee. You may want to check it out as well if you enjoyed this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hi Octane fun","review":"This movie rocks, I never so many imports in one movie. I have to say its better than \\"Gone in 60 Seconds\\". The actions scenes are entense, the races are great and I think the final part was a bit suspense when Diseal trash into the truck. This movie makes the import cars look better and proves who has the better cars in this flick. They need to make more movies like this. Plus the extras in the DVD are good and the Music videos make it much better to get into the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Job All Round","review":"This movie is great, story just keeps flowing. Good cars *good for not V8's*, good drag scenes, and a sweet charger to top it off at the end. I was impressed with the sound, the DTS mixing is one of the best i have heard. I recommend this for sure, even if you dont like cars !!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the characters?","review":"Oh wait, characters do not matter in an action packed film like this one. Its all about the cars, women, the special effects, and the speed! Hmmmm, seems more like the definitive film for a Kid Rock fan, then the good Art-house flick. Well, if you like action, get this film. Otherwise, if your like me, come on over and watch Emma."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Gay and Gritty Would Be a Better Name","review":"I took my nephew to see this movie. What a piece of garbage. I thought it was bad seeing all these little twits driving around the cities in their rug burners, but now they make a movie about them.Unless your under 18, don't rent, buy or borrow this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Cars","review":"This movie is all about the cars. So what if the plot was weak or repeated. It was about street racing, not surfing as in Point Break. So if you are a car fan you should enjoy this movie. It's good to see any car movie coming out of Hollywood. The cars were simply amazing. The red Mazda RX-7, orange Toyota Supra, and green Mitsubishi Eclipse were all well done with the performance modifications and body work. The race scenes are tight, but there should have been more of them in my opinion. As far as the acting goes I think Vin Diesel and Paul Walker did a good job. The ladies did a good job as well, Jordana Brewster as Mia and Michelle Rodriguez as Letty. So in conclusion, if you like car racing and women you should go see this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring...","review":"This movie was boring. The plot was ridiculous. It would have been much more interesting if they'd decided to go with a little bit of intrigue rather than just plowing through with the bad guy they'd been hinting at the whole movie. In the end the action is tedious. Go rent Bullit."},{"rating":"2","title":"VIN DIESEL MAKES \\"THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS\\" #1","review":"GREAT MOVIE.

Perhaps some scenes are a little bit exaggerated, but that is, why I like this actionful movie. Furthermore it is very interesting to get some information about, in which way it is possible to tune a car.So, I really recommend this movie, especially for people, who like a lot of action and fast cars, too.Enjoy watching the film..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Copied from Hong Kong movie","review":"I don't see any creativity in this movie since they copied the whole plot from a Chinese movie called \\" Legend of Speed\\" and not given any credit to the original film.

The (japanese) sport \\"karts\\" in this film were in there maximum power (nitros oxide + twin turbo cars)could not match the the pure power of the CHARGER (not in its full potencial), an all steel car, or any of the AMERICAN MUSCLE CARS of the past or even today MUSCLE CARS. I think this movie is prof for those who think that today import cars are the fastest. My SS CAMARO easly can go 160+ MPH with no problems and without any modifications at all, not like the \\"(japanese) fully modified Sport Karts\\" that are breaking bolts to go only 150 MPH!!!! What a shame:( (...)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be fooled","review":"This movie is awful. Vin Diesel is an awful actor, the screenplay is absolutley trash, the director obviously has no idea how to make a good movie. Vin Diesel always plays the tough guy and it was good for a change to see a different kind of role in Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan. Everything is too fake. TOO fake. Don't be fooled by the awesome action, all right, it's too fake. Beleive me, my father was a race car driver, he's seen this movie, it's all bull. He noticed a fault every time they got into a car. This is a pathetic try at a tough racing movie. Trust me, it's not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible!","review":"bad movie. i dont care if my review was helpful or not, but this movie was one of the lamest excuses for a movie ever! if you want to see a good action type movie, see rollerball!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even a good action movie","review":"This movie is about the underground import street racing that has become popular in the late 90's and still is going strong today. If the movie had some more plot or some more action it would be better. The racing scenes are not that spectacular and the plot is non-exsistent. This movie would not be bad as a rental, but to buy it, save your money. Maybe if the director had added about ten more minutes into the plot then it would have been ok, but he didn't and nothing really makes sense. It seems everything happens way too quickly and we never understand what is happening."},{"rating":"2","title":"Paul Walker is the fittest guy on earth!","review":"This film is my favourite film of all times it really appeals to young people actually perhaps under 25, well i'm 16. i mean theres loads of cars with the engine over exaggerated, i didnt actually think about that at the time at the time i just thought wow does this really happen in life ( i know i sounded niave but hey who cares). Its so unpredictable whats gonna happen next which is very original and inventive, but i guess the title kind of gives it away anyway.After watching this film its not only a guys film but also a girls film too with all the fit guys in it such as Paul Walker.He's gorgeous,a typical and a perfect surfer, with a brilliant body.Which this film is definately worth watching which ever sex you are."},{"rating":"2","title":"Action Packed","review":"\\"The Fast and the Furious\\" is one of the those movies that you didn't expect to be very good when you went to see it, but ended up loving it in the end. It's a film filled with fast-paced action, romance, and incredible cars.The story revolves around an undercover cop, Brian, who is trying to crack a difficult case in which a group of people hijack trucks on the highway and steal their goods. Instead of doing his job, Brian gets caught up in the lifestyle of street racers and must choose between his job and duty and his friendship and loyalty.I would suggest this film to people who are fans of Paul Walker and Vin Diesel as well as people interested in a cool action-packed film that will have you on the edge of you seat and saying, \\"Wow!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"YOU GOTTA GET THIS MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"OH MY GOD, if you're a guy you HAVE to have this movie. If you're a girl, and you like attractive guys, or sexy cars you gotta get it. It's pure sexy adrenalin from opening credits to close credits.

Who cares about the storyline? Racing and stories don't mix, that's not what this movie is trying to do. It's about linking a load of fast-paced shots of burning rubber, violent machinery, noise and loud music and it does one hell of a job at it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really good on any level","review":"There are some flashy scenes with the Japanese cars, but that's not enough to hold this turkey up. The chase scenes in Bullitt and the French Connection are still unchallenged.This is an teenage fantasy movie. That's the only way you can explain the glaring implausabilities. This doesn't explain the bad story, weak script, and boring chase scenes.I was hoping for better brain candy, but came up snake eyes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beyond Pooh, & I Ain't Talkin' Winnie","review":"How about this? Why don't we all make a pact not to indulge the Hollywood waz-machine, until the businessmen there stop treating us like hormone-driven teenagers. Okay, I'm guilty of sitting through this, and the guilt alone should take a year off my life. But in a day and age when films like American Beauty and Fight Club can fall into the mainstream, doesn't this kind of high-polished and soul-eating flick seem very outdated? One can only hope so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"This is truly a bad film, reflecting certain issues and segments of our society that are truly lost and hopeless, not to mention criminal. I hope the cast and crew were well paid for their efforts. It's highly contrived and very juvenile.

I thought I would admit defeat and give in.This is the WORST movie I have ever seen, and yes, I DID see Armageddon.The plot is...well, there is no plot. But if there is, it's dumbed down for an audience of lowbrows. Is this what 100 years of filmmaking has led up to? Oy guvalt.To play devil's advocate tho, I was upset that this movie wasn't nominated for any animation Oscars, since primarily all the car chase sequences aren't even REAL."},{"rating":"1","title":"A few thrilling sequences, but otherwise shoddily paced.","review":"Paul Walker is an undercover cop who gets too involved in the underground world of racing. Vin Diesel is the criminal he eventually befriends. Not much plot-wise, and there aren't nearly enough chases or races to make up for the incredibly slacking pace and overdone, headache-inducing visuals. The truck-siege in the climax is obviously inspired by the similar setpiece in The Road Warrior, but doesn't compare in terms of sheer excitement (or even in size, scope, and length). Walker took a far more enjoyable trip in Joy Ride."},{"rating":"2","title":"Drop the Hammer and let's go","review":"This movie blew me away. It proved to be just as fast and exciting as promised in the previews and trailers. True, there is no life changing morals here or deep philisophical hidden meaning in \\"Fast and the Furious\\", but that's not the point. This is a movie that delivers what the trailers promise. It is a rare movie in which any hype surrounding it is justified. Why? Cause it delivers the goods. See it. Feel it.

Same exact story except it's an under cover cop in street racing cars instead of on a surf board, and it has the same bad acting. I don't know who discovered Paul Walker and Vin Diesel, but they have about as much talent as a rock.

Paul Walker almost seems like he is a robot when reciting his lines in many scenes, and his ability to strain a look of concern makes my head hurt all the more. Vin Diesel is really no better, and even though he played a great villain in the movie \\"Pitch Black\\", his try at being a rebel without a cause/but with a cool car is stagnant. What the film is really good at are chase and race scenes, but the story involving an undercover agent and gangs who seem invincible is shallow, hollow and downright ludicrous. This film probably appeals to middle school kids who dream of having a souped up Honda with a fancy paintjob."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great action movie","review":"The Fast and the Furious movie that started it all.

He's still doing classic cd's and the new hit that reached #1 on the charts(Drop it like it's hot)is the bomb.

When I first heard the album I wasnt so sure what I thought about it.... you may say I was a little disappointed, but I was expected to be blown away.The album turns out to be a pretty solid album. We all know that his first single \\"How We Do\\" was hot but there are a lot of others too. Westside Story feat 50 Cent was a good track along with Dreams produced by Kanye and Higher produced by DRE. Put You on the Game which was produced by Timbaland is a good up tempo track. One of my favorites was the Documentary were he gives loves to all the classic rap albums before him. Then there is We Aint feat Em.... just another hot track that you gotta hear.the rest of the album is good but these listed above are the standouts for me. People seem to have mixed feelings about this album but I havent meet anyone who has hated it.

I don't care if he had a rough childhood. I don't care if he's the real deal. I don't care that he has two gats and a Benz. I don't care that he is richer and better than me. I DONT CARE!!!!! With weak lyrics and like this he doesn't deserve my money. People must really be brainwashed if they think THIS is \\"The Hottest Joint\\" since Snoop Dogg.

Even though Goldie Loc and Tray Deee are older cats, to me they can put the west back if they had the proper promoting. The Eastsidaz was puting a dent on the West until Snoop screwed them (how's that for a homy?!)

The Dre beats are, as is usual for Dre's work, very good, however The Game is lyrically not very talented. He seems to have fallen into that increasingly large category of contemporary hiphop artist that relies more on studio polish and high production values than pure rapping talent to get his point across. He would probably be an awful live performer. The album tracks are listebable but it's a bit difficult to get over the fact that any average streetcorner MC could torch this guy in a freestyle battle. My advice is to download the songs so that you can delete them from your computer/iPod/whatever when you get tired of them, rather than drop the money for the CD and realize a couple of months from now that you could have bought a better album or new headphones instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"sounds the same","review":"the songs from the documentary has decent production. but all the songs sound the same like nelly, excepts the game only talks about various rappers over and over again like dr dre. and this cd isn't even as good as his first album where he talks less about various rappers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated!","review":"Here are the ingredients for a gold record these days:One solid producer like Dr. Dre with credibilityFour of five mediocre-good rappersAdd a large dosage of hype and marketing from a large record companyInsert a wack rapper who talks about guns, girls and 22 inch wheelsRepeat as needed!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rap","review":"GameYou should be ashameCuz' your rap is lamePlease n*ggaaaaaYou even try to diss jiggaNobody knew who you wereYou're lucky that Snoop put u on his tourI wish Triple H kicked your assCuz' you stole his nickname and your cd is a messNow your rap career is over you need to quitWe don't like a dumb kid full of sh*t"},{"rating":"1","title":"THE GAME HAS NO GAME","review":"I like the direction, nice bass. but stutter-step lyrics.

I will never doubt him again, this is indeed the a great release to kick the year off. I think this will go on to be one of the best releases of the year as well. Kanye did it early last year and the Game did it early this year. Kanye and the Game are on a diferent level, but life is full of different perspecties. Most of the time he raps about experience and not the same old bitches, bling, and car related garbage that pollutes mainstream airwaves.

I thought the game was going to be the worst member of G-Unit, but I was sorely mistaken. While there is a lot of name dropping going on throughout the album, it is overshadowed by the incredible lyricism found through the entirety of the album. His flow is mindblowing, and his rhymes never fail to impress. You cannot listen to \\"Dreams\\" or \\"The Documentary\\" and not be totally blown away by both the incredible production matched with equally impressive rhymes. This could quite possibly be the hottest release of this year, excluding the RZA's The Cure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just As I Expected...","review":"Ok...Maybe I didnt listen to this album enough, but I really was not impressed by the beats or the lyrically flow.

This album doesn't havent, in fact most hip-hop albums these days are like that.70mins in length filled mostly with \\"fillers\\", tunes are dull, so is his voice and NO i dont think he is a lyrical craftsmen.

His lyrical skills....well lets just say he was better off at droppin names than he is at comin up with dope lyrics.The only reason this album gets 2 stars from me is cause the production is pretty good...which is prolly the only reason this album is getting any acclaim. Most of the people who think the Game is a great rapper also think that G-Unit is the best thing to come out of the westcoast.I say no to this album...ain't much of a westcoast revival to me.

Even if game is not on G-unit anymore, this album still sounds dumb. If anyone who is truly sensible in their music listening just listens to game's lyrics(real hip hop is about lyrics and not just the beat) you will find out just as I did that he raps about nothing significant. All he does is call the names of the last 100 or so significant artists(much better than him) to take up space. Just look as his video for dreams and tell me what you think. This guy won't have much staying power in the rap industry and he will soon be forgotten just like the Sega dreamcast and N64 video gaming systems. Game over and lights out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage.","review":"I can't believe how many mind-washed children think The Game is even decent when it comes to rapping. He can't go a verse without mentioning Eazy-E, 2Pac, Notorious B.I.G., or Dr. Dre, and he's got one of the most boring flows I've ever heard. The Game is one of the reasons people say rap is just 'people talking over a beat,' because that's all Game does. He has no charisma whatsoever, and acts like he's never even seen a dictionary. Documentary? How is this a documentary? How can an album full of name-dropping be considered a story about your life?If you want real hip-hop, and not mainstream garbage, go pick up some Canibus, GZA, or Killah Priest.

I mean really good, his lyrics are awesome and of course the production and beats were awesome because Dr Dre co produced this one. I also really like how he gives he's shout outs to the greats like Eazy-E, 2pac, Biggie, and so on and so on.

TWO POUNDS OF WEED! HAHA!!! who the heck shoots someone over weed????

No thought in the rhymes, just talking about meaningless b.s.and the sad part is people are eating it up like it's the greatest thing. Learn your history. Seriously, if your under 25, go back and check for the classics. The kind if stuff that the rappers of today are copying that the \\"new\\" fans of hip-hop have no clue about. Do you realize that no rapper from the LA area , besides Ice T, has \\"made it\\" without going through Dr. Dre in some form or fashion. The Game is a poor reflection on his judgement of talent.

I'm not sure if he really is a good writer, since 50 wrote the hot joints on his album like \\"how we do\\". The beats aren't all that either. All in all I give the album a 2.5/5.

Id give this album 0 stars but I dont think if you can do that on here. Take my advice,if youre thinking of buying this album DON'T.

Its a must buy for G-Unit or Em fans. The Game has a very unique style of rhymes and rap, hes truly a great artist, and some of the stuff he spits is amazing especially songs like Higher and Hate it or Love it. The artists in this album like 50 cent, Nate Dogg and Eminem are also great, ignore the idiots who don't know anything about him or G-Unit and hate rap in general. Its a great CD, i recommend it big time."},{"rating":"2","title":"WAKE UP THE WEST-COAST IS BACK!!!","review":"this boy Game is yonkers! the cd is great the dvd is straight and the flow is off the chain. his lyrical content is up there with the best of 'em and if ypu want the cd of the year pick up The Game- Documentary"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't listen to anyone else","review":"I can't believe anyone who would give this cd below 3 stars if they are a TRUE hip-hop fan. first of all everyones talking about how Game sucks and he's no gangsta cause of this cd well if you listen to his mixtapes you can tell that Game is an up and coming gangta rapper who WILL be here for the next 10 years. second of all back to this cd...ya so what this cd has some slow songs with light beats but they are all nasty and who says this was supposed to sound all gangsta. it is an excellent collection of songs in which Game or whoever else is very good with the flow of the song and the lyrics are pretty good.

We watch everything he makes, no questions asked. The Amazon review calls him \\"morose\\" and \\"laconic.\\" Um, yeah. That's Alan Rickman.While I was tempted to call Sigourney Weaver 'annoying' in her role, I realize that that's the entire point - she's portraying a high-functioning autistic and - by all accounts - has done an amazing rendition here.The real star is Emily Hampshire as Weaver's on-screen daughter, Vivienne. She powerfully portrays her character's quirky, fierce but ultimately sweet nature. Why does she single out Rickman for attention as the film opens? As the spotlight review on this page notes, \\"Vivienne always picked the loneliest people to talk to.\\" The truth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Snow Cake","review":"I love this movie! Alan and Sigourney play off of each other so well. Sigourney Weaver should have won some award and there is a sexy Alan scene too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strange but very effective story","review":"Sigourney Weaver, one of the world's finest actresses, attempts to do something almost impossible in this film.She portrays a mildly autistic woman on the edge of madness. To Weaver's credit she underplays the woman's problems and thereby raises the believability of the role.Alan Rickman plays a man accidently involved with her and plays his role superbly. Rickman is rarely given enough credit for his film portrayals. The first I saw of him was in a role opposite Juliet Stevenson called \\"Truly, Madly,Deeply\\".The only other actress i've seen do so well with this type of role is Isabelle Huppert of France in a film titled 'The Piano Teacher\\". \\"The Piano Teacher\\" is a much darker tale however."},{"rating":"2","title":"A most unusual film","review":"This is a unique inquiry into the life of an autistic adult. Sigorney Weaver must have done deep research to get this just right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This movie is an amateurish film that thoughtlessly glamourises everything connected to the real-life struggles and heartaches of families who actually deal with autism. This film is Hollywood's weakly-realised version of 'Autism Lite' which is both distressing and disappointing. Sigourney Weaver makes a valiant attempt to interpret the struggles of a highly-functioning autistic woman as best she can, and a shockingly older Alan Rickman disappoints as the former convict accompanying Weaver's daughter when she dies in a car crash. Rabid fans of Weaver and Rickman will no doubt enjoy this movie for their quasi-hammy, star-turned performances, but Snow Cake simply cannot be recommended to anyone else, especially those who are intimately aware of the realities of this insidious and hearbreaking syndrome."},{"rating":"2","title":"HOT ICE SCREAM","review":"HOT = Alan Rickman is my favorite actor for more reasons than there is space to write. Having said that, if you have never heard of him, I can promise you that you will be amazed. It must have something to do with his connection in aiding autism awareness. His character has quite alot of baggage, but he still manages to care. Thoughts & Deeds are essential.ICE = Sigourney Weaver's performance in this film is astounding. She makes a real connection by disconnecting. You know that feeling you get when ice stays on your tongue too long? It burns! That's how it is watching her. Cold & hot all at the same time.SCREAM = There are many screams in this film and not all audible. You'll understand if you buy it (or rent it). My internal screaming was what grabbed me with this film. I found myself wrenching in moments of their turmoil & sadness. Then, in the next scene, laughing & elated by the true interaction these actors brought to us through fantastic writing & direction."},{"rating":"2","title":"This cheese is great","review":"You also buy this cheese a whole foods markets.

Neruda jars the soul by explaining in simple verse, how tragic life can be. The reflections and odes collected in this work are a superb display of the skill Neruda has. Residence on Earth is a compilation of poetry from a mature poet who willfully takes risks, and carries through with beautiful prose. Nerudas candid emotional stylizations convince one of the feeling of being consumed by the poetry itself. Neruda is boundless in structure. The easy style allow for the reader to atempt to understand the abundant imagery and symbolism contained traditionally within Nerudas works. One must read this compilation, as one would consume a fine port wine, or richly decadent chocolate-with trepidation.

I would describe myself as an advanced beginner who has been through classroom training. This DVD allows ENDLESS combinations that you can tailor to your time frame and/or the desired intensity level of your session.Shiva Rea has a lovely voice - very soothing. The beautiful location and music choices help to maintain the feeling of relaxation while still providing you a fantastic workout. As a few other reviewers stated, you will sweat. And you will never become bored with it. Just use the \\"matrix\\" to create a new workout. This is the one you will stick with. I simply love this DVD and cannot recommend it enough!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Many great workouts","review":"This is an excellent dvd. Shiva is a great teacher. The 4 workouts are increasingly difficult, and you do feel like you got a good workout. The other feature is the matrix, where you can select which routines to combine together. It takes less than a minute to set up and is well worth the effort. The beach setting is relaxing. Only 1 complaint; you can turn off shiva's voice, but there is no option to remove the music and keep the voice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic !","review":"I agree with the raves about this DVD.

It is way to fast on all the moves. All it is is a woman on a beach doing yoga with NO instruction on what she's doing. I wish I could return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only for the very advanced.","review":"I've given this DVD a few tries, but every time I did it, it left me feeling frustrated and I like I didn't get a workout because a lot of her moves are so advanced I can't even begin to get into them. Her modified versions aren't even easy, and I've been practicing yoga for years and feel that I'm at a good intermediate level. The last time I did this, I pulled my hamstring badly, just trying to get into a modified \\"beginner\\" version of one of her poses. I didn't feel like she did anything to make sure my body was safe or that she was concerned about injuries. The DVD left me feeling like I had just watched her show off for 90 minutes, only making me feel less flexible, injured and frustrated. I've heard so many things about Shiva Rae, yes, she is talented, but as an instructor she's terrible. Definitely not a place for beginners or people with realistic flexibility."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Atmosphere, but...","review":"Personally, I wouldn't recommend this particular DVD to anyone with spinal issues.

It does have the effect of making me want to go to the beach right now."},{"rating":"1","title":"less whispering more action please","review":"the matrix is great and I wish it were available in other DVD's that I use (I'm a big Lotte Berk fan) but for those of us who're more focused on the \\"bottom\\" line, this DVD's style is way too abstract. If you're like me, you're probably not looking for poetry buried in vague/meaningless instructions like \\"feel the earth's fire in your core\\". This is a workout you'll probably do at home so the beach scene, the tides sweeping from both sides(!) the sweet-soft whisperings (!!!) of the instructions make this one a great waste of what might otherwise have been a very to-the-point and no-nonsense workout. Shiva's flexibility and control are very inspiring but you may feel cheated when you can't follow a decent sequence with that inspiration to get your own results."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you are a serious about yoga teaching or your own practice...","review":"Avoid anything by Shiva Rea, Queen of the Trance Dance.

You'd be better off spending your money on something by Yoga Journal or finding a teacher in your community."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its great...for Shiva Rhea","review":"It says in the info that the DVD caters to all skill levels. NOT TRUE! This is not a DVD for yoga beginners, this is one for someone who has been doing yoga for years and knows the poses. I'm a beginner and I couldn't do even a 1/4 of what is on the DVD. Shiva Rhea can do the poses, yay or her. Not yay for a beginner. She doesn't describe the poses, only says \\"place your feet here and hands here\\". And the way she was acting while doing this reminds me of someone who is stoned out of their mind.This DVD is NOT for beginners, no matter what the DVD Info section says."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shiva Rea Yoga Shakti","review":"Not Great for Beginners,The package is too cumbersome to play.I would not recommend others"},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep looking","review":"Difficult to follow, not kind on your lower back.

NOT RECOMMENDED for beginners, you could hurt yourself on this tape."},{"rating":"2","title":"Use the Matrix","review":"This is a great yoga DVD. It works for both beginners and more advanced students. The trick is to watch (even in fast forward) each program and \\"mix and match,\\" using the matrix, according to your level of experience. What makes this DVD work is that it changes as you grow; you can create new practices as your experience and skill increase. The beginner's practice is very easy, for example, but can be modified using the matrix to include, e.g. one or more of the \\"Dancing Warrior\\" sequences. The sun salutations also offer several options appropriate for either beginners or intermediates. You need to take the time to view each practice and find what's right for you. This DVD and the Rodney Yee DVDs will be the mainstays of my yoga DVD library, including my travel library. I also like the fact that it's not slick, but rather put together by real practitioners. Go for it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"HUGE DISSAPOINTMENT and waste of $20!","review":"I guess I just do not like this style of yoga. I thought i would love the matrix setup but there is just too long of a pause between segments so it totally throws off your flow. Then the next segment might be in a completely different pose (ex. laying on back, next pose starts in standing). Its awkward and annoying. I do not like her voice and the lack of clear instruction on some more difficult poses. She then goes too fast into other poses which leaves me either trying to catch up and never fully achieving the desired pose or missing out on a chunk of the sequence. I should have listened the negative reviews from Baptiste & Kest lovers as those are my preferred yogi's and the style is so different. I prefer less flowy ashtanga. And the annoying rapid hands/breathing segments were boring and complete waste of time - i found myself fast-forwarding through the entire thing and missing out on my practice for the day. 2 thumbs way way down!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't like this DVD","review":"I found this DVD to be too fast moving. There was not enough time to look at the screen, do the action, get the movement correct and understand the benefit from the exercise. It was filmed in a great location but it is to condensed to really enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great overall, but does not guide you through the poses.","review":"I really like the Yoga matrix aspect of this DVD and the poses involved. My one complaint is that there is no narration during the sequences to tell you what poses to change to and when. I find it hard to look at the TV screen constantly and be in the poses. Maybe I just don't have a certain setting on... but I don't think so!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Variety of Options!","review":"This DVD is wonderful! It has such a variety of options that it is appropriate for nearly all levels of practitioners. My only complaint is that there are so many options that it is difficult to choose!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Challenging Yoga","review":"Great yoga DVD but definitely not for the very beginner. The practices are challenging but the yoga matrix is really good for slowly increasing the challenge and also adapting the yoga practice to the amount of time you have on that day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too slow ...not to the point.","review":"I was lured to get this DVD with the excellent reviews - and I can understand how it's appealing - there is an exercise matrix, you can mix and match and there are 4 options for workout that vary b/w 40 min and 90 min.However - the flow is very unnatural, sequence transitions lack flow, the commentary is poor (correcting poses etc) - and thus the teaching component is lacking. This DVD is not for anyone whom desires a \\"to the point\\" - effective & efficient - fluid, strong Yoga practice. It's a bit slow - and a bit too meditative for my likes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Yoga DVD in my collection","review":"I recently purchased this dvd and I am so glad I did. Like many other reviewers, I love the matrix and find it easy to use. I have many yoga programs on dvd and I prefer the ones set outdoors. However, some of the ones I have recently purchased were lacking in their ability to help grow a practice. This dvd is perfect and I can see myself using it for years to come as I become more experienced at yoga. So far the lunar sequences are my favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yoga Shakti","review":"Worth every penny I paid for this DVD set. The instruction, scenery,and music are all perfect. Try it out and enjoy, you won't be disappointed. Take care."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shiva Rea - Yoga Shakti","review":"The best part of this DVD is that you can create your own routine, depending on how much time you have. Instead of following the same routine over and over again, it's different every time! On the weekends, when I have more time, I'll do the hour-and-a-half solar routines, which are great flexibility and strength workouts. I always face the rest of my day with clarity and inner strength, whether I do the DVD on the weekend or before work. Furthermore, my leg and arm strength has never been better."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE Shiva","review":"This maybe a bit for the intermediate to advance DVD. You can choose your own workout if you wish. I Love that!! Shiva is a wonderful instructor. Her voice very soothing. You get a choice of either staying with the beginning of the pose or going to the full posture. All in All if you have been doing Yoga for awhile I highly recomend this DVD if you would like to go to the next level."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rather challenging for the beginner","review":"I've not done much Yoga up to now and it was the rather slow type so far. This CD contains very interesting variations of the moves I already knew plus new ones. I enjoy the challenge, I hang behind her speed most of the time, though, she moves from one posture to the other so fast that when I'm pointing my face at the floor during downward facing dog, I might not realise that she's already out of it and doing a completely different thing.It's good to have a goal, though, and one day I'll be able to follow. So, its a good DVD if you want to develop your Yoga skills from a bit more than beginner to advanced, I'd say."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insanely Beautiful!!","review":"What is not to like about this DVD? Great instuctor, beautiful scenery, some of the best music you'll ever move to , superior poses(beginner -advanced) taught in thier Sanskrit names, excellent flow, challenging poses to strive for, and sooo much more!! I can't speak highly enough of this DVD, I have used it for years and it has taken my practice to new heights!! You can also tailor your practice to you needs/time--no other DVD has this feature!! This DVD teaches you to be patient and keep evolving forward with your practice and your life!! If you truly adore Yoga- you will LOVE this DVD!!! Forever my favorite!! Shakti!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"New Yoga User","review":"I was looking for something that would get me into shape and I think I found it. Not really a yoga fan Shiva has got me into it. She has a relaxing voice and she's a beast. I also like how the DVD allows you to grow and advance through different stages. I also like the morning/sun salutation and the night/lunar salutation. So you can do it either time of the day. Great DVD I'm glad I purchased it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This DVD is for watching not for following","review":"This DVD is not for me.I bought this DVD due to all those good reviews, but I was really disappointed. If you like watching Yoga show, then this is for you. If you are looking for a Yoga course to follow, then definitely do not get this one.People who like this DVD must be very experienced at Yoga, else how can they follow the pace and moves?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Was Hoping For","review":"I was introduced to yoga through a group class at my rec. I fell in love with it and really enjoyed the full body, relaxing experience. With all the great reviews of this DVD, I thought I might continue my passion for yoga in the comfort of my own home. Sadly this DVD was not what I wanted. I enjoy the physical aspects of yoga but this DVD tended to focus a lot more on the spiritual than I am comfortable with. My own personal beliefs cause me to feel uneasy about the depth this DVD went into with the spiritual part of yoga. I'm just looking for a good invigorating yoga DVD. Shiva Rea wanted me to buy into the entire spiritual concept of yoga and its roots and that is just not my cup of tea."},{"rating":"2","title":"great dvd, but it doesn't play most of the time!","review":"I also have the unreadable disc problem. The main disc doesn't play consistently, but the 2nd unessential disc works like a charm. I got a replacement copy from the company, but neither of those discs work. It's a bummer because I really like the workout. I actually have abdominal muscles now from using this dvd!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yoga Shakti","review":"I expected a full practice without pauses, but the full 1hr practices just combines the shorter matrix versions, so as soon as you get started and into it, it stops and goes to next matrix. I just want to do sun salutations for 15min or so to get into the groove. Too much talking for me but then again some people who are not really used to dropping down to the level of the body or emotional state might enjoy this. Shiva can guide to you to those places.I just want to move and then talk. I still go to baron baptise for simple power vinyasa with alignment cues. Shiva is more into the state of the pose and the \\"energy\\" etc then the physical alignment."},{"rating":"1","title":"the un-yoga","review":"I tried to love it, but this dvd had nothing for me. The sequences are boring and then impossible and back to boring. Which is a great argument for building up to a pose, which never happens in all the sequences. Not that it matters because none of the poses are held, so the physical challenge of the poses are always very limited. And to top it all off, the switching of scenes after each sequence is distracting and obnoxious. Don't waste your money. If you want a challenging practice that builds strength and awareness, forget Shakti and go get something by Rodney Yee."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far so good","review":"Great production, great workout and inspiring on so many levels. I need to use it more, but I love having it in my collection. Very happy with this purchase!! You will be gald you got it, plus you feel like they didn't just do it for the money... a good feeling."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Complete Yoga Experience","review":"This is the best yoga video I have ever used. It is very challenging, yet full of guidance as you grow in your practice. The music is soothing as Shiva guides you through a complete experience of the mind and body. The yoga matrix is also incredible, allowing you to customize your workout according to your needs. I am telling everyone about it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great for intermediate","review":"This dvd is excellent. The yoga matrix is a great way to focus on your own needs. Before this dvd I had done many of the Gaiam dvd's with Rodney Yee/Patricia Walden. I am happy I had those dvd's before I had this one, as I believe they really catered to the beginner/advance beginner. I feel that now that I am advance beginner/intermediate this variety of practices is just what I need to further myself. I don't think I would have appreciated this dvd as a pure beginner. The music is perfect, as well. There are many way advanced positions in this dvd that I will never be able to do (no matter how much I practice). But that should not be a deterant to purchasing this GREAT dvd!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great yoga routines!","review":"I love this DVD. It has a huge selection of yoga routines/segments to choose from, ranging from very basic/beginner to very advanced. Plus you can choose from the different segments to make your own customized yoga practice. So you never have to get bored! Shiva is a good instructor and offers very inspiring words as well as tips and posture advice. Love this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"my favorite yoga dvd","review":"absolutely love this dvd, being able to customize your routine is THE BEST and her voice is so calming and I love to watch her do the moves and the backgrounds are serene, a must have"},{"rating":"2","title":"best yoga dvd ever!","review":"Multiple yoga parts to pick from to keep you from getting bored. Challenging to beginners to intermediate. Just love the calmness and strength of the instructor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comprehensive and Versatile","review":"This versatile DVD provides 4 preset flow series that are invigorating and adaptable to your level of practice, but this DVD is unique in that you can build a seeming infinite number of custom series that meets your exact needs on a daily basis.Extensive bonus features are provided that covers the practice of yoga, the making of this DVD (you won't believe how they did it once you see the footage), and many other topics.This comprehensive DVD could easily be the only yoga DVD you need."},{"rating":"2","title":"vinyasa flow","review":"great vinyasa flow. i didn't realize that it was all the same type of yoga when i got it, so it was a little disappointing, but it is a great dvd for vinyasa flow. i haven't used all the features, yet, but i am looking forward to it. great dvd to have on hand when you can't make a class."},{"rating":"1","title":"wow she shore is purdy!","review":"Yeah, I'm a red blooded American male and I fell for the pretty woman on the cover. The yoga routines are not so great. I would recomend YogaZone videos. That Alan Finger guy is a real teacher at heart. His instructers are also great if you get one of the ones led by them. From what I have seen. they are really the best for beginning to intermediate."},{"rating":"2","title":"best yoga instructor out there","review":"this dvd is like 4 dvds for the price of one. four distinctly different yoga routines are set to soothing music in a beautiful setting. You are expertly guided through each routine by Shiva Rea. I had her pregnancy yoga dvd and highly recommend that one as well!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This DVD takes you there - in mind, body and spirit! I have been doing yoga for 3 years and this DVD is awesome!!!! Not for beginners at all - but keep it on your list is you plan on taking up yoga - it's THAT GOOD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do be careful","review":"This video is visually stunning. There are segments which are extremely challenging and rapid without any attention to good form. Definitions of \\"beginner, intermediate, advanced,\\" are not well defined. I put segments which were beyond my ability level into my workout and my carelessness contributed to a knee injury."},{"rating":"1","title":"I do sorta like it","review":"Shiva Rea's yoga is more like yoga porn. She's very sensuous and the movements are beautiful to watch but to try to follow as a real practice one must have a dance background. If you are beginning or intermediate in your practice you won't like this. I teach yoga and I didn't really like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great deal!","review":"I had read several other great reviews for this dvd, but was really impressed when I finally got to see it. To get an idea of what was on the video, I took some time to view each section first. Shiva gives instructions of the beginning level, then shows the next levels of many poses. It gives me something to work towards. The wealth of routines is amazing! The matrix lets you customize every step, but the programs already made offer a wonderful program too. The background and music are very soothing. Shiva gives just the right amount of instruction also in a soothing voice. I'm very pleased with this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Recommended","review":"I've been a Yoga enthusiast for about 10 years now and this is definately the best DVD/Video out there. I've practiced several types of yoga: Ashtanga, Bikram, & Jivamukti in a studio environment; and have tried many DVDs: Rodney Yee, Bryan Kest's Power Series & Baron Baptiste, none of which compare to this. I read a review in Yoga Journal & immediately purchased it. The yoga matrix is fantastic! By letting you create your own practice it eliminates the boredom that often occurs with video instruction. I also love the fact that she includes breathing and meditation exercises which are very integral parts of yoga and are often left out of other videos. Although some knowledge of yoga is needed, it's great for the beginner as well as the very advanced. I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Yoga DVD","review":"This DVD is worth every penny. It is beautifully shot, and the matrix is such an amazing tool that it is as if I had bought 8 or 9 DVDs. The preset flows are outstanding and range from beginner to intermediate poses. These account for 4 hours of instruction, plus every set of flows is included in the matrix so you can customize the workouts to work for you. To add to the mix, Yoga Shakti offers a feature to play only music with the flows. This video is really a great buy for anyone who is interested in ashtanga or power yoga and who really would like to take the time to work on themselves. I am very happy with this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little disappointed","review":"As someone that has practiced yoga for a couple of years, I found this DVD set to be a let down. Since Shiva refers to the poses in non-English terms, I found that I never knew what she was doing unless I kept watching the TV which is really hard in some poses. I was always lagging behind. I tried reviewing the discs since it was said to have an \\"instruction\\" portion. This only showed a few minutes of one or two poses. For someone that knows the names of the poses this disc may be ok. It will collect dust on my shelf until a time (if ever) that I learn what the poses are called. This is definitely NOT a beginner DVD as advertised. Although I do not consider myself a true beginner and know most poses in their English names, I had a hard time. I will now order one from Yodney Yee or Patricia Walden who guides you along and tells you exactly how to align your body and prevent injury."},{"rating":"2","title":"simple but effective","review":"i have never done yoga before so this dvd was perfect. the fact that i can start simple and customise my routine helps.the scenery is breathtaking and the instructions are soothing and easy to follow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watching a human pretzel is not yoga","review":"I bought this DVD because of the great reviews. I hated it! There is NO instruction. I had to keep looking to the TV to see what she was doing...which is not always easy when you are in a pose. Most of the poses are made up, so you NEED instruction to know how to do them correctly and not hurt yourself.I found this workout very advanced, and not very relaxing. I consider myself intermediate, and I could maybe do half the moves in the workout. It seemed more like she was showing off how flexible she is, instead of helping students achieve the right pose for their level."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Really For Beginners","review":"I bought this DVD thinking it would be a very easy to use beginner yoga workout. It really isn't. In order to do this workout, you really need to know how to do the poses already. There is very little instruction. I found she switched poses too quickly and I couldn't keep up. The recommended workouts ranged from approximately 45 to 90 minutes and I really don't have the time for a workout that long. You can put together your own workout using the matrix, but having very little knowledge of the types of yoga and the poses, I could not create a workout that worked for me.I have to admit, the scenery was beautiful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"Yoga Shakti is a \\"must-have\\" for serious yogis/yoginis! I think that if you already have a good basic foundation in yoga, you will enjoy Yoga Shakti very much. If you are just starting out, you'll probably become frustrated. Yoga Shakti is vinyasa flow yoga, so it does flow more swiftly and therefore it's better for someone who's not entirely new/fairly new to yoga. If you prefer more of Iyengar style yoga, you might not like Yoga Shakti as much.Having said all this, Yoga Shakti is amazing! It's one of the best yoga DVDs available and it's stunning in all aspects. There's so much on it that you will find endless possibilities in your home yoga practice. I really like how the yoga practices range from simpler to more challenging poses--the practices address different levels of yoga experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is in my top two favorite yoga DVDs","review":"This DVD is spectacular, and that is not an overstatement. It is filmed beautifully, and the music is perfect. It's also great to use one of the four practices they've created, or make your own. You will never outgrow this DVD.BUY IT!P.S. My other favorite is Power Yoga for Happiness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great yoga video","review":"I've only been doing yoga for a few months and was using one of those 10 Minute Solution videos prior to this one. Like many have said, there are some difficult things on here but yoga isn't easy...you slowly work up to those poses/practices. I don't even use the matrix aspect of this DVD because I am new to yoga but I know that as I progress I will."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful DVD, Great Variety","review":"Like most of the other reviews I love the options on this DVD. I think it's well worth the money. If you can only buy one yoga dvd, this is a great one because of the variety of workouts. It also has a music only option and will be useful in creating your own routines. I love Shiva, but my complaint is that this particular DVD is not for totally FRESH beginners. You should know some of the basic poses already because she doesn't explain them (in my opinion) thoroughly enough for a rookie. Great quality, and she is totally in line with what I want out of yoga. I love how she uses Sanskrit verbage. It reminds me so much of my old yoga class."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad, not great","review":"There are very few books of this sort around, so if you're into the medium of bodypainting, it's a keeper. But I found it wanting in several areas. Some of the painting jobs are quite good, others (including the cover shot) are not particularly well-done. The photography and modeling are adequate but uninspired-- they all seem to be taken with the same lighting, from the same angle, with the same attitude. The images themselves appear to be story illustrations or ad art, and many don't stand up too well out of context. In short, it's a book of commercial art images of attractive nudes with stuff painted on them. If that's your bag, this is your book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The first word that comes to mind is \\"uneven\\".","review":"I've always been fond of body art (\\"Painted Bodies\\", edited by Roberto Edwards, is spectacular) but this book, a relative handful of photographs capped with a page or two of one-line comments, barely bounced on my coffee-table on its way to well-deserved obscurity... the overall visual sensibility is derivative of \\"Penthouse\\", except with subpar photography. It was not a complete disappointment - the best images are very good, and almost worth the price of admission - but the overall effect is not quite what it should have been. Most of the author's effort clearly went into the painting: it is imaginative and well-executed (with several rather sophomoric misses), but the combination of wooden models (albeit with a few welcome exceptions) and a photographic obsession with poorly-lit faceless torsos makes the painting a mostly wasted effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Primitive attempt, painted on costumes mostly.","review":"Mostly painted on primitive costumes. Had the lighting been truly wonderful it might have obscured the poor casting choice of models. Otherwise this a truly unremarkable book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sandy Toed Beach Bum Life!!","review":"Love it!! Makes me want to be on the beach with the sand between my toes & a bottle of rum in hand. His laid-back style and whiskey voice evoke images of the islands in a way that few others can. Definitely a must-have!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast moving suspense","review":"Thea Harper just got out of a mental hospital. She had a seizure and supposedly killed her boyfriend Senator simon Gallatin. She remembers nothing. But his blood was on her hands so she must of killed him right? The Senator's family is powerful and out of revenge. They want Thea to pay for what she had done. Now that Thea is trying to get her life back. Murders are happening again. Did she do them while having an another seizure. She did wake up with blood under her nails. Wasn't her feet all muddy when she woke up in the morning. And she is painting objects only the killer or victim could know. There's a good guy on her side even though she doesn't know it and he believes she couldn't have killed. Read the book for the shocking ending. If you like this book. Buy \\"If I should die\\" and \\" The house on the hill\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Straub Soars!","review":"Peter Straub doesn't just tell a story...he pulls you into his mind and lets you live it. He is the absolute king of the supernatural thriller, a genre he may have created (as far as I can tell).I got a bit of flak from my dean when I said I was going to include Straub in my American Lit class. Then I challenged him to read the man's work before judging based solely on a \\"genre\\". Let's just say I won that bet.If you haven't read Straub yet...then go do yourself a favor. Start with Ghost Story and keep going."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Fan of Straub is Disappointed","review":"I have read all of Peter Straub's books -- he is one of my favorite authors. I felt very cheated by this book. I put in an advance order for it and expected his usual great story. This seemed like the tag end of \\"Lost Boy, Lost Girl,\\" composed only of character and plot relating to that book. It does not stand on its own and even as a companion to \\"Lost Boy, Lost Girl\\" it has little value. I don't know how to explain how this book could be so bad. The \\"trick\\" plot device was not impressive -- no technique is more valuable than the story, and there was no story here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good at all","review":"I honestly don't understand why anyone would consider the plot of this book to be a good one. I thought it was actually silly, without any credibility and filled with poorly written dialogues. Around 2/3 of the book I just didn't care about what would happen in the end and stopped reading. I have never felt the slightest desire to pick it up again to finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"LSD is easier to understand","review":"Like Annie, I found this book a huge disappointment. Unlike her, I decided not to finish it -- why waste my time? This author must have been on serious drugs in order to write such tripe. One shouldn't have to work so hard when reading a book for pleasure. As a fan of Stephen King's first few books, I quite reading him when he got as weird as Peter Straub. I can see why they're friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"dead tree","review":"ink on paper = dead treeink on paper = moneydo not spend your dead trees on this dead treeif you find it at your library put it back on the shelf"},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes no sense","review":"I picked this author up after reading a book he did with Stephen King. I was sorely disapointed. Not only did the book make no sense, it had no plot, no charater development and I had to force myself to finish it. Whatever great conventions he is breaking, I obviously must not get it. Go to the library before wasting your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Straub: sometimes confusing, always enjoyable","review":"I picked up this book without realizing that it was a sequel to Straub's last novel, Lost Boy Lost Girl, which I had not read; however, I was already familiar with the main character, Timothy Underhill, from Straub's earlier works. Here, Straub goes one step further in blurring the lines between reality and fiction, to mixed results. On the one hand, In the Night Room is an engaging, suspenseful tale laced with genuine grief as well as truly poignant moments. On the other, I couldn't help but to feel a bit confused by the elaborate storyline, which includes email messages from dead classmates, a hierarchy of the afterlife, and angry guardian angels. Sometimes I feel as if maybe I'm just not quite smart enough to keep up with Straub, as I don't always \\"get\\" what he is trying to say. Still, I enjoyed this book and plan to go back and read Lost Boy Lost Girl to fill in the backstory."},{"rating":"1","title":"GREAT TITLE..AND THAT'S IT","review":"\\"It was OK\\" is the most damning-with-faint-praise expression I can think of for a book like this. It's an adequate read, but who has time for adequate reads? Straub has his pet themes like all writers, but unlike most seems happy to just riff on the same notes, over and over and over. I particularly hate his portrayal of women: they're either beautiful, winsome, perfect creatures (we know this because he tells us, they actually come across as needy and childish) or they're the staff. Ick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mostly disappointeted","review":"Actually this book deserves 2 1/2 stars. It wasn't that bad, it just wasn't good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sequel to LBLG? - naw","review":"While many refer to \\"in the night room\\" as a sequel to \\"lost boy, lost girl\\" I disagree. The book has many references to the prior book but does not tell such a similar tale.The story is good as it follows Tim during his life after his adventures in LBLG. And at first I am not sure of what to make of the other story taking place. But I think the greatest parts of the book is when the stories come together and reveal themselves.I wouldn't classify this book as being horror that Straub usually does but it does have a great sense of suspence and thrills involved.This book does quench the thirst in me that was left after LBLG and was an enjoyable read. Straub has written better (LBLG, Mr. X) but he has written worse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this product","review":"Great to work with, and no odor!

I thought it reminded me of her comedy tour routines."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Book Ever","review":"Whoopi Goldberg has managed to write one of the worst books of all time. All she does throughout is spout her liberal messages off like we should all believe this nonsense, and throws in every four-letter word she can think of for emphasis on her already off-the-wall ideas. And if you are Catholic then you will be extremly offended by her comments on the Pope. Do not buy this book under any circumstances! Please don't waste your money like I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beneath her considerable Talents...","review":"This book was about Whoopi Goldberg's opinion on various things. It was non-fiction. Though I agreed with many of the ideas presented in this book, I found it to be adolescent. Whoopi was trying too hard to be down to earth and frankly, ended up sounding juvenile. I like her, I think she has the ability to see things others do not, but I think this book was dumb and beneath her intelligence and wit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only Whoopi ...","review":"Only from Whoopi would you expect a book entitled Book. Her 'to the point' and sometimes raw style jumps right from the pages. It is filled with some of her most cherished views on life, sex and being American (not African American). Whether you love Whoopi or hate her, this book probably won't change your mind either way. You've heard some of the quips before ... others might raise your eyebrows quite high ... really, really high."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laughing to death!","review":"I was laughing so much that people on the train were staring at me. If you like Whoopi, you will like this book. There are serious parts to it but it was trully her.

I honestly expected some thoughtful yet humorous insight into the mind of this great comedic actress. Nothing of the sort. It is poorly written, it rambles and drifts from one issue to the next with no real destination. She tells you what she thinks of the world but not why she feels that way.

It was a funny, sort of brutally honest look at life as she sees it. It's not meant to be this majorly serious novel as I see some people are reviewing it as...it reads like it was written for fun. It brightened my day because it made me look lightly at my life and the lives of everyone around me. I find Whoopi's writing entertaining because almost everything she talks about has happened, at least in part, to me.

I was lent this book (thank heavens that I didn't buy it) and accepted it, thinking that it would be full of funny and witty comments from a very talented actress and writer. It consists of very short chapters, each on a different subject, but most of which are concerned with bodily functions. If you are fascinated by reading chapters on urinating (and why men have wet spots on the front of their trousers), pooing, farting, masturbating and all the other usually private functions, then this is your kind of book. On the other hand, if, like me, you prefer to read something a bit more entertaining, don't bother with this book. Ok, perhaps I'm old fashioned, but there are some things that I'd rather keep private and don't find any humour in the kind of wee and poo jokes that traditionally have 5 year old boys rolling in the aisles."},{"rating":"2","title":"WONDERFUL!","review":"this book is so funny. pick this book up when you need a good laugh. it's a great stress reliever book. absolutely wonderful. i love her bluntness and just how she approaches life, it's very inspiring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not funny","review":"Whoopi Goldberg, like so many comedians, apparently thinks that the so-called dirty words are funny, per se, in whatever context. In this case, they simply aren't amusing, except to the snickering adolescent. She is a fine actress, and I have laughed at some of her wit in stand-up routines. Perhaps something goes out of them when reduced to paper and read by someone who is cold sober. Ultimately humor has to have something to say about the human condition, and she doesn't have much to say that is beyond a perfect grasp of the obvious. That is sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!","review":"I was extremely anxious to read this book but was disappointed when I finally did.

Returning from a trip to Paris I was inspired by the works of the great French impressionists and wanted to learn the basics of their style of painting. This book is a two part course in painting - the first section covers basic color theory and the second walks you through step-by-step excersises to learn to apply the techniques. My landscapes have taken on a whole new look and I'm looking forward to a workshop with Griffel in the coming year."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment","review":"I hate to give anyone a bad review, but the best thing about this book is the cover. I have gone through this book several times, and I really cannot understand the high rating of the other reviews. Lois Griffel is NOT a painter and apparently has never taken a lesson in perspective. I am guessing that she has had all her former students write glowing reviews for her. The best paintings in the book are by other artists. If you really want to know how to paint in the impressonistic style, visit a museum or look at some paintings by Monet or Manet. The exercises in the book are just directing the artist to paint boring pictures of white blocks and forms. \\"See the color.\\" This is your local art guild stuff and, if you have any talent at all, this book will NOT improve or add to your current skills.

Of the many books on my shelf this is the one that I would not do without. Lois Griffel has demystified a painting process, made it easy to understand and given us a way to practice it, the oft' dreaded block studies. She has successfully fulfilled her stewardship of the Cape Cod School started by Charles Hawthorne and developed by Henry Hensche. She is a great teacher who should be read and studied by anyone interested in color, especially painters both experienced and beginner alike. Many of today's greatest painters studied with Hensche. The rest of us can get a touch of the training here. Great book!

The dubbing is off, and the special effects are laughable.

The old-fashioned style in The Golden Scorpion can be a bit offputting until you get used to it, and the racial stereotyping is certainly jarring to modern sensibilities (and would probably be offensive for some). But if you view it as a product of the time and accept that such views were typical then, it is a very exciting story.

Good stuff!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Golden scorpion, yellow peril","review":"Strictly speaking, this isn't in Rohmer's Fu Manchu series. The name of the insidious Chinese mastermind bent on world domination, together with his beautiful female agent, has changed. That's about it, though. The excitement, dens of iniquity, worldwide conspiracies and all the rest are about the same. The racial stereotypes haven't changed much either.As always, Rohmer delivers a good, trashy bit of noir amusement. And, I'm happy to say, the bizarre attitudes about people from different gene pools are no longer commonplace. In fact, such attitudes are about as distant from my world as whalebone corsets and Victorian mores. The story's racism, though odious in itself, lies safely behind layers of history. Like the manners and clothing of costume dramas, the attitudes depict Rohmer's time as it was, even if not as any sane person would want today to be.-- wiredweird"},{"rating":"2","title":"A walk in a distant place","review":"These poems are refreshing, startling, witty and warm.

The tension adjustment on this thing leaves much to be desired -- after over half an hour of playing around with it, I still haven't got it quite right -- but I do have a terrific headache! I really just want her to have something to learn the absolute basics on before she graduates to my old sewing machine, but it looks like I should have just gone for the real thing to start with.

The majority of books that I had available at that time offered little practical explanation and were overindulged with obscure details, mathematical proofs and issues far beyond what was needed by the beginning quantum chemist. I think that Griffel's book bridged the gap providing enough material to fully grasp the terminology and theorems needed for the study of quantum mechanics while not overwhelming the beginner. It think that this book would be a nice prelude to the one by Byron and Fuller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very cheap quality","review":"I would say these should not be more then $20.

Oh yeah, only 6 or 7 of us watched this series. PEOPLE, wake from the dead! This DVD is so freaking hilarious you will bust a gut! I remember watching this show in the early 90's. I thought Ben Stiller was hot hot hot. And the show was funny and quirky. Well, it is SO much better than I even remember. Do not hesitate to buy this DVD. It is worth every cent. A great find.

The filter of time made this a must-buy for me; sadly, I cannot recommend this dvd to casual or even hardcore sketch fans. The show has that same overreaching, too broad, too cool-for-school quality that made its sister Fox show 'In Living Color' such an unwatchable mess. The Odenkirk bits have some non-linear charm, but that's a plug for 'Mr Show'. For those who remember 'The Edge' or those horrific mid-90's SNL shows, it may be better to wait for those upcoming KITH and SCTV boxes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Been waiting for publication of this show for TEN years","review":"Finally!

I trudged through all 13 episodes, hoping at some point to laugh, but no.It's surprising that such a cast and a team of writers could fail at this. The Ben Stiller Show is horribly unfunny, and while there ARE very good ideas within each sketch, it just does not produce.If what you're looking for is hilarious sketch comedy, stick with Mr. Show with Bob And David, The Kids In The Hall, or Monty Python. And if what you're looking for is a good example of Ben's work, stick to his movies.But if you want disappointment, this is where it's at."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hysterical!","review":"How I have waited for this DVD (and will continue to wait... 2010 release date? that can't be right...)!

If you think that description sounds fun, then you will think the movie is fun. Not only are there some great laughs, but Ghoulies 3 even tosses in some great T & A. I was surprised because I don't remember any of the other Ghoulies movies having any nudity. Ghoulies 3 is included in the 8 pack horror collection just released by Lions Gate.

Plus, the ghoulies talked in this one which was not funny at all. We had high hopes for this movie but it let us down. If your reading this and thinking to yourself, \\"Well if this guy hated it so much he must just not like those types of movies, and its probably one of those movies where its so bad its hilarious\\". Well, that's not the case. Never watch this movie.

One wishes for more depth of passion from this woman than we get here (her whiny voice is a definite negative), but the Lawrence themes of love, marriage, and personal freedom are presented in an interesting way.Lawrence's book is long and thorough; director Ken Russell errs by merely touching upon certain themes that were more fully explored in the book (the miners, for instance, and the war) and then letting them drop. It also ends abruptly with Davis chasing the rainbow. The movie lacks depth of feeling and intelligence, but it's well photographed and the whole thing might be closer to Lawrence than we'd like to admit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good adaptation of D.H.

Nothing was said of the capitalistic negotiations that made the festival possible. The few scenes of litter made it look as though it was a \\"KEEP AMERICA BEAUTIFUL\\" rally, when in fact it was not. The politicking by the bands was ignored, and the salesmen must've vanished for awhile. Rather sad for those of us who thought this was as much a political convention as a show.

[Although looking back now, the 'scene' seems hilariously self-absorbed and frankly cringe inducing in places].As a social documentary,I'd give it 4 stars at leastBut as a concert film it is dull, too 'chopped up' and not really worth buying for repeat viewing. For example,the butchered set of Hendrix was played over footage of all the rubbish being cleared up....hmmSo if you're primarily a music lover,in particular if you like full un-interrupted song footage,I suggest you rent this and buy something else insteadAll together now- 'no rain,no rain,no rain....'!"},{"rating":"1","title":"woodstock 40th anniversary ultimate collection blu-ray","review":"I was disappointed with this product. Blu-ray did not enhance the video quality as much as I had hoped, and the aspect ratio left huge black borders not only at the top and bottom, which I can accept; but also on the sides, which I cannot. Sound quality was also disappointing. In my view, this was a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short on extras","review":"I was expecting much more from this special edition. The only extra was a short infomercial for the Museum at Bethal Woods. No commentaries, not supplementary concert footage, not even a trailer. Lame."},{"rating":"2","title":"Woodstock","review":"This was a once in a lifetime event that will most likely never happen again. Great artists, great music and a great view of how we were going to change the world through music, peace and love. So glad I got this on Blu-Ray."},{"rating":"2","title":"Peace and Love!","review":"This is a very wonderful in depth look at the festival. I liked the detail of the event provided from all sides of the production. I enjoyed the songs and guitar licks that were not included on the original movie. I laughed I cried and I rocked out big time. We need another Woodstock generation. Buy it, enjoy it and remember just how long ago this was. Peace and Love!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BUY THE VHS - not the DVD","review":"Read the other reviews.I bought the VHS to see if it was better than the DVD. It is! Better video AND sound quality. Warner Home Video did a poor job on the DVD version. It is NOT truly widescreen (as you will see if you buy the VHS). It is more pan-and-scan full screen. You WILL get a better movie by buying the VHS and copying it to DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"just say no to re-recording music","review":"I just watched the video above about bringing in some Santana band members (and in one case the son of a band member) to re-record some percussion parts for the 40th Anniv Woodstock blu-ray/dvd. I am the only person who has a problem with this? I think that if you have to re-record music today to make footage from 1969 usable, the footage shouldn't be included in the movie. If the music isn't original, it's not authentic, and if it's not authentic, what's the point?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good documentation of Woodstock","review":"It was a very good realization of Woodstock. It showed everything as it happened with nothing censored. The editing was done very well, in the sense that they added music and scenes together to get a better picture. I couldn't believe how real it seemed. It will always be a classic to watch the revolutionary society as it was back then."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money.","review":"I also have this movie in it's many various incarnations. The Blu Ray 40th Anniversary, the original VHS and DVD release, as well as the director's cut DVD. So I go and by this 40th Aniversary DVD for my office (which unfortunately does not have a Blu Ray player) specifically because I wanted the extra performances that are on the other 40th Anniversary discs. Creedance, Johnny Winter, The Who, Canned Heat, Airplane, etc. Wrong! Not here. Even the extra documentary footage that's on the other 40th Anniversary release of Wadleigh, Dale Bell, Scorsese and many others speaking on the events surrounding the filming of the movie is not here. Just some cheesy Story of the Sixties film. Totally dissapointed. What really made me angry is that there's no disclaimer stating that there's huge differences between this \\"40th Anniversary Edition\\" DVD and the others that are available. I just gave it away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad translation from VHS","review":"1. Bad Menu Options2. Bad Sound, besides the 5.1 the sound its soo bad3.

The film opens with someone from a band called \\"Ten Years After,\\" the lead singer looking like Kent from Begosian's film \\"Talk Radio,\\" and the man is strung out on something, repeating over and over again how he is going to \\"go home to see his baby.\\" One gets an overpowering sense of how lost these kids were and how badly they wanted to find the answers. Footage of John Sebastian, Santana(young Carlos on guitar) and others gives a great insight into the anti-war madness during Vietnam. God bless the flower children, because their intentions were good. Of course, the road to hell is paved with good intentions."},{"rating":"1","title":"And the subtitles?","review":"I want to know if this \\"new\\" version has subtitles.

The analog VHS is far superior to any of the digital conversions and the Blu Ray is just a copy of the first D/C. A complete waste of material. The sound will pass for those who used to listen to 8 track and still think it is the best format. For the time being anybody who would like the memories seek out analog; the D/C was done out of greed not Love.........Peace.........."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong item pictured","review":"This is not the Woodstock \\"Target Only\\" exclusive.

I have since had to request refund. Please keep that in mind when ordering."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bought it for Santana","review":"I bought this DVD for Santana's Soul Sacrifice. In my opinion, this is the highlight of the whole concert. Michael Shrieve's drum solo is unbelievable. Imagine 400,000 people dancing in a muddy field, all at once! Crazy! Santana stopped the show! Ten Years After and The Who rocked the show too, and of course, Jimi Hendrix ripping on guitar. I gave it 4 stars because there's too much talking. Some talking parts are long and drag on and on. They could've been replaced with more music. Otherwise, a really good movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review Hits the BullsEye","review":"Reviewer Thomas Thatcher is absolutely correct in every aspect of his review. Younger people ask me about that time (I had the long hair, blue jeans, and Dingo boots, etc.)and I set them straight about things as I see them.

I can see why they tried to re-create the feeling of these times by staging woodstock 94 and 99, unfortunate that 99 ruined a great thing. If you like music from that era, this film is a definite must have. The who, Hendrix, Joe Cocker to name a few, but many other as well. Interesting look into Flower power. I don't nessesarily agree with everything in the movie, but this is an important American Documentary. Something for any Music person to watch at least once in their life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good stuff","review":"When reviews of music DVD's are all over the board regarding sound quality only one fair conclusion is possible: The problem is the end user,not the product. I was stunned by how good this DVD sounded. Consider the conditions under which Woodstock was recorded and the quality and calibration of your home system before jumping to negative conclusions about this \\"transfer\\". That the VHS version sounds better than the Dolby 5.1 mix on DVD is simply not possible. You can quibble about several aspects of this movie but sound quality should not be one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"OVERDUBS?? For WOODSTOCK??!!!","review":"Why in the WORLD would you \\"ADD\\" overdubs and RE-RECORD MUSICAL PERFORMANCES FOR THIS??!!

The whole point of Woodstock was one of Peace and Love and TRUTH and HONESTY - this seems kinda; counter to those ideals.

Several of my favorite groups performed at Woodstock so I wanted to own the video. It is a good historical piece. The blu-ray is great.

But if you want to remember Woodstock and not spend a lot of money on the special sets and editions, this is the DVD to get."},{"rating":"2","title":"I purchased this DVD set for the CCR clips","review":"They finely included CCR in this package,but they did not cut them into movie.They are on an extra disc entitled Woodstock:Untold Stories.This disc also includes some great never before seen performances by Santana,Canned Heat,Mountain,Johnny Winter and Paul Butterfield.No Blood Sweat And Tears.For me it was worth buying this set for the Untold Stories Disc,although they did not bother using all the camera shots to make it wide-screen as the movie was done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rating is for this version ,not the Concert","review":"I have a borrowed copy so I am not bitter about buying this CHEAP rehash. Director's cut... means what? We all know that Woodstock was a groovy phenomenon - there's no debate there, and the positive reviews for this product are giving credit where its due. However, if I was a consumer I would be enraged. As another viewer mentioned, the sub titles are in places hysterically inaccurate- Couldn't the producers of this version hire a fact checker? Additionally- there are no extras at all, and the two sided disc is not mentioned anywhere. The dvd just cuts off and turns to black while CSN are still talking. I thought something happened to my TV. ( yeah man, the cats that put together this version were just not being cool - and that's not me just rappin' with a negative vibe- ya dig? Don't waste your bread man.)

Unfortunately, the Director's Cut has butchered the original film. Scenes and performances have been altered, all for the worse. This dvd will sit on the shelf, and I will continue to listen to the cd. The Director's cut is revisionist at best.Update--1 July 2008: If this review was not helpful to you, I would appreciate learning the reason(s) so I can improve my reviews.

This unease is found among the the anti-vietnam & anti-govrnmant slant among the songs.

A split screen in HD is no better than a split screen in regular 480, with small images like this there is no real improvement. I was never a fan of hippies either, but the music was why I bought this. It is 1969 and this is nothing as good as the Mets winning the world series. I can not get past the split screen, I made a bad error in judgement to buy it. I will watch it once and forget about it. I bought it because it was 26 bucks on special of the day...big deal, it's still bad filming and even worse post production. Wow I can see the grainy cheap print in Blu-Ray! Sound is 1969 Muntz 8 Track. It sound awful on my really good home theatre surround. Very disappointed, but it is about what I expected. I blame myself for being so stupid. I knew better! Makes me want to go back to VHS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Time capsule that is still mesmerizing","review":"Who hasn't seen this yet? The older it gets, the more contemporary it seems. Just a different war now than 40 years ago. The clothing and hair styles are pretty much back in 2009, same as 1969. The film is edited such that actual events and musical performances are not in line with how it really happened. For example, Sha Na Na went on right before Hendrix on Monday morning, but this is edited to look like they were on mid-show. The performances that have held up best: Joe Cocker, Santana, Hendrix, CS&N. Even at more than three hours, this still omits probably 40-50 hours of musical performances, not to mention all the other film that was shot. I loved the apocalyptic ending showing the garbage, smoke from fires and the mud left over. And the scroll of all the dead from that era is sobering."},{"rating":"1","title":"They cut the good stuff","review":"I purchased this DVD with high expectations, and was very disappointed.

The picture on the DVD looks the same on the Blu-Ray which makes sense since I would guess that the original footage was shot in 16mm. The audio on the other hand sounds much better than on the DVD. If you're an audio purist than you probably won't like the multichannel mix, but I'm not a purist so I enjoyed it. If you haven't seen the Director's cut then definiately buy the Blu-Ray.

Then there are the large number of pointless one liners, short dumb sketches, scenes that go on too long, etc. This now seems about as hip as a Nehru jacket and love beads. Simply awful. You also know that a supposedly radical \\"youth\\" show has lost its sense of identity when it starts having lounge lizards such as Joey Bishop and Sammy Davis as guest stars.

He and Rampal joined up on several notable chamber music recordings; here the renowned flutist serves as conductor for his old friend. Stern's tone is a bit thin and his intonation not always perfect, but you hear decades of musicianship in his playing.Nothing is all that polished, which is one of the nicest things about this performance. It feels impromptu instead of studied, and there is an amiable flow of melody from beginning to end. I wish Sony's digital sound from 1994 were warmer and the timing (62 min.) longer, but this is an engaging Haffner Serenade that I thoroughly enjoyed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fair product, but company does NOT pay rebates.

There is nothing secret about it; it is plainly taught in the New Testament. The only thing unknown about it concerns the timing debate, which is really the crux of the matter. Woodrow's title for the book suggests to the nominal reader that the Rapture concept was hatched up in secrecy by certain individuals who were not following scripture.

Plus, one of the shelves was cracked all the way through.With the correct parts this would make a good printer stand.

With Homicide, by contrast, I couldn't take my eyes off the DVD player's time reader, to determine whether I had seen enough to make a fair judgment.

Brought to the small screen by Oscar-winning director Barry Levinson, Tom Fontana and Paul Attanasio, the series boasts one of the a tight, razor-sharp cast --- headed by Ned Beatty, Richard Belzer, Andre Braugher and Yaphet Kotto --- that helped redefine police dramas ... and then rewrite that definition over and over again.

An interest in the romanization of East Asian scripts or literacy issues would be enough. Unger writes well and has a certain fiery opinionatedness to him that belies what most people would consider his dull subject matter.

Khalil Kain ( the most ignored actor on the planet ) did great too, but once again never got his props. To break it down Juice is just about four friends who decide to knock off a store for no reason at all. The actions didn't match Omar's character. He was the straight laced one and cared too much about his music, so it didn't make sense that he'd go along with this. The writing wasn't as good as \\" Boyz In Da Hood \\" or \\" New Jack City \\".

The film explores a very happy family with the kids all grown up and now have their own problems. Jack Lemmon was perfectly cast as the hyperchondriac husband and Julie Andrews is just as good as the loving but somewhat reserved wife. Critics complained about the use of improvisation and a flat story. Nothing could be further from the truth. You see some of the wacky things people do at the spur of the moment,(Harvey goes to a fortune teller), and the true frustration with getting older. Blake Edwards assembled a fine cast of real-life family and friends. Robert Loggia and Sally Kellerman add to the supporting cast as do Lemmon's son Chris, Edward's daugher Jennifer, and Andrew's daugher Emma. \\"That's Life\\" may not be the most outstanding Blake Edwards film, but watch it anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT A DVD!!!","review":"I've been looking for this movie for years, it's so classic Jack Lemo and Julie Andrews , but is personalized cuz the children of the stars have staring roles, too.

I'd reccomnd it to ages 4 and up, thoughour 3 year old loved it. I love it, too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I like it, but it could be better.","review":"Maybe I don't like this game that much because I'm used to pressing A for gas and B for break. This game is unique and the graphics are awsome, but something is missing.I love Sonic games, but this seems a little to confusing for me, maybe with a little more practice the game will grow on me.I do suggest that you rent this game before buying it, just incase you don't like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sonic Riders buy or not to buy","review":"Here are good and bad things of the game. The good thing is they have great graphcis and its fun to play multiplayer with a couple of your friends. The bad thing is this game is fusrtarting the controls are still need to get used to.

You may want to practice a lot before you play in the tournament mode, or if you want to play it right away, have a lot of patience. My tip is to restart automatically if the computer player is about to win. That way, you can bypass the losing.Overall, if you like Tony Hawk games, then i would try out this game. But the game is meant for PATIENT people!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"a disappointment & a waste of $40","review":"At first, i was very excited about this game because i own Sonic Adventure2: Battle, which is one of the best games ever in my opinion.

I had already purchased it as a Christmas present for him. I don't know why it was grouped with the Pink Floyd members solo material, when it wasn't even Rock 'n' Roll music or at least pop music, but Jazz. I don't think I'll return mine, it's too much trouble, but it's not my type of music. I'm sure others made the same mistaken assumptions. At worst, it will keep my listening experiences diverse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ritualism","review":"Be careful about buying this item.This is not the Gilmour of Pink Floyd.Honestly I love jazz music and The Pink floyd music too Amazon can prove that.I just wondered why Amazon advertized it very confusingly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get over it ... this David Gilmour is a much better guitarist","review":"I've been hearing and admiring this man and his guitar for a number of years, always backing other players. It's great to see he has put together his own. It seems okay to me that more than one person has his name. On a CD entitled \\"International Quintet (On In),\\" he plays with the other Bill Evans (the sax player). In fact, I know of a number of people who have the same name I do. Is there no end to the confusion? Admitedly, this music is a bit complex for most P. Floyd fans (although I've been one myself since \\"Meddle\\" was first released). For those who love great jazz guitar, this might be for you.

Leslie has tremendous talent and did receive a lot of help from Pappalardi (producer of Cream's Wheels of Fire LP). It is a classic and led Mountain on to several great LPs. Listen to Mountain Climbing for Mississippi Queen and Roll Over Beethoven live . Tremendous . This is their starter lp and pretty damn good for 69."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting but Flawed","review":"In this book, Stedhal attempts to analyze the phenomenon of love. I'd highly recommend it to any fans of Proust, as it presents many of the ideas which were more completely and satisfyingly developed in novel form in _Remembrance of Things Past._ The first half of the book contains the meat of Stendhal's ideas, which I found very interesting. However, the second part, in which Stedhal attempts to give examples of his ideas, was uniteresting and would have been better left out. Stedhal spends a lot of time discussing the particular ways that different nationalities approach love. Perhaps a European reader might find this parade of national stereotypes interesting, but I thought the second half of the book was tedious and didn't add anything to the ideas developed in the first part."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comprehensive","review":"Each chapter is comprehensive and delivers in providing a background, profile, and analysis of politics in selected countries. Unlike another reviewer, I did not see a particularly leftist bias. If anyone is interested in reading truly leftist material filled with criticisms of developed countries and international institutions, I recommend using a research database or even google using key terms like \\"neocolonialism\\" and \\"Dependency theory\\" in conjunction with \\"Latin America\\". Or pick up the latest copy of Annual Editions' \\"Developing World\\". There's a difference between discussing facts and applying interpretations to the facts, and this book does more of the former than the latter. It is dry and oftentimes repetitive, but it's also comprehensive and informative."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gorgeous junkfood.","review":"Alas, the whole is less than the parts. Promised Land is a beautifully filmed, well acted, heartbreaking story with an absolutely fabulous score by the always excellent James Newton Howard.

And even though it has no superheros or computer animation - our five year old loves it, too! The pug-nosed pup, (Otis), and his curious little kitten pal, (Milo), go on a long journey together; getting into a few scrapes and experiencing many amusing run-ins with various other forms of wild-life, along the way! The most amazing thing, is that there are no people in this whole movie! What's even more amazing, is that people would just be superflous!

This is a charming family movie that is a MUST for ALL animal lovers!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It IS Cruel !","review":"I bought this movie for my little one because I loved it as a child. However upon watching it again as an adult I can totally tell that it is cruel to animals.I then did some research and sure enough its very controversial.They do a number of cruel things to the creatures in here.I began to notice something was wrong when they sent the cat down river in a box,which includes it going over a falls(with a real cat in the box !!).That cat is unhappy and frightened,you can tell by the tone of his meows,and its a real cat w/a real voice ....When will we stop enjoying being \\"entertained\\" by the idea of animals in pain?

I saw nothing \\"cute\\" about a kitten getting bit on the lip by a crab, or floating down a river in a box and over a waterfall, with a look of dispair. Not to mention the puppy being \\"forced\\" to fight a black bear. There was no \\"trick photography\\" to this movie. What you see is what you get. I had to shut it off half way through. I couldn't deal with it. I would not consider this family entertainment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible kids movie.

Shallow, poorly scripted, cruel to the animal actors and insincere about the cruelty (the narrator ascribes emotions to the animals that are clearly not what they are feeling (\\"happy\\" while obviously distressed, etc.) Plus, it's just dumb, simply moronic, insulting to the intelligence of the children it's aimed at. Really: don't bother. (Axton)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok, now I feel terrible","review":"I bought this movie at target for $5 for my son remembering how much I loved it as a kid. He has watched it a couple of times and adores it, and I thought it was a benign kid's film. My husband and I were suspicious about how they got the animal to perform such tasks but assummed they had trained animals to do it all. Recently, my friend told me that the film was filmed in Japan and as many as 30 cats were killed or harmed in the making. It is all starting to make sense now! I wish I could take it back because I feel awful having given my money to a movie that was cruel to animals."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kitten Snuff Film","review":"A deeply troubling film that shows animals, at the very least, in obvious physical distress, and, in all probability, in the midsts of horrific death. According to the American Human Society, it is rumored that as many as 27 cats were killed in the production of this picture in Japan. These are not computer generated special effects; it just wasn't possible to do that in 1986 when this movie was made. The scenes are also just too realistic to have been created any other way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute at times, but the abuse to the animals can't be ignored","review":"It's really hard to say anything bad about the movie because of the cute storyline, and the cute action caught on film of the animals, but CUTE doesn't cut it when you realize the animals are being abused. There aren't any special effects here, the animals are mistreated, and it is shocking.

I rented this movie for my little 2 yr old. We thought it was cute in the beginning with all the little farm animals. UNTIL THE ANIMLAS WERE PLACED IN DANGEROUS SITUATIONS.

It came quickly and in good shape! The story is all animals with the narration by Dudley Moore. It is quite an adventure for these two stars - an orange tabby and a pug. My 2 1/2 year old son adores it and the best thing is that after watching it every day for the past two weeks I want to see it again too!

Most people in my family loved it as well, and what's not to like about a friendship between a cat and a dog?Years later, with an adult perspective, I now see the danger the animals were put in. The claim added to the movie was that the animals were taken care of, but there is never a codicil of 'no animals were harmed, period'. Investigations of animal cruelty turned up cold without any definitive evidence because the Japanese were evasive in their comments. When I was little, I would have given it five stars, but now knowing the dark story and very much possible animal cruelty/deaths behind the film, my conscience will not let me give it any higher than a two."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not enjoy","review":"I am an adult and usually enjoy movies regarding animals.

The scene where the cat was being attacked by gulls. Obvious abuse. Then the cat either jumps off the cliff in fear of his life (as the movie maker wants you to believe). Or the more plausible scenario is that the cat is tossed off the cliff which again is not ok in any way, shape, or form. Oh but they seemed to have \\"lived\\" through the scene huh???

Many kittens died during the filming of this movie, others were injured. Long before the invention of CG, this movie features a kitten being thrown off of a cliff into the ocean and does not show it's survival afterwards.

It was well directed and written. Dudley Moore adds a very interesting element with his narration. I would be interested in seeing the original Japaneese version of this movie.I thought the best part of this movie was the soundtrack. I would almost be willing to sell some minor organs to find out what the songs were, and who wrote them. I know most if not all of them are classical pieces. The main theme song is \\"Of Foreign Lands and People\\" by Robert Schumann. This movie also contains \\"Appalachian Spring\\" by Arron Copland. I have heard it also has Chopin, Debussy, and others.

Watching it now, it seems like it hasn't aged that well to me anyways and I don't mean that it's still a good kids or family movie whichever you want to label this movie as.

It is real, and what are you watching is wholesale animal abuse. See, in real life staged films usually require MULTIPLE takes to \\"get the shot right\\"; perhaps the angles aren't good enough to use, whatever. All throughout, I kept wondering what horrors the crew was doing behind the camera to get the animals to do what they wanted. If you were utterly naive about the ways of the world and viewed this picture with innocent eyes you might find it cute, after all you have dainty music, deceptive editing, and the charming narration of Dudley Moore. That is the magic of post-production. I'm no animal rights fascist, but this is beyond the pale. Misery is so clear and evident upon the faces of the dog and cat.

I finished watching the whole thing to see how bad it would get and while no one knows if animals died or not making the film - they are definitely stressed beyond necessary. The film made me cringe - I was uncomfortable and felt worse for watching it. If you can throw a cat off a cliff into the water, let it get attacked by sea gulls, and let a pug almost die in the snow all to just catch the perfect scene then, yeah, the abuse probably went further. I get and accept that nature can be cruel - but you don't have to add to the cruelty just to make a film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Awful","review":"I bought this for my 4 year olds birthday because i thought it would be cute to see the animals on their adventure since my kids are animal lovers and we live on a farm.

My husband and i thought it was very annoying and all we could think about was how the poor animals were tortured over a 3 year period while making this movie.

Tito had us.

Our toddler tries them on all kinds of paper, but all they leave is a faint trace. We are having a MUCH better result with the free crayons they give away at California Pizza Kitchen: they are equally NON-TOXIC, have GREAT COLORS, and -most important- DO leave a trace on the paper!Unless you kid is 5, frustration-proof, or allowed to draw on the walls, don't waste your money on the Alex crayons, you will regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smells and fragile","review":"I bought these crayons for my son to refine his tripod grasp and to provide a fun new crayon. To my horror, these things have a faint chemical smell. That can't be good. They also are easily broken if you have a rough toddler(26mths) boy such as mine. That said, he loves them.

Moreover, these take a lot of pressure to make marks, and the marks are never as vibrant as other crayons. I think they actually make better stacking toys than crayons, but of course then they have the significant drawback of making marks on everything. They don't break easily, but when they do break the pieces become very difficult to draw with.I would skip these and go for triangular beeswax crayons instead: http://www.amazon.com/dp/B005YWG5VM/ref=wms_ohs_product"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun","review":"These are fun beyond coloring.

It's just that I don't buy him as a country guy who goes to bars, line dances, and rides mechanical bulls. Debra Winger is good and so is the supporting cast, but that's not enough in my opinion. There's the music to consider, too. It's so polished and movie-ish that it has no edge whatsoever. It is the exact kind of country music you would expect some Hollywood moron would think was good.

The Burt Bacharach soundtrack was used for the US export version of the film.The original Italian LP soundtrack release contained 4 new tracks from the film plus \\"Goblin Greatest Hits\\". This release, however, expands on those original 4 tracks with some excellent alternate versions plus unheard compositions. Unfortunately there are some problems with the tapes (noticeable from tape drag in some spots), but still this is a great improvement over the original LP. For Goblin fans most interested in their horror scores like Profondo Rosso and Suspiria, the music definitely takes a different tone in most spots, but still there is some valuable material here (and even one or two tracks similar to their horror sounds)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the actual movie soundtrack","review":"The soundtrack for this movie (which was released in the US as \\"Together\\") was composed + conducted by Burt Bacharach.

I always remembered it very fondly and decided it would make sense to read it as an adult. The story takes place in the 30s in the Deep South and is told through two children: Scout and Jem Fish. Their father, Atticus, is an extremely brave and noble lawyer who has to defend a Black man who is accused of raping a white woman. Harper Lee was awarded a Pulitzer Prize and this is probably one of the most famous and most loved American classics. I enjoyed it very much but I have to admit that it is now feels a bit dated. The reader still feels plenty of outrage at the way the Blacks were treated and admiration for the many lessons Atticus tries to teach his children. However, for me at least, it lost a just a bit of its emotional charge as history has moved on."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic!","review":"I saw the movie, starring Gregory Peck, years ago and many times after, and was curious as to the book that started it all.

However, this did not work for me at all as a shampoo ... and I normally love Aubrey products. In short, over the course of two weeks of using this product, my hair became increasingly oily, clumpy, and dirty looking ... ick. Maybe it's my own fault for not initially checking the ingredients: At least five of the 14 ingredients are oils. No kidding, oils. I agree with the other reviewer that reported that this makes hair feel crunchy, while in contrast, Aubrey's conditioner is awesome. For now I have returned to using my good-old shampoo (with sulfates) and will use up this Aubrey shampoo by applying to only the ends of my hair, like a follow-up conditioning rinse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Will be buying again!","review":"I only subtracted one star because it is a little runny, but otherwise it smells wonderful and I really like how my hair feels.

I don't know why it is so drying. Our hair (especially my daughter's hair) was dry as straw. thank goodness for the Protein conditioner.....it worked just OK for me, but for my daughter - ugh. I can only say for my hair it is not good at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so much","review":"I am a Caucasian female with somewhat dry, unruly hair. I normally use Biocleanse shampoo and conditioner but became troubled by some of the ingredients in the Biocleanse product. I opted for the Aubrey Organics on a whim and was fairly disappointed.

Don't buy this product if you have dry hair or use thermal appliances like a hair straightener."},{"rating":"2","title":"worked great","review":"I used this along with the honey suckle conditioner and together they make a great team, the shampoo didn't leave my hair with the usual slickness from typical shampoos which I loved but it wasn't overly dry either. don't expect a huge later like traditional shampoo that pulls all the natural oil out but a nice gentle lather with a great cleanse, I highly recommend this line for anyone with long, dry and easy to tangle hair"},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Shampoo","review":"A while back I decided it would be smart to move over to an organic shampoo that didn't have harmful ingredients such as Sodium Lauryl Sulfate in it. This is the company that was recommended to me and I just picked out the green tea one at the store. After going through three bottles of it I've decided it's easily the best shampoo I've used. My scalp is healthier, I have less dandruff, it does a great job of moisturizing my hair, and I'm not slowly poisoning my body. It's an oily shampoo, which I prefer because it is easier to wash out thoroughly even though I have extremely thick hair. The smell is a neutral clean smell that isn't overpowering. I always feel clean and refreshed after using this shampoo. I definitely recommend this to anyone wanting to try a more healthy and natural shampoo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dry, Dry, and Dry!","review":"This shampoo did a number on my hair!

I detangled before hand with a cheapie condiotioner just for this reason and this product was so drying that I'd rather use dish detergent before using this again.I will be exchanging it for anything other than this.Big suprise coming from a brand that I heart the twin of (conditioner) so much. It leads me to believe that for textured hair as is mine its a no go. My hair is itchy and scratchy as I type. UGH!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent natural hair shampoo","review":"I've used this natural shampoo off and on for about two years now and I like it. It seems to do the trick of getting my oily hair fairly clean.However it works best only when you use it with the green tea rinse. Otherwise, it feels like your hair is not completely clean. The green tea shampoo is very thick, and I guess some of it clings on to the hair shafts and refuses to come off until you use the green tea rinse or a good regular shampoo.The only major problem is that the green tea rinse is the consistency of water and you need a fair bit of the rinse to completely rinse out your hair. As you can see, this leads to the rinse running out very quickly (think monthly) and the stuff is not cheap either. So, as a result, I don't use this shampoo very much due to the high costs of use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I had high expectation for this product, but it just didn't live up to my standards. The shampoo smelled A LOT like \\"Scrubbing Bubbles,\\" yes, the well-known bathroom cleaning product. The shampoo is runny. It lathers, but very well. Cleaning wise, it strips my hair clean to the point it felt excessively dry. The conditioner helped combat the dryness of the shampoo, but it's not an exceptional conditioner. It does the job as conditioner, but it's not the best conditioner out there. I typically will leave in the shampoo just a little longer than usual for a more reasonable result. Overall, I'm giving this product a one star because I don't feel like it fully served its purpose for helping dry damage hair. I experienced dryness, fall-outs, and increase split-ends."},{"rating":"1","title":"No lather, doesn't work","review":"This stuff doesn't lather well at all and my scalp did not feel clean. To be fair, I've found that with other organic shampoos too. Their conditioner is very very good but skip the shampoo. The scent is nice."},{"rating":"1","title":"very surprised","review":"I rely on Aubrey Organics Honeysuckle Rose conditioner, so I was shocked with this shampoo.1) It smells NOTHING like the conditioner. I expected differences, but this was just ridiculous. The best way I can describe it is as smelling like my cat's flea bath. Horrible.2) After the first lather my hair felt stripped of any moisture.I can't stress enough how much I adore the Aubrey conditioner of this scent, and other shampoos by them, but this one was a huge miss for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sulfate and Alcohol free was an amazing help for me","review":"I have had trouble with both dandruff and rosacea as I've gotten older, and I came to realize that harsher shampoos aggravated both conditions significantly. Products containing alcohol in particular were my personal trigger.I ordered this based on Amazon reviews and I was not disappointed. It cleans well but gently. It has a pleasant, light floral scent. Most importantly, when I use it I have little to no troble with dandruff and my skin doesn't flare up like it did with other products.For anyone who has never tried a sulfate free shampoo, it is extremely low lathering, it takes some getting used to, but that is normal. I use the conditioner as well, and I like it. My hair is straight, about normal texture and dryness, no special needs like curls.I'm buying a bottle of the Camellia scent to try it but I would recommend this product based on my experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Need to be open minded","review":"If you are trying Aubrey's for the first time, you have to be open minded. It is not like a conventional shampoo. The first day I used it, I was wincing through the whole shampoo and cream rinse experience. The shampoo is thinner than conventional shampoos and doesn't lather like conventional shampoos. The cream rinse is very \\"watery\\" as well. Goes on very differently than conventional conditioners. That being said - my hair comes out great every day. It feels and looks a lot healthier and when I style it, it doesn't look flat by mid afternoon. It looks great all day. I feel good recommending this product...not only is it all natural and free of harsh chemicals, but I feel it works very well to keep hair healthy."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK product, takes time to get used to","review":"This is not a \\"normal\\" shampoo, at least in my opinion. It has an oil-like consistency, in a clear, green-tea color. It's hard to hold it in the palms and work up the lather. And this shampoo just doesn't lather well. I really have to add water little by little (even though the hair is already wet) and really take the time to work up the lather. And in the process I've got my hair all tangled with the constant rubbing-motion. Not the best thing to do for long thick hair. However, after rinsing, the hair does become noticeably softer. I still need to apply de-tangling product before I can comb through the hair, but the hair seems moisturized, so I guess the product does its job. No fragrance- just a natural, tree-oil-like smell. I've used it about 5 times so far. Will finish the bottle but probably not buy it again or recommend it to anyone with long hair."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not for me","review":"I really wanted to like this line because it is all natural but this line is not for me. I have tried several of aubrey products and it doesn't work well with my hair and neither one of my daughters. We are african americans and maybe this product is not for us. It doesn't moisturize as well as I thought. I am not saying that this product is not for everyone it is just not for me and my family. I won't be trying anything else from Aubrey Organics. I have tried GPB, Poo and Condish, Honeysuckle Rose Poo and Condish, and now the Island Naturals Poo and Condish. None of which works well. I also tried the Blue Green Algae Mask and the Primrose Tangle-Go Hair Conditioner and Detangler, and the White Camellia and Jasmine Shine Conditioner Spray."},{"rating":"1","title":"not good","review":"This shampoo made my hair more oily than other shampoos. I stoped using it and bought a different shampoo which is working much better than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Left me disappointed","review":"Usually my hair seems to love organic shampoos, but not with this one. My hair was the exact type that the shampoo was made for, and after the first usage my hair felt greasy, stringy, had a ton of fly aways and looked as if I hadn't washed it in several weeks. I gave it two more tries, both to disappointment, before I gave up on it.Warning to anyone with fine and straight, dull hair - choose a different organic product. The one I was using before Aubrey Organics was Kiss My Face's Big Body Shampoo, which was incredible. It also lasts longer, is easier to find in stores, and is cheaper."},{"rating":"1","title":"WATERY","review":"You will have to use more then regular shampoo, because this one is very watery. Although the shampoo works great, the company should make it thicker to stay on your head when appling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible fragrance and doesn't do a thing for my hair","review":"I had high hopes for this shampoo. I used it for the first time yesterday after swimming. It does not lather. It has a strong sweet fragrance which stayed with my hair hours after using it, making me queasy and making me sneeze. It did not seem to help my hair at all; rather, my hair was dry and dull. I have very healthy shiny hair, so I can only conclude that this shampoo is not good for my hair. I won't be using it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"itchy - didn't like it","review":"IMHO the more I used it, the worse my hair got. My sculp itched, my hair was hay-dry on the first day and lumpy and dull on the second. I didn't like the smell either. It's very retro - that's the only way I can describe it. Not at all sentual. Now it's my dog's shampoo. He doesn't mind. In fact, I think he likes it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best chlorine removal shampoo","review":"I bought this to use on two of my kids hair that are competitive swimmers.

This novel reads as though it were written in a single sitting, without revision, as French menus and plot twists flew into the author's mind. Except for one ghastly and characteristically Gallic murder, the book is strangely flat. The characters of stomach doctor Emile Bastien and the Gestapo officer he treats have some depth; everyone else serves as a backdrop. If you want to read an authentic novel set in France during the Nazi occupation, read anything by Kay Boyle. She was there. J. Robert Janes' current detective series set in Paris under the Vichy government is also far superior to this overrated book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much better reprint available","review":"Very much of a disappointment.

From then on he was a close aide to Grant. One of the more interesting missions he undertook on Grant's behalf was to travel to Atlanta to visit with Sherman about possible future actions. His notes are detailed and reveal a great many of the details of Grant's life and behavior bot under fire and when in a relaxed more personal setting.

I am allergic to some fragrances so was pleased with Enjoli. Most perfumes were out of my price range so Enjoli selling at a reasonable price was a godsend.

It was one of the best courses I took a in college and got an A too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay, but poor discussion","review":"I used this book for an engineering mechanics course. I still have it. I decided to keep it instead of sell it. The book is very well illustrated and full of problems with the answers in the back of the book. The discussions are brief and poorly developed. They do not facilitate an intuitive understanding of the subject material. The author seems to believe you will develop theoretical understanding by working problems. Alas, the approach will probably result in a good grade but not in a solid understanding. If you are an atypical sudent genuinely searching for subject mastery, this book is of marginal value. Its value is largley in the illustrations alone. I have found that having multiple books on the same subject is often the best learning approach. Since one author may cover one subject well and fall short where another shines."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Great","review":"This book is not very helpful for the course I am taking. It doesn't do a great job of explaining subjects, although some of the examples are informative.

As such, the text is distorted and highly annoying to read. It is also printed in HUGE letters and there is absolutely no margin to write notes in.

You had to feel sorry for him. And Melanie, way to go!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Prompt shipment","review":"I still haven't had time to watch the video to comment about the quality, but it was shipped promptly and seems to be in good order."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not what I expected.","review":"It was about 8 years ago at least when I first seen this film. At that time I was young and I couldn't remember it, but I just bought it the other day. I watched it, and it was totally different from what I expected. I could only remember this film being very nasty and the villain (played by the excellent Michael Keaton) to be more scarier. Even though the film wasn't what I expected it was still good. Many people hate Michael Keaton's character in this, I can see why, but the character I more hate in this is Matthew Modine's. His character always treats Keaton's very badly in it, and he never treats him nice in it. The ending is quite tense (it was the only part I remember from when I saw it 8 years ago), a bity predictable, but it was good. The film can also try to be funny in places, it can be too.So, you might not expect such a psychological thriller that much in this, but it does reach a point in the film where it does become psychological as it nears the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"I love this movie. I first bought it when it came out in VCR tape. Had to get it on a DVD. First -rate acting, especially Michael Keaton. Everyone who is considering buying property to rent should see this movie FiRST!

In fact, California has lawed themselves into backruptcy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chilling.","review":"Pacific Heights is a story about obsession and violence. Michael Keaton has never been creepier than this movie, his performance was the highlight of his career. Matthew Modine and Melanie Griffith are good as well, they play a couple who become terrified of their new tentant. This film is oldie but goodie, don't watch it alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great movies, but I've seen better quality","review":"I just got this dvd set with the Bob Hope Tribute Collection \\"The road show series\\" and have to say I am pretty disappointed with the quality.

I already own a dvd with \\"My Favorite Brunette\\" and \\"Road to Bali\\"Road to Bali/My Favorite Brunette. I bought this set thinking the quality would be much better then the version I owned and boy was I wrong! First chance I get I'm buying the single version of \\"Road to Rio\\".

The color in \\"Road to Bali\\" is stunning...a few of the \\"big time\\" DVD companies would be wise to take a lesson from Brentwood.The black and white \\"Road to Rio\\" is well done, though not quite as perfect as the color \\"Bali\\" (\\"Bali\\" was the only color movie made in the \\"Road\\" series). \\"Road to Rio\\" is transferred from a UCLA Archive edition of the movie. The sound needs to be turned up a little on this one...but that could be the result of the age of the movie and nothing more.All in all, a wonderful addition to anyone's classic movie collection. No extras (outside of a Hope biography) and limited chapter marking...but it really doesn't matter.Universal DVD.....are you paying attention? This is how to issue a DVD! No skips, no grain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pre War Paris with Beaton Dust Jacket","review":"This attractive book, with its marvelous Beaton-illustrated jacket, captures the essence of Paris. The author explains that among world cities, Paris is unique in its ability to embrace modernity without sacrificing its past to it. Its unique alchemy enables creativity and inspiration to flourish in spite of (but not at the expense of) industrialization. The book includes over one hundred photogravure plates of images taken by the leading French photographers of that era."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not soft-at all","review":"Not soft at all, twists up and shrinks horribly when washed (on cold even). Not a good buy even at this price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fair and reasoned representation of gun control debate","review":"One of the most reasonable assemblies of pro-firearms opinions and anecdotes available. I would recommend this to anyone who wishes to make informed decisions with regard to gun control policy, as it contradicts much of what is hyped in the media regarding gun violence and cuts through much of the mythology surrounding guns and criminal behavior. Interviews with average, working people who have defended themselves against violence with a firearm, police officers expressing their desire that citizens become more proactive in fighting crime and self-defense, and with gang-bangers who describe how they choose their marks and what their decision-making process would have been had they known their intended target was armed are thought-provoking, even for the most rabid gun-control proponent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good!","review":"Larry knows how to weave a story.

An excellent defense of the second amendment and another counter to Michael Moore's sensationalist nonsense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truth Prevails","review":"Loved the video. I'm a regular talk radio listener of Larry, so I knew what to expect. The movie presents facts about guns and gun users that would probably surprise the passionate anti-gun liberal. The difference is very clear cut between the two film makers...Michael Moore's so called documentary was scripted, edited to change facts and presented incorrect information. I saw Moore interviewed where he laughed at his false information saying he was an entertainer, not a journalist. Whether you agree with Mr. Elder or not, at least he presents the facts. How rare these days!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Michael & Me","review":"Refreshing and informative! Nice to see something factual that also entertains for a change."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uneventful","review":"I watched this movie in an attempt to keep a balanced perspective of both liberal and conservative views. I wasn't convinced. Though Mr. Elder manages to bring in valid arguments, they are not delivered with a powerful punch. Instead, the viewer is left listening to mostly \\"opinions.\\" The arguments, in case you're interested, are that statistics do not indicate that lawful gun owners commit numerous crimes, gun control laws do not reduce crime, and people might just need guns someday to defend themselves against their own government. I would have loved to have seen this latter point explored in depth (i.e., as to why this should be a genuine concern of citizens). As mentioned, however, the arguments are overshadowed by the endless droning of beliefs, as opposed to facts."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Twenty First Century or the Wild Wild West?","review":"Michael Moore answered the one basic question: \\"You tell us how many gun deaths there are in America, but how many Americans are alive because they were able to use a gun for self-defense?\\" by responding in the Bush Administration fashion by not saying anything. Moore concluded that America has \\"too many guns\\", but put it into the correct context. Do you really need to carry an automatic weapon with you whenever you leave your home? Your answer would probably be a definite yes if you lived in New Orleans during the aftermath of Katrina under the threat of violence from gangs that raped, robbed, and burned, but what about the rest of America? If you answered yes under normal circumstances, maybe it's time to get our Administration to beef up our Homeland Security with some competent officials."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plain wrong","review":"This film claims to be an unbiased look at gun control, but I would not be suprised if it has some sort of NRA funding backing it somewhere. In the end, it is just as loaded and biased as the filmmaker alluded to in the title. It is a response to \\"Bowling for Columbine\\" that feels more like damage control. It is permeated by the stench of the same old argument, \\"guns don't kill people, people do.\\" Well, they sure do make it easier, don't they! The director of this documentary has a very obvious agenda. After the shooting at Virginia Tech, and with all the violence in our society, it is really irresponsible not to at leat ponder the idea of some sort of restricitons on gun ownership. There are people out there, however, that will not change their minds. For those that are unwilling to consider any reasonable arguements, then I suppose this is the film for you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Boring!!","review":"The title attacks Michael Moore (Whom I believe is a bad film maker as well) But does a poor job of why he thinks Michale is wrong. Incredibly boring - same old rhetoric about how guns don't kill people, people kill people - blah, blah, blah.Is one pathetic attempt to discredit Moore, Elder shows a clip of Moore stating how guns kill an untold number of children in this country...then show a stupid statistic stating that more 10 year olds die from bathtub accidents then gunfire. Hello? Larry...increase that age by another 10 years and see how many of our children are killed by gunfire.Really bad"},{"rating":"1","title":"An ok documentary with flawed logic","review":"Michael and me is an ok documentary with flawed logic by some of the interviewees. Take Jane Doe who seems to blame the government's 10 days waiting period for her rape. Instead she should blame the rapist or fate.Also Elder looses respect when he attacks Moore. Instead he should've focuses on gun control instead of throwing mud."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Film Without Merit","review":"If I ever wanted to see a so called documentary driven by ideology other than facts - this would be it! There is no substantive argument here in favor of America's gun culture...just the same tired (and immature) arguments about the 2nd amendment. As if the world hasn't changed in the last 200 years or so. The more guns in circulation in the hands of our not so stellar citizenry, means the more preventable carnage and gun deaths that happen. That fact is indisputable in spite of Larry's propaganda. No, if you're looking for something thoughtful in this film, forget it. Save your money and spend it on a cheap meal instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical.","review":"Attack the messanger instead of addressing the issue. Neither original nor creative, what we have here is a rip-off of Moore to trash Moore.If Elder had bothered to pay attention to Bowling, he would have understood that it is not the number of guns which is central to the issue, it is the constant feelings of fear and anxiety that is played up by government and greedy corporations."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must see for 2nd amendment supporters","review":"This is a documentary based on facts and interviews with experts. He interviews people (on both sides of gun control) and shows how misinformed most people really are. There are some mispellings and technical bloopers in the CD, but hey, Larry Elder mortgaged his house to produce this film. All gun owners should buy it.The reviewers who trashed this here on Amazon were predictable. I'll bet they didn't even watch it. These guys are panty-wearing liberals who drive Volvos with 'Kerry for President\\" bumper stickers on them.

I appreciated the fact that the authors did not \\"talk down\\" to the reader (me). A must-read for anyone wanting to/needing to clear out clutter and downsize. I enjoyed it so much when I checked it out of the local library, I ordered five copies from Amazon - one for myself and the others to give away to several friends who are considering downsizing. And, I received my order from Amazon in a very short time. I am more than pleased all the way around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well done.","review":"This book does the job and does it well. The authors' experience is evident throughout. Written clearly and efficiently, the book has many practical suggestions about all aspects of downsizing.

I turned on the CD playera, and listened for an entire afternoon to some of the best music to ever be recorded.

The only pitfall is that most of devout Parrotheads already have the songs that are included in this set. Just how many times is Jimmy going to include \\"Cheeseburger In Paradise\\" on an album? The song is on two of his live albums and nearly every 'Hits' package he's put out. Most Parrotheads will be happy with the live versions of \\"Holiday\\", \\"The Pascagoula Run\\", and \\"Son Of A Son Of A Sailor\\", but nearly everything else is previously released material. A better deal would be to buy the MCA boxed set - \\"Beaches, Boats, Bars, and Ballads\\". Mr. Buffett should be putting out completely new albums, and leaving the compilations for his retirement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jimmy does it again!","review":"I picked up this cd the day it came out. In fact, I left school early to pick it up at the local Best Buy :) I popped it in and was met with the anthem, Margaritaville. Moving down the songs on the first disc there are a lot of the usuals and some lesser known songs (AKA the ones not on songs you know my heart) such as Migration, Pascagoula Run (live - sounds great) for instance. The 2nd disc is hot with such songs as School Boy Heart, Knees of my Heart, Desperation Samba (love this song), and the beach boys cover - Sail on Sailor.Overall this disc is great and is the ultimate collection, if there is such a thing. This would be a GREAT gift for those that are not familiar with the music of Jimmy Buffett and the Coral Reefers.oh yeah, the sound is amazing on these cds. You can hear every instrument with clarity.... except for the annoying accoustic guitar in some live tracks, this cd sounds AMAZING"},{"rating":"1","title":"It had some scratches when it was 100%","review":"It had scratches all over it but it still played.

As a musician--yet not per se a 'purist'--who enjoys good quality classical music, this CD is highly recommended to anyone who enjoys the majestic quality of trumpet and orchestra together. It is a CD I would have no hesitation in giving to anyone as a gift, classical music officionado on not. I would give it a 6-star rating out of five if it were possible to do so!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good, except for the Brandenburg","review":"Wynton definitely plays these pieces with a modern touch, and this recording could never be construed for a period performance. For mot of the performances Wynton may plays beautifully, and his modern style is mostly a matter of taste.The Brandenberg concerto, however, is a different story. This recording is simply ridiculous. The overpowering trumpet playing is completely wrong to the extent that it is no better than missing notes. Ironically, the trumpet part is emphasized to show off Wynton's playing, but part of the difficulty of the Brandenburg concerto is being about to play the high notes softly and balancing with the rest of the ensemble.Overall, the balance in the Brandenburg concerto is so terrible it's hard to give this album more than 2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Wynton's Finest Hour","review":"Wynton's Classical recordings are a mixed bag, and this is at the bottom. While his recording of the Tomasi and Jolivet concertos is one of the best trumpet solo recordings ever released, this collection of Baroque favorites finds Marsalis' usually beautiful tone now strident and too prominently featured. He's not a team player in the Brandenburg and spends the rest of the disc overblowing and overornamenting what should be beautiful Baroque repertoire. Check out the Tomasi/Jolivet or \\"On the Twentieth Century,\\" but leave this one on the shelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality Solo Spice Girl","review":"This double single is one of the best singles I owned...\\"Yeh yeh yeh\\" is a fresh, rock, danceable song while \\"Melt\\" is one of the most calm, beautiful and lovely song I ever heard...Too bad that Melanie C doesnt care for promoting this jewels...People should give a chance to a Spice Girl in solo...

His model of the universe is essentially that of the Theosophists or other metaphysical groups. Unlike some more popular books on similar subjects, he actually has some new material. Unfortunately, the editing job is terrible and the book is choppy and repetitive. For example, he describes the properties of water treated by a \\"healer.\\" This is excellent.

The idea that you can take photographs that are astonishing for their sheer size and scale (their whole raison d'etre) and then publishing them in a book smaller than a regular A5 hardback is utterly absurd, presenting them with a fold in nearly every picture and losing any possible sense of scale.

In addition, to use this book to learn stochastic processes puts you through a whole lot more trouble than you'll probably need. Each deduction in the book is long, boring, and hard. Since I've read other books which are not, I'm going to assume it's the fault of the authors and their lack of LaTeX.This book, not unlike quite a few in probability and statistics (e.g. Billingsley), is popular because old professors used it and don't bother to find a new one."},{"rating":"2","title":"fast service","review":"It was fast service and shipping was reasonable.

This movie made us look like a bunch of rejects from Norway, I was very insulted to say the least. Sadly it wasn't even made in Minnesota, it was made in Canada where they say \\"Aay?\\" alot. Since I moved out to western MN, I have picked up saying \\"Heh?\\" (the Canadian Aay habit), but I don't say \\"Ya know? or \\"You betcha!\\" I guess you could say this is a sore spot for me, I just find it so annoying, wasn't Fargo enough?

It was a glimpse into \\"life in a northern town\\".As for the stereotypes? ha I grew up in the north and have recently returned to the north -and while there were a couple of over-done instances, the stereotypes really are true. For me, that's what made several parts of the movie laugh-out-loud moments. They may be stereotypes, but they're true!I really liked Renee Zellweger in this movie, as well as the other actors/actresses. It was well-cast.

While the predictability was mildly annoying, the attempt at a Minnesotan accent was pure comedy. I've lived in Minnesota for many years, and I can honestly say that I have never, ever heard ANYONE talk like that. I suppose it's meant to be a spoof, but it became very annoying after the first few lines. I think THAT is maybe the main reason I left the room. Anyways, it's a cute movie at least.

What I admire most about the film is that they shot it in Winnipeg, Canada in bitterly cold weather. And for that reason alone the film deserves four stars.

Going North is a decided shock to her and she is amused at the locals who enjoy ice fishing, scrapbooking, and tapioca. Harry Connick Jr. plays the head of the plant's labor union and, predictably, he and Zellweger clash. Siobhan Fallon Hogan is wonderful as Zellweger's secretary and she catches the Minnesota accent and attitude perfectly, while giving respect to the humanity of the character.

I will attempt to get satisfaction from the seller, but caution anyone purchasing from this vendor."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Emotional Journey into the Economic Tsunami","review":"A light romantic comedy, it tugs at the emotions while pulling very familiar - and sad - elements of this era of the national economic tsunami that has swept away Main Street in many settings and often in very heartless ways.Renee Zellweger portrays a Miami businesswoman who is assigned to lay off at least half the employees in a Minnesota factory. Harry Connick Jr. is the union representative who is the last line of defense in this tragic game of dollars and cents, which juxtaposes the ways and means of the big-city with small-town life.Winter turns to spring in a neat little 96-minute journey that has a typical formula for the genre, but is set on a roller coaster of reality that most can truly appreciate."},{"rating":"1","title":"RUN! DON'T WALK","review":"This was beneath the talent of Harry Connick, Jr. and Renee Zellweger. Poor script, contrite story, non dimensional characters. There were only three scenes that I can say were genuinely funny. Other than that it was predictable and incomplete in plot and story line.You find yourself wondering \\"where did that come from?\\" There is a lack of character development that is frustrating.

New in Town's timely premise and winning leads are no match for the film's weather-beaten, cliched script, which tries way too hard to be uplifting."},{"rating":"1","title":"BodyLift","review":"I dont think this product is able to do what it promisses.I could not lose my appetite or weight wearing this product as indicated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch Rainbow Notes","review":"This is a single CD with 3 tracks: the opening, ending, and one of the main songs.The songs on this CD include:1.

He was left with a bottle and half of the cage in his hand. The mounting bracket was still mounted to the bike. We pitched the cage and he put the bottle in his back jersey pocket for the rest of the 50 miles, but what a bummer this was. This cage saw light use, too, as he rides a couple of times a week. These cages didn't even get as much use as some on my bike would. Moral of the story, for $7 bucks a piece, buy something that is going to last instead of this.

I emailed pictures to Planet Bike about the broken weld and they sent me a replacement, no questions asked (NICE customer service!).HOWEVER, the replacement cage only lasted 3 months before the weld on that broke at the same spot as the first.The Planet Bike SuperFlash is an incredibly bright taillight (drivers have said it looks like an emergency vehicle light); the Planet Bike fenders are perfect on our tandem; their customer service is painless, but in my experience, this cage doesn't have the metal - where it needs to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Susceptible to bending","review":"The bottle holder worked well enough.

Butch's voice is great. The production is solid. But the melodies are not as strong as in Butch's last 3 great CDs. Some parts of the upbeat melodies are bordering on cornball like some 70's TV music show.\\"Mixtape\\" and \\"Jane\\" are excellent. \\"Maybe It's Just Me\\" is good. But the rest of the songs just don't measure up to the quality music that is classic Butch.Maybe I need a few more spins, but \\"Left Of Self-Centered, \\"Ready Sex Go\\", and \\"Hey Album\\" have more quality songs and blow this decent effort away.

The combination of these three factors make for a wonderful style of story telling music.On this album you will find a few fun songs, a few serious, and others that don't really fall in either category. If you've never heard butch before, this is a great starter album for you.On a side note, Butch Walker has produced and co-written with some of todays top talent including: Avril Lavinge, SR-71, American Hi-fi, Stroke 9, Bowling for soup, The Donnas, GOB, and that is just to name a few.You will not be disapointed with the musical stylings of mr.

Butch has always been at the forefront of Power Pop and this release is no exception. The extremely pretty \\"Mixtape\\" really sets the overall tone of the album, with Butch's powerful vocals at the forefront. \\"Maybe It's Just Me\\" and \\"#1 Summer Jam\\" clip along at an enjoyable toe-tapping pace and \\"Race Cars and Goth Rock\\" is actually a country-flavored twanger."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE BUTCH WALKER","review":"Butch Walker is my HERO!!! =D After I went to the Avril Lavigne concert, I became in love with Butch!!

The talking caller ID is nice, but it does take two rings (or more) before it says anything, so you run the risk of a mad dash before the answering machine picks up after the default 4 rings.

I have only had these diapers leak on literally a couple of occasions and both times I had been wearing them for over 6 hours and had been drinking a lot of ginger ale all day (about 6-12 12 ounce cans) making the leakage problem completely avoidable.

Nonetheless, his research is amazingly indepth and the information presented is crucial. He dismisses popular conspiracy theories and picks apart his topics with logic and razor-sharp critical thinking. This book is great also because he quotes from so many other authors/researchers, and footnotes like you wouldn't believe. So the book serves as an index of many other fascintating books. You owe it to your Country to absorb this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great guide to improve your sleep","review":"Heller's book contains helpful tips for anyone who has trouble sleeping. I've suffered from insomnia for years and found her book extremely helpful. The book packs a lot of information into a quick, easy read. I especially liked the lists such as the ones on how to lessen the effects of jet lag or the 7 essential habits of highly successful sleepers.Heller's book was a vital resource for an article I wrote about sleep titled \\"Wooing the Sandman.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"right stuff, wrong publisher","review":"I haven't had this specific volume in hand, but I happen to own a set of pocket size paperbacks of Lovecraft's worksalso published by Del Rey (and still available). These were poorly edited, and ill printed on crummy paper. Apublisher who gives this kind of treatment to a writer, and puts this kind of low quality product for sale doesn't deserve your money.If you like HPL, or just want to discover his works, do yourself and the publishing industry a favor, get your booksomewhere else, there are some better collections and omnibuses around waiting for you to pick them."},{"rating":"2","title":"magnificent collection of Lovecraft's sweetest visions","review":"During one of my hometown's long, snowed-in winters, my personal discovery of H.P.Lovecraft (I think I'd heard he liked cats or something and decided to check him out) breathed a stellar spell of spiritual fantasy back into the sober statsis of pristine atheism and devotion to mathematical truth where I'd settled. I've since then read everything I know to exist of his work. Dreams of Terror and Death contains all of my favourite Lovecraft tales; coming across this particular selection was how I found out I wasn't alone in having journeyed far out into the infinite vistas of his universe-expanding dreamscape. Lovecraft is far more than just a writer of horror; read this collection through and find yourself enchanted by the beauty and wonder of his timeless vision."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing album, somewhat disappointing reissue","review":"David Crosby's \\"If I Could Only Remember My Name\\" is an excellent, five star album featuring a number of wonderful guests. It is superb and deserves much more recognition that it gets. You can read the other reviews here or on the page of the original album release to hear more about that. What I'm not happy about is getting only ONE bonus track with the remaster. I've heard over a complete CD of different versions and different songs out there from these sessions. Why not release a 2 CD Legacy Edition with that material? They surely have access to it. This is a disappointing move by the label and I can only assume was done so as to not impede sales of the David Crosby box set \\"Voyage\\" released at the same time (which is excellent, by the way). When will we see these extra tracks officially released?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Let The Buyer Beware","review":"The price of the cd alone is $10.99 and if you get the DVD Audio you pay $22.88. When it says an audio DVD it means it as there is not a whit of video on the DVD.

This is David Crosby's finest hour as a \\"solo\\" artist. The new remastered version is remarkably \\"CLEAR\\"!! The new release is worth your investment sonically and for those that have not heard this music previously, just sit back and ENJOY!! You will not be disappointed!! The liner notes & packaging is also much improved compared to the original CD release."},{"rating":"2","title":"Voices soaring.","review":"I found this album in a cut out bin. I took it home and didn't like it. I played it a few more times and really listened. It is now one of my favorites. The vocals just soar and the music is otherworldly. A wonderful collection of players and they are all so very compatible. This album is a true masterpiece. I have heard it said that listening to this album, you can hear David Crosby singlehandidly invent new age music. I would never accuse David of that but he does point it in that direction. In my opinion, a lot of rock music with spacey interludes is just what the doctor ordered. New Age Music is all spacy interludes. David can do that and still keep it interesting. I salute you Mr. Crosby."},{"rating":"2","title":"What's His Name","review":"One of the many remarkable things about this album is that the first voice to be heard on it isn't even Crosby's- -it's Neil Young's. There isn't anything here that would sound out of place on either the CSN debut or- -more especially- - DEJA VU, either. True, it isn't as cohesive as the debut but it's better, and it is certainly stronger overall than DEJA VU or Crosby's own efforts on that album ('Almost Cut My Hair'? Sheesh. 'Deja Vu'? C'mon). It's an album of intentionally questionable identity, from the title through the various characters Crosby plays. It's a very weird album, by turns corny and grating ('Cowboy Movie' sounds like the jam that would turn into Young's 'Down By The River') and lovely and wistful ('Traction In The Rain' teeters beautifully on the Cliffs Of Despair). Et 'Orleons' est dans sa classe propre. Yeah, the album is flawfull. Yeah, it's uneven. Yeah, it has all the usual West Coast friends and suspects all over it. Yeah, I love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"simply beautiful","review":"Listen to the other 30 or so people who have raved about this classic. They're right.

Each show has a moral lesson, well done with a good variety of situations. 1960's style TV shows, black and white. This was good TV, like The Twilight Zone and Andy Griffith Show. Complexity mixed with simplicity, Rifleman is one of the very few TV shows can match the very few that are worth watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rifleman, Boxed Set 1","review":"DVD's are defective.

These dvd'd were a Christmas present and since she didn't get a chance to view them within 30 days of receipt, we're now stuck with a defective product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Content","review":"These are extremely well written shows from a time when television portrayed the good guy as the winner and the bad guy the loser (and usually dead in this series). There are 2 reasons why I cannot give this DVD set 5 stars:1) MPI Home Video is not releasing the episodes in order. Obviously the earlier shows are better so they have decided to pack representative shows from all 5 seasons in Boxed Set 1.2) There are quality control problems with disk 1. At 21 minutes into the episode the picture pixilates then skips to the end of the episode. Amazon sent me out another Set of DVDs and I found a similar problem at the exact same time (though only pixilating not skipping). I was able to repeat this on several DVD players.Negatives aside I still recommend These DVDs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Family fare with a bang","review":"Chuck Connors, Johnny Crawford and the Chuck's rapid-fire long gun are the featured performers of these episodes. I watched this show five days a week when I was a grade-schooler and I'm delighted to find it holds up pretty well. Naturally some episodes are more worthwhile than others (in those days they knocked out thirty episodes or more per year), but overall quality is high for half-hour weekly fare. It's family entertainment that won't bore the not-so-young'uns.Sam Peckinpah created this before moving on to feature films, and he utilized his youth on a California ranch to add realism to the show's atmosphere. Recommended viewing, especially the first couple seasons."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Rifleman","review":"Hi: Most of us 50's and 60's kids love these shows. Especially the Rifleman.

I had only played about 4 games as we had issues getting the number of players together.However, in the short amount of time I had the shoes, the strips on the inside edging of the shoes had already come loose. One would expect this to happy after a full season of wear and tear, but not after 4 short games on fairly smooth grass play. Also, I would like to note the shoes are a nice fit, but can get quite hot inside.Overall, I am not a happy consumer... when combined with the fact another pair of KC shoes ($180) falling apart after 1 month (the sole LITERALLY peeled apart into two), I will never buy any Kenneth Cole apparel again."},{"rating":"2","title":"These shoe are nice!","review":"These shoes are comfortable and light.

I don't remember where I found references to this book but there was a lot of weight attributed to the importance of this title. First off, there are only like twenty pages, it is an incomplete work. The style by which it is written seems like the author wanted this work to resemble and also have a similar gravity as the bible. The theology the book is based on is askew. Getting back to the value in terms of a conspiracy, the land described by the work is a land of law, hospitality invention and Christianity. Reading this work only does not constitute or reveal any great scheme for the future of America. If anything, it is to late for this book's vision to be realized."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm glad I read it, more or less","review":"Hmm, this is interesting. Despite the convoluted prose I was able to plow through this in a couple days (it's less than 50 pages long). The cover and all looks cheap on this edition but it's the content that counts, and the content is interesting. NEW ATLANTIS posits an alternate history for America and is intended to supply an example of a Utopian, scientifically overachieving society. It's an interesting look at the philosophy, symbolically expressed, of a man considered a great \\"rational\\" philosopher. Not bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent edition","review":"The significance of this book speaks for itself to the knowledgeable reader. This edition , in hardcover, is the one I am glad I purchased. The Foreword is very informative and the appendix is useful with respect to an issue related to pagination in the contemporary edition. The typestyle which appears to be some sort of typewriter Courier font detracts and gives it a \\"term paper\\" feel. In this age of web publishing, there is no excuse for not using a more pleasant, and professional looking font. Nevertheless, overall an excellent version for the serious student."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh!","review":"I know this is a classic, but, oh my, it was quite a chore to get through. I love other, scholastic works by the esteemed Lord Bacon, but this one was too much for me in it's religiosity, and convoluted story-telling style.

The record is loaded with drive and has that special avante garde sixities flavor that makes the Smithereens so special. Some of the arrangements are more creative than on previous releases. Top Of The Pops and Indigo Blues rock with energy and flair while Evening Dress is one pretty ballad.

She gets caught up in the civil rights movement and gets into trouble for writing in the newspaper articles favorable to the civil rights movement. It could have been a decent movie, but I found the acting and the dialogue so superficial and uninvolving and unconvincing.

When I looked at other biology text books for self-study, many seemed padded with extraneous material and gimmicks. Worse, these texts talked down to the reader. \\"Biological Sciences\\" is not chatty in a forced attempt to be 'relevant' but instead makes demands on the reader without being willfully obscure. Even better, the pages are not full of fashionable white space, but packed with text. The only caveat I have is that since 1996, surely many developments have cropped up since this last edition.

And I cherish every moment of Quentin Crisp on the screen. I would be entranced just watching him read the phone book. And I would much rather watch this than any of the hundreds of insipid, coming out films that have flooded the market in recent years. Films like this remind us that queer culture had it's genesis in the underground, where it grew into a rare and fabulous flower. It seems now that everyone wants to get married, adopt babies, and live tastefully in the suburbs. It's like they're saying, \\"You can accept us now.

Fond memories led me to find the Pippi Longstocking films for a younger daughter for a recent birthday. I am very disappointed in the videos I got. My older girls must have watched another version. These films are filmed in Finnish? and dubbed in English. The dubbing is poor. In fact, the acting is poor too.

The first segment is of a dog herding cattle, except the film is so old and grainy it reminded me of the old Lorne Greene animal documentaries he used to narrate. My daughter got bored and crawled away. So I skipped to the next song which wasn't as bad, so she sat and watched it happily.

Although it is by all means an excellent fieldguide I do have some remarks. A number of the plates contained errors, suggesting the artists didn't see these birds in the field. I realise it is virtually impossible for artists to see all species featured in a book such as this in the field, so that a lot of plates are drawn from skins. It is important however to use skins from the region itself, this may make a lot of difference. We came to the conclusion that for a number of species skins from west Africa were used. Especially the greenbuls had some misleading plates. For a number of species the Kenyan Zimmerman-book is probably better, although those plates lack in other respects.In addition a number of the maps were incorrect, especially for Uganda.Still, if you go to the region for birding, make sure to get this book, because it is definitely the best field guide around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Have guide book, will travel","review":"This guide has the best illustrations of the 20+ bird guides I own.

A little heavy for the field, but contains only the essential material: species accounts and range maps on the left page, illustrations on the right.

They were totally manic onstage, looking like 5 guys on too much caffine -- the show was so bad that at the end, people seemed to be cheering BECAUSE it was over. The vocalist was so obese that most people thought a clown suit would have been more appropriate than the tight fitting outfit he had on. The bassist was appropriately dressed in black -- the band died in concert. Everyone else seemed to be out of place as well.The CD reveals what's wrong: competent instrumental playing, but no real songs. The vocalist sounds like he has a sore throat, and most of it sounds like it was hastily written for a high-school 'battle of the bands'.Since this is farce, once is enough. Repetition only wears out the welcome and drain the humor from the farce."},{"rating":"1","title":"one of the most over rated bands","review":"In life there are many things people dont like to admit. For instance, the fact that root beer tastes like toothpaste. Not that that is a bad thing. But I digress.

Sure in their previous CDs they were a little repetitive too, but the difference is...the songs were actually GOOD. I think theres like a 20 second breakdown in These Are A Few Of My Favorite Things that is worthwhile, but it just blew my mind how boring these guys could actually be. I always had a Respect for DBS, but with this CD it just killed it. The intensity of this CD compared to other DBS CDs also went down the tube, and it sounds like Ephram and company just gave up. Other people are going to rate this much higher just because its death by stereo, but if you judge music by sound rather than band reputation you'll be just as upset with this CD as I am. If your into meaningless rehash, this CD is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sauces and gravies","review":"my gravies have never been smoother, and are not scorching on the bottom of the pan anymore.

The entire point of Skinny Puppy's music is to be unique and nihilistic and definately contrary to the simplistic, predictable and uninspiring mainstream attempt at musical artistry such as sellout travesties like Aerosmith or Falco. Lets get real. Ministry's 'Land of Rape and Honey' wasn't meant to appeal to the same crowd as the thumb-sucking, adolescent Goo-Goo Doll fans, and do you really think Einsturzende Neubauten is supposed to sound like the Scorpions? Dude, lets have your sarge throw YOUR music into the latrine. By the way, VivisectVI and Land of Rape and Honey were released in 1988 NOT 1998. Get your inacuracies straight!

During a break, where I went back to the Air Base in Turkey/ I was able to buy a few tapes at the PX.Among the tapes were two of the worst pieces of music I've ever had the agony to hear. One was Primus \\"Sailing the Seas of Cheese\\" and the other was this sad excuse for music. I couldn't give this away to the other soldiers even in a mountainous area [northern Iraq] where we had little entertainment except shortwave radio, some tapes and books.

They unnecessarily blow up part of a monastery, when they could have just surrounded them from several sides and shot them. There were only 4 Andorians!Then Captain Archer betrays the Vulcans, their main alleys, by deliberately giving the Andorians top-secret Vulcan info. If T'pol was really logical, she would have killed all the Andorians as well as her human crewmates on the spot.It's like this show is a parody of human stereotypes from a Vulcan's point of view, it just makes all humans look like idiots...

Well, I'm not too up on interspecies love, I got put in the drunk-tank in Mobile for that once, so I think it's setting a bad example for the kids.I give it two stars because the the special effects are better than the first Star Trek, which don't make sence because this is supposed to take place BEFORE captain Kirk..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snoozefest!","review":"What an incredibly awful & boring piece of TV.

But don't worry Captain Archer is always there to pat them on the back and say \\"I believe in you, you can do it.\\" That type of manure is in almost every episode.

I remember hearing that he was cast in the lead role and I knew instantly it would be bad. I even hate the terrible theme music. BlueRay won't improve this disaster.

Enterprise Season One maybe the best first season of any of the Trek series. There are a couple definite poor shows, but \\"Broken Bow\\" is easily the best kick-off episode in Trek. \\"Breaking the Ice\\" is excellent. The story-line about the temporal cold war is fantastic, and I am glad that there are no cute characters. Phlox is eccentric at times but never annoying.Why this show did not make it is a mystery, but it certainly did not suffer due to quality. At the end of the day, it stands with TNG, DS9, VOY and TOS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blu-Ray now please!","review":"Trekkies everywhere, lets unite and add this title to our Amazon email alerts and wish lists and get the message out that we want to see this series on Blu-Ray!

I suppose it had to happen after continuously cycling through the 4 seasons repeatedly. However, this is the one Star Trek than I can watch over and over again.Sci-fi is showing it but not in HD. I suppose I will have to resort to that. I refuse to buy the DVD version, holding out for the Blu Ray. What's the hold up?? As previously stated by others, this one would be so EASY.

UP for a bit longer. When the first year started, I lived in virgina, or cable could get the first network it was on. Then halfway though the first season we moved. To Nevada, alas the the \\"Enterpise\\" network was not on there line-up. Wacthing reruns, they seem to show the same ones over again and again. So I found them on Amazon. Still waiting for them, to come done in price! When my wait was over I found season 1 in Walmart, for $19.95! Not the $50.99 they have it listed for here. So excuse me as I go wacth more. The first disk played fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Start Trek in my opinion","review":"If you liked Captain Picard, you will love Scott Bakula (Captain Archer). He is not afraid of taking the tuff decisions. Can't wait to buy Seasson 3 (when aliens tried to destroy the Earth and Captain Archer goes through the entire season trying to stop them). If you haven't watch Enterprise at all, believe me... the stories are much compelling than previous Star Trek and you won't be able to stop watching episode after episode."},{"rating":"2","title":"More Waiting - $84 Per Season???","review":"OK, I was smart enough to wait to buy the original DVD Enterprise sets at pawn shops for about $25 each. I enjoyed the series a LOT, and even my wife liked them. So the years go by, and I convert my entire DVD collection to Blu Ray, and wait for the Star Trek stuff to come out. Finally TOS comes out on Blu Ray, and I bought them 1 season at a time. Woops...then they release all 3 for much less. Fool me once.So when I see Enterprise FINALLY coming out on Blu Ray for a whopping $84, I jumped at it, then had second thoughts. $84?? Really? I've never paid that much for ANY Blu Ray series...EVER. Why is this one different? I don't know, but I do know that I will not buy them individually. I'll wait for the complete series.

It had no sense of awe, no sense of humor, no original stories, and a wasted premise. Plus, Scott Bakula is without a doubt the worst starship captain ever, a one-note character played by a bland, boring actor. If you want good Trek, look to Star Trek Voyager instead. If you want great sci-fi, wait for Battlestar Galactica (the new series) to come out on DVD.

Sadened by the ending of both, I was looking forward to this new entrant to the Star Tek family.Where do I start? Bad scripts, apalling casting and the theme music summed up a \\"cowboy western\\" meets \\"miami vice\\" shocker that lost me the moment it premiered. Scott Bukula wins the award for the worst Star Ship Captain....EVER. I felt as if TV execs had created this as a bad joke on their audience.Take note those people who gave this a good review, this series was canned after its 4th (a difficult thing to do considering those of us who found the pace of DS9 unbearable). This came as no suprise to those who were fans and those who weren't.Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Series","review":"I watched TNG, DS9, and VOY when they were on television but I never watch Enterprise. Once I saw Star Trek was added to Prime I decided to try it out so I could see the shows again. I just finished watching the entire series of Enterprise. I really enjoyed watching it, it brought back memories of the other ST series. I thought this series was a little different than the rest though. This series seems to have more suspense in the episodes and less of the Federation ideals-- since this supposedly takes place before the Federation is formed and before the other series then it portrays it well. The last season of the series I thought was lacking and didn't end how I would've hoped but I still thought it was worth watching and overall liked it.

And like many, I was VERY skeptical about new shows trying to pretend to be Star Trek. But, THANK GOODNESS I saw the light. I loved STTNG, DS9 and Voyager....but I was even more skeptical about a show that went back BEFORE the Original series. But, I watched and I was blown away. I didn't know what they would do without shields and holodecks, but oh boy the frontier was wide open for exploration and invention...and this excellent crew has done it. We see them making a mess of first contacts and the beginings of the evolution of the Federation and Star Fleet. It is a travesty that the show is not allowed to go the full 7 years. I don't want to hear any malarkey about ratings...Voyager is arguably the weakest of all Trek shows and it managed to hold on and Enterprise blows it out of the water. Anyway, I cannot wait to relieve the show again on DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enterprise boldly goes..........","review":"Enterprise boldly, and proudly, actually goes where Star Trek's never gone before. The world changes, and Star Trek Enterprise just follows those changes in the human conditions and reflects them in it's storytelling, it wouldn't be Star Trek if it didn't.Enterprise is, IMO, the proud carrier of a brightly shining torch handed down by it's predessors, the immortal legends of TOS, TNG DS9 and Voyager. Enterprise proudly keeps that legendary fire with a storytelling, most often, beyond the possible for a series with so many offsprings.This DVD release marks the beginning of an era of us being able to own the finest TV series of the 21th century. Enterprise, one to beam up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good DVD set!","review":"I've seen all the Star Trek shows from start to finish. After purchasing Star Trek Enterprise season 1, I have gained way more respect for this series. Most of the Star Trek shows ( TNG, DS9, and Voyager ) all started slow in the first couple of seasons, and didn't really become good until the 3 & 4th season, but enterprise is really quite good in the first season, \\"right off the bat\\".I had forgotten how good the first season really was, until I watched it over again with this boxed set. I think the fourth season has been great, and I am sorry that the show has been cancelled, it could have easily gone another season.The DVD set is the best one out of all the others in the Star Trek universe, done in 16X9 anamorphic 5.1 DD. So if you have a Hi_Def widescreen TV, the show looks exceptional for a TV show.

The only Trek series filmed in HD, it is beautiful and as the series went on, it just continued to get better by leaps and bounds. The Xindi season (season 3) was incredibly suspenseful with just enough light-heartedness to provide relief.

It's a typical Star Trek, which means the bean counter morons in TV once again kill off the only TV programming worth watching. Thank god for DVD.I have to say too that the theme song was better in the first season. The slower pacing and tempo allowed the show's premise to settle into the mind. Unlike many Trek fans, this long time Trek fan thoroughly enjoyed Warren/Watson's theme tune. It was a perfect change that fit the show's distinction as a prequel to all the rest. Fans who dislike it simply are missing the bigger picture and ought to go check their emotional disconnect with a local betazoid counselor.It's a perfect buy.

It might hard to explain some things that go on here that supposedly happend before the first star trek series but besides that it is very good throughtout the first season. The main enemy in the first season is the Suluvond and the temporal cold war.

A quick sampling of a couple of episodes reveals some differences in editing from the versions I faithfully recorded on VHS years ago. 'Desert Crossing' differs in trivial ways, for example. But the DVD is packaged in a style befitting a _Star Trek_ offering, and the added features are entertaining, amusing, even informative. Get a second copy, put it in a vault with the plastic unbroken, and have a worthy relic for your kids. And in case you were worried - yes, it is indeed viewable as 16:9 hi def.

My Trek experiences are severely limited, mostly exposed to the original series and early Next Generation stuff. I'm no expert here. All I'm saying is that with my limited knowledge of the Trek universe, I personally was not disappointed in the least, and will now pre-order this set.

While my title may suggest a disapproval with the sociology of what is known as \\"the sixties\\" (which began in the mid-sixties and lingered into the mid-seventies), that is not my perspective. In fact, one of the aspects of the novel I liked was the author's dispassionate approach to a fascinating era.What ultimately made the novel a failure for me was the lack of direction (loosely chronological) and order for this book. There are about 2 1/2 books in this novel, and it never became clear to me how exactly they related, other than the author's own uninsightful juxtapositions. Too bad.

It reads as a political tract and it often felt as though the author had written an autobiography outlining her own experiences of the 60's. The story didn't flow after the first few chapters; it might as well have been a newspaper report.

The best of the lot is the translation of Ms Pac-Man - very faithful to the original. Galaxian is highly addictive and equally faithful to the original. Most people don't give Dig-Dug the credit it's due - it is very entertaining - even for adults. I rather liked Dig-Dug in the arcades, and this is a good rendition. On the other hand, \\"Phozon\\" and \\"Tower of Druga\\" are very forgettable, \\"Tower\\" the most worthless of the lot. Still well worth buying just for the excellent Ms Pac Man."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Arcade Games","review":"Namco Volume 3 is a well rounded collection of classic arcade favorites. It features Ms. Pacman, DigDug, Galaxian (which became addictive very fast after a few plays.), also..features Pole Position II, Phozen (which I had never heard of till this collection. It's not for everyone.), and last but not least we have..The Tower of Druaga. Obviously the best games are Ms. Pacman, Galaxian, and DigDug which each of these games are worth having individually, so having them all on one disc it's hard to go wrong. But wait there is one slight problem. When you go to the screen that allows you to change the dip switches..when they pop up they cover the menu and you don't know what your changing until you get back to the game, only to realize you have unknowingly changed your amount of lives to 1 and set your bonus on 10000000 or something to that effect. Maybe it's just me but I would have preferred a modern menu instead of the switches. Never~the~less 4 STARS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great collection of Namco games!","review":"Great game! I haven't played the other ones yet, but I really like this one a lot! You get Ms. Pac-Man, Dig-Dug, Galaxian, Phozon, and The Tower of Duraga. Dig-Dug is my favorite out of these and all are fun, but some can get a little boring after a while. The graphics for the psone look great and little to no lag. I really like the theater and the library that is in it too! Overall, I really enjoyed this game and great for people who love arcade games! Can't wait to get the other Volumes some time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A mood game","review":"Doom isn't a game with revolutionary graphics or sound effects.

Just think about it, the demons resemble people we all loathe. Mancubus is the big fat ugly smelly retarded school bully we all love to hate! Cyber Demon and Spider Mastermind are the school principal . The Baron of Hell is your stupid brother with his strange pants and retro boots and his goofy haircut . He's the brother who got sunburnt trying to tan. :) So next time you get mad , don't hit a punching bag, pop Doom into your playstation and fry some demons!P.S.

Just to say that I owned this Doom back in the 90's and after that I had to buy it again. What's the deal with this version of Doom? I'm gonna repeat the same as the other reviewers: Music! Playing Doom with the original PC music its... I don't know, just something is missing and doesn't fit; but playing this Doom with the ambient music just takes the game to a whole new level. The composer of this soundtrack just knew how to transform the game to what was originally intended to be. Do yourself a favor and buy this game before they cease to exist.

JT fans who think Sweet Baby James was his best, enjoy his later stuff but feel he never quite reached that level again, MUST hear this album. It is a masterpiece. Much of it reminds me of \\"Country Road\\" with strings bridging the songs (the strings style reminds me of Beatles orchestral works, such as in Yellow Submarine, from this era). Anyone who has wondered where the song, \\"Carolina On My Mind\\" came from will now have their answer. Another magnificent selection is \\"Circle Around the Sun,\\" a traditional song that has been borrowed in part by the Grateful Dead (I Know You Rider) and Janis Joplin (Piece of My Heart). This album is hard to find. It is really the first half of the Sweet Baby James work. Get it-you'll thank yourself!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet Baby James Is Born","review":"There is nothing like the raw simplicity of a new artist's initial work, and this album is no exception. Little wonder that APPLE and Peter Asher saw the genius that is James Taylor back in London in '68. And thank God for that!James' talent is attested to by his musical longevity and the respect he is given by other perhaps bigger-selling artists.It is often said that genius comes from pain. James' debut solo effort whilst on heroin & coming to terms with an unfathomable world is ... well ... simply fabulous and the versions of 'Carolina In My Mind' and 'Something In The way she Moves', to my mind, are far superior here to the later slicker versions he did.Sure, this talented musician went on to write several more great hits as he \\"matured\\" into the mellower performer & writer he is today, but for me, this beats the lot! A must-have!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this album since the first time I heard it.","review":"A magical album - ethereal. I bought the record when it first came out (one of the first Apple releases) - it seemed magical then. Probably hadn't heard it for almost 20 years, so I wasn't sure if it was just great in my memory. Just got a CD, and am very happy to say that it still sounds great. Definitely one of my all-time favorites. It takes me to another place."},{"rating":"2","title":"NOT A BAD APPLE","review":"This 1968 album was very hard to find from 1972 to 1995.It finally was reissued and well remastered for the public when Apple started its reissue series.CIRCLE ROUND THE SUN never sounded better.

Energetic rockers like You Dream Too Much and Feel So Good alternate with the restrained anguish of ballads like Misunderstood and Why Must I Plead, while 1952 Vincent Black Lightning is a magnificent story of love and death. His folk roots appear on the humorous Jimmy Shands and the melancholy and very beautiful Keep Your Distance. Thompson is versatile and always very original."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of many great R T albums","review":"I don't think I can add much to the many fine reviews posted here. There are several classics on Rumor and Sigh; in particular I Feel So Good, 1952 Vincent Black Lightning and Mother Knows Best. These 3 are neatly placed at the front, middle and back of the C D.

Not just a one song CD, each song is a hit.Hope you do try this CD, and enjoy it as much as I have and do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Richard Thompson's best...so far","review":"In a long career, this disc is the one where everything comes together - the rocking, the folking, the balladeering, the wit, the wisdom, the sarcasm - all here for the enjoyment of the listener.I had heard Gypsy Love Songs from Amnesia on the radio, bought that disc, and loved it. I bought Rumour & Sign when it came out, heard Read About Love and was just completely blown away it in ways that very very few songs do.If you're new to Richard Thompson, this is a very good place to start. I find his recent works his best, so then go to Amnesia, Mirror Blue, Much Tudor, then, if you are really into it, You? Me? Us?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fantastic Album","review":"Richard Thompson writes some of his best melodies and hooks on this album. The production isn't quite what it could be but Froom isn't as terrible as a lot of people make him out to be. In any event, every song has a vibrancy and an attitude. You can't listen to the opening of Read About Love without going through at least one round of the chorus. Absolutely infectious. I think that overall this is his best album. Others are too hit and miss with some great songs and some just a tad bit boring (Shoot Out The Lights and I Want To See The Bright Lights Tonight are very notable exceptions) but this album is just great all of the way through, and the music is dense enough to make repeated listens a learning experience. Highly recommended. I think it's great that Thompson's best album is his most accessible, by the way. You play a couple of songs off of this one for most anybody who likes pop, rock, or anything inbetween, and they'll start singing it almost immediately."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Game","review":"Its no where near as good as I remembered from a demo a long time back but I havent played past the first world/level yet so what do you expect?

It features very good character animation and a well-designed 3-d environment. Hell never looked so good! The main issue is with the problematic camera, which requires constant readjustment and the puzzles can be simplistic at times. However, if you can spare a good 10-20 hours, I believe you'll find the game rewarding. Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Her early work","review":"Great book and introduction to CQY books.

This is not in any sense an erotic novel, unless the two [forced love] scenes described in this book (in much more detail than the few romantic scenes) just happen to be up your alley. Really, don't purchase this book. There are so many really interesting novels out there. Try Laurell K. Hamilton. She has some very interesting novels with a heroine that can take care of herself.

Why not? He never did eat in public and he was always telling stories of events that happened centuries earlier. His character in the book is just as amazing as his character in real history.THAT is the good point. The rest of the book is not as good. The characters have no life. They are either 2-dimensional or sterotypes. The strong willed, free thinking woman who is ahead of her time. The ruthless and powerful bad guy. The henchman who turns to the good side by the acts of kindness carried out by the good guy.The book is like a stew made with one carrot and a hand full of pebbles. The only good thing about reading this book is that you will find out about Saint-Germain and can look for books about the REAL man."},{"rating":"2","title":"hidden voices","review":"Heidi Bright Parales, a graduate of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville, Kentucky, spent five years searching through almost 100 books and articles to prepare this provocative and exciting account of the many women in the bible.

There are some decent tracks where the sound quality improves. \\"Missa\\" ,\\"Soolaimon\\", \\"Havah Nagilah\\" are some examples.Look for \\"Hot August Night\\", \\"Hot August Night II\\" \\"Neil Diamond Gold\\" or even \\"Love at the Greek\\" if you're looking for a concert album.

Sorry, Neil"},{"rating":"1","title":"This isn't Neil","review":"I have to agree with alot of the reviewers, reflected in the title I have chosen for my review. I bought this CD the NIGHT it was released, and have grown up with Neil's music and anxiously waited this release.....but I took it back to the store within 2 days. If you are a Neil FANATIC, you might add this to your collection, but if you are a realist, you will find this recording pathetic...He SHOULD be embarrassed.

It sounds like he enjoys singing these songs with frogs in his throat! Absolutely? dreadful! Like the other reviewers, Hot August Night and Love At The Greek, in my opinion, are truly Neil Diamond. Those are his finest ever live albums. He is truly a talented singer song writer and I have a lot of respect for him, but have no respect for him when he sings with flem in his throat and yelling out lyrics!!! That's not Neil to me!

Unfortunately, I bought the album at a local store and did not come to Amazon for a review. Neil Diamond was a great singer and we all age, but he basically yells all the lyrics, so that these live performances bear almost no resemblance to the original recordings I was expecting to hear.

Please save yourselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL","review":"Do not buy this. Neil Diamond gives you a box set showing just how bad his greatest material can sound when you scream out lyrics, and fall into Vegas.

The wind also has a tendency to blow beneath the table and chairs causing the cover to balloon upward which assists in its rapid removal. You need to tie the Velcro straps to the chair and table legs with a knot in order for it to remain in place thus making it difficult to remove easily. The manufacture definitely needs to come up with a better way of attaching the cover to table and chair legs. They might also want to consider providing small sandbags to place on top of the table to help prevent ballooning.I'm going to try two Hugger Mugger Yoga Sandbags from Amazon.comUPDATE: August 2011.

Salonen conducting LA Philharmonic Orchestra is an authentic reference for someone who wants to hear the most beautiful music by Lutoslawski (3rd-4th Symphonies). Another possible choices in this repertoire are Wit (Naxos) and Baremboim (Teldec). Though Wit's version (talking about 3rd Symphony) offers lots of delightful details which are not present in Salonen's version, the latter is more intense and convincent. Specially striking are the stunning fanfares of the brass (14 minutes from the beginning) and the colours of the strings, piano and percussion (last 10 minutes of the piece). The motives of the symphony are strong and powerful and the main one remind us that of the Beethoven's 5th Symphony (1st movement) The orchestra is in a good form and its conductor masters contemporary music and more specially Lutoslawski music. A great achievement!"},{"rating":"2","title":"my all time favorite steve miller album","review":"i would tell any steve miller fan old or young to buy this album, it is a must have for miller fans everywhere"},{"rating":"2","title":"Concert tour with Sugarloaf and Freddie King","review":"I saw the Steve Miller Band on their tour with Sugarloaf and Freddie King. Steve was great and Freddie joined him for the encore. After seeing the show, I purchased every album available by Steve Miller to go into my collection next to the Joker Lp.

Except for Michael Bolton's version of A Miragem (original is 100x better) and a few other select songs, this album is great.

I watched this soap when it first started in the Brasilian channel GLOBO.

The middle eastern ballads are beautiful!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfull","review":"O Clone was a wonderfull Brazilian Soap Opera.

Robert Bloch is the exception. King will never equal Bloch's PSYCHO, and I truly love some of King's books....SALEM'S LOT, CARRIE, CHRISTINE, THE LANGOLIERS, SHANKSHAW REDEMPTION, THE GREEN MILE. DOLAN'S CADILLAC is a sublime short story.But King is soooo uneven as a writer; 90% of what he writes is mind numbing, inane chatter with eruptions of genius. King's books are packed with more stuff than Santa's sleigh, and are busier than Katrina looters. The man needs an editor bad! Not sycophants.This book, THE ESSENTIAL STEPHEN KING, is a sycophant's pilgrimage to Mecca or Lourdes.Kings best book isnt IT, it's CARRIE."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, entertaining, interesting","review":"This book is good. It has a lot of interesting facts about the worlds greatest authors books. Things you might have missed when reading.

Have recently orderedproducts for my other vehicle."},{"rating":"1","title":"for beginners","review":"I just started working out and I am by no means in shape but I do live in the city and walk and climb stairs a lot. Anyway, I was really disappointed with this DVD because it is not very challenging. The instructor and music are great, it's just the pace. It is not fast enough to make me break a sweat or make me lose my breath. I prefer DVD's that really get my heart pumping and make me moderately out of breath. This workout was equivalent to me taking lightly paced stroll for 30 minutes. Comfy, relaxing and not too challenging. Unfortunately I am not here to watch the scenery, I want to lose weight. I would recommend this video to beginner beginners. Otherwise no help at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"An overall great workout!","review":"I was pleasantly surprised with this workout! I was skeptical as to how effective a 3-minute aerobic, 2-minute weights, and 1-minute core workout would be... but it was great! I was sweating, my heart-rate was escalating, and by the end, I felt energized and strong! The instructor is delightful (very encouraging and fun), and the mood and music are upbeat. There are even tips that scroll at the bottom of the screen to help make it the most effective (breathing, positioning techniques, etc.) After the workout, one of the women demonstrates other useful relaxation and massage techniques. I am very happy with this purchase, and will use this circuit often as part of my workout regime!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Prevention Fitness Systems: 3-2-1 Workout Video","review":"I love the video...it's a complete full body workout in 45 minutes that includes warm up, aerobic and weight bearing exercise. I liked it so much I bought several more to give to friends!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not challenging enough","review":"I enjoyed this video the first few times I did it when returning to working out after an absence. It does have some fun segments such as the salsa dance but overall it is not challenging for me after working out at the gym for a few weeks and my fitness has improved. I pulled it out today because I needed a quick workout but after doing other things my opinion of it has changed. I didn't feel that the cardio or strength intervals were long enough to do much good, I'd just be getting into it and the instructor would move on to something else. Also, the weight repetitions are done too quickly; I had difficulty keeping up with the tempo without swinging the weights and compromising good form. Many of the weight exercises are isolation moves instead of compound, there are more effective ways to strength train. This is definitely a beginner workout and one that anyone who is serious about getting fit will quickly outgrow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah","review":"I am an avid exerciser and put this dvd in the second I received it. I was expecting a lot more. The other reviews made it seem like this is the end-all-be-all of workouts. I am used to doing Tae Bo, The Firm, Turbo Jam and marathon running. I work myself hard-high impact the whole time. I felt NOTHING this whole workout. Sadly, I feel like I wasted 45 minutes of my life trudging through this. I will not recommend this and have 2 more Prevention workouts on their way. I hope I won't be disappointed. This one is a bummer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites","review":"I have bought several workout dvd's and this is one of my favorites. I have a bad back and am limited on what I can do, but this video is perfect. I would recommend this for anyone - even if you are just getting started, this one is great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great workout","review":"I loved this workout. It's a good all round workout. I read a lot of reviews and wanted to use a video to do the workouts instead of reading them (I own this book Prevention 3-2-1). I own a lot of workout videos because I get bored easily. I like this one because of the interval training. Its a no nonsense, lets do it and get results kinda workout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Workout for Time-Challenged","review":"I like this workout. Being a beginner and over 50, I started with Get MovingPrevention Fitness Systems - Get Moving, then after about a week started doing this one 1-2x a week for a little more challenge. At first it doesn't seem like a lot of work, but about 2/3 of the way through the sweat is dripping off me. I find the toning segments for the lower body to be a good challenge. My husband does this with me sometimes and the sports-type moves keep him interested. I agree with some other reviewers that there could be more stretching, but this is short enough that I have time to do the first 2 segments of Perfect in 10 StretchPerfect in Ten: Stretch - 10-minute workoutsafterwards. I can see where advanced exercisers might be disappointed, but this is good for my level and I'm sure I'll continue to use this even when I reach the intermediate level."},{"rating":"2","title":"Which Future Do You Want?","review":"This utopian/futuristic novel presents two, evolved versions of current, western society. While both are highly digitalized/computerized, one is an even more exploitive, controlling and corporatized version of \\"now\\". The other, for some readers, will be a more ideal model of what \\"might be\\". Here, in what is essentially a new culture, the reader is exposed to the characteristics of a re-ordered society involving advanced technology that benefits all, different child-rearing practices, superior shared/group decision making and the absence of traditional government. For a reader with an academic psychology background, the novel is more intriguing in that it's author is a mathematical physicist rather than social scientist, sci-fi writer or full time novelist."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of money","review":"What a complete and total waste of time and money. I bought this because I am Filipina and I wanted a way to teach my nieces, nephews, and grandchildren how to do it. Nowhere in the description does it say that this is modified from the traditional to an American style. It was totally useless for the purpose I had in mind. Now, if you are looking for a simple way to do a fun, new exercise for kids that is totally western, this may be a good bet for you. If you wanted real tinikling, it's not even close."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great compilation.","review":"A great compilation of prominent and varied 80s and 90s country. Such a diverse group represented - from my personal faves Little Texas' My Love to Paul Brandt's I Do (best tracks on the album). Take a listen to the rarely played Can I Trust You With My Heart? by Travis Tritt. A few tracks are skippable, including the overplayed Shoes You're Wearing by Clint Black... but overall, a great investment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid refurbished batteries","review":"My cell phone rejected the refurbished battery for this model.

The photos are not always from the captains wartime carrer, the text is very short (one or half page for every individual) and the only useful aspect of the book is the trivial data, like date of birth, date of awards, promotions etc.U-Boat aces deserve a better book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pat","review":"This is a beautiful book.

I've always thought that Fastball is a very catchy band but my perceptions were shattered by this album. At almost every track you'll be looking for something good to come around the corner, something catchy, something exciting, but it never happens. Trust me, this CD is a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"BIG LET DOWN","review":"Fastball had a good thing with their stuff like \\"The Way\\", I have no Idea what happened in this album. It is way to slow for all the song's messages. AWFUL."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still waters run deep -- this is white water","review":"If you loved the mature sound of \\"All The Pain Money Can Buy,\\" you may be disgusted by this one. Pop nonsense is right. If I wanted to listen to meaningless pop I'd just turn on the radio and not waste my dollars. Everything is overdone, the sound is very \\"thick\\" with many layered rock instruments, and the lyrics are what you'd expect out of Britney Spears -- not the Fastball we knew from the previous CD. There's no soul to this CD (and I'm talking about the thing, not the music style). I hope that this album is largely a case of fulfilling a record contract in any way they can, and that the next things we see from Fastball are a return to the depth and maturity of All The Pain instead of this pop pap. I agree with the reviewer who says this album is \\"playing it safe.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Retro? Please! Let's Try .....","review":"I'm sorry, but I enjoyed the tunes I heard on the radio from their first album much more that this one. This album runs the ..... gamut from XTC & Squeeze to Oasis to the Beatles with little original input of their own. The only redemption at all is the Bill Preston piano jam on \\"You're An Ocean\\". The hook is good too, but I'm glad I bought this as gift for someone else. I can't say I'd have it in my collection. I would give it a zero, but the review form check boxes will not allow it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fastball plays it safe","review":"Pleasant, pop nonsense. Nothing like the previous groundbreaking album. The cool genre-bending stuff like \\"Way\\" is nowhere to be found here. It's not bad, but we know they're capable of better. Hopefully this album's lack of success will push them back out of their safe zone for their next one. I'm still a fan, but feeling a little let down."},{"rating":"2","title":"They have finally returned!","review":"Fastball has to be one of the best rock bands out there; the great styles of guitar, percussion, bass, and guest players on this cd make it one of the best ones i have in my collection. Their first single You're An Ocean is a great radio song, and will get many people to notice them, if they have been living in a cave for the past few years. If you didn't buy the first cd, and you like their song The Way, buy it; I garuntee that you will love every single song on it. That's why i bought this cd from only hearing one song on it; i did it last time and it worked out for me! but before you buy this one get the first one first; make sure that you like this wonderful band before you get this cd. This has got many great songs on it, and hopefully Fastball will continue to rock on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get your eyes adjusted to the Harsh Light of Day","review":"After Fastball's seemingly one-hit wonder \\"The Way\\" off of their second LP, \\"All the Pain Money Can Buy\\", people expected them to fade away. But, now, \\"The Harsh Light of Day\\" disagrees with that opinion. With awesome winners like \\"You're an Ocean\\", \\"Love is Expensive and Free\\", \\"Wind Me Up\\", and \\"Morning Star\\", you really can't go wrong. Their songs may remind you of stuff you've heard on the oldies station, but their music is all original. Nevertheless, some of their music may seem a little repetitive, like \\"Don't Give Up On Me\\" and \\"Goodbye\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Greatest Rock & Roll Band in the World","review":"With their debut full-length, the Smithereens have crafted maybe the finest recording ever. The quarter from Jersey meld a myria of styles from rock to pop to even rockabilly and country to produce an album chock full of toe-tapping tunes that take forever to leave one's head upon listening. Post modern lyrics and deep introspection make Pat DiNizio the finest songwriter of our time and Especially For You is a true gem. Music listners don't know what they are missing if they haven't listened to the Smithereens."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Classic CD","review":"Relive the 80s with some of the greatest power pop songs ever written.

So tranquil, yet so spirited (and finally a picture of the Kern on the coverart!), this cd is a refreshing break from my well-worn collection, I just keep wanting to listen to it over and over again. I am amazed!It reminds me somewhat of George Winston, but still very unique. This is music to the soul. Absolutely relaxing, as well.I ALSO RECOMMEND: Mehdi ~ Instrumental Heaven Volume 7 ..Truly a Gem...Samples are at SoothingMusic,Com...Just Listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful, melancholy, subtle and yet so incredibly powerful","review":"I was so emotionally moved by the movie Solaris and I was pretty sure a great deal of it had to do with the soundtrack...I recently purchased the cd and found out I was right. The soundtrack is subtle but somehow achieves an emotional level that not many others achieve. It's a bit melancholy, lonely, beautiful, and always unique with its combination of resonant tones such as melodic bells and tonal percussion mixed with the warmth of strings and deep bass. A couple of the songs nearly bring me to tears when I hear them.I think Cliff Martinez is an incredibly brilliant composer/artist and I will be looking for more from him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest sound-visuals match - stuck in your brain","review":"A great film that was so misunderstood by the Hollywood lovers who went to see it, expecting another Clooney film. But enough of that - the music really IS another cast member - that's a great analogy and boy I can't forget it after several months. It has literally put my mind at peace in so many situations. It is depressing when I need that particular fix, and uplifting when I need that too.That I might forget..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Among my favorite CD's.","review":"As soon as the movie ended, I wanted this soundtrack.

I found this to be better value for my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Buzzed\\" Out","review":"I rushed to buy the soundtrack the first time I saw the movie, the music is that good. Right out of the wrapper, every other track has in-the-recording distortion as though the input recording signal is saturating, or the sound of blown speakers. Same at all volumes. Nothing wrong w/ my system I guarantee. Too bad!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much to work with","review":"There is really only one track worth it's salt here, and that's Track #2 (First Sleep). The rest of the tracks on this disk fall into one of two categories. The first are just tired, pared-down versions of track #2. The others are bla, movie-filler background ambience. Much of the sound is out of context when not in the movie, i'm sure. It's very bland and unimaginative. Most of my musical taste falls in the \\"ambient\\" category. There are many other comments here about how it sounds \\"spritual\\" or \\"soothing\\". If you like this kind of music, you should check out something that's actually interesting like Ian Boddy's \\"Aurora\\", Stars of the Lid, or music by Steve Roach, Robert Rich, or Vidna Obmana (particularly \\"Crossing The Trail\\"). This piece of work is pretty flat (except track 2). I'm sure it's decent when you watch the movie, but rather disappointing as an album. It even fails as background music. I would not recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thunder Is Very Bad","review":"I have played this game; in fact, I bought it last year. I just want to say that it is terrible. The graphics are exactly the same as Nitro from the year before. The game moves so fast that you have no idea what is going on; that is not a good thing. The moves are performed instantaneously, which looks very stupid. It plays like a fighting game, and is very little fun. The reason I am writing this now is because I had ordered WWF Smackdown off Amazon. However, my friend bought it and I played it yesterday, and the game is terrible. It plays just like Thunder and Nitro. I am not going to make the same mistake twice, and I just cancelled my order on Amazon for the game. THQ should have used the same engine from WWF Wrestlemania 2000, which I bought recently along with an N64. The game is so much better than all these other crappy titles.

By the way, THURSDAY Thunder is gonna have a Little competition pretty soon. WCW is good, but the storylines are horrible.

There were little \\"outrageous moments\\" on the DVD. What was nice, though, were the Tribal Councils, in which each contestant's 'confessions' on camera were shown, instead of only a few seconds of it.

Where the producers of the DVD could have taken a full two hours to tell the story of Survivor 2, they instead chose to really show clips of the survivors, followed by audition footage. For someone who has never seen the show, the DVD will seem incoherent and impossible to follow. For example, there is no insight given as to why anyone votes the way they do, all we see are five people voting a particular way. There is no mention of any tie votes or strategies going on. All of the suspense and drama that made Survivor so enjoyable is lost. I can only hope that the third time will be the charm on making Survivor DVD's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Survivor tape","review":"This vhs was a very good one.I realy didnt like how they did not show the challenges and stuff but i loved the early show interview and final words."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Survivor: The Australian Outback\\" DVD Much Better!","review":"If you bought \\"Survivor: The Greatest and Most Outragous Moments: Season One\\" DVD/Video and were very dissapointed (as was I) Have no fear! \\"Season Two\\" has many improvements!

Unbeknownst to Julie, she wasn't the only potential heir: Great-Aunt Elizabeth had an illegitimate son, Jake, who was born mentally handicapped, and his true identity as Elizabeth's son was kept a secret. After Elizabeth's death Jake found refuge at the Keeler Institute, where those with marginal abilities were able to thrive...until now. The organization has no more resources for people like Jake, and Jake has no resources at all.Julie's and Jake's lives are about to intersect- an intersection made more interesting because Julie and Jake are protected by the same guardian angel.

What I do know is that this is not a very interesting video. I got it to use with 6th graders studying the origins of Islam. I found only about a 7 minute segment which was usable in a classroom setting. The rest was very tedious and just plain boring. (I usually show 15-25 minutes of documentary video, which is all that holds their attention at that age. But it was hard to get then to sit through just 7 minutes of this.) I got rid of it after using it one year, and have ordered a PBS video on Islam which will hopefully work out better."},{"rating":"1","title":"dated video","review":"I had flashbacks of school where the teacher would turn the lights out, the reels would start spinning and you know you're just minutes away from dreamland.

It does go into history of islam and the caliphates. A good intro to the topic.

This video is propaganda of Jews and christians."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmmm strange and misleading facts!","review":"I would not recommend this video to anyone who wants to hear the truth.

Prophet Mohammed was an illeterate which is endorsed by all the historical facts - there is no contradiction about this. There is no way that he read the bible or anyother holy book as he was illiterate. This is a propaganda film to tarnish Islam, the only true religion of God, through media. God will surely punish whoever tarnish a true religion with all the misleading facts."},{"rating":"1","title":"JoJo Reardon needs to shut up","review":"Wow, that insane review by JoJo Reardon was really out of line, huh?

The sales speak for themselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre Effort","review":"Liberty has nothing new to say about this band. The only great songs are Serious, Liberty and My Antartica. Great drums and guitars in both songs. Others like First Impression and Violence Of Summer, are childish and very influenced by an overused New Wave/Synth Pop Style. Very bad production and a lack of creativity. Not recommended. Buy their later productions instead. Everything they've done after 1993 is awesome, but avoid this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Hate To Say It.","review":"I'm a fan. Really. I still have the 12\\" singles, I still have a tour poster on my wall. But this album is a true stinker - I knew it when I was 19, and I know it now, 11 years later. The occassional good idea (ie. the great beat riff in the remix of \\"Violence of Summer,\\" or that synth in \\"All Along the Water,\\" or the guitar lick of \\"Read My Lips\\") ends up disappearing as every song, without fail, turns to mush. The ballads are overly weepy, the \\"nasty\\" songs just sound ridiculous. Others are pure ripoffs from popular songs of the time (ie. \\"Can You Deal With It?\\" is ripped off from a club hit of the time). This album proved that Duran Duran desperately needed another Nile Rodgers, someone who would curb their lousy instincts and play up their hooks. Thank goodness Duran Duran was able to get it back together in later years."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing","review":"This is a amazing album. And iam not just saying that because DD are my all times favorite :)This album rocks my world I love every track on Liberty from strart to end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Liberty","review":"I missed the CD as I had the vynil and could not wait any longer to hear this album again. It is brilliant even though Duran Duran do not play any of these tracks live, unfortunately."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Album","review":"Probably the most least known of all the Duran albums and one that is either a love-it or hate-it, but in my humble opinion is quite good.It can be dark at times and true does lack direction in certain areas, but it felt lyrically & musically more honest and pioneering than any of their other albums until that time. This was also the album that Warren was considered a full member (along with Sterling Campbell) and had put another element into the mix.If you are looking for the Duran you know it is reachable in such tracks as \\"Violence of Summer\\" and \\"Serious\\". If you are willing to keep a open mind: \\"First Impression\\" & \\"Downtown\\" are musts (and my personal favs from this album).Overall I give this album 4 1/2 stars. I know I have five (the four makes it look like you should pass it up).It is not a perfect album such as \\"Rio\\" due a lack of a true flow from one song to the next (or a true theme) but it is a great listening experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"The most disappointing Duran Duran album.","review":"In danger of fading into obscurity at the end of the 80's, Duran Duran re-invented themselves as a funk-rock act for Liberty. Unfortunately the album wasn't the comeback they had hoped for, and it is easy to see why. Liberty is full of mediocre songs you won't want to listen to again, ruining the few high points, such as the catchy \\"Violence of Summer\\" and the beautiful ballad \\"My Antarctica\\". Thankfully the band learned from their mistake and went on to write the excellent Wedding Album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than you think...","review":"I have to agree with Benjamin C. Cunning, not only because he's from my husband's hometown, but also because he made a good point. This is a good album, it did have potential, and it is worth owning!The song \\"Serious\\", is one of my favorite songs of all time. It's mix of powerful vocals and music are definately worth listening to over and over again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Die-hard fan disappointed.","review":"As a die-hard Duran Duran fanatic, I'm sorry to say that this album was quite disappointing. First of all, the production is horrible and production has been one of their strong points. It has a few nice moments - \\"My Antartica\\" being the stand out song. The single \\"Violence of Summer\\" is very very forgettable. This album is officially the beginning of DD's inconsistent output. The line up changes as well as changes in musical direction have steered the boys in the wrong direction. I bought is because I'm a loyal fan and hoped they would do better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a very interesting album.","review":"I've always been a fan of Duran Duran, but to be honest, this is one of their albums I don't much care for. I used to feel the same way towards their other album Big Thing, but I've gotten to where I respect that one more than Liberty. Almost all of the songs on Liberty are basically unmemorable and forgettable. The only songs that are pretty good are \\"Serious\\" and \\"My Antarctica.\\" I happen to think that \\"Serious\\" is the best song off of this collection. The guys seemed to be in a stage of transition on this album: the use of guitars was more up front and noticeable than past albums for example (which isn't bad). The songwriting is just not that strong on here--everything else (musicianship and production) about Liberty is okay. This isn't a completely poor effort, but it's not that good either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reaching","review":"Duran Duran had a few new members, and appeared to be reaching for a new sound. They probably should have waited a bit. This album caused many (including myself) to prematurely write the band off - the fact that it came out right after a greatest-hits disc didn't help matters. It took me a while to grow to like some of the tracks on here - \\"My Antarctica\\" is one of the prettiest songs the band has ever done, while \\"Serious\\" is a great mid-tempo number. \\"First Impression\\" is fairly good (although that wasn't MY first impression!), and \\"Violence of Summer\\" is a passable track. I'd suggest this one to completists, or to anyone who finds it for under a few bucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"for the new Duranies","review":"This is a message from a true Duran Duran fan written for those just getting into the band. This album \\"Liberty\\" is a disappointment - ok, maybe the song \\"Serious\\" could have been a minor hit had it come out in Duran's prime, but the rest is not worth your time. Look into \\"Rio\\", \\"Seven and the Ragged Tiger\\", or the first Duran Duran self titled album with \\"Girls on Film\\" on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Duran Duran Album I've Heard","review":"This dog features the WORST DD lyric EVER - and that's saying a lot! Simon LeBon deserves to be keelhauled for rhyming \\"catechism\\" with \\"jism\\" on the reprehensible track \\"Venice Drowning.\\" \\"Serious\\" is merely okay and if the best they can do here is \\"Violence Of Summer,\\" a total swipe of Roxy Music's \\"Trash,\\" then it was time for a rethink. A fetid pile of dung, then, this is. Even the cover stinks. If I were Nick Rhodes, I would not be looking so smug after delivering this steaming heap! It is nothing less than astonishing that they delivered the masterful \\"Wedding Album\\" after this."},{"rating":"1","title":"The price of Liberty","review":"I am a Duran Duran fan. I was deceive with Liberty. With this album, I thought that Duran Duran was at the end of the road. Yes, there is some catchy tunes but, besides \\"Violence of Summer\\" and \\"Serious\\", there was no serious contender here. Hiring Chris Kimsey for producer was kind of a bad idea. Fortunately, the following CD, 1993's Wedding Album, was superior product. Liberty is for die-hard Durannies only.And unlike reviewer \\"They can ban me\\" said, Liberty didn't sold millions of copies. It didn't even reach gold status in the US."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gives you hope but makes you cry anyway ...","review":"The beauty of the song \\"Serious\\" is worth the price of the CD .. god, every time I hear that song it takes me back to 1990 ... when everything was wonderful ... I was 18, and barely in the Army, and this song was the most wonderful song to have in your Walkman during a dull pink late summer sunset with the light fading beyond the horizon while you were tired from an exhausting day and still dressed in sweaty camouflage fatigues and walking back to your barracks from the PX after buying laundry soap and black Kiwi shoe polish and you knew that you could never go home again ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get Serious, this was they're weakest album!","review":"If you like noisy samples and guitar rifts thrown in with some blunt lyrics, this is the album for you.

I suggest ANY Duran album but this one!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Raw, powerful, and just great songwriting","review":"I don't care what anyone says about these guys or who they try to compare them to.

In fact they are quite boring. Akron, Ohio was once the home of Devo and the Rubber City Rebels. Good stuff that had gusto and energy. Albeit a long time ago. This is flat, \\"young white guy trying to sound like an old weathered black guy\\" blues. I'm insulted I ever listened to the reviews.To rock you have to put forth some passion and some kind of drive. This has none of that. And hooks? None to be found. The lyrics are quite simple.

Big riffs and sweaty, ballsy vocals, the White Stripes comparisons are totally off base in that these guys are drenched in a hybrid of soul and sex and the blues, striving for a Stevie Ray hierarchy and landing there. My grade: A"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD!!","review":"This is a great CD, they have outdone their first 2 CD's which were both great. The highlights of this CD for me are \\"Keep me\\"\\"Just couldn't tie me down\\", \\"Grown so Ugly\\".There are more multi track guitars on this CD, it will be intersting to hear how they pull the songs off live.Already waiting to hear their next CD.Dan is the most soulful singer/musician recording these days.Buy this CD!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than previous recording","review":"This album is far tighter than their previous recording, which sounded like a looser version of the White Stripes with 1969 vocals. Well, the retro vocals are still here, but the songs are more straight up rock and roll than mopey blues. Great use of stereo here as well, with riffs changing emphasis based on the use of levels. Simple, intelligent and immensely enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bluesy garage rock with a punch","review":"Imagine the Rolling Stones up to and including Let It Bleed mixed with the White Stripes but with a soulfull lead singer that channels late sixties, early seventies rock vocal stylings. Now add some fuzzed out bluesy guitar and slide and you'd have an approximation of the Black Keys' sound. They have just the right amount of \\"slop\\" to their sound, ie any more and they would stink, any less and they wouldn't be as charming. But really the best thing about these guys is the songwriting which is emotional and melodic with a good amount of bluesy grit and feel. This is rock before it was called \\"classic\\". The only thing that mars the cd is the crappy, er, \\"lo-fi\\" recording, but what do you want from two guys from Ohio who recorded in a rubber factory? This is the first recording I've heard by these guys and I'm convinced, good stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"all right now","review":"i bought this the day it came out. i had heard a cut on the local public radio. i played it a few times and enjoyed it. but i recently got it back out, and, maybe it needed the summer heat to make me really hear it for what it is. this album is a scorcher. it seems to me that people somehow lump it in a category with the white stripes. to me, there's no comparison. this music is raw, exciting, bold, explosive, and RANDY. if i had to compare it to anything, it would have to be the band Free...at least, it seems to me that this is what i always imagined Free could have sounded like. don't fall for the white stripes comparisons...this is not novelty music. this is the real stuff. play it loud and enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great blues rock","review":"Haha, wow.

One pro is that the guns are pretty original & the South Park kids say some funny things, but the novelty wears off after a while.

The songwriting here is absolutely great, tracks vary from high-speed power-metal-fests to slow beautiful ballads to good thoughtful instrumentals. And there's fabulous Tarja's operatic vocals soaring over all this. Though other band members are also proficient musicians, you should buy this CD for the vocals alone. This is perhaps one of the best power-metal albums of the 90-ies and will be in place in most melodic metal fans' collections.Absolutely recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"New Convert to Symphonic Metal","review":"I believe some of the other reviews have given a history of the group, Nightwish, and also of this album, so I won't retell what has already been told.I am a very new convert to symphonic metal, having first heard it played on a bus I was riding and, having listened to several other bands in the genre, I realized that Nightwish is far, far above the competition, and Oceanborn is an amazing example! The songs are beautiful, the tone is joyful, and the melodies are unforgettable! I find myself humming them at the oddest times. :) Be sure to read the lyrics as I think you'll be surprised at the lovely thoughts expressed.You certainly don't need to be a fan of metal to appreciate Nightwish's creations. My 88-year-old mother thinks many of their songs are terrific, and so do my 6, 4-1/2 and 2-1/2 year-old granddaughters, as well as their parents!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific and Unique","review":"What a treat this album is. It just goes to show that it has to be a Finnish group to be this unique. First of all, this album sounds like prototypical power metal to me ears. Most of the musicians have impeccable CVs and it shows, the musicianship is flawless. But not a note is wasted. The solo here and the fill over there are absolutely perfect. But the obvious standout is due to Tarja's vocals. As soon as you hear them you know that this is a professionally trained soprano....singing power metal! And we should be grateful because it works. Many of us know that many metal bands have been utilizing waify female vocals to suffuse the atmosphere with a delicate touch. Well, there is nothing of it here, because the music really rocks. And the ballads are truly sweeping in their beauty. If you manage to like the soprano vocals over the power metal behind them you'll be treated to one of the most magnificient albums in recent memory. Tremendous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just my 2","review":"This is just my opinion, so don't come and whine about my review if you've bought the CD and don't like it (although I don't see how that's possible). I was first introduced to Nightwish sometime last year by my Belgian friend and since then, I've been madly in love with their music. I'm not sure how Britney Spears came into one of the other reviews; it would certainly be an insult to try and compare such an amateur (BS) with Tarja, who, in my opinion, is a goddess ;) I love every single track, from the powerful Sacrament of Wilderness and Gethsemane, to the intensely beautiful Swanheart. Each song (except the instrumental track, Moondance) is lyrical perfection. Obviously I don't know much about the technical side of music, but I know enough to know that this is one of my fav CDs and quite possibly one of the best ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Odd combination of Opera and Metal","review":"This CD (especially track 4) combines Opera and Heavy Metal. The Guitars are wired to digital effects to sound like harpsichords, violins, etc., and the lead singer sings mezzo-soprano operatic form. Weird. Good. Melodic. Easily accessable the first time you hear it. Substantive in content. Perhaps its most attractive attribute is the subtextual commentary the group itself makes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intellectually challenging","review":"\\"Metal,\\" is something my teenage son listens to and I cringe, normally; but this one is different. This album is quite interesting, complex, and varied with only a few sounds too harsh for me. It builds musically on late romantic composers, while adding electric guitar sounds. The lead vocalist -- a talented, operatic soprano -- has an eerily chilling voice, which adds intrigue.I tried having this playing in my car while driving and found that it presented a problem. The emotions are so intense that I found myself getting unacceptably stressed out, feeling nervous, harried. I like the album, but can't drive with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEAUTIFUL!","review":"Speed metal meets Opera....amazing...Tarja's voice is beautiful...this entire album is gorgeous...and this is not [WEEK] music either...it's quite heavy! \\"Devil & the Deep Dark Ocean\\" is what got me hooked to these Finlandish masters of Gothic powermetal. Beautiful and unforgetful! Any music fan will love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a refreshing joy to listen to!","review":"I borrowed this CD from a friend of mine at work. I normally don't listen to his type of metal (he's into the hardcore gothic and death stuff). Anyway, he had a note on it labelleing it \\"Operatic Metal\\". Decided to take a chance. Boy, was I glad I did - this thing is spectacular! Decided to pick it up immediately!I don't know how to describe it other than some intelligent stuff, well written, catchy, and definitely NOT your standard stuff that falls under the label of \\"metal\\".I normally listen to stuff like Black Sabbath (I run black-sabbath.com), and stuff that falls under the category of 70's metal; the only metal to come out of the 80's that I truly liked was Queensryche & Metallica. This is the first new thing in a long time that I've had this kind of positive reaction to!Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful and Beautiful","review":"Not much to be said here except buy it! I can honestly say there is not one person that I have played this for that hasn't liked it in someway.

WISHMASTER, ANGELS FALL FIRST and the most recent CENTURY CHILD are all of them much. much better than OCEANBORN.In OCEANBORN, it seems that Nightwish suddenly lost their touch for a while. THe songs sound all the same, the drumming is boring and repetitive, even Tarja's vocals are annoying at some point or another.Well, this would be my last option if I was beginning to know Nightwish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Power Opera?","review":"It appears this band got 40 of their friends to write reviews because there's nothing on this album worth listening to. This album is the musical equivalent of the tuner car. Like the morons who put $15,000 rims on a $10,000 Honda Civic, the dynamics of the band don't make any sense. Blending a good opera voice with a decent metal band is like putting shrimp in a milkshake...you might like both things, but mixing them together only makes you want to throw up. The only people who should buy this CD are people living with their parent's who feel the need to drive them insane with their music."},{"rating":"1","title":"ludicrous","review":"Here comes a Malmsteen-esque style hair metal with no emotion, no imagination and no messgae; neo-classical metal they call it, but it's merely a bunch of bored Europians having fun with their Casios and their fancy production. Don't be misled by the other reviews here. This CD is the most ridiculous piece of music I have ever held in my hands. Just have a quick look at the CD cover \\"art\\". This is how their music sounds: kitsch-metal at its worst."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oceanbore more like!","review":"This would be great if Nightwish had a concert at the bottom of the ocean, or, am I wishing too much here?

The winner stands, and no one can play the same character twice are two house rules that keep things interesting around here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Fighting Game -- No blood or gore.","review":"I am a concerned and involved mother of 3. I was VERY pleased to have found a game that has a good \\"battling\\" scenerio with all the action, great graphics, and variety of characters, weapons, and moves that Soul Blade has -- without the street-violence, blood, gore, and death. This is set up like a competition, in a ring, not on the streets. The whole family LOVES playing this game! We all have our fave players, fave battling weapons. I strongly approve of this game, for even my youngest Playstation player."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Game, Great Graphics","review":"Compaired with games of simular weight (Tekken 2, Tekken 3, Bushido Blade 2) This game ranks #1 in my book. The graphics are great and looks almost EXACTLY like Soul Edge (the arcade version of this game). Although I beat this game rather quickly, the game has loads of replayability with the Edge Master mode (search for the ultimate weapon for your character and use it in other modes), Player Vs. Player modes, Survival Mode (goal is to not get hurt and to see how many fights you can win), and Team Play Mode (play as a team against the CPU, when you are beaten your team mate takes over).An added plus for younger people is that no blood or gore is in this game. So if you are a concerned parent, that prohibits such things from your youngster, this game offers a fighting genre without blood, guts and gore or death (says \\"Knockout\\" when you are beaten or win).Bottem line, this game is a classic and warrents a place on any gamer's shelf that enjoys a good fighting game."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Ever!","review":"Hey! I'm a girl and I love this game! The only one I've seen better is the new Soulcalibre for Dreamscape! I love the action, the characters are aewsome, and the moves-WOW! The Edgemaster mode is cool, because you can win more weapons for the characters while leaning more about their history. My 2 fav characters are Mitsurugi and Seigfried (sp?) anyway! The intro movie is awesome. I love the song and the shots of Mitsurugi. If you haven't played this game yet, try it! It is The Best!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Welcome to the stage of history...","review":"Soul Edge - Circa 1996GOOD:- Gameplay is pretty balanced- Some nice unlockables- Different and interesting story for a fighter- Pretty good sound track for a fighterBAD:- Graphics looked pretty dated- Voice-Overs are not so goodIF IT FITS YOUR TASTE:- Play story mode to unlock new swords characters and costumes- Plays like Tekken, but with weapons- Medieval Theme has Ninjas and Samurais fighting Pirates and KnightsGAME ITS MOST ASSOCATED TOO:- Tekken 2- Virtual Fighter 2ADDITIONAL NOTES:- This is the first game in the Soul Caliber franchise- In the arcade this game was called Soul Blade"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hack your mates up with swords then laugh at them","review":"This, along with Tekken 3 make the very best fighting games ever produced, forget all that Virtua Fighter and Bushido Blade rubbish, this is where its at, all of teh grace of Tekken, minus the ridiculous weightlessness of the always disappointing Mortal Kombat series.

It has everything you could want in a fighter: jaw-dropping graphics and animation, cool moves, and many different play modes. The different modes of play add a lot of replay value to Soul Blade, and makes you want to keep playing it. The Edge Master Mode actually adds a story to the game for each character, unlike games like Tekken 3. But one of the most innovative things about this game is the different character endings. Each character has 3 different endings, making you want to keep playing it to find out the whole story. The only problem in this game is that the computer always seems to have the upper hand if you both do moves at the same time. But all this for $20! What more could you want? If you like fighting games be sure to pick this one up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Old School Fun","review":"This came is great if you want to get more back story to the Soul Caliber games.

At first i thought the movie was gonna be some washed out comic book movie, but after i watched the first 10 minutes. I was totally hooked.Ive watched the movie countless of times, i borrow my friends VHS of it, i rent it almost everytime i go to hollywood video, i love enid's accent and how shes a \\"1977 style punk\\" which you rarely ever see anyone like that in the movies. I didnt understand the glasses though, cause most people who have thick rimmed glasses are the ever so popular 'emo' but we wont go there.after watching it 28 times i can say that this is a great movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"GHOST WORLD IS BY FAR MY FAV MOVIE.. ...you'll love it","review":"This movie is awesome! Thora Birch is great in it, her sarcasim and way of thinking in this movie is so great! She has her own opinions and lets people know them.

I love this movie and own it, I'd recomend it to anyone that can appreate a good laugh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous!!!!!","review":"This film is truly fabulous. As a new college student, I can totally relate to this film. Thora Birch and Scarlett Johansson gave such superb performances; you'd believe that they came straight out of your own high school. I think that this film is something that you can watch over and over, and still totally relate and reminsine over. BUY IT!! you won't be disappointed, I guarantee it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top entertainment","review":"Having enjoyed the first Terry Zwigoff film (Crumb), and the Graphic Novel 'Ghostworld', on which this is based, my expectations were high. The film does not disappoint in the least, working on a range of different (though rather downbeat) levels.What was most interesting, and impressive, for me was the fact that the film deals with all the material in the original source 'Ghostworld' within the first 1/3 of the movie, and yet far from running out of steam, if anything, it ups the ante. This is visually stunning, and with some of the best dialogue outside of a Tarantino flick.eg. Enid: Oh my god. It's him. He's insane.Rebecca: We should follow him home.Enid: So, what was all that about enlarged holes and tight cracks?A stellar, almost perfect cast (especially Steve Buscemi and Scarlett Johansen), and a fine score, this is a must-see film. If you have read the original graphic novel, it will be that much more entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"great movie","review":"At times watching the film i had moments where i felt like i could really relate and they made me quite sad,a fine drama with great comedic moments. Thora Birch's acting is superb, the characters are so believable that it almost feels real, and i would like to imagine they she is the same way in real life(i am not a big fan of her in american beauty,although it was a fine film) This film made me see Thora in a different light, and i find her so incredibly sexy. Her non chalant attitude, her sarcastic and quirky remarks are hilarious.Steve Buscemi is a great actor , one of my favorites, and he delivers in Ghost World He plays this role out so well, that i couldnt help but get depressed and try to sympathize with him,i never have read the comic book, but after seeing this film i am gonna go check it out , i reccomend u go watch this movie , either renting or buying , it wont dissapoint!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My Fave","review":"This movie has got way halarious parts!

Thora Birch was excellent for this role. I also must comment on the music, very well done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quirky, funny, poignant","review":"I really enjoyed \\"Ghost World\\" and having been an angst ridden \\"outsider\\" in high school myself, I could relate to the alienation of the central character, Enid. The movie although peppered with prickly humor and oddball characters has a true-to-life feel that effectively resonates that universal sense of alienation that we have all experienced at one time or another just by virtue of having once been a teenager. The movie starts off as a comedy but as Enid's self destructive behavior progressively manifests itself, it ultimately achieves a real poignancy. The ending is the sort of Anti-Hollywood ending guaranteed to leave it out the running for an academy award. And that's a shame too, as the acting, directing and script were all first rate. And to all those who dismissed this as a \\"chick-flick\\", you missed out on a real comic gem and believe me, I'm no \\"chick\\".Recommended"},{"rating":"2","title":"Irony Defined","review":"Ghost World is the anti-teen movie in that it perfectly captures real teen life. Most ironic thing: The fact that Enid is an artist who keeps flunking art classes."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Movie Ever","review":"This continues to be my favorite movie, other movies come and go and this one endures! The dvd is far from the \\" special edition\\" that it says it is. Would love to see a real special edition with commentaries by most, or all of the stars, a behind the scenes documentary, extensive interviews with the cast and maybe a small featurette on Bollywood.I had never even heard of Bollywood before this movie, now i am a huge fan, so if you want a great flick you can watch over and over , this is the one."},{"rating":"2","title":"classic!","review":"This movie is so great at making its charecters realistic and relatable to those of us who don't fit in or conform to society.

But this one just didn't do it for me. It had a few funny parts. I wanted to see more of the weird guy at the convenient store with the numchucks - though he kinda reminds me of Stifler from American Pie. I like the girls Daria attitudes and such, and their retarded graduation concert thing was a riot, but the movie in it's entirety just had nothing really going for it.Kick ass tune in the beginning though, nothing I've ever heard of before."},{"rating":"1","title":"over rated","review":"I heard so many raves about this movie, but I found it to be very slow. And the one thing good that Enid seemed to be doing was getting Seymour a love life with the beautiful and kindly Dana. And then Enid sabotages that by sleeping with Seymour. (Why Seymour would forgo beautiful Dana to sleep with short, dumpy and obnoxious Enid I have NO idea.) I really thought this had so many flaws, I can't recommend it at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't Get into It","review":"Although another reviewer suggested and compared this movie to other \\"quirky\\" comedies like Rushmore, I didn't like this movie at all but did like Rushmore very much. I have liked all 3 Wes Anderson flicks to date. But this movie just wasn't for me. I found it very slow. Very dry. Although Buscemi does a good job, I have liked him in other roles more. I think for most people this will be a real 'hit' or 'miss' movie. And for me its a 'miss'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing film","review":"After seeing that this movie was on Roger Ebert's top 10 of 2001 and hearing about all the other praise from various movie critics, I was really looking forward to renting Ghost World. I wish I hadn't.While it might appeal to some individuals who can relate to the awkwardness of trying to fit in with their \\"conventional\\" peers, I found this movie a complete bore. It is very difficult to muster up ANY interest in the main character (and the film itself) as she whines and complains to anyone and everyone about how stupid and \\"un-hip\\" everyone is as she proceeds to spew negativity and criticism wherever possible.I would NOT recommend this film (labeled a \\"comedy\\" but in the darkest way) if you truly want to care or have any empathy towards the protagonist and the characters around her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid [Junk]","review":"Bad acting highlites a story of a girl who is not ony sarcastic, cynical and deppressed, but [messes] up everyone elses life around her.

Story is about a self-centered, self-absorbed teen age girl who never seems to be able to her connect actions with their consequences. There were a few funny lines (every one of which was in the preview) between long stretches of tedium. Save the cost of the rental and just watch the preview."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where's my bus stop?","review":"A well-done, solidly performed adaptation of a fine graphic novel, Ghost World is resonant with anyone who felt themselves either outgrow, outpace, or lose touch with their friends and family. I hate to say \\"coming of age story\\", but there ya go.Thora Birch gives a strong performance as a girl who isn't quite sure who she is but knows she isn't anything she sees around her. Steve Buscemi gives his personal best as a record seller whose social awkwardness has become a treasured possession. Fun cameos include: Teri Garr (uncredited) and David Cross as...well, I'll leave that to you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Questioning","review":"You're reading these reviews because you're trying to gain insight on whether or not to buy Ghost World. Just buy it.If that wasn't good enough, let me explain that I've seen every movie ever made with the exception of about 10 films. Ghost World is definitely in my top ten. I wouldn't call it a traditional movie. It has no clear, defined plot like perhaps the Hulk does. Character building, dialogue, quirkiness, etc... well this film has more than any movie I've seen in a long time. I figured, while watching it, it would fail in the end, but I was happy with the ending... the overall feel of the whole movie. I'm not really describing the movie here, but it's best to let you rent or buy it and find out for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Let it grow on you","review":"From a teenager's perspective - being in the midst of everything Enid hates - Ghost World didn't really make sense to me at first. Its blatancy annoyed me, but I found myself returning to watch the movie over and over again because underneath the anti-social humor, there is an undeniable truth. After viewing it five times, I understand why Ghost World is so magnificent. This is a movie stripped of any false emotions. It may be frustrating since all the characters are so damn intelligent, but that's the beauty of it. I love this movie because it presents brilliant, lovable loners, and you can't help but misunnderstand them at first, but the more you watch this movie and the more you are willing to understand the quirky characters, you will finally realize that people like Enid are the few precious gems we have left in this corrupted society."},{"rating":"1","title":"The most depressing \\"comedy\\" I've ever seen","review":"If your an anti-social punk rocker, you might just like this movie. There were some funny scenes, but the two girls are annoying. They just walk around cussing and complaining about how terrible life is and how everybody is so stupid. Buscemi was good (a little strange) but the guy with the numchucks was the best. Unfortunately, you only see \\"numchucks\\" for a total of 90 seconds. I think the funniest scene was when Buscemi goes into the convenient store steaming mad and tries to knock over the food shelf. He didn't see those numchucks coming now did he? Rent it if you must see it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated movie, feature free DVD","review":"Why was this film praised? I have no idea.The only reason the DVD received 2 stars was for the colors. The colors captured are great. That has to do with the costumes and lighting.Other than that avoid purchasing this film. Don't even rent it. Watch it on cable for \\"Doug\\", the guy with the mullet. After he disappears turn off the TV."},{"rating":"1","title":"No revelations here...","review":"First, my apologies to all that found some sense of ownership in these characters or their deeds. Personally I found Enid to be despondent wreck, hell bent on lambasting others for their perceived injustices (read: success). The parade of foil characters that attempted to sharply contrast her persona only reinforced my belief that not only was she clueless and without direction, but that she was simply melnacholy because she did not fit in. Her acerbic demeanor, lack of depth or any altruistic conviction only proved that she wasn't motivated by a cause or struggle. My belief is that her perpetual effort to rub popular culture the wrong way was in some way a combative response to not fitting in. On that level this work was a mild success. Just don't get confused, acting out is not high art. This piece was a prime example of both the director and the protagonist being rebels without a cause...or clue."},{"rating":"1","title":"overrated...","review":"slightly conscious of my own alienation, i really wanted to connect with this movie. or, atleast, have a couple good cynical laughs. unfortunately, the actions and development of the characters just seemed too contrived and unexplained, giving this movie a very disjointed feeling. and then there are the subtle smacks in the face that serve to hurt the movie, like the cheesy bus scene at the end. the story simply flails its arms, trying to grasp a sense of solidarity with high-school untouchables, and fails miserably.quick and dirty description: cheesy, clunky, contrived, and painful in a bad waywhat would i rather watch? high school spanish videos, they provide more insight and understanding of people and are also more amusing.i recommend watching the trailer, you'll get all the funny parts and delve into the depths of the characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Solid About \\"Ghost World\\"","review":"Ghost World is the kind of movie you love to hate, at least if you're me that is. The people I can see enjoying this movie are bitter, outcast teenagers who resemble the two main characters, and seem to be the exact audience this movie was made exclusivly for. The film chronicles the adventures of two young women who have a tendency to be sarcastic and bitter towards everything and anything. The films plot lacks any direction and the ending is worthless. The film gets 2 stars for decent acting and a few interesting segments. An alright movie to rent on a rainy night, but certainly not seeing more than once."},{"rating":"1","title":"i must not be hip enough to understand this...","review":"Ghost World is one of the worst movies i have ever seen, i can't believe someone reviewing this movie dared compare it to rushmore. I'm so sick of stupid 'indie' kids ridiculing pop culture, and thats the whole point of this movie...worthless. And on top of the stupid plot, Thora Birch is ugly and she has cankles, and those damn combat boots certainly don't make things better. My idea of a pleasant movie going experience is not ghost world, in fact in my ideal movie, none of the actors/actresses in ghost world would be present, they'd all be dead.

A slow, boring mess that should have been edited down to one hour. Total over-rated crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ghost Script","review":"Ok, I should say right up front that I went to high school with Dan Clowes who scripted Ghost World. I sat in the same art class that he based scenes from this movie on, so it was kind of neat to see a piece of my life up there on the screen.But the fun stopped there. While all of the actors in this film where good, the characters they portrayed were hateful, and their story was a complete bore. Clowes' misanthrope characters may carry an issue or two of Eightball, but much like the comic, they become tiresome in their perpetual cynicism and outright hopelessness.Twenty minutes into the film, people started voting with their feet. Out of loyalty to Mr. Clowes, I white-knuckled it to the bitter end as his story of teenage angst hopelessly unraveled."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid [Stuff]","review":"Bad acting highlites a story of a girl who is not ony sarcastic, cynical and deppressed, but screws up everyone elses life around her. Of couurse, shes deep, so shes not responsible. A horrible mix of cliches- it felt like 10 hours long."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie is not worth watching. It is very dark and hopeless.","review":"My wife picked this movie up from Blockbuster but I was surprised how hopeless and despairing this movie is for our youth. The story is about a young person who does not fit in with her peers. The acting is very poor and the end of the movie has no real point."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the best movies of 2001","review":"Yes, it's funny. Yes, it's quirky. Yes, Thora Birch and Scarlett Johanssen act their collective socks off. But the best thing about this movie is the unbelievably true way it depicts friendship. The scene with Thora Birch crying on the edge of the bed because her friend has rejected her is simply amazing. If you liked Welcome To The Dollhouse, you'll enjoy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just rent it...","review":"I purchased this DVD after reading the advice of other reviewers, I shouldn't have. While I agree Ghost World is smart and intelligent, the slow pace and often below-average performances (except for Buscemi) take away from what could have been a good movie. I kept waiting for some sort of climax or even something to laugh at, but the movie abruptly ended before that could happen. The only thing that kept my attention was Steve Buscemi's wonderful performance as Seymour, the object of Enid's (Thora Birch) obsessive attention. Don't waste the money on buying this DVD, rent it first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hysterical and Poignant","review":"It's nothing new that Thora Birch is one of my favorite actresses today, so it's no accident that I enjoyed this film. However, the best performance comes from Steve Buscemi; while he, Thora, and Scarlet Johansson each play outcasts, Buscemi pulls off some of the most comedic moments ever captured on film (you will never feel the same when inside of a 7-11 after viewing this movie). Yet, Buscemi also is able to maintain his character's personality with the most dramatic feel to it. He was ROBBED of an Oscar nomination!Though \\"Ghost World\\" is a tad long, its perceptions of reality are starkly and hilariously on the spot, and its ending perfectly weaves these perceptions together. Masterfully written by Terry Zwigoff and Daniel Clowes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ghost World is Amazing","review":"Amazing. This movie represents Indy films at their best. After seeing Memento and this film mainstream movies are no longer on my list of movies to be seen. Everyone who loves a great teenager angry at the world movie needs to run to your local theater to see this movie. No words justify this movie. See it now."},{"rating":"2","title":"You do not like this movie; therefore you are gay!","review":"Nevermind what ma and pa kettle said. This is a wonderful movie. I've always assumed that if you don't \\"get it\\" then obviously you're one of the people the film mocks.Thora Birch is pitch perfect as Enid, the sarcastic, vulnerable and often times immature heroine. It's great to see a character so flawed but still so lovable. She is exactly like all the alienated girls from my high schools; alternating between moments of profound wisdom and profound stupidity.It's called being human.The story meanders a bit which seems to echo the characters' meandering so I didn't mind it.The moneyshot performance is given by Illeana Douglas as the cheesy, summer school art teacher. She embodies the role without winking at the audience, totally playing it straight.Buy this movie. Trust me. You'll watch it a lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie, okay DVD","review":"For my money, this was the best movie of 2001, a wonderfully written and acted movie that touches on everything from coming of age to the increasing blandness of mainstream culture.What keeps me from giving this DVD the full five stars is the so-so presentation. Where's the commentary from Terry Zwigoff and Dan Clowes? How about showing some of Clowes' original \\"Ghost World\\" comics stories? I'm glad they feature the full musical number from \\"Gumnaam,\\" but the behind-the-scenes documentary just doesn't have enough information.A movie this good deserves a more fully-packed DVD. But I've got no complaints about the movie itself, it's terrific."},{"rating":"2","title":"Give Thora Birch the Best Actress Oscar now!!!","review":"I highly doubt we'll see a better performance this year. This was my most-anticipated movie of the year (i'm a giant fan of the comic) and it didn't disappoint in one single category. a brave, awesome, and hilarious film. I saw it twice in one week, and I haven't seen a movie twice in its opening week since \\"Pulp Fiction.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Flick!!","review":"I found this on NETFLIX and something told me I had to rent it and I am glad I did, now I own it! This is a great flick! I recommend it highly."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 stars out of 4","review":"The Bottom Line:I know tons of people who esteem Ghost World but I found that it came off as pretentious and not terribly interesting--because the film is a polarizing piece of art, I would recommend (if you want to watch the film) renting before buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe I Missed The Point But...","review":"I really didn't care much for this movie. First off, i cant imagine it is easy to make a movie based on a Graphic Novel.I found the story to be very dull, and the main character (enid i think her name is) is extreemly annoying. The movie, to me, is set around her feeling sorry for herself, and whinning a whole lot.There are parts of the movie that i did like however. I loved all the Art Class scenes i thought those were hilarious.I give it two stars, because it wasnt the worst move i have ever seen, and like i said i did like the art class scenes."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Movie is Horrible!","review":"It is slow, boring, and without a plot. Yes, it does look like several different episodes of a comic book were put together to make this movie. It stinks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid movie","review":"It's about two anti-social high school girls who thinks almost everything and everyone are stupid.The movie wasn't entertaining, wasn't funny, and had no character to sympathize with. Perhaps it was made for an anti-social audience.It's not a sloppy film or badly made film. It's well made, just not my cup of tea.The only reason I didn't give it 1 star is because it managed to keep my attention until the end of the movie. I guess I kept expecting something to happen which didn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"stink -o- ramma","review":"OK, Scarlett Johansson is very sexy in this movie, and the 80's guy (complete with mullet hair) got a snicker out of me, but most of all this movie is missing a plot. The main characters drone on in their meaninless lives cursing a lot. After watching, you aren't uplifted in any way or even challenged to think about anything, you are just depressed. It is a very slow moving and maybe I just don't get the 'art' of it. I just think it was boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT?! HOW HORRIBLE CAN IT GET?!","review":"This movie was BOOOOOOOOORING! It is really depressing, and has this weird music in it. It is practically about this depressed woman's life. In the end, she just goes away on a bus with this old man. In the middle, she loses her friend.... pretty depressing huh? NEVER WATCH THIS MOVIE, unless you like really depressing movies!"},{"rating":"1","title":"YAWN!","review":"It's ashame that American Beauty star Thora Birch was apart of this movie. The movie dragged on and had no substance to it. Thora Birch's character was an annoying brat who needed a slap in the face of real life. I don't recommend this movie to anyone with taste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch this movie, or suicide?","review":"This movie stinks. If you like actors seemingly strung out on a bad heroine binge, then this is the movie for you. The whole time it seemed like they were all wanting to be somewhere else and were just trying to get the stupid movie done so they could get there. Not much effort, in other words.To summarize: this movie stinks."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Bad!!!","review":"I'm not very good at writing review, but I bought this DVD because of all the stars I saw here. And this is one of the worst movie I ever saw. SO THERE IS MY 5 STARS WARNING : IT'S BORING!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"awsome","review":"I've been watching this movie since junior high,only had it on vhs and just now buying it on dvd. thanks"},{"rating":"2","title":"You will laugh and cry and LOVE IT","review":"Ghost World is brilliant. The cast is fantastic, and the music a true gift. I think we all can relate to this coming of age story."},{"rating":"2","title":"worth watching all the way through","review":"This is a good movie starring the beautiful Thora Birch and Scarlett Johanssen along with an endearing performance by Steve Buscemi. I found the characters to be somewhat dislikable in the opening scenes, but this is meant mostly for character development. You don't even know why the movie is entitled Ghost World until maybe half way through, which is also when the film becomes more cohesive. I enjoyed the movie and give it 4.5 stars overall."},{"rating":"2","title":"Let's Remeber Who's Album We're Reviewing Here...","review":"First of all, Supreme Diva Diana Ross' name should NOT be taken in vain in any review of Susaye Greene's album except when used in the term \\"post Diana Supremes.\\" Everytime there is an opportunity to diss Diana Ross, ignorance takes precedence over appropriateness...which is the case with most of the reviews of this CD.Susaye Greene's album is ballad heavy and sensual, which was always part of her skill. She writes beautifully and the years out of the studio have only mellowed her pipes. Highly recommended and remember, stop taking Ross's name invain."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Fear But Good Music Here","review":"The Last Supreme Susaye Greene finally releases a solo CD and it is excellent. From the start with &quot;End Of Days&quot; to the end, this Cd spotlights her strong voice and amazing octave range. It takes mucho talent to turn a Brodaway ballad like &quot;Bali Hai&quot; into a funky, danceable tune. Her octave range is like Minnie Ripperton but less tea kettle sounding than Mariah Carey's. The danceable &quot;Bewitched&quot; is outstanding as is the charmer &quot;Laugh Till You Cry&quot;. I recommend this CD heartily. Susaye also co-wrote the songs and she is an accomplished songwriter(&quot;Free&quot; by Deniece Williams and &quot;Can't Help It&quot; by Michael Jackson). This former Supreme exhibits no fear and a great amount of vocal talent. I recommend the CD as very listenable and enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"SUCH A SHAME","review":"I love the Supremes \\"Mary Scherrie and Susaye\\", so I was so happy to get this cd sent to Australia....but alas it just sounds very dated...what a shame..... far to much reliance on electronics...where are the live real musicians that would have taken this release up to anotherlevel way beyond where it is now, so that it be considered a great release. Good to say u have it in your collection BUT.....!!!!!!!Im so sorry to have to say what I have said cause I think this lady has a great voice."},{"rating":"1","title":"sappy rather than happy; slow-going rather than easy going; annoying rather than charming","review":"Riding off into a very slow start, this movie patters along for the most part until about the last quarter of the film when it picks up pace and the dynamic between the characters really escalates. Sally Hawkins portrayal is noteworthy but the character is slap-worthy until the very end rather than lovable. The movie ends a minute too long - had it ended a few frames before it does, it would've made a posh statement, a statement that resembles the rest of the movie, instead of falling into the romantic comedy trap of our times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying","review":"Mike Leigh has made some fine films-esp.Vera Drake & Naked, but this is not one of them. The lead character is just too annoying! Other reviews state this and for me it is the kicker for making it unwatchable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Happy-Go-Lucky Isn't","review":"I do not understand the 4 and 5 star reviews for this movie. Don't waste your money or your time. This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The lead character, Poppy, is 30 years old and acts likes she's 3 years old. The character is maddingly irresponsible; if you had to deal with a real adult who was that irresponsible, you'd run out of patience within the first 10 minutes. Plus, for my American ears, it was difficult at times to understand the English accents. This movie did not have a point or a theme or a story; it was just a jumble of little scenes that made no sense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't finish the movie","review":"Thank God it was a rental. As an American, I could not understand the British lower middle class accent. Poppy does not speak the Queen's English. I didn't know if she was still high/drunk or happy go lucky. I did not make it past driving lesson #1 when it went back to the rental."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money - Rent it first before buying","review":"I bought this based on criteria of other viewers. Wow what a disappointment. Boring British and a waste of good money. If you are thinking about buying this suggest you rent it first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Happy? I think not.","review":"I'm an optimist, and was looking forward to seeing a movie that promoted having a positive attitude (not the most common view in the world today, especially considering how lucky many of us are). But I was extremely uncomfortable at how such \\"happiness\\" was displayed. I think that Poppy used her humour like a bludgeon, and although she showed compassion at times, this was definitely countered by moments of thoughtless (one hopes) cruelty. And why did the actress, in order to show her constant glee, have to come across as such a mouth breather?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to like this","review":"However, the main character is so annoyingly unlikeable that I had a hard time with the movie. No plot to speak of. Just a series of vignettes in which the lead character plays an overtalkative ditz who is, I guess, demonstrating to us why it's better to be positive in life than negative. She is surrounded by various unhappy people: her driving instructor, a young boy pupil, her sister etc., but she blithely either ignores their misery or tries to help them out of it. In the end, I guess it's better to be her than the angry driving instructor who has a crush on her. I did like the 1960s-style soundtrack."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poppies in the Cemetery","review":"This movie receives all kinds of analytical accolades about Poppy (main character) and her relentless optimism, but truth be told, i wanted to kill her in the first 10 minutes. It was unnaturally gloomy watching this movie, so i could not even finish it...there are much more uplifting stories out there. Credit for the reality in cinematography....characters not glamorized, background very realistic...in fact, it seemed much more like a documentary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really fun","review":"In the first few scenes of Happy-Go-Lucky I found the main character, Poppy, to be tiring, maybe even empty-headed. As the movie progresses, however, this amazingly sunny Britisher shows herself to be intelligently dedicated to her young students, loyal to her friends and family and uncannily wise about the psychological upsets of those about her -- whether a street person, a student, her sister, or her driving instructor. As usual with Mike Leigh's films, this one is both funny and deep. My favorite character: Poppy's Flamenco dance teacher."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant film","review":"You might initially think that the main character is slightly annoying and too carefree. However, the film (as well as the main character herself) actually has an underlying serious note. The story is a great reminder to consider that there may be much more to people than first impressions."},{"rating":"1","title":"If happy don't watch this movie","review":"My friend and I were excited to watch this move. I don't know who fell asleep first, but we paused it about 30 minutes in and never went back to watching it. I don't even know where to start with this boring film about a unrealistically happy lady who takes driving lessons from a miserable man."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big mistake","review":"We fell in love with Sally Hawkins in Jane Austin's Persuasion. We read a review in People magazine about this movie and just couldn't wait for it to come out. We knew we just had to have it in our video library. We weren't five minutes into this movie when we both realized we had made a major mistake. All I can say is that it was so awful we didn't keep it or even donate it. It went in the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Actually 2-1/2 stars","review":"I found it a bit average. Sally was certainly enjoyable to watch and made me laugh a few times, but it's hard to believe that people really can be THAT happy-go-lucky; certainly not in NYC anyway. She's not annoyingly peppy at all, but i found her character immature and knieve....was that the point? The ending left me feeling 'blah' which changed my opinion of the movie from 'like' to 'didnt like'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Game!

If you like fast-paced games buy this game!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This Game is Pales in Comparison to the First","review":"This game sucks. I don't say that becasue it's too hard or easy I say it becasue it doesn't live up to the name Jet Moto. Buy the first and then you'll see a real racing game. Buy this and you'll see a recycled, generic racing game with dumb racers and even dumber tracks.

It goes out on a good note. I am not upset that I read past the first, but the first was the best. The prot character has returned from the dark recesses of the mind of Robert Porter, or so we believe. Prot's arrogance toward the human race, and our self-destructive nature, wore on me a bit in this book.The hidden personalities of Robert Porter make appearances again. Giselle, Robert's wife, and recurrent character, is again, a high point. It was interesting to read about Dr. Brewer's internal conflict with retiring. Dr. Brewer's children were very good secondary characters.Well, this book will make little sense if you do not read the second one in the series, so read it.

I give Ma credit for attempting to establish them musically, but there's not much success that I can hear.As well, I hardly think it necessary for reviewer, S.

Yet they are also very graceful, warm performances. All three scores are meditations on death and dying. I don't know whether these works will become part of the classical music canon, but in Ma's hands they are treated with much reverence. Under David Zinman's baton, the Philadelphia Orchestra gives Ma ample support in exquisite performances of their own which never detract from Ma's brilliant playing. It's truly amazing that such wonderful music was played and recorded around the time of a raging snowstorm."},{"rating":"2","title":"Three powerful cello works.","review":"The Danielpour work is very dramatic; at times it sounds like a film score by Bernard Herrmann. There is plenty of darkness and conflict and is a very powerful and dynamic piece. The Kirchner work is very energetic and regal - again, like a film score; when talking with Richard Danielpour in Atlanta he praised the Kirchner work. The Rouse work is more dissonant and haunting than the other works and evokes a sense of loss and mourning. The performances are exceptional. A great recording of three new contributions to the cello repetoire."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Intriguing Disc","review":"It is always nice to see a major label offering contemporary music, even if the compositions on this disc are fairly weak. The Rouse is the weakest piece: loosely organized, with borrowings from just about any and all 20th Century composers, even Joaquin Rodrigo!! Mercy!! The Kirchner is not bad, but it is not one of his more inspired pieces and borrows a little too much from Bartok. The Danielpour is the strongest work on this disc. It is the most tautly organized, the best orchestrated, and the most moving. This is the first composition by Danielpour I have heard that is not totally synthetic and derivative. Any listener who appreciates 20th Century music should buy this intriguing disc.

If I am to disregard the logics of the plot and the subplots and think of the film as brainless, then the movie is simply quite boring and mindless. There is not much to look forward to in American Ninja, although there is a couple of good characters in Michael Dudikoff and Steve James, who manage to shine much better in the sequel. It is pointless to discover the many faults of American Ninja. I am a good fan of the Ninja genre, and American Ninja has plenty of Ninja action.

He reiterates everything he said earlier-ranging from opinion to nonsense-and then as before launches into his pet designs with little good explanation.If you want to build a Class B semi-serious amplifier for instrument or PA or non-serious-listening use this will probably work, although there are a lot of old 70s and 80s designs readily available at your local library in old electronics and audio magazines.If understanding the trends in serious audio work today is your goal, start with the \\"horses mouth\\" JAES paper \\"Tubes vs. Transistors: Is There A Difference?\\".

Better yet, buy all three listed here at Amazon as I did. Randy's easy to read writing style makes learning about electronics and amplifiers fun, as any hobby should be. Granted, this book will not make you a electrical engineer but it will open your eyes to the inner workings and design of amplifiers in general.The book contains many projects as indicated by it's title. Randy's Seal Electronics offers these projects in kit form. I purchased his Opti-Mos kit. Talk about ease of assembly. And, if you have a problem he is as close as the telephone. \\"What does the amp sound like\\", you ask? For my ears, AWESOME!!So there you have it. A great project sourcebook with readily available kits for a true hands on learning experience andas an added bonus you even get to speak with the author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amplifiers and More","review":"I bought this book after my great experience with Slone's High Power Audio Amplifier Construction Manual. This is a fantastic book if you want to build your own amplifier \\"accessories\\", such as headphone amps, preamps, equalizers, and other types of signal processing devices. There is an interesting circuit for a phase-linear filter, which I built and works beautifully. It splits the audio signal up between the pre-amp and power amp into low, midrange, and high frequency spectrums. This avoids the phase shifts associated with conventional speaker crossover networks.You'll need a power amp for each frequency spectrum, but that's no problem. You'll have so much fun building your own amps that you'll have plenty of them laying around. The resulting sound is absolutely fantastic."},{"rating":"1","title":"This game is definitely no Mario 64.","review":"Where's the 3-D quality? After playing superior games like Mario 64 and Donkey Kong 64,the game is just too linear and doesn't present much in the way of graphics. Throughout the game I felt hindered by the outdated 2-D feel. You can only move Crash forward or backward. Also, why in the world is this lackluster game so difficult yet incredibly boring? The only virtue of Crash is that once you acquire the code that opens up all the levels; the game can be manipulated to a small degree of satisfaction. If you want a true platform experience, stick with N64, otherwise this title is virtually worthless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great but too difficult in some places","review":"This is a classic game that I come back to every now and again. The graphics are great and the content is really satisfying. But I do have a complaint of the actual difficulty of the game.1st island - The easiest to beat if you have all of the different coloured gems. The hardest level here is Native Fortress.2nd island - Slightly harder but still fun. The hardest level here is Sunset Vista.3rd island - The most frustrating. I spent half an hour to beat Generator Room with Perfect and another half an hour with Toxic Waste. The hardest level here is Slippery Climb.I don't get why a kid's game can get difficult to beat. I mean, I own mature games like Jak 2 and Oblivion and they are a whole lot easier by comparison. If you are looking for a challenging game, this is your cup of tea. But if you want a kid's game that you can just glide through, I recommend Spyro."},{"rating":"2","title":"SECRET CODE","review":"I have never managed to beat the game, can't imagine how some people claim to do so in 5 hours. My 5 year old has finally figured out how to play these games on the playstation. She was getting frustrated with Crash, until I found the code that allows you to go to any level and play. Plus if you go to the Castle Machinery level first, you get 20 some free lives and then can go where you want. Find the password screen and punch in: T(triangle),T,T,T,X,S(square),T,T,T,T,S,X,T,O,T,T,T,O,S,T,X,X,X,X. Maybe it is cheating, but for us folks that have a hard time beating the game, it makes playing it more fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"How can Crash eat all those apples and still be so skinny?","review":"I don't know what so many people have against this series. Personally I prefer games which are all action to games which just seem to involve wandering around becoming hopelessly lost and ending up going around in circles getting nowhere. This is an excellent example of the best kind of platform game with lots of running, jumping, item-collecting and baddie-avoiding. The game is filled with imaginatively-designed levels and humorous, well-thought-out characters. The exception to this is Tawna, Crash's girlfriend, but thankfully she only appears briefly (there is already enough blatant sexism in adventure games without it invading this kind of cartoony environment). Tawna was wisely dispensed with before Part 2 came out.Minor gripes aside, however, this is solid platform action, the best I've played since Sonic & Knuckles on the Megadrive. Crash himself makes a likeable and interesting hero, something sadly missing from a lot of video games."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Game with some Mistakes","review":"This game has very good graphics and music, but it has some mistakes. Naughty Dog really goofed up on this game, like when you can only save on the Tawna Bonus Rounds-(how many times does that come up?!) You cant move very fast, and you aren't able to jump that far either. Finishing the hard levels can take a while, like Toxic Waste with bouncing barrels that you can't beat. It can be frusterating. It's fun, but it doesn't have as many powers as Crash Bandicoot 2 or Warped. They don't give you a lot of Wumpa Fruits in the hardest levels when you need them most to earn a life. You really have to work at this game, you just don't finish it in 2 days-(Unless you know secrets about the game or you put in the secret password.) All in all this is a cool game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute little guy","review":"When I got this for my early birthday,I didn't expect that the character would be so cute!Crash is adorable,which will get you hooked on for about an hour,the fun for another,and the hard for minus a second.Even though it is difficult,you'll enjoy looking in those eyes,and playing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can I use this soft wear for Japanese system?","review":"I have Japanese system of playstaion.

I love this game and all the other Crash Bandicoot games."},{"rating":"1","title":"A fun game with a few problems","review":"Rent this game, because you can beat it in 2 days. Crash Bandicoot had good graphics for its time and even now they are decent, but the lack of good 3D graphics causes you to sacrifice numerous lives due to not being able to judge how far to move or jump. Some of the levels are repetitive, like the High Road and Road to Nowhere, which are two levels that are virtually the same thing. Also, Naughty Dog really goofed up when they set up the game so that you can only save your progress at Tawna Bonus Rounds. (Not that often do these special bonus rounds come along.) This causes you to have to go back and redo a level that you have already beaten when a Game Over comes along. If you are looking for a good action/adventure game, try Spyro 2 or Crash Warped. This game isn't what I expected it to be, but it is still fun to play and the graphics are decent."},{"rating":"1","title":"disapointment","review":"this game is pretty bad first off all you can do is run strait the only good thing about is its pretty long the other bad thing is its to hard and it gets boring i wouldnt buy this game if you want a crash bandicoot game get either 2,3,4."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, like other Crash Games...","review":"I recently obtained Crash 1. I already had Crash 2, Crash Team Racing(CTR), Crash Bash, and Wrath of Cortex (PS2). I began playing the game, and noticed only one negative thing. You cannot save the game unless you are in one of the special bonus levels (which you can get to only if you collect three of the little cards with the bear on them- I do not know what those are called.). Other than that, the game is challenging and fun. Most gamers should enjoy it, whether they are hard-core gamers or not."},{"rating":"2","title":"great game but slight harder than crash2","review":"not as good as Crash Bandicoot 2, but I'm still getting use to this one.it's a lot harder, specially since you can't slide in this one like you can in the 2nd one.but i'm almost 100% done with this game :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy Drilling Now","review":"This drill press is great it is quite and has all the power I will ever need. The only reason that I am giving it 4 stars instead of five is the table that is with it. I ordered a clamp and a vise to go with this great drill, they had to be jacked around to work because the slots in the table do not goo all the way through. These everyday extras work well but had to do a lot of fiddling to get them attached to the base.One comment is that I find it incredable that Delta feels the top covering the belt and pulleys to be an extra. Made one from plywood to protect the pulleys from loading up with sawdust.Over all I am most pleased and highly reccomend this drill to any one.Robb"},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE OF THIS PRODUCT!!!","review":"If you read Amazons review of this product - it illudes that this Drill press comes with a Jacobs Chuck & yet it DOES NOT!!!!

Starting out with Biohazard doing a fast paced cover of \\"after forever\\" followed by Rob Zombie in his usual style with Children of the Grave. Not many people could be better to do such a song. Megadeth does a speed metal version of \\"paranoid\\" which I must say i like better than the original. Espicially good since Most remixes of Paranoid tend to be techno or industrial. Another cornerpiece of the album is \\"sympton of the universe\\" by sepultura. Playing a fast beat and with powerful vocals with the casual clasical guitar piece at the end. The only song I did not like on this album was Black Sabbath by Type O Negative. Black Sabbath does not sound good \\"Gothic\\" in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing compilation cd!!!","review":"The first time I heard this cd, it totally freaked me out- and Sabbath became my favorite band ever since. I remember all the original versions, I thought they ruled-but I was very young then and had no idea who was singing the songs. I listened to it one day,and I even got my friends (who were into that grunge stuff at the time)to rock out on it! I knew then that Ozzy and Sabbath were heavy metal gods.That night I went out and bought tickets for the Ozzmosis tour in 1996,it was my first Ozzy show, and it was such a trip to see Ozzy sing some Sabbath at his show. OZZY IS MY GOD!!! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD is what turned me on to Black Sabbath!","review":"I originally bought this CD for my boyfriend on Valentine's Day, but after listening to it with him I decided I had to have it for myself!

I'm not too crazy about Faith No More's version of \\"War Pigs\\" or Type O Negative's version of \\"Black Sabbath\\" but that is a mere technicality.

I would easily recommend buying this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you are a sabbath fan get this cd","review":"Every song is great except war pigs by FAITH NO MORE, the lead singers voice is way off.

If you can take songs that are 20-30 years old, and basically just remix them and the sound like today's modern music (even the originals are still very similar) then you've got a great band.By the way, I have been hearing a lot about a CD called N.I.B. Part II, for those of us complaining that it wasn't a double-CD set"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Sabbath experience.","review":"With all the efforts put into this album, and all the great bands' participation this album has nothing special to offer to the listener.

This is a cartoon you should take a look and collect. Yu Yu Hakusho is straight out Hilirious and romantic.

If you like to watch anime that has everything like romance, comedy, fighting, betrail, curlity, or true friendship, and trust in one another. You will love this series it just has it all. And this doesn't have anything that looks the same like DragonBall Z. Cause you know in DragonBall Z everyone looks the same.

Though some might not quite get how the main character is dead from the start, it all works out. ^.^()For the boys there's plenty of fighting, cursing, and some cute girl characters. For the girls, there's Kurama. He's a nice, polite, foxy (literally ^.^) bishonen. Oh yeah, and he still kicks butt - he just does it with roses.Oh, and there's the one known as the \\"Vegeta-wannabe\\", Hiei. He's a fire demon with a big attitude problem.And behind all the fights and tournaments each character's heart breaking past is shown. It's a little like DBZ - but the fights aren't as long and are certainly much cooler.

I was so put off with it, I didnt even finish watching the first DVD.The animation, the story ...Its just another variant of DBZ and that should be enough to ward anyone off. This is poorly drawn dreck, a cross between DBZ and Yu-Gi-Oh, enough said. Leave it for the young teens.Japanese animation is capable of pure art, at one end of the scale you have Miyazaki, at the other end you have Pokemon, DBZ.

The 90-Minute tapes are made utilizing thinner mil (thickness) tape that is likely to jam in many audiocassette recorders and/or players. I rarely have this problem with Maxell 60-Minute Normal Bias tapes. As far as sound is concerned, if you record on an audiocassette recorder with Dolby HX-PRO these tapes sound exceptionally good. I seek out Maxell 60-Minute Normal Bias tapes when I go shopping because all varieties of audiocassettes are becoming harder to find.

The carry straps are long enough that you could carry the case like a backpack, but the straps are so thin that they hurt horribly if you put them over your shoulders.

While it is very disturbing, and sometimes presents ideas that are seemingly relevant to current events, it is not that we'll-written and is a rather tedious read. It does use offensive language, but I didn't buy into that as the language did serve to define the main character. In my opinion, the book simply drones on and on and on, moving at a snails pace. I suppose the author could have been making a statement about the methodical pace of the books \\"organization,\\" but I'm not sympathic enough to the white supremist cause to find it worth the minutia.

The plot of the book itself tells of a revolutionary group fighting the corrupt, authoritarian power that the United States becomes with breaks from the action for the main character to rant about blacks and Jews. The story plays on almost every stereotype about Jews and blacks and all anti-government hysteria put forth by neo-nazi type organizations.All in all, the novel's only good use is that of a conversation piece."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure evil","review":"The unimaginable racism and violence in this book is absolutely unreal. I admit I have some racist blood in me myself at times, which is why I thought I might enjoy this book but you have to be a truly dedicated, extremely hard core racist to enjoy this book.The book is about a race war in America that leads to the complete genocide of Jews and non-whites worldwide and violent murders throughout, such as hanging everyone who was in a relationship with a non-white.The author William Pierce has absolutely no regard for human life except for White people and believes theres nothing wrong with genocide. After reading this book, you will have a different definition of what a racist is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Writing Skills","review":"While I certainly do not agree with the defining message behind this book, I believe in free speech.Even still though, this book was an absolute train wreck.The lack of literary skill, meaningful plot progression and abundance of simple, one-dimensional characters made this work reminiscent of something a hormonal teenager would write in remedial English class.By no means is this a great literary work."},{"rating":"1","title":"What are The Two Previous Reviewers Smoking?!?","review":"That the previous reviewers, try to explain this book as possessing any relevence or, on the other hand, to excuse it as \\"fiction\\" is either naive and foolish or, most likely, devious of them.This book is nothing more than NAZI (and I use that term very deliberately) propaganda! The writer, William Pierce (aka Anrew MacDonald), led one of the most fanatical and extreme neo-nazi organizations in post-WWII America. The book is written with only one purpose in mind: To inflame disgruntled and insecure white men against everyone and everything that is not Western Indo-European pink-skinned white."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE","review":"This book is just horrible.

I read it and that was that. Today, looking through my \\"purchased items\\", it no longer appears on the list. It has dissappeared from my Kindle as well.I was under the impression that Amazon would no longer be deleting e-books from people's Kindles after the 1984 fiasco, but apparently I was wrong! The version I bought was cheaper than this one, but I couldn't tell you for sure how much I spent because there is NO record of my ever having purchased it - it's as if it never happened!I really don't think I can ever trust Amazon to archive my books after this.

Much ado about nothing.","review":"OK, I had to read it once I realized, while watching a Timothy McVeigh biography, that this book had been virtually banned by mainstream publishers and, until recently, was only available by self-publishers at gun shows. Now I like gun shows as much as the next guy, but this sophomoric attempt to \\"awaken\\" the white, male conservative (of which I am one) is almost comical. And completely improbable. For this to happen as it is laid out (and let's face it, many things are wrong in our country that need to be fixed) could not possibly happen as such. Nor should it. Still, if you want to read it just to say you did, by all means do so."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book deserves no credence.","review":"I found this book to be gruelling to read.

Why is someone who has never read the book giving an opinion on it? He listened to what other people told him about the book on television??? Regardless of how offending something may be it is and always has been protected by the first amendment of the constitution. So regardless of wether or not you agree with someone's opinion is irrelevant. If you disagree with me then I think your just as guilty as being un american. You really think we should censor anything? I don't know why you would unless your scared of the truth. You like to live in a world of lies and deciet because it helps you sleep better at night but what it boils down to is that you are ignorant on the subject and in no way does your opinion mean anything towards this book at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review of Turner Diaries","review":"I have just finished reading this book.

I am very liberal in what I read and I would not ever suggest this book to anyone, except for someone that wants to find out what the thinking of hate groups. As an American, I was appalled with the scenario suggested in the novel. The only think I can say about this book, that the vile content of this book is equaled to Mein Kampf by Adolf Hitler. Most hate groups think Mein Kampf is a bible for their groups and The Turner Diaries extends the hate for these group.I wouold never, ever let a member of my family read this garbage and it still making me ill.

Because of its prominence, I decided that I would read it. I was prepared to encounter a book with rather flaky social and political underpinings that nonetheless might be a little fun, just as RAMBO or RED DAWN can be fun apart from a great deal of silliness.I was wrong.The only thing this book offers is a fictional embodiment of inconceivably naive and intellectually empty beliefs and fears. The writing style is inconceivably wretched, the characters unbelievable and cardboardish, and the plot boring and without suspense.Apart from members of the extremist right, it is inconceivable that anyone deriving any pleasure or enlightenment from this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Racist garbage","review":"An unbeleivable tale of white supremacist racism, filled to the brink with moronic political views, laughable ideas about warfare, basic ballistic mistakes, and general idiocy.Worth reading to see how the racist nutbags actually think. It's not about separation. It's about mass slaughter of non-whites."},{"rating":"1","title":"Woeful Assumptions","review":"While interesting and frightening at the same time, the Turner Diaries make the usual mistaken assumption of radical groups: That, in their secret hearts, the bulk of society feels as they do. Without that support, the Turner revolution would fail as quickly and as silently as the leftists of the 1930s or 1960s did. Remove that assumption and the book fails.

Historically significant maybe...kinda portrayed in such a biased and opinionated way that to some it'll feel unusual to read and maybe even uncomfortable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Finally read it.","review":"After hearing about this book for several years, I finally decided to buy it and read it. Much like \\"The Catcher and the Rye,\\" the mystery surrounding this book was the factor that persuaded me to give it a read. I found the content and ideas to be very dangerous, and somewhat offensive. This is one of those books that I read simply out of curiosity, but would not read for recreation. I personally did not care for this book, but think that it is an important piece of literature as it reminded me of the value and meaning of the first amendment. If you have \\"thin skin\\", and are offended easily you may reconsider reading this book. I read a very wide variety of literature, and am rarely offended by content, but there were a few areas of this book that got to me a bit. As a student of psychology and law, I enjoy reading books that seem to stir emotions in people, I rank this book in the top 5 of the most questionable pieces of literature that I have ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't compare to the ps1 version","review":"I am going to try to keep this review short and sweet (more like bittersweet) or just bitter like this game. I realize that coming from someone who has played most of the newer Choro Q series before this entry, my views are very biased but I am still going to give it a shot. This game has not aged well at all; the driving mechanics, graphics, and entertainment value are null but strangely enough, I found this game so bad that I could not stop playing. It was like I was trying to see how much of this game I could endure before I finally gave in to pursue something more entertaining. Given the small sum of money that I actually paid for this game, I would say it is a good value for a retro cartridge paperweight but this review is about the content inside of the cartridge and not the actual cartridge itself.Recommended for: People collecting N64 cartridges, children that enjoy racing games, and people collecting the games in the Choro Q series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre","review":"This game is okay. It's not very exciting. The graphics aren't very good, and the cars start s-l-o-w. Come to think of it, the graphics aren't very good at all. The weapons and blowup scenes are kind of hokey. The music is sad. VERY lame. It sounds like a cell phone song. I was looking at this when it was 50 bucks, and I saw it two weeks later for 30, so I bought it. There's a reason the price dropped so fast. I do like the customizable cars, (paint, parts) and tracks, but the racing itself detracts from it. BUY MARIOKART. MUCH better. But I do like that noodle truck. -Mark"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mother Reader Will Nourish Your Soul","review":"This is a book for mothers, for writers, for readers, and for anyone to whom life and books are intertwined.

Some of the oldies (\\"Shoo-Shoo Baby\\" and \\"Well All Right\\", for example) benefit from tight studio band arrangements and improved recording techniques, but most do not. Other selections reflect Capitol's inexplicable experiments in turning this swingin'est of sister acts into a country (\\"Crazy Arms\\") or gospel (\\"By His Word\\") group -- without much success. I bought this CD because the Capitol recording of \\"Hold Tight\\" was the first Andrews Sisters record I ever heard; so it has a place in my childhood memories, and I wanted to have it. But unless you're an Andrews completist, I'd opt for the original 1940s recordings and pass this collection right by."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this - these are re-recordings - buy the originals","review":"Don't buy the Capitol Andrews Sisters CD's - these are re-recordings done in the 50's. They tried to copy each song exactly but you just can't recapture the original spirit of the times in which they were recorded, the sister's involvement in those times caught in every note, the spontenaity, and the jazzy bands over 10 years later. The originals are about 50 times better. I recommend The Andrews Sisters - Their All-Time Greatest Hits (MCA) - this is a far superior CD - all the original recordings from the 40's with neat DECCA replica label on the CD's and great liner booklet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not Great","review":"This had the misfortune to be made in the 80s. Charlie Brown specials weren't their best at this time. The music was post-Guaraldi and pre-David Benoit. For some reason, the voices and animation weren't good, either. However, it isn't the worst Peanuts special. (That award goes to \\"Someday You'll Find Her, Charlie Brown\\")If this were made in the 70s, it would be great. The New Year plotline involves Charlie Brown's homework dilemmas and New Year Dances.If you want a good Charlie Brown storyline, this is fine. If you want good music and voices, no.

But the film is no embarrasment, and any Wayne fan might find this a pleasant surprise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wayne is game as a cop on the case in London","review":"Good movie overall. There something to be said about these gritty '70's cop films, with the grainy look, dated scores, and often hard to follow dialogue and story lines. John Wayne jumped into this \\"dirty harry\\" genre with this and McQ, with marginal success. Wayne is nearing 70 by this time, and in many ways looks it. He brings charm and style to any role he graces, but looks surpirsingly tired and worn out here. Perhaps his declining health had something to do with it, promting questions as to why he kept on working when so many others of his era had retired. He should have retired with True Grit, although his brave performance in The Shootist was a fitting swan song to the career of the finest actor America ever produced. There will never be another John Wayne."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deceptive advertisement","review":"I have purchased and rented many films from Amazon and those films that are NOT for the US (region I) are clearly indicated so in the body of the movie description.

Loren Estleman, a fine writer, created a very convincing hero (or anti-hero) in Gene Morner, a youth who becomes an outlaw through no real fault of his own. Having strayed from the path of strict virtue, Morner proceeds to Go Wrong in the grand style, becomes a gunfighter, gets involved in the Kansas-Missouri border wars, and has many colorful adventures before catching a bellyfull of lead.

Four stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"first half pretty good, but then...","review":"This book really started out pretty good, nicely paced to our dawning understanding of an extraterrestrial colony and how their society developed, but then devolves into a shuddering mass of pseudo-cosmic poop at the end (actually, like the whole final third). It's very unsatisfying when an author schemes up a story that culminates in situations-that-cannot-be-described, and we the readers are left holding the bag of whatever-it-is. Fortunately Watson's \\"Mockymen\\" is much more even."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the all-time greatest albums for sure","review":"This is a must have for anyone.

I defy anyone to listen to it without breaking into a grin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Listening","review":"This is an album that has always been one of my personal favorites. Great song writing is one of this cd's strong points; partially due to the fact that both Finn brothers are on board for this. It is extremely melodic. It is certainly one of the better things vocally that I have heard. The harmony at times is quite stunning. It probably never received the recognition that it deserved. The production and sound are also done well. Some say that it is over produced, but I disagree. This album takes me away to another place every time I hear it.

Now from a guys perspective, what the heck, Just so out landish, and not in a million years, and I can't give a woman's perspective, but I expect his dorm speach would probably end with laughter and future future torture by guys and eventual transfer. So, shutting of the brain is good for some of the story. But otherwise Not bad. A young man at college gets lucky after a party at the girls dorm with the mystery girl in the stalled/dark elevator. He spend the whole school year looking for her, and contrives a plan to work his way into the dorm.

His roommate, Rod (James DeBello, better know for his part in the MUCH better Detroit Rock City) is there to act as a soundboard which Mat gets to tell his ideas too (and adds to the sophomoric teen comedy humor quota obviously). The film isn't that bad for a teen comedy, if you can get past the abundant pitiful similes, metaphors and the fact that Tucker doesn't really have the look to really pull off the shenanigans this movie wants us to readily believe. A couple of enormous hurdles indeed. it's not bad, but there are so many worthier teen comedies out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"100 girls","review":"Alright so 100 girls is essentially a romantic comedy set in college from a guy's point of view. The male protagonist spends the film searching for a mystery girl he copulated with on an elevator during a power outage and comedy ensues, or something like that. My problem with the film is that it is filled with little subplots that feel non sequitur and like interruptions to the main story line rather than being effectively interwoven with the rest of the plot. Additionally this is an R rated film and it has very strong sexual content, sometimes I felt the nudity and sexual elements were unwarranted. That said there were some laughs to be had and it wasn't a complete waste of time, just be aware going into this that it's not a Great film, it's a raunchy \\"thrown together\\" college romantic comedy."},{"rating":"1","title":"total garbage","review":"This movie is total garbage. The guy in it talks through the whole movie, talk, talk, talk, as bad as any soap opera. And what kind of a guy does all this talking? He dresses up like a girl and his roommate hits on him. Need I say more? It should say 101 girls because he is one. There are a couple of scenes where the girls say something interesting, but it is somehow done is a very unexciting way. There is nothing exciting about this movie at all. If you liked girls before seeing this soap opera you would be bored with them afterward. And then it might take a while before you get your head back to normal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Teen Flick","review":"It was a great movie, it was funny in an immature teen sort of way, but we all need a little bit of that kind of humor in our lives to keep us young, right?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Old-fashioned but enjoyable","review":"I just picked up a beautiful old copy of this at Moe's books in Berkeley.

I picked up their later work, and god! It's awful. It's like New Age music in New Wave packaging. It loses so much of the raw, jittery beauty that 'Garlands' had. It's a completely different band, and not one I want anything to do with. If you're into calm armchair music, I guess you'll like this, but for people looking for something exciting, skip this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh!!","review":"I stumbled across this CD when I was looking for an Enya-like artist and subsequently bought this CD solely based on other reviews. What a mistake.The vocal aren't ethereal and the instrumentals are grating. The worst part is the extensive use of echo and reverb. I don't know who mixed this album or who approved its use but I am sure they were stoned out of their mind at the time. If I had to describe it, I would say it is a \\"punk\\" version of an Enya wannabe or some other untalented artist, mastered by some guy who passed out on the effects console.I can't recommend it to anyone, unless maybe you sniff paint fumes for a living."},{"rating":"2","title":"The voice of angels","review":"I have been a fan of goth and ambient music for quite a long time.

The first album I bought of theirs was Treasure. Not only is the album beautiful, but from the melodies, you can hear that they were infulence by The Cure, and Bauhus.

Being introduced to it in 2001 however, it sounds a bit dated, mainly due to the drum programming, which has a very tinny and mechanized 80s sound.

It has aged extremely well."},{"rating":"2","title":"An absolute gem!","review":"This album is the most beautiful, elegant, and enchanting Cocteau Twins creation yet. If there is a disc to put on and play for hours on end, this would be it. Skillful music and utterly angelic vocals place this collection among the greatest I have ever heard from any artist. The opening track, \\"Ivo\\", is as uplifting and hopeful as \\"Persephone\\" is sexy, creating a sound that envelopes and inspires you. This is truly an album that no one should pass by - whether you are a Cocteau Twins fan or have never even heard of them, this will enchant practically anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Personal Transformation","review":"Too bad the album cover isn't shown above - it is what got me to tell the clerk to put the vinyl(!) within upon the turntable. After ten seconds of \\"Ivo\\", the first song, I snatched it up! Haunting, lifting, breathless. 1984 was a year of tremendous growth in my new appetite for musical experiences, and this album helped lead the way. For some reason, I hear the (now defunct) group always subsequently dissed this album, and rarely played cuts from \\"Treasure\\" in concert, but it is my favorite."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my all-time favorites","review":"Incredibly beautiful. Before I got a CD player, I had worn out *two* copies of this on tape.

If you're mainly a fan of the recent stuff though, I'd preview the sound before buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"fabulous fem","review":"Every song pulls you into a web of mysticism.

No accounting for taste I guess...if you don't yet own any Cocteau Twins, Heaven or Las Vegas might be a surer bet for your first Twins CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album!","review":"This album is great! Every track is so amazing. The standout tracks for me would have to be Whats the Worst that Could Happen, Something There and especially What If.

You will not be disappointed by this one!Great buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost a good product","review":"Well, it looks nice enough...Unfortunately, the thing doesnt really take care of frozen objects really well. The core of a smoothie is either frozen fruit or ice cubes, this thing had a tough go with either one and could barely get the job done effectively. Finally, the attachment that connects the blending mechanism to the blade starting cracking and then pretty much was destroyed due to frozen strawberries. Despite the presence of a \\"crush ice\\" type button, actually doing so proves to be a cruel joke on the customer. Lasted about a year before the thing went south.Also, it's not very user friendly, the lid barely fits the thing, making you have to pry the thing on and off. Terrible blender by any measure. Looks nice tho"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wimpy blender","review":"This blender is below average. It frequently overheats with only moderate use. The black ring has cracked, rendering it useless.

I was thinking of replacing it when the glass jar broke and figured it was time to buy a new blender. I barely used this blender and never used it to blend ice, and it sounds it was a wise decision. The food blended in there was not smooth, unlike the one from my new Cuisinart. I too though that Black & Decker was a brand representing good manufacturing and solid long-lasting products, but I guess it is no longer true."},{"rating":"1","title":"Motors Burn Out After Just a Few Uses","review":"I now have had three of these blenders and with each one, the blender motor burns out after just a few uses - so I say three is three too many!

See you in Hades."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get something that lasts...","review":"It was a wedding gift less than three years ago. I really didn't use it very much at all. I was making fruit smoothies, and an ice cube must have busted the spinner thing at the bottom (which, of course, cannot be replaced). It's not part of the actual pitcher, it's the stupid plastic part that's supposed to be attached to the motor. Yeah, not anymore! Thanks a lot Black and Decker! I won't be looking highly at your products anymore. You're just loosing customers. Stop making crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was fooled by Black & Decker's formerly good name","review":"The plastic collar broke after a dozen uses (nothing strenuous) , and the little replacement part cost half the full blender price.

Worked great for about 6 months, and then sometimes out of the blue, if I left it plugged in it would start running by itself in the middle of the night...very weird. So I just started unplugging it every time I after I used it. Then, after a year and a half, similar to other reviewers, it got a funny smell one day and just quit on me. In my opinion, a year and a half isnt long enough for a $40-50 blender to last...heck, I have had $25 blenders that lasted me 3-4 years before!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok blender, bad parts","review":"This blender doesn't do a great job crushing ice, but the biggest problem is that the black plastic base cracks easily.

We've owned this blender for perhaps two years, using it for a variety of food and drink preparation purposes, but not for crushing ice. Two weeks ago I was home alone and came downstairs to open the door for my wife, only to hear a loud whirring sound in the kitchen. Went in and found the blender running. I was unable to turn it off. The buttons were non-responsive. I had to unplug it to get to stop. The jar was tilted and the jar blade holder had ground itself into small pieces. Eventually this was going to lead to a fire. All I could think about was how close we may have come to our house burning down had we been away. It is outrageous that such a dangerous product is allowed to remain on the market."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"I bought this blender from Target less than 3 months ago and didn't check any reviews on it beforehand (major mistake). Had I seen these reviews I would've never wasted my money or time. The first thing wrong with it was that while making my morning and evening smoothies (fruit, ice, orange juice) I would wind up w/ a smoothie with ice chunks in it. No matter how much I blended, there were always ice chunks. And because the pouring lip is not angled, but straight---juice falls and slides down the front of the cup when pouring. The final and last straw came yesterday morning. Attempted to make my usual morning smoothie, pressed the blend button and walked away. Within seconds, I heard the loudest, chugging, sputtering & splittering noise. When I rushed to the kitchen I saw half crushed smoothie & juice all over the kitchen counter & walls along w/ black oil. The blender basically exploded and was toast. I pulled the plug on it and tossed it in the garbage. Do not waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible blender","review":"Got it about 4 years ago for a wedding gift. The motor burned out after only a few months of light use. Took it back and got a replacement. About 6 months later, it broke again and we took it back.

Save your money and buy something better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of CRAP!!!!!","review":"I bought this blender (B&D; BL900) today (2/5/09) because it was on sale atTarget. I took it out of the box, washed the jar, inserted a cup of grapes, half cup of pineapple chunks, an avacado, half cup of water andsome ice. 10 seconds into blending the motor cuts out and an LED on the front of the blender starts blinking - gotta pull out the instruction manual. Oh, it's the \\"intelligent fuse\\" feature!! So I unplug the blender for about 5 minutes to let the motor cool, plug it back in and in 10 more seconds it does it again. What a POS!!! You know B&D;, you wouldn't need to add this \\"intelligent fuse\\" to your blenders if you had intelligent employees to design quality motors. It's back in the box for a return. That's it for me - no more Black & Decker appliances!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy this blender if you like to replace parts.","review":"I have owned this blender for 4 years. In the first few months I had to replace the blade assembly because it broke into pieces while I was making a smoothie. When I called, I was imformed that the blade assembly was recalled, so I got a new blade assembly for free. I had to replace the new blade assembly 2 times since. Just recently I was blending up some cooked beans into a paste and the glass jar broke at the bottom. I just now ordered a new jar, but I ordered the stainless steel one. I hope this one won't break. I had no idea that the blender jar could actually break like that. I thought I would have to drop it on cement for it to break.I really don't use this blender a whole lot, never really did. It really isn't a durable blender. When the motor blows on this one, I will not buy another Black and Decker blender again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible blender","review":"DO NOT buy it!!!I used few times when the rubber ring broken while blending a smoothie.I spent more money on Shipping than the part itself.Today I tried to use it and did not turn on at all.

Not worth!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Low Reliability and Poor Workmanship","review":"We owned this blender for about 3 years and only got to use it about 6 times before it broke down completely. I contacted Black and Decker and was disappointed when they told me that the blender was no longer covered under warranty and that I would have to purchase a new one. They also had to do a recall as the blender blades were breaking off during regular use.If you have the opportunity, I highly suggest avoiding this product. I was truly disappointed by Black and Decker's response (since the blender was clearly either defective or very poorly manufactured) and the product itself is unreliable. Save the trouble and buy a quality product that will work consistently and last for several years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Died after 5 uses","review":"This blender looks great and seems to be well made. I thought the power was sufficient until on the 5th use, I decided to make my smoothie a little thicker (slightly less milk). It started well but after about 20 seconds it sounded like it was struggling. I stopped it and manually stirred it to push down the couple of chunks of frozen peach still at the top. It stirred easily and didn't seem very thick to me. I started out on high again and 10 seconds later it burnt-out. Clearly, I need way more power for even slightly thick drinks. Now, I am looking at the Blend-Tec's and Vita-Mix's but they are $350+ blenders that will turn chunks of wood into sawdust."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blender stopped working after 4 uses","review":"The blender looks cool with it glass jar and stainless steel base. I was able to make some good fruit juices with it. However the motor died during the fourth session. The blender slowed down, and stopped. That was it. Not a sound. When I unplugged it and plugged it back in, I could hear clicking sounds when I hit the switches(as if there's some electrical relay inside that's still working), but the motor never budged. I should've read the previous reviews at Amazon.com before buying this product. Glad I bought it from a store nearby I could return it to and get my money back. Come to think of it, the model was not available in the store anymore and I had it ordered from their catalog. There must be a reason this model was pulled off their shelves."},{"rating":"1","title":"good for one-use only","review":"This blender worked great the first five minutes out of the box.

Worked for several months making smoothies; then the blade \\"ate\\" the gasket. We ordered a new gasket (took 6 weeks to come) and all was well again for a couple of months. Then the plastic base for the blade cracked. Other reviews indicate the current model has been revised (ours was purchased for Christmas 2004). Hopefully the weak blade and plastic mounting have been improved.

This blender worked fine for about the first month I had it. I used it maybe once a week to make a smoothie. Then it started dieing on me every once in a while. Within 4 months it was completely dead. And it wasn't as though I was blending anything that required a lot of power, just fruit and yogurt. It was very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"The motor died in 1 year and 3 months","review":"I bought this blender in August 2006, though not from Amazon. It worked very well for one year and 3 months. One day I made some paste. It worked fine. I turned it off. Five minutes later, I wanted to make another paste. But the motor just won't start. Before I bought this blender I had an Oster blender, which had lasted for 20 years. The oster's motor is still running, but it does not move the blades. I think it just needed new blades.

It's done a great job for me! I liked it because of it's appearance, 48oz GLASS jar and 550 Watt-ice crushing motor. My tip is to actually USE the \\"ice crushing\\" Button to crush your ice! (It will prolong the life of your blender!) I have had to jiggle it a little and add liquid when the smoothie is more thick than smooth, but then it moved fine; I think that's typical. It's done a great job for me, no complaints thus far. I would recommend this blender to anyone who asks.

It is vital that you keep the top on at all times because anytime you turn it on, it errupts out of the container and will spray the contents all over the kitchen. Even at the lowest speed.#2. Keeping the top on shouldn't be such a big deal, except that the way they've engineered this thing, the top is too big, and it is very hard to get the top on.#3. It doesn't crush ice. I make smoothies about five times a week and my ice comes out somewhere between a jaw breaker and a marble. It take the edges off the cube, but does not totally crush it. In fact, it doesn't even a do that good of a job on other solid objects (bananas, frozen strawberries.)I tried to make do, but after three weeks decided to take it back. I got a Hamilton Beach blender that is priced exactly the same, and it's doing a much better job."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little hesitant, but it's been good so far...","review":"I thought I should post because of the negative press going with this blender. So far, mine's been pretty good. I'm not entirely happy with the way it crushes ice (the cubes seem to bounce around in there for a while before they finally catch), but it's not bad by any stretch. Obviously, you can't (and shouldn't) be putting entire trays of ice in there at one time, but if you make smoothies like I do (liquid + a little frozen fruit, ice cubes going in at 2-3 at a time until thick and then add protein powder) you'll be fine.

Low & behold I am now only 3 months past warranty. black & decker wouldn't work with me, would only offer to sell me the little rim piece that holds the blade in for almost as much as the blender originally cost me. nothing more. very disappointed with service and will not be coming back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk for the money","review":"The plastic piece at the bottom broke after not so much use. I'm staying away form this brand when it comes to blenders."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad if not using to crush ice","review":"I used this blender for a little over 3years. It worked great for me, as I did not crush any ice in it. I used it to puree veggies, cooked lentils and milk shakes. I was surprised to see so many 1-star reviews.It looks great with the steel base and heavy glass jar, purees in no time. And yes, a blender should solve the purpose of making smoothies, which I never made with this one. It served me more worth than what I paid.My jar cracked today due to temperature variation. I pureed hot lentils and then filled it with water immediately...A BIG MISTAKE, so now I am here looking for a replacement jar. But I guess, its better to buy another blender instead of a replacement jar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blade broke while making smoothie.","review":"This blender never did what it was designed to do...blend. Ice and anything remotely solid would get stuck in the upper portion of the jar while the blade spun freely underneath. I would often have to stop, remove the jar, and shake it around until the clog released. Today while making a strawberry banana smoothie, one of the blades broke off into the shake. Terrible blender with a poor design."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE DEFINITIVE BASKETBALL SIM","review":"If you are a fan from the old school generation of basketball games; I'm talkin Double Dribble on NES and NBA Live 95 on Super Nes, etc., then you will certainly appreciate the attention to detail in Live 99. First of all, it's manufactured by EA Sports who, is by far the leader in sports games with the possible exception of 989 Sports. Graphics are quality, gameplay is smoothe, details are detailed. Only missing ingredient to a perfect game is a larger variety of dunks that are more personalized to the players and can be controlled by the user. For example, Matt Maloney CANNOT DUNK even on a good day. Therefore, he shouldn't be dunking over the likes of Mutumbo or Zo. But overall, a brilliant game. A must-have for any b-ball enthusiast."},{"rating":"2","title":"live '99 is the best hoops game yet","review":"nba live '99 is a great game. the new practice mode helps. the players have awsome facial expressions. the gm mode is also a blast."},{"rating":"2","title":"Her best cd yet!","review":"Laura Love just keeps getting better and better.

It doesn't get any better than this!Laura is one of my musical heroes"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work as well as old formuls","review":"I used the old formulation of this combo, which included Bitter orange/synephrine for years, and it worked great. In the new formula, there is no synephrine, and it doesn't work nearly as well.The strange thing is that on the new bottle, the same warnings are listed about nervousness and not taking if on MAOI's. On Source Naturals' website, some of the materials list the old formula, and some list the new one. Despite 3 phone calls and 4 e-mails to the company, I can't get any explanation of what in the new formula would have some of the same side effects, or where to get current and accurate information about the product.So, since the product doesn't work very well, and the company doesn't seem to care about customer's questions and concerns, I have to give this a bad review."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"Growing up, I absolutely loved Red Skelton.

Once a game is stared, hours fly by.Civ II is not a very complex game in that it's impossible to learn, but that is not to say it isn't intense. Read the rule book, and start playing; I guarantee, two hours of your life will be gone.Civ II: the CLASSIC simulation game. It is \\"Risk!\\" with more strategy and history. Buy it, and become addicted."},{"rating":"2","title":"this is one great game","review":"This is probably the best and most addictive game I have ever played. Once you start playing and get a feel of the game, you can watch the hours fly by. The graphics may not be that great, but the gameplay is so tremendous that you can deal with it. The replay value is probably the best part of the game since every time you start a new game a totally new world is created with different tribes who each have their own characteristics making each game brand new. It is nice to play a game where you are not always playing on the same board and know the entire map before you even start playing. This game is highly recommended to any person who has the time to spare and loves strategy games."},{"rating":"2","title":"Killer strategy","review":"This is the best game I've ever played. Unfortunately, I'm used to playing it on the PC, and Playstation versions seldom compare in scope. Still, Civilization is a lesson in history that will lose you in a world entirely dictated by the economic phrase \\"opportunity cost\\". It's amazing in its intricacy, and the possibilities appear endless. I actually feel as though I am learning every time I restart the game and lead another civilization through the ages. It's a must own for anyone who has grown tired of the fast-paced arcade style games that have made the Playstation famous."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Playstation Game (Period)","review":"I love this game. (My wife hates it, because I can't stop playing it.) I have played at the Warrior level. I have played at the Deity level. It is great. I feel great when I play it. After playing for an evening, I can say that I've conquered vast empires and built world wonders, or created the greatest civilization on the planet and landed men on the moon! It has the best replay value of any game I've ever played and is by far the most intelligent game I have seen on the Playstation. There are many ways it could be improved, despite its greatness, and I am always looking to see if Activision will convert another of its PC Civ games to the Playstation format. If they came out with one for the Playstation 2, I would buy the Playstation 2 in a heartbeat. (Hint, hint.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"strategy pure and simple...","review":"If your looking for a strategy game tht challenges you... this is it. Its not pretty to look at, terrible music, and this game takes a long time to beat at its maximum level. I found it challenging and my competitive nature would not allow me to let go until i figured it out. However this is number crunching at its highest point. Its easy to go thru the menues but difficult to master the systems. This game is only for strategy freak like me who love a challenge if your looking for action, graphics, or storyline dont bother. The price is right though, but Romance of the three kingdoms, nectaris, or command @ conquer, or even panzer or allied general have a little more to offer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad translation from computer version","review":"I played the computer game on a friends computer and thought it would be as good on the PSX. WRONG! This game was a terrible translation. The graphics are bad. The speed is terrible. But it is strangly addictive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Addictive","review":"This game is simple and the graphics are a little clunky, but it is addictive. For hours and hours, you get caught up building your civilization and pummeling civilizations around you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun But Gets Boring","review":"The game is great from the start, but has short-lived replay fun. The characters that you interact with (your advisors) are fun to see and listen to, especially the Elvis character. It is also fun to see how they evolve over the years. But game play is slow between years and can even put you to sleep at times. The graphics are not all that great either. But if you are a fan of Civilization you will enjoy this version (at least for a little while.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Civ II - AWSOME Game","review":"If you don't have a PC for gaming, this is the next best thing. Civ II is a great game and the Play Station version is spot on.This may be the ultimate strategy game of all time and it definitely translates well on to the Play Station format."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitley an Intelligent game - but painfully slow moving","review":"This is not a game for the impacient. Normally, If I dig into a game I know will take a long time solve, it has to motivate me with an interesting story line, music and or graphics (an RPG like FFVII or VIII for instance) However, If you are interested in a complex and super challenging strategy game, this may be for you. Too bad they never made Age of the Empires for PSX, and warcraft psx is really hard to find!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"... on this","review":"you build cities research stuff in them the city gives yo warriors to battle.and to play the game fully and get lots of technology you have to play for 50 days never ever get it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Its got its pros and cons","review":"I also played this game and found it to be probably the best of its kind. It is very in depth on all levels of your civilization. Economic, military, science, deplomacy. You have to have a good long term outlook on the placement of your cities and your empire in general. The game is somewhat interactive as it can tell what you are up to before hand. The only reason i gave it a 4 was because it is a very slow game and i literaly lost sleep over it. It does have a trance like effect on those who like this genre of gaming. It is very slow paced even on the easier levels of difficulty. I wont even try to play this game at diety level."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Saw - Terrible dust collection","review":"I really like the saw - it is quite and accurate. The only problem is the dust collection system. The dust bag collects only 2/3 of the dust. The port is exactly 2-inches so it is too small for my 2-inch hose and too large for my 1.5 inch hose. I need to find an adapter. I use the saw on woodworking projects using red cedar and cherry. The cuts are very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"home improvment contractor","review":"I have the 8\\"sliding saw and 6 months ago bought the 10\\" very pleased with both except two minor things, the handle for tilting is a little akward to get to, and reading the numbers on table are a little annoying other than that, awsome saws,very durable and worth the money"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Saw","review":"This saw is great to use, cuts like butter and is very quite. The only thing I would change about this saw is the safety trigger, it's in an awkward position. specially for a lefty's.

Originally I had the old 8\\" compound miter saw and used it daily until I finally wore it out after 10+ years. Bought this one as a replacement. Light, accurate, great laser, but this thing just screams. You'll really need hearing protection when using it all day.It's not an issue with the blade. I use several different blades, it's the electric brake. The soft start is nice and smooth, and not too bad noise wise, but let the trigger go and it really shrieks.Other than that I would certainaly recommend it if you need a good dependable tool.Just expect to say \\"What???\\" a lot at the end of the day.Might seem to be a silly complaint, but I've had a significant hearing loss after working around power tools for the last 30+ years, so noise levels have become a criteria as important as accuracy and dependability in my book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Miter saw you can Buy.","review":"I have used many miter saws. This is by far the best saw I have worked with. The smoothness of cut, the accuracy as well as the power, even the price, cannot be compared to any other saw I have used. It also is very durable.

I would recommend this product to all contractors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome Saw","review":"This saw is one of the best saws i have ever used, just smooth cutting and real nice to work with.

I would recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"I *REALLY* wanted to like this saw...","review":"and for what it costs, I should love it, but I don't. It came with a bowed left fence. After two weeks, I still haven't rec'd the replacement, so I can only make cuts from the right side. The right fence is about an inch tall, i.e. TINY. It slides smooth, and cuts wide stock. The blade it came with is good. The table is also pretty small. The saw I'm replacing is a five-year old 12\\" Dewalt (dual bevel but no slider), which I still prefer, sad to say(bigger table and fences). A couple of colleagues have the 12\\" Bosch slider, and love it, which at this point I wish I'd bought. Anybody want my Hitachi 10\\" slider?"},{"rating":"2","title":"great saw","review":"Just bought my second saw. My first one still works great, I just couldn't pass up this great price.
